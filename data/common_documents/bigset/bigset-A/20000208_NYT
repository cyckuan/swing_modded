WEIRDNESS GROWS IN GRIFFEY SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE After writing last week on the fate of Ken Griffey Jr.,
I told myself to give it a rest until he's traded.
</P>
<P>
   Then I went to the Mariners' annual pre-spring training luncheon
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Matters have gotten weirder, so astonishingly weird as to be
irresistible storytelling. I can't help myself. Just once more,
then I promise to consider attending a Griffeys Anonymous session
(``Hi, I'm Art, and I'm a Grif-aholic'').
</P>
<P>
   Level-one weirdness: At the gathering for media and sponsors,
Mariners executives and baseball bosses addressed the Griffey issue
by not addressing the Griffey issue, apparently presuming no one
would notice.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if they were standing amid a herd of stampeding
buffalos and shouted, ``What buffalos?!''
</P>
<P>
   Level-two weirdness: In a preceding press conference, general
manager Pat Gillick and manager Lou Piniella all but accepted
Griffey's return and claimed to be happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Refuting the notion that a return would be a disaster, Piniella
insisted his center fielder ``will be very professional _ he
thrives on playing well.'' Said Gillick: ``I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both know deep down that Griffey's unresolved future will
work on him _ not to mention the franchise _ like cactus underwear.
</P>
<P>
   At least Piniella kept within hailing distance of reality with
this bit of candor, however inadvertent: ``I know I get overly
optimistic, but that's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Level-three weirdness: A few moments later, new CEO Howard
Lincoln took the podium and cast matters in a different light,
saying a potential trade is ``a delicate situation'' that will need
to be resolved soon. Yet he has been told there is no market, not
even in Cincinnati, for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The word in baseball is that the Reds are done with bluffing and
really have to turn their backs on Griffey this year. Their last
offer was outfielder Dmitri Young and pitchers Scott Williamson and
Denny Neagle for Griffey plus $6 million cash to pay most of his
salary. That deal would satisfy their demand to be ``salary
neutral'' _ in other words, no Reds player payroll increase in 2000
_ but would get Lincoln an invitation from his Japanese boss,
majority owner Hiroshi Yamauchi, to explore the ancient custom of
hara-kiri.
</P>
<P>
   Level-four weirdness: The Reds can't really say they don't want
Griffey, for fear of irking not only him but also their batting
coach and perhaps future manager, Ken Griffey Sr., not to mention
mom, the relatives and all the fans of the 1970s Big Red Machine
who ache to see the glory revisited by a second generation.
</P>
<P>
   But the new ownership of the Reds, which won 96 games last year
with few stars, is sincerely skeptical about whether their small
market can sustain a superstar contract of $140 million-plus, even
if it goes to a local hero who will play in a new, revenue-rich
stadium by 2003. So the Reds will cast the Mariners as greedheads
and hope like hell they don't decide to surrender him for minor
league prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Level-five weirdness: These developments came after Griffey's
alleged death-threat disclosure last week that was so
breathtakingly foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Although declining to reveal the months-old threat to police,
the team or major league baseball, Griffey instead went public with
it. When Gillick and Piniella commend Griffey for his presumed
professionalism, does that include the disclosure of an internal
team-security matter to the media instead of authorities?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has had threats before, as have many athletes and public
figures of all walks. But this vastly overplayed story now makes
him appear as if he's seeking public pity and also inspires more
cranks to harass him.
</P>
<P>
   If the disclosure, as well as his remarks about being hated in
Seattle, were manipulations designed to force the Mariners to
capitulate in a trade, he is sadly misguided. Not only can't the
Mariners be pushed any deeper into a corner that doesn't even have
room for daylight, the ploy casts doubts on Griffey's emotional
state, thereby reducing his value.
</P>
<P>
   How does it help the skittish Reds to invest so much in a single
player when his decision-making is so dubious? When somebody
threatens him in Cincinnati, where does he run?
</P>
<P>
   So that's the tale, five levels of weirdness that leave the
Griffey saga a week before spring training absolutely dead stopped.
Becalmed. Cul-de-sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick, a master baseball tradesman who in his short time in
Seattle has hardly revealed a public flicker of joy, despair or
anger, was asked if he were surprised to find himself in this
predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised by anything in the business,'' he said. But
after a few more dismissive remarks, he amended his thought and
said he is ``not overly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the equivalent of the average person saying, ``Just shoot
me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime soon there needs to be profound changes of hearts and
minds on multiple fronts, or this months-long collision of wills
goes from fender-bender to train wreck.

FOR ASTEROID, ODDS ARE ONE IN A MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to clarify) 
(ATTN: Ariz., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the fifth time in two years, astronomers have discovered an
asteroid hurtling through space that might collide with the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of collision is considered slim _ one chance in a
million. While the projected date of any impact is 2022,
astronomers say additional observations, if acquired, would allow
them to better calculate the orbit of the asteroid and perhaps rule
out a collision.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid, named 2000 BF19, is about a half mile wide,
relatively small by cosmic standards, and would threatening a
regional disaster on Earth rather than planetwide destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Its discovery was made by astronomers using the Spacewatch
Telescope at the Steward Observatory on Kitt Peak in Arizona. They
spotted the object on Jan. 28 and tracked it until Feb. 3, at which
point an announcement of its existence was made for the
International Astronomical Union by the Minor Planet Center of
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement did not mention the possibility of a collision
but suggested that the asteroid was potentially dangerous and worth
watching. On Monday, the possibility of impact was raised by Benny
J. Peiser, who runs the Cambridge-Conference Network, or CCNET, a
Internet newsletter about astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current impact probability of one in a million can easily
and quickly go up or down,'' Peiser wrote. In all likelihood, the
asteroid will turn out to be no risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only further observations can provide us with the information
to assess the potential danger,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Peiser reported that the calculation of the current risk factor
and projected impact date had been done by Andrea Milani, an
astronomer at Pisa University in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Milani as saying that the object should raise no
alarms. ``Nevertheless,'' Milani added, ``shame on the astronomical
community if we lose this dangerous fellow, which is unfortunately
quite dim and fading.''
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid is expected to pass near the Earth every 11 years,
next in 2011 and again in 2022.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a wide variety of orbits that can fit the
observations,'' said Gareth V. Williams, an astronomer at the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, who wrote the asteroid's
official birth announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who should be concerned are astronomers who
should be trying to get additional observations,'' Williams said.
``Since the arc of observation is so short, it is highly possible
that any additional observations will be sufficient to reject the
2022 impact solution. However, it is possible that another possible
impact scenario will turn up for a later date.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that in other instances follow-up observations
have let astronomers rule out collisions with the Earth. In one
case observations were too limited to let them do so before the
object disappeared from the world's telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000 BF19, he said, with the asteroid fading fast, a
clarification might take years rather than weeks or days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hefty object,'' Williams said. ``We would not like an
object of this size to hit us.''

WOODS PULLS AMAZING COMEBACK FOR SIXTH TOUR WIN IN ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ For 4{ hours, it was the kind of PGA Tour
event that Seattle has been offered and rejected: Sparse crowds, no
live network TV coverage, a no-name player atop the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tiger Woods showed up, doing magic tricks.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Tommy Smothers with a yo-yo. Out of nowhere, this
was golf's great one swinging an anvil, and rookie Matt Gogel
wasn't wearing a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Making up seven strokes over the back nine, Woods Monday turned
the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am into a walk down memory lane,
hard by the ocean. He shot 64. He holed a wedge shot for an eagle.
He gave us yet another history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Woods marched off with his sixth consecutive tour victory, tying
a similar effort by Ben Hogan in 1948 and pulling him closer to
Byron Nelson's record run of 11 in a row in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over until it's over,'' said Woods, turning into Yogi
Berra after doing his best Bobby Thomson impression. ``I know how
difficult it is to win out here. You just have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Perseverance brought him a two-stroke victory over Gogel and
Vijay Singh, a 15-under-par 273 total, his biggest comeback victory
on tour and a paycheck worth $720,000. Woods now has career
earnings of $12,557,128 in barely four seasons, just $31,519 behind
Davis Love III, the all-time money leader.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in just his fifth PGA event, Gogel birdied five of his
first seven holes and threatened to make this a runaway. He played
like Tiger, only without the swagger. Making the turn, Gogel's
closest pursuer was five strokes back. The Nike Tour grad from
Kansas thought only Notah Begay or Singh could catch him.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. Woods went by him like a CEO's Learjet pulling out
of Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed,'' Gogel said. ``I will not be amazed anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods played the final seven holes in 5-under par. He holed a
97-yard wedge on the 15th, a miracle shot for most but commonplace
for him. He nearly holed a 115-yard wedge on the next hole,
settling for birdie; he thought it was in. He nearly chipped in on
the 17th. He birdied the 18th with a four-foot putt to grab his
first lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel was so shook, he missed an eight-foot birdie putt to tie
Woods on the 18th, then botched a two-footer that cost him second
place alone and $80,000. He finished with four bogeys on his final
eight holes. Still, his $352,000 check nearly doubled his Nike
earnings from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as good as I think I had ever played for nine holes of
golf, then it was just tough coming home,'' Gogel said. ``I'm not
the first pro who's struggled on the back nine at Pebble, and won't
be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more players are finding out their best simply isn't
good enough against Woods. He's won 17 of his 72 PGA events, and
eight of the last nine golf tournaments he's played anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Woods now heads to the San Diego area for the Buick Invitational
at Torrey Pines. Should he stay hot, though all of his commitments
aren't firm, a record 12th consecutive victory could come at the
Masters. No one is suggesting he can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there a moment the 24-year-old prodigy didn't think he
could win the Pro-Am. Before the final round Monday, Woods and
swing guru Butch Harmon pegged 64 as a number to shoot for. It
mattered little that 64 had never been recorded in a final round at
Pebble.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a nail hitting a magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if I could just hang in there, keep plodding along,
make a few birdies here and there, you never know,'' Woods said
with a twinkle.
</P>
<P>
   To come up with his 15th-hole eagle, Woods took a three-quarters
swing with a wedge, watched the ball hop twice on the green, spin
slightly left and drop. He pumped his fist, high-fived amateur
partner Jerry Chang and waved to the roaring gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Woods had backed off the shot when a car went by and
someone leaned out and yelled something unintelligible. But on this
day, nothing could stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in another dimension,'' said Ken Venturi, CBS-TV golf
analyst and a former Pebble Pro-Am winner. ``These guys are going
to have to raise the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gogel: ``I don't know about destiny. e's just damn good.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he putted out on the 18th, Woods had to wait 40 minutes for
the leader to finish. Clint Eastwood approached the golfer with a
handshake and probably told Woods that he had made his day.
Security people surrounded Woods greenside while he watched Gogel
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rookie missed, Woods hugged his caddy Steve Williams
and Harmon. He then put on his watch, which seemed appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where the PGA Tour goes these days, even on a cloudy,
lonely, tape-delayed Monday at Pebble, it's Tiger Time.

CLIPPERS NOTEBOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.2000Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Welcome to the Hotel Clipper, where - thanks to
our 11-35 won-lost record _ you can expect the very best in rumor
service.
</P>
<P>
   Our first floor features last Sunday's NBC ``scoop'' regarding
Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens, who - according to peacock
sources _ will be coaching the Los Angeles Clippers next season.
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor, get a whiff of the rumor that ex- Clippers
coach Larry Brown will quit the Philadelphia 76ers. This rumor also
reminded us that Brown friendly with owner Donald T. Sterling's
bench boss. Aha!
</P>
<P>
   The third floor offers a smorgasbord of suitors to take over for
interim coach Jim Todd once this season ends. You may choose from
Kurt Rambis, who flunked an audition with the Lakers, current USC
coach Henry Bibby, or even invent a candidate yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth floor is truly special. On four, you will be
presented with last weekend's rumor that the Clippers are preparing
to send free-agents- to-be Derek Anderson and Maurice Taylor down
the Staples Center hallway, where they will trade locker rooms with
Lakers Glen Rice, Derek Fisher and Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you may run into some opposition. Like reality.
In reality, Knight will make 2.8 million this season, which is
about the same as the combined paychecks of Anderson and Taylor.
And ... the impressively unproductive Knight has four years left on
his deal after this season dies. This means the salaries of Fisher
($3 million) and Rice ($7 million) must come within 10 percent of
what the Clipper have left under the salary cap for this alleged
deal to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have around $8 million, give or take. Do your own
math.
</P>
<P>
   And remember: Like Taylor, Rice (who plays the same position as
Clips rookie Lamar Odom) is a client of super- agent David Falk,
who remains chafed that the Clippers didn't select another of his
clients, Mike Bibby, with the first pick in the 1998 NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors about next season's coach?
</P>
<P>
   Try the fifth floor, where Elgin Baylor, the Clippers' vice
president of basketball ops, is trying to figure out how to
convince Sterling to pay five more head coaches at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe these rumors aren't true.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D-Day &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rumor also has it that the Clippers don't play defense.
</P>
<P>
   To alter that reality, Monday's practice was intended to be an
inclusive, tactical approach to guarding the other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 100 percent defensive day,'' said Todd in a state &QL; 
- ment that might fit as a response to any question posed to every
Clipper coach sense the dawn of time. ``We're pret &QL; 
- ty much starting at square one.''
</P>
<P>
   Square one included what is known in hoop lingo as the
defensive-intensive ``shell'' drill, which encourages awareness for
where each defender should be relative to where the ball goes.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting concept that harks back to the golden days
of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' said Taylor, who - by the way - hasn't ordered
Nikes trimmed in Laker purple. ``It's what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Todd, the Clips also need to upgrade their mental
approach to defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it will be attitude and accountability,'' Todd said.
``Hustle, desire ... all the words you always hear. They have to
accept the personal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Point guard Eric Murdock, who split in the first quarter
of Sunday's loss to Chicago after turning his left ankle, didn't
practice Monday and will miss Wednesday's game at Portland ...
Monday's other absentee was Tyrone Nesby (personal business). &QL;

NEXT THREE WEEKS CRITICAL FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray wants to hear
nothing about his team making a huge push coming out of the
All-Star break because, in essence, he would take it as an insult.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question would be, what were (teams) doing in the first
part of the season?'' Murray said. ``I don't believe in peaking. I
don't believe you make a push here and all of a sudden you say
you're going to get it going. Then you haven't been preaching the
right things all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even Murray admits he brought the Kings together before
Monday's practice and went beyond the one-game-at-a-time coachspeak
to talk about the importance of the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 21 days, the Kings play 12 games. Eight of those are
on the road, including seven straight, and eight are with teams the
Kings either lead or trail by two points or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never, ever talk beyond the next game, but (Monday) morning
we talked about the situation we're in and what's facing us,''
Murray said. ``Eight of the 12 teams are from San Jose to Chicago,
so we talked about that. . . . As a coaching staff, we kind of knew
we'd be in this situation at this time of year. It's not a surprise
to anybody. I'd much rather be where we are now than where the
Kings were at this time last season.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point last season, the Kings were 19-28-4 with 42 points
and in last place in the division. This season the Kings are
23-21-7-3 for 56 points and in the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Donald Who?: Donald Audette skated before practice, but his
sprained ankle is a few weeks away from being healed. And even if
he's healthy, he could have trouble finding his way back into the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Blake took Audette's spot on a line with Bryan Smolinski
and Glen Murray and he's fitting in well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so fast,'' Andy Murray said. ``He makes the other guys
work hard to keep up with him. He's recognizing he can be an
effective player and not get goals.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Slap shots: Defenseman Rob Blake returned from the All-Star
Game but didn't skate. Instead, he had a ``half-day'' and worked
out on an exercise bike. . . . If the Ducks bring tough guy Stu
Grimson back early from injury, the Kings might counter with
enforcer Steve McKenna tonight.

Rockets vice president Carroll Dawson stood at one end of the
Rockets' training-facility court and described Steve Francis'
chances of playing tonight as a ``game-time'' call. It was too soon
to know whether Francis' sprained right knee and hernia would allow
him to play against the Cavaliers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the other end of the court, though, Silkk the Shocker _ a rap
artist of renown who also hoops on occasion with the NBA's younger
generation _ missed a shot, only to have Francis explode to the rim
to slam the ball back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just did what I normally do after practice, what I do every
day after practice,'' Francis said. ``It (the injury) has points I
can't feel it. It's not something I'm going to get nervous about.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to make a decision now, I'm not sure which way I'll
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis said the decision tonight would be his, which might seem
a potential problem given the bravado he has already shown about
playing with pain. But Rockets trainer Keith Jones said he would
put Francis through a battery of tests tonight that will make the
decision obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting better every day,'' Francis said. ``I'll find out.
It's been tough. I really love my teammates and my coaches. I've
been watching every single game and every single minute. Hopefully,
I'll be ready to go. If not, I'm not going to rush myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets have to consider Francis' potential to do just
that. Jones and team doctors can make evaluations, but their
information is predicated on feedback from Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been progressing every day,'' Dawson said. ``We talk to
the doctors. That's their profession. We listen to them. Until we
get the doctors to say one thing or another _ we're not to that
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the young guys think, as soon as they get hurt, the first
thing they say is, `I'll play tomorrow.' You love that enthusiasm.
You've just got to temper it. We have to make sure it's the right
thing. Truthfully, after we took him out the other night against
Philly, he wanted to go back in the game. That's the way the young
guys are. They think they're bulletproof. They're not used to being
hurt. You have to make them realize where they are in the injury,
what could happen, and make sure they get well.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets having returned home, the temptation to play
would seem even greater for Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurt in college and had to sit and watch,'' guard
Cuttino Mobley said. ``It's real hard. When you come back, you're a
little too anxious. He'll be all right. Steve has a strong heart
and a strong will. He'll be fine. I talk to him every day, twice a
day. I tell him, `Stick in there, and do the rehab so it won't
happen again.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Francis also must deal with the reality that he is needed.
As well as Bryce Drew has played since Francis was hurt Thursday,
Francis changes the game in ways Drew can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes a lot of the focus,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
``People are leaning that way, going that way, just like when
Michael Jordan played. Everybody else gets involved because the
focus is on the guy that can really drive the seam.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew scored a career-high 20 points against Minnesota and
duplicated it against Detroit. He matched his career high with 10
assists Friday, adding six more Sunday. But despite his shake and
drive around Grant Hill on Sunday, teams have not changed their
defenses to stop Drew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryce has done a fantastic job,'' forward Matt Bullard said.
``It's super tough to go from playing 10 minutes a game to two
games of basically playing the whole game, and he's played
fantastic. But Steve is one of those top-echelon players the entire
defense has to be aware of what he's doing. When the entire defense
is geared to stopping one guy, it opens a lot of things up for
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit switched the pick-and-roll against Bryce. They
couldn't do that against Steve, because Steve would have taken
anybody that was guarding him. Steve can take his guys and beat
them. They wouldn't put a big man on him. That's a luxury very few
teams have that we have with Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what happens when that luxury is removed, Bullard
said, ``I get two shots a game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two games Francis has missed, Rockets other than Drew
made 30 of 67 shots against the Pistons, the league's worst
defensive team, and 23 of 64 against the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryce did a great job, but it definitely hurts us because
Steve's one of the best guards in this league already,'' forward
Walt Williams said. ``He demands a lot of attention. When guys are
paying a lot of attention to one guy, they're not paying as much
attention to the guy they're guarding. It makes things flow a
little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds guard Shandon Anderson: ``How our team plays is basically
designed around Steve and the things he can do in terms of
penetrating, going to the basket, going one-on-one with a guy. That
opens up a lot of things for everybody. The defense has to go and
help, and everybody benefits from that.''

OKLAHOMA STATE THRASHES KANSAS

   STILLWATER, Okla. _ In an effort to catch a roving network
camera, a student with his face painted black and orange and
wearing a cutout family-pack chicken bucket over his head held up a
sign that read, ``dEsmond Schools Poor kaNsas.''
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooled 'em on Big Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Mason, Oklahoma State's acrobatic wing man to whom the
student's sign referred, helped put the Jayhawks back a grade last
night by leading the No. 14 Cowboys to an 86-53 runaway victory
before a thoroughly thrilled capacity crowd in Galligher-Iba Arena
that witnessed the Cowboys' biggest victory in a series that dates
to 1926.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally manhandled us in every aspect of the game,'' said
Roy Williams, who suffered his worst defeat in 12 years as Kansas'
coach. ``This was the worst feeling that I've ever had on the
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason tied a season-high with 31 points in 33 minutes on
10-for-14 shooting that included five 3-point attempts that all
found center net.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was was big-time,'' Mason said. ``This is the first time
I've had a chance to beat Kansas in four years. This is the best
game we've played this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The must-win victory, considering the Cowboys' upcoming
schedule, boosted Oklahoma State (19-2) a half-game ahead of
Missouri and Iowa State into the Big 12 lead at 8-1 and dropped
fading Kansas (17-6) to 6-3. The Jayhawks had won eight consecutive
games in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets you know we have a great team,'' Mason said. ``When
we go out with that kind of mentality, we can give a lot of people
some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas was in the game for only about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the third-worst in Kansas history. The Jayhawks
had previously lost 48-8 to Nebraska in 1899 and 100-63 to Kentucky
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Roy we played a little over our heads tonight,''
Cowboys coach Eddie Sutton said. ``But tonight we could have played
with anybody in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night was the first game in what could prove to be a
pivotal week for several teams in the Big 12. No. 17 Iowa State
(19-3, 7-1) is at Missouri tomorrow. No. 18 Texas (15-6, 6-2)
visits the Tigers on Saturday after a midweek home game against
Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, the Cowboys and No. 16 Oklahoma play the
initial installment of this year's Bedlam Series in Norman.
Oklahoma State plays four of its next five games away from home
including at Texas (Feb. 9), at Missouri (Feb. 21) and at Iowa
State (Feb. 26) _ making last night's victory critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some really tough games on the road,'' Mason
conceded, ``but we showed our character tonight. Oklahoma is
playing really well. We have to go down and play with confidence,
play hard like we did tonight, and it's going to be a dog fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night there was only one dog in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our defense was outstanding, really the key to the
game,'' Sutton said. ``We've started shooting the ball the last two
games like I thought we would. And Desmond Mason showed why he's
one of the best players in college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys blistered Kansas with 54 percent shooting and nailed
9 of 13 3-pointers, holding the Jayhawks to 33.9 percent from the
field. Kirk Hinrich, one of three freshmen starters last night,
with 12 points was the only Jayhawks scorer in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outplayed us in every phase,'' Kansas forward Nick
Bradford said. nn

WOODS' STREAK HITS 6 AFTER UNLIKELY FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 BEACH PRO-AM-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The picturesque 18th green at Pebble
Beach Golf Links overlooks Monterey Bay. It might not be too far
into the future before Tiger Woods is depicted walking on those
waters after his logic-defying victory here yesterday at the Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   Woods performed a golf miracle by rallying from a seven-stroke
deficit with seven holes remaining, making him the first player
since Ben Hogan in 1948 to win six consecutive PGA tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at the 12th tee, I was standing at 11-under,'' Woods
said, ``and I figured if I could somehow get it to 14- or 15-under,
I might give myself a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   One shot put Woods in contention on this damp, overcast day, a
wedge from 97 yards for an eagle on No. 15 that served as the
catalyst for the greatest final-round rally of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back in it,'' Woods announced to the TV cameras as he
pumped his right fist in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Woods continued his charge with birdies on Nos. 16 _ narrowly
missing another eagle with a wedge shot _ and 18 to finish a round
of 8-under-par 64. His three-foot birdie putt on No. 18 moved Woods
to 15-under par, a shot ahead of faltering 28-year-old rookie Matt
Gogel, who had just finished bogeying No. 15 to drop to 14-under.
Gogel, who said he didn't realize until he reached the 17th tee
that Woods had taken the lead, missed a long birdie putt at No. 17
and a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 18, either of which would have
forced a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only Fort Worth native and longtime Roanoke resident Byron
Nelson stands between Woods and his run at history. Nelson
established the PGA Tour record with 11 consecutive victories
during the 1945 season. Woods plans to continue his pursuit
Thursday at the Buick Invitational in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While the birdie on No. 18 provided the winning margin for
Woods, it will be the wedge on No. 15 that will be remembered as
the signature shot of this 72-hole tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wedge shot definitely ranks up there, but I'm telling you
the feeling I got when I made it was not the same when I made the
hole-in-one in Phoenix \R1997\S or when I've made a huge putt to
force a playoff or beat someone in a playoff or down the stretch,''
Woods said. ``I guess it was a completely different feeling because
I had three holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that, I was chasing somebody. If Matt would have
played well coming in and makes a birdie here and there, it's over.
I needed to keep pushing and keep making birdies to make it
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Until yesterday, Woods' biggest comeback on the PGA Tour was
four strokes going into the final round. He trailed by five
entering play yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel, who shared the lead through 54 holes with Fort Worth
resident Mark Brooks at 12-under-par, made it a one-man race for
most of the morning. He dipped as low as 17 under through 10 holes,
at which point he led Woods by seven. Gogel rolled in birdie putts
of 4, 7 and 15 feet on the first three holes and birdie putts of 2
and 15 feet on Nos. 6 and 7 for a 5-under-par 31 on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster, though, struck with consecutive bogeys on Nos. 11 and
12. His approach on No. 11 went into a greenside bunker. His 4-iron
on the par-3 12th also found the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was swinging the golf club so well,'' Gogel said. ``I was
hitting it in the middle of the fairways and hitting good iron
shots at the flag just about all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going along so well with absolutely every shot, and
everything you've done to that point has been the correct shot or
just a solid shot. I didn't make a mistake. I really didn't hit a
bad shot. Then, all of a sudden, you make a bogey and let one get
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogel, though, refused to give in despite another bogey on No.
15 that dropped him into a tie at 14 under with Woods, who was
playing No. 18. After just missing the birdie putt on No. 17, Gogel
went to the par-5, 543-yard hole 18th knowing he needed a birdie to
force a playoff. He found himself 116 yards from the hole after two
shots. Gogel's 9-iron shot landed 10 feet from the cup below the
hole, a left-to-right putt that confused him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just misread the green and just got careless with the next
one,'' Gogel said.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel missed the tap-in to save par, and that three-putt dropped
him into a second-place tie with Vijay Singh, two strokes behind
Woods, and cost him $80,000 of prize money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how tough it is to win your first tournament,'' Woods
said in reference to Gogel. ``I've been there. I blew one at Quad
Cities \R1996\S, and I know how difficult it is to go through all
the emotions and to have a lead like he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy. He got off to a great start, and it looked like
he could run away with it. I just figured if I could just hang in
there _ keep plodding along, make a few birdies here and there ...
Well, you never know.''

 FORBES HOPES FOR REPEAT WIN IN DELAWARE  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican presidential contest moves to Delaware Tuesday,
but it's a much bigger deal for Steve Forbes than for the other GOP
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who won in Delaware in 1996, is looking to repeat that
victory to reinvigorate his sagging campaign. He has been
campaigning full time in the state since Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delaware calls itself `The First State,' and it's certainly
the first state in my mind after 1996,'' Forbes told reporters at
the California Republican Convention in Burlingame this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But while the big-spending publisher had the state to himself
four years ago, Texas Gov. George W. Bush was in Dover and
Wilmington Monday for a series of events and has been running a
strong television ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials have said from the start that they plan
to run a 50-state campaign, which includes a scuffle for the 12
delegates that Delaware's primary will assign today.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain is skipping the primary and focusing on
the Feb. 19 vote in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delaware is an itty-bitty state, that we're going to pass for
now,'' said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for the McCain campaign. ``But
we're going to be contesting almost all the elections from here on
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever today's result in Delaware, Forbes promised it won't
affect his plans to stay in the race for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the strongest message, and I'm not going to let one
state be the be-all and the end-all,'' he said. ``We're in this for
the duration. I'm the one true conservative in this race, and I've
got to get that message across.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime soon, however, Forbes needs a win. While he already has
pumped millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and
is ready to commit millions more, without a convincing showing in
Delaware, South Carolina or one of the other states leading up to
the delegate-heavy March 7 primaries, he is likely to be little
more than a wealthy footnote in the GOP race.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, he already is slipping into
invisibility. A Field Poll released Monday showed him with just 1
percent of the Republican vote, behind even Alan Keyes, a
conservative talk show host who is running his longshot campaign on
a financial shoestring.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes believes his surprisingly strong showing in the Iowa
caucuses, where he finished second behind Bush, and McCain's
shocking win over the Texas governor last week in New Hampshire
gives his campaign a growing glimmer of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters have made it clear that this is a wide open race,''
he said. ``That's going to help the party to emerge with strong
messages and a strong candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes already is running television ads in South Carolina and
plans a swing through Michigan, which holds its primary Feb. 22,
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware's primary is a Republicans-only affair. The state's 22
Democratic delegates won't be allocated until the April 8 state
convention.
</P>
<P>
   A nonbinding ``beauty contest'' vote Saturday attracted only
about 5 percent of Delaware's Democrats, giving Vice President Al
Gore 57 percent of the total, with former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley pulling in 40 percent.

STEWART BACKS THE PENALTY, NOT RACIST LABEL OF ROCKER
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-ROCKER-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through 15 major-league seasons and five different teams, Dave
Stewart could always be found front and center in the clubhouse.
Which had nothing to do with locker location.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has that certain presence about him. A presence that
translates into leadership. A presence that remains a factor in
baseball today, six years after he retired as a pitcher, who, among
other things, was a 20-game winner four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   For those who keep score by color, Stewart is African-American,
worth mentioning here because this column relates to John Rocker.
Yes, that John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart was a player, I figured he might have run across a
Rocker-type during his stops with the Dodgers, Rangers, Phillies,
A's and Blue Jays. If so, how did he handle the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Stewart's current position as assistant general
manager of the Blue Jays. Stewart is working his way toward
becoming a major-league GM, and when he does, those who keep score
by color can correctly identify him as an ``only.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, one other thing I always liked about Stewart _ outspoken,
but in a smart kind of way. So if he's the general manager of the
Braves, how does Stewart deal with both Rocker and the Rocker
suspension handed down by commissioner Bud Selig?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly sure on Rocker,'' said Stewart yesterday from
Toronto. ``I read the magazine article and just sat there stunned
for a few minutes. Here is a major-league baseball player who with
his words alienated and insulted basically every race and gender.
How do you deal with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Not once in his 15 seasons, Stewart noted, did he ever have a
teammate he considered a racist. ``But there were a couple of
managers I put in that category,'' he added, ``and that's even
worse because it's a leadership role. I do feel strongly that when
someone goes public with these kind of views, as Rocker did, then
baseball needs to address it swiftly and with substance.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who think Selig overreacted with his Rocker
suspension, Stewart's answer was, ``The commissioner absolutely did
the right thing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any hint of racism tears at the fabric of the game, more so
than problems we might have with, say, drugs. A drug-user will
change if he wants to change and is willing to accept the treatment
program. A racist, in most cases, will not change. I am not calling
Rocker a racist, but his words certainly left room for doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said his original reaction was to label Rocker as just
that _ a racist. ``But the more I tried to reason it out, I went
the other way. I changed my mind. I don't think he's a racist,
although since I don't know John Rocker, this is strictly an
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   To Stewart, a racist player in baseball would never have gone so
public. ``That's why for all those years we had the Klan members
hiding behind their sheets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, Rocker appeared to have gotten carried away with the
whole New York City thing after what went on in the playoffs and
the World Series. He was dumb. There is no excuse. But he started
talking to a reporter, and he couldn't stop. He was trying to be
controversial, but he didn't know where to stop with what he was
saying. I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball clubhouse has become racially diverse, mainly due
to the large influx of Hispanic players. And it was Hispanics who
were most insulted by the Rocker comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been clubhouse verbal play between blacks and
whites,'' Stewart said. ``You can say a lot of things to a
teammate, but at the same time everyone knows there's a certain
verbal line that can't be crossed. Certain words are never spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have the Hispanic players, some of whom struggle with
English, and it's only natural they tend to be more comfortable
with other players who speak Spanish. So the Hispanics are
criticized at times for being clannish.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you are dealing with the team element, all that has
to mesh under one roof. On those old Oakland clubs I was with \Rin
the late '80s and early '90s), you could say almost anything to
anybody and no one took it personal. But those were good teams, and
we had the true team concept in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what the Braves also thought, until ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocker totally disrupted the team concept Atlanta had going,''
Stewart said. ``It will be interesting to see how the Atlanta
players handle all this with Rocker once he returns from the
suspension. But if I'm in the commissioner's seat, I do what Bud
Selig did.''
</P>
<P>
   Another view, among many, on a touchy subject in sports.

horizon than abortion _ an issue with the potential to explode
along every step of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From Iowa to New Hampshire and then on to South Carolina and
California, the candidates have been questioned about where they
stand regarding a woman's right to choose an abortion. And woe to
those who try to sidestep the question, obscure their position or
morph their words from one place to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, it was `the economy, stupid,' '' said Belle
Taylor-McGhee, president of the California Abortion Rights Action
League. ``Right now, it's `abortion, stupid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That is because the next president is expected to appoint three
to five Supreme Court justices _ and thereby will wield enormous
power to recast Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court
decision that provided for legal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And though it is rarely included among the top 10 concerns of
voters, a candidate's position on abortion carries enormous weight,
particularly with women, who comprise the crucial ``gender gap'' at
the polls, political insiders say. Abortion has become a kind of
litmus test in itself _ a good indicator of where a candidate
stands on a variety of related social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position on the right to choose basically speaks to the
fundamental principle on how we value women in our society,'' said
Taylor-McGhee. ``That includes health care, how she can raise her
family with a fair wage and how she can provide education for her
children _ because if you don't have the power to decide when the
time is right for you to become a parent or not, you really can't
decide anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Without exception, the Republican presidential candidates _
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain, publisher
Steve Forbes and former Ambassador Alan Keyes _ are vehemently
opposed to abortion. All have said they will support the repeal of
the Roe vs. Wade decision if they are elected.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has taken heat for sidestepping abortion questions and
has been pressed repeatedly for failing to promise he would appoint
anti-abortion judges and select an anti-abortion running mate. He
said recently ``it should be up to each state legislature'' to
decide what restrictions to place on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has had to soften a statement _ made in an interview with
The Chronicle last year _ in which he worried that an immediate
repeal of Roe vs. Wade could send women back to illegal abortion
mills. The senator argues that he always has been unquestionably
anti-abortion and wants to see Roe vs. Wade repealed, but he has
said the GOP ``must be an inclusionary party'' that respects all
views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has faced criticism that he has changed his political
views on the subject _ becoming far more hard-line _ for political
expediency, specifically to win the critical backing of the
Christian right. And Keyes has made the outlawing of all abortions
one of the central issues of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, Vice President Al Gore and former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley strongly support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But they, too, have been mired in controversy around the issue.
In New Hampshire, Bradley openly questioned Gore's commitment on
the abortion issue, citing a letter Gore wrote to a congressional
constituent in 1987 in which he said abortion was ``arguably the
taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain, Gore said, ``I used the word `arguably,' and
yes, my position has changed. . . . I would not use that phrasing
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said revisiting Gore's old position is legitimate,
because it raises questions about the vice president's consistency
on the issue _ and his truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The arguing about credentials does not change the bottom line,
said Democratic political consultant Garry South: ``You can gussy
it up, but you are either for a woman's right to choose _ or you
are not.''
</P>
<P>
   And on this issue, in California, South argues that recent
political history _ and polling _ proves Republicans are vulnerable
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the GOP's 1996 presidential candidate, took repeated
criticism for his anti-abortion position and lost the state _
particularly female voters _ handily to Bill Clinton. And Dan
Lungren, the GOP's 1998 gubernatorial candidate, touted his
anti-abortion views across the state and went down to the largest
landslide  &LR; defeat in modern political history here, again with
women voting in large numbers against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistently, Californians are pro-choice, and by a very large
margin,'' said pollster Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy
Institute of California, whose surveys show ``7 out of 10 said
government should not interfere with women's rights to abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   But GOP presidential candidate Keyes, in a recent interview with
The Chronicle, argued that Republicans can win on abortion _ if
they stick to their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the major victories that the Republican Party has won
in the last 20 years have been on the strength of pro-life,
conservative candidates,'' Keyes said. ``(Take) the '94 Congress,
with a freshman class that was overwhelmingly pro-life, moral,
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks won because they had moral, conservative
convictions. So I just think that the pundits fly in the face of
real experience,'' he said. ``It's not true that pro-life people
win all the time, but it is true that it has not been any kind of
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   And anti-abortion groups insist that more change is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``As technology changes, hearts are changing, because the proof
is in the pictures,'' said Mark Washburn, president of Capitol
Resource Institute, a nonprofit, bipartisan family advocacy group
in Sacramento. ``Years ago, we had discussions about viability (of
the fetus) _ and it was 30 weeks. Now it's 25 weeks. ... The other
side could get away with calling it a blob of tissue, but it's hard
to argue that when you get an (ultrasound) picture of a baby (in
the first trimester).
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation is seeing it more clearly than some of
their elders, even,'' Washburn said. ``The newest voters, 18 to 24
(years old), are more pro-life than ever. And as they start having
children, it will swing even harder to pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Californians prepare to go to the polls, advocates say
they are prepared to organize and fight the issue to the end _ and
that the presidential candidates know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason George Bush has been running away from the issue,
and John McCain has straddled it,'' said Taylor-McGhee, ``is that
they know if you are rabidly opposed to a women's right to choose
here, you cannot win.''

 BIG PROMISES IN CLINTON BUDGET  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton released his final budget Monday,
a $1.84 trillion policy agenda filled with goodies for vote-rich
California but unlikely to do more than frame the debate between
Republicans and Democrats in an intensely political election year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget calls for spending much of the projected
10-year budget surplus, estimated by the White House at $746
billion, on bolstering Medicare and Social Security. At the same
time, it promises to pay off the $3.7 trillion publicly held debt
by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   The central element in Clinton's budget is a new prescription
drug benefit for Medicare, to cost $160 billion over 10 years,
along with an additional $35 billion program for seniors who have
especially high drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget also would provide sharp spending boosts for a
vast array of federal programs, from Head Start and farm aid to
conservation and education, and provide a net tax cut of $170
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said about a dozen of Vice President Al
Gore's proposals were written into the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government and public life are more than rhetoric,'' Clinton
said. ``The reality eventually makes a difference. The specific
decisions do count, and that's what this budget is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly dismissed Clinton's plan as a ``lame-duck
spending spree'' aimed at aiding Gore's presidential bid, while
Democrats like California Senator Dianne Feinstein hailed it as
``right on track with the major concerns of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the tight partisan divisions in both the House and Senate,
it is unlikely that Clinton's budget will be passed in anything
resembling its current form.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the document represents Clinton's opening bid for
debates over everything from Medicare to the military as both
parties struggle to win control of Congress and the White House in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president's budget does not break down spending
state-by-state, it does offer some big items that would
disproportionately aid California, including an 11 percent increase
for border control and $15 million to buy more than 200,000 acres
of private land inside the Mojave National Preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said that when combined with Congress' purchase last
year of 225,000 acres in the Mojave, the land buy would ``mark the
largest such acquisition in the history of the continental United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget also calls for additional money to preserve ancient
sequoias in the Sierra Nevada as part of a $1.4 billion ``Lands
Legacy'' program to help states and local governments buy property
for everything from wildlife protection to suburban greenbelts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling called Lands Legacy ``the
greatest effort to save natural resources since President Teddy
Roosevelt.'' The initiative includes big increases _ $93 million _
for coastal protection and a $10 million increase for marine
sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal so pleased environmental groups that Defenders of
Wildlife called it ``something akin to the Holy Grail for the
environmental community.''
</P>
<P>
   California transit projects would receive $242 million,
including $80 million for BART's extension to San Francisco
International airport and $12.2 million to complete the Santa Clara
Tasman light-rail project.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS treatment and prevention programs got several substantial
increases: an additional $125 million for the Ryan White CARE act
providing treatment and services to people with AIDS and HIV,
bringing total funding to $1.7 billion; a $66 million increase to
$795 million for the Centers for Disease Control to prevent HIV
infections both here and abroad; and a $26 million increase for the
AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), to $554 million.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health received a huge $1 billion
increase, to $18.8 billion, including an increase of $105 million
for AIDS research, bringing the total to $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, called the AIDS budget ``a
reasonable start,'' but said Democrats ``must fight for funding
above the president's request, especially in ADAP, which pays for
life-saving drugs for people with HIV who cannot afford to pay for
the drugs on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for tens of millions of dollars in federal
spending to ``promote the e-commerce revolution,'' including
previously announced plans to spend $50 million to help poor
households get computers and Internet access, along with $19
million to ``help small manufacturers become e-commerce ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the administration wants $23 million to ``install
broadband technology in rural communities and distressed areas''
for high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also calling for $13 million in new money to ``track
the growth of e-commerce'' to help ``guide us in deploying our
resources for this e-commerce revolution,'' according to Commerce
Secretary William Daley, along with $28 million in new funding to
historically black colleges for science and engineering training.
</P>
<P>
   On immigration, the administration proposes a nearly
half-billion-dollar increase for the Border Patrol to hire 430 new
agents, increase their pay and otherwise intensify border
surveillance. States would get additional money as well to offset
the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants who have committed
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is also proposing a
voluntary ``Premium Service Fee'' program, in which businesses
could pay $1,000 to guarantee 15-day processing for immigration
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also includes $181 billion in tax increases,
including a 25-cents-per-pack cigarette tax hike and corporate tax
increases. Republicans quickly dismissed these as ``dead on
arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP House majority leader Dick Armey accused the administration
of trying ``to have it both ways, increasing spending and trying to
pay down the debt.'' GOP leaders said they would write their own
budget that also protects Social Security and pays down the debt
but provides bigger tax cuts and less spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to use a larger projection of the
10-year, non-Social Security surplus than Clinton's $746 billion,
one based on lower spending projections, thus carving out room for
a bigger tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders have already begun work on a 10-year, $182 billion
tax cut for married couples, to reduce the so-called marriage
penalty, a plan the White House said is too large.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides would put aside all the excess payroll taxes
collected for Social Security, which are expected to amount to $2.2
trillion over the next 10 years. That money is credited to the
Social Security trust fund, but because the trust fund is simply an
accounting device, the actual money goes to pay down the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would, in addition, credit to Social Security the
interest savings from a lower debt and credit an extra $300 billion
in projected surplus general revenue to Medicare. The way by which
Clinton can give a sharp boost to Medicare and promise to pay down
the debt is because the money credited to the Medicare trust fund
actually goes to retire federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   While reducing the national debt will make it easier for the
government to finance retirement benefits in the future, many
budget analysts warned that relying on projected surpluses to
bolster the program trust funds avoids reforms that would prepare
for the huge retirement demands of the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   While Social Security reform was a hot topic last year both at
the White House and in Congress, nothing ever came of it. This
year, with huge budget surpluses projected on both sides, the
impetus for reform has all but evaporated.  &LR;

 HACKERS SHUT YAHOO DOWN FOR 3 HOURS  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yahoo.com was the victim of a hacker attack that
shut down the world's busiest Web site for three hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most significant outages we've seen,'' said
Cormac Foster, an analyst with e-commerce research firm Jupiter
Communications. ``It doesn't get any higher profile than Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's main portal, Yahoo.com, and several related
services were unavailable worldwide from 10:20 a.m. until about
1:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that several people may have worked together in a
``denial of service attack'' to shut down Yahoo, which was accessed
by more than 42 million unique users in December.
</P>
<P>
   Such an attack uses several different computers to simulate a
huge increase in traffic that essentially freezes a Web site.
Picture a 20-car pileup on a major highway at rush-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our routers were overwhelmed by this mock traffic that hit
us,'' Mallett said. ``Up to 1 gigabyte of requests per second were
coming in. Some Web sites don't get 1 gig in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was focused on one of Yahoo's server centers in
Northern California, said Jeff Mallett, Yahoo president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bellovin, an Internet security researcher for AT&AMP;T Labs,
said the attack on Yahoo could undermine consumer confidence in the
Internet if the overall problem of denial-of-service hackers ``is
not dealt with. It's a form of vandalism and it's growing,''
Bellovin said.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately took credit for the attack, and Mallett would
not speculate on who or how many people might be responsible.
``Someone thought through this; it wasn't just on a whim,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo stopped the problem by 1:20 and access to its sites was
soon up to 97 percent, according to Keynote Systems, a firm that
measures Web site performance. Criminal authorities were not
investigating the attack last night, but Mallett didn't rule out
that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was limited to the routers that connect Yahoo's
servers to the Internet. Yahoo's servers, where its Web pages are
stored, were not invaded, and the attackers did not change any
material on Yahoo's pages.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett said that some of Yahoo's services, such as its
calendar, e-mail and shopping sites, remained available throughout
the outage, and users who had Yahoo.com open before the attack
began were able to perform Web searches and use the directory
intermittently. However, access to some of these services might
have been so slow that some users were ``timed out'' and
disconnected from the site before successfully loading them,
Mallett said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, denial-of-service attacks crashed a
number of well-known targets, including the Web sites of the FBI,
NASA, the Navy, and a number of colleges, including MIT,
Northwestern University and University of California campuses in
Berkeley, Irvine and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bellovin, of AT&AMP;T Labs, was in San Jose Monday to
deliver a speech on denial of service problems at a conference of
North American Internet service providers. The Yahoo attack, which
became the talk of North American Network Operators Group meeting,
occurred shortly after he finished his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bellovin expects more distributed denial-of-service attacks now
that Yahoo has been hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time a very prominent site has been hit,''
Bellovin. ``The problem is we don't have many good defenses for
this at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all too common in our experience,'' said Stephen
Hansen, security officer at Stanford University. ``At present there
is no foolproof way to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said Stanford itself was hit with a similar attack Sunday
afternoon. Apparently, a hacker broke into one of Stanford's
computers, logged onto a chat room and did something to irritate
some of the other chatters. In retaliation, someone tried to flood
several Stanford computers, where the hacker appeared to be
operating from, and shut the machines down. The attack lasted about
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Hansen said it didn't create a serious problem
because Sundays are slow, and Stanford's network can handle a large
amount of traffic. But had the attack occurred during business
hours, it could have cut off other users. He said other attacks
have occurred during busier times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Yahoo today? I don't know,'' Hansen said. ``Why someone
might do this to the FBI? That's fairly obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem with these attacks, he said, is that hackers often
disguise their location by forging fake Internet addresses to make
it appear as though the attack is coming from everywhere. That
makes it hard to spot a denial of service attack, and even harder
to track the hacker down.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Magdych, director of Network Associates' security research
division, feared that Yahoo's attack probably was a new type known
as a ``distributed denial of service attack,'' in which a single
person can use several different computers simultaneously to launch
an attack. The hacker can even use people's computers without their
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   If this was the case, it's conceivable that Yahoo was brought
down Monday by a single hacker, Magdych said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before there would have been a person on each machine
launching the attack ... now one hacker, if he had enough time and
energy, can launch huge attacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After early gains, Yahoo's stock slipped slightly in the
afternoon after the outage was publicized. Shares closed at $354,
up 50 cents on a day when the rest of the Nasdaq composite index
surged.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jeff Siegel said traders were wise not to panic when
Yahoo became unavailable. ``When eBay went down, people acted more
foolishly,'' he said, referring to eBay's repeated outages this
summer that sent its stock tumbling from more than $200 to $75 in a
matter of months. EBay closed Monday at $169.56, up $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internet popularity index tallied by Media
Metrix, Yahoo.com has been the most popular destination on the
Internet since June, and Yahoo's collected Web sites are second in
popularity only to America Online. Yahoo had 42,361,000 unique
users in December.
</P>
<P>
   According to Keynote Systems, Yahoo has consistently been the
best-performing and most reliable Web site.

 PASSAGE OF PROP. 25 COULD RESHAPE CAMPAIGN FINANCING  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ California voters will have a chance next month to
join the growing public outcry for campaign finance reform that has
been a key element of the presidential candidacies of Republican
Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 25 on the March 7 ballot would tighten campaign
contribution disclosure requirements, establish contribution limits
from individual donors, ban corporate contributions and provide for
public financing of advertisements for candidates who adopt
voluntary spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Reforming the system that allows candidates to rake in money has
long been popular with voters, but attempts to change the system
have often been blocked by politicians reliant on campaign
contributions, as well as by courts that have held that those
contributions are a form of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure is supported by the consumer group Common
Cause and by McCain (Bradley has taken no position), it has drawn
opposition from the League of Women Voters and the California
Chamber of Commerce, which say it will give an unfair advantage to
wealthy candidates who are able to spend their own money on
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Contribution limits for people who wish to donate to a candidate
would be set at $5,000 for statewide candidates, $3,000 for other
candidates and $50,000 total per election. A donation by a
political action committee also would be restricted to $5,000 for a
statewide election or $3,000 for other candidates per election.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate contributions would be banned under the initiative,
and fund raising could take place only 12 months before the primary
election and 90 days after the election.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require immediate disclosure on the Internet
of large campaign contributions and require advertisers to disclose
who is paying for the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers each would pay $1 per year, for a total of about $17
million, according to the state legislative analyst's office.
</P>
<P>
   It would also require an expanded voter information pamphlet
that would include financial information. The secretary of state's
office estimates the cost at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that Proposition 25 will not suffer the same
fate as Proposition 208, the 1996 voter-approved campaign finance
reform measure thrown out by a judge who said it was too
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Californians an opportunity to get big money out of
elections fairly, effectively and constitutionally,'' said Tony
Miller, a Democratic former secretary of state who is co-chairman
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the measure gives an unfair advantage to a few
people and will force taxpayers to pay for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a $55 million cost, which will either come from tax
increases or cuts in other services,'' said Carol Evans, a
spokeswoman for the No on Prop 25 campaign. ``It's not worth it _
it contains more abuses than the system we currently have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said the opponents of the measure simply like the
current system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to drain down the swamp, you're going to p_ off
the alligators,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big unions and big corporations benefit from the current
system and don't want to see it changed,'' he said. ``The disease
does not endorse the cure.''
</P>
<P>
   California is one of only six states that have no limits on
campaign contributions. Proposition 25 supporters say the system
creates a situation like that Gov. Gray Davis finds himself in.
Davis raised $13.2 million last year, even though he does not face
re-election for three more years.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has opposed Prop. 25, saying it would ``cost $55 million
annually and would load additional millions in election costs on
local governments'' at a time when ``there are too many other
pressing needs in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said it would also ``do absolutely nothing to rein in
the unlimited amounts of money wealthy candidates can _ and do _
spend on their own campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was clearly referring to Ron Unz, a co-chairman of
the Proposition 25 campaign. Unz, a Silicon Valley
multimillionaire, spent millions of dollars of his own money to
fund Proposition 227, 1998's successful initiative limiting
bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Unz was also expected to spend significant amounts of his own
money this year in an attempt to gain the Republican nomination for
the U.S. Senate, but he abandoned the bid after only three months.

COACH SAYS SIZE MATTERS LESS

   LOS ANGELES _ Coach Phil Jackson wants to open up the Los
Angeles Lakers' offense and he's willing to go a bit unconventional
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson plans to play small forwards Glen Rice and Rick Fox in
tandem, giving up size in the lineup for extra scoring punch _ and
the promise of making defenses play more honestly.
</P>
<P>
   With Fox subbing in for low-scoring A.C. Green at times, the
Lakers will have an added shooter on the floor. Opponents have been
sagging off Green and Ron Harper to double-team Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our offense, for us to really operate the offense well, it
takes every player being a threat,'' Jackson said, ``and sometimes
we have players that don't carry a threat out on the floor. Harp,
obviously, they make a choice to run off him and A.C. When you have
two players out there that neither (defenses) feel they have to
play because of their(lack of) outside-shooting threat, it makes it
difficult to get the ball back inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do have Rick and Glen together out on the floor, it
changes that. Teams have to spread their defense and open up the
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will look for the right opportunities to make the move
but is not worried about the 6-foot-7 Fox playing bigger power
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he has any probems with size. He's got a big
body, he weighs 250 (pounds), he's a good post-up defender,''
Jackson said. ``It's the rebounding aspect that might be a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Big weekend: Derek Fisher's All-Star break won't be much of a
break. He has been selected to replace Kobe Bryant in the 2ball
competition on Saturday but only after he goes home to Arkansas to
have his college jersey retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge,'' said Fisher, who played at Arkansas-Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   He'll fly home Thursday morning, then fly back to L.A. and up to
Oakland on Friday morning. On Monday, he'll leave for Chicago,
where the Lakers begin a six-game road trip. He doesn't mind the
whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The break would have been nice, but (2ball) is a career move
as far as I'm concerned, just continuing to kind of build my
(fame),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher admitted he's not entirely clear on the 2ball concept but
added with a smile, ``I know how much prize money we win.
Twenty-five G's, split it evenly.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Unmasked: Robert Horry is thrilled to be playing without the
plastic mask he wore for nine games to protect his broken nose. He
ditched the mask Friday and said his shooting definitely was
affected by it.
</P>
<P>
   Horry was shooting .446 before breaking his nose but shot .309
(13 for42) with the mask on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a whole lot better without it,'' he said. ``It's a big
difference, because you're so worried about having it in position
right so you can see, so if it gets hit, it won't hit your nose. It
was a big hassle.''

   FRANCE-ABORTION-PILL (Trappes, France) _ The students stopping
in at the high school infirmary on a recent morning were making
their usual requests for aspirin or cold medicine. But soon they
will also be able to pick up morning after pills. Last month,
France became the first country to give its school nurses the right
to dispense emergency contraception pills. The pills are to be
available in both high schools and junior high schools. Although
the nurses are advised to make efforts to inform the child's

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is in charge of

MIDAIR COLLISION OVER L.A. KILLS FOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY, JESSE HIESTAND AND LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the region's busiest air corridor, four people
were killed Monday in a midair collision in L.A.'s San Fernando
Valley that sent one plane crashing next to the Golden State
Freeway and the other bursting into flames on a golf course amid
terrified players.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular crash occurred at 9:48 a.m. in the heavily
congested Newhall Pass, which funnels planes into Burbank Airport,
Whiteman Airpark and Van Nuys Airport, the nation's busiest general
aviation airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to happen sooner or later,'' said Kevin Connolly,
a certified flight instructor with King Aviation Center at Van Nuys
Airport. ``It's very common to have many aircraft around you in
close proximity.''
</P>
<P>
   No one on the ground was injured, and the single-engine planes
miraculously avoided the busy Golden State Freeway, after clipping
each other's left wing and hurtling out of control, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally thought it was going to fall on our heads, and
another concern was the power lines,'' said Jeffrey Childers of
Sherman Oaks, who was playing golf with friends at the newly built
Cascades Golf Course when one plane fell about 30 yards away and
burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the pilot and passenger of that plane were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the plane that crashed alongside San Fernando Road
was identified as Charles David Oliver, 53, of Glendora, according
to the Coroner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver was licensed as an airline transport pilot and flight
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie and Ronnie Jabara, neighbors of Oliver, said he often flew
celebrities, including rock stars and politicians, with his charter
plane company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him telling me about flying Debbie Reynolds and her
team,'' Ronnie Jabara said. ``Rod Stewart, too. He was very much in
demand from the VIP world.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said despite losing an eye in an accident, Oliver was
a steady, experienced pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't interfere with his flying,'' Ernie Jabara said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not release the name of his passenger, a woman
in her 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Childers said he and other golfers ran to the other wreckage but
couldn't get near it because heat, smoke and the fear of live wires
and exploding fuel kept them at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was too early to determine why the planes
crashed, but that the pilots might have failed to see each other
because of the planes' blind spots.
</P>
<P>
   Neither plane reported problems before the collision, said FAA
spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Both planes had been in contact with Van Nuys Airport just
before the collision, Dunn said. Oliver's plane had indicated it
was heading for the airport, but when air traffic controllers
answered, it did not respond, Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials said the pass is
heavily traveled, but not dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot who asked not to give his name but who has been flying
out of Van Nuys for five years said the pass ``is a very
high-density area compared to most places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is certainly the biggest single spot in the Valley for
getting into and out of the Valley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that fell on the golf course was a Bellanca 7ECA that
might have been scouting pipeline locations for a Bakersfield
company, said Bruce Nelson, an operations officer for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Oliver was flying was a Questair Venture, a homemade
two-seat experimental aircraft that was bound for Van Nuys Airport,
six miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   After the collision, the Bellanca plunged into high-voltage
power lines, exploded, and fell onto the sixth-hole fairway off
Balboa Boulevard. About 33,000 customers in the Van Nuys area lost
power for three minutes after the plane hit the power lines,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The other plane, witnesses said, tumbled and corkscrewed,
passing over the Golden State Freeway, until it crashed on the side
of San Fernando Road near the gate to a Metropolitan Water District
filtration plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they hit he was kind of fluttering to stay up,'' said
Darren Gray of B&AMP;W Pipeline, who was working with a crew installing
storm drains at a new office building next to the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The red Bellanca did not catch fire, but ended up like a crushed
Coca-Cola can amid the roadside vegetation. Rescue workers lifted
the wreckage with a crane, trying to recover the bodies of the two
occupants, said L.A. Fire Department Capt. Steve Ruda.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the Bellanca's pilot may have been
circling over a construction site near the golf course, monitoring
pipelines, when the planes collided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever they see construction going on, it's their job to
make sure (construction workers) are not digging into the line,''
said George Petterson, an investigator with the National
Transportation Safety Board.

BRYANT LEADS LAKERS OVER NUGGETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant has found favorite new sparring
partners. They're called the Denver Nuggets and they have become
regulars at absorbing Bryant's repertoire of body blows and quick
jabs.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant single-handedly knocked out the Nuggets in a 35-point
Lakers rout last month and for an encore, he nearly dropped his
first career triple-double on them Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Igniting a second-half comeback from 17 points down, Bryant led
the Los Angeles Lakers to a 106-98 victory at Staples Center that
had the Nuggets looking dazed and wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant finished with 29 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds and
made 10 of 21 shots from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal benefited from Bryant's show, as the receiving
end of several of those assists, and finished with a game-high 35
points, 13 rebounds and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   A near double triple-double.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't always look as good as that sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, paced by 24 points from Antonio McDyess and 18
points from ex-Laker Nick Van Exel, led from early in the second
quarter until the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant got eight points in the third quarter to start the
comeback and 11 more in the fourth to finish it. He was good on
three straight 3-point tries in the final quarter _ hitting two of
them on feeds from O'Neal _ as the Lakers pulled within three
points. Rick Fox hit another 3-pointer and the game was tied for
the first time since the first half, 87-all.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal did the rest, scoring six points down the stretch as the
Lakers won back-to-back games for the first time since their
16-game winning streak ended Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed by 17 points early in the third quarter after
watching Van Exel score a quick five points to open the second
half. That got the Lakers' attention and the game suddenly
turnedinto a crazy see-saw pattern of scoring runs.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Lakers went on an 11-0 run, with six straight from
Bryant, to cut the lead to 67-61. That led to a 10-0 run by the
Nuggets, with a pair of 3-pointers from Van Exel, to make it a
16-point Denver advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers answered with an 8-0 run, with six points from
O'Neal, and eventually settled for a 79-71 deficit heading into the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With a 35-point pummeling of the Nuggets here last month as a
backdrop, coach Phil Jackson worried about his team's focus.
Particularly in light of Denver's recent changes _ since these
teams last met, the Nuggets acquired Chris Gatling and Tariq
Abdul-Wahad for Ron Mercer in a trade with Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an interesting game tonight for us,'' Jackson said
prior to tipoff. ``I think that maybe we got ther attention because
they've changed personnel and have got three different players in
their rotation. It should be a game that we have to meet a little
bit of their energy, and this team has not done that historically
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's concerns proved well founded, as the Lakers fell to a
62-50 halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   With a 12-point burst from McDyess, the Nuggets outscored the
Lakers 37-23 in the second quarter, tying the most points allowed
by the Lakers in a quarter this season.
</P>
<P>
   Denver shot 53.5 percent in the first half, and the 62 points
was the second most the Lakers have surrendered in a half.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 18 points, and Bryant 10 points and seven assists as
the Lakers shot 47.6 percent. But the difference was in the bench
support _ Denver got 22 points from its reserves while the Lakers
got just six points from their second unit.

LOS ANGELES: Safety Board. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the factors that could have led to the crash are the
planes' respective blind spots. On the Bellanca the wing is above
the cockpit, while the wing on the Venture is below the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly something to consider _ a wing does block your
view,'' Petterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a heavy-traffic area such as Los Angeles International
Airport, where air traffic control regulates height, speed and
direction of incoming planes, controllers at Van Nuys merely tell
small planes the order in which they should land, and the location
of the plane ahead of them in line.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, when conditions are good, the area is considered a
``see and avoid area,'' and pilots are on their own to stay out of
each other's way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Newhall Pass is uncontrolled, an inspector for
the FAA's Van Nuys Flight Standards District Office said small
planes should have enough room to avoid each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a little bit of concentration for natural
features, but not a lot,'' said the inspector, who declined to give
his name. He said the 10-mile-wide Newhall Pass and the surrounding
peaks form ``more of a landmark than a physical barricade.''
</P>
<P>
   The pass lines up with a runway at Van Nuys Airport, so when
pilots are in the pass they know they're lined up with the runway,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said that's why so many pilots use the pass _ it's
convenient. But he said the ultimate responsibility is with the
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for your eyes,'' Connolly said. ``It's
just a reminder everyone needs to keep their heads up. That's the
only way you can prevent this.''

PGA PLAYERS EVALUATE SITE OF 2000 U.S. OPEN IN JUNE
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Two-time U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen
frowns upon the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain just makes it so tough,'' said Janzen, who questioned
the Pro-Am's status as a ``legitimate golf tournament'' after heavy
rains and severe winds forced PGA Tour officials to suspend play
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A history of poor weather haunts the Pro-Am, but Janzen returned
grudgingly to the 53-year-old tournament for the first time since
1996 to preview the site of June's U.S. Open. That also explained
the appearances of Spain's Sergio Garcia and France's Jean Van de
Velde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to come to the U.S. Open without knowing the
course,'' Garcia said of Pebble Beach Golf Links, one of three
courses utilized during the Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   Recent changes to the course failed to go unnoticed by players
during the Pro-Am. Officials reshaped and narrowed the fairways
with the U.S. Open in mind after last summer's U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quite a few changes,'' Mark O'Meara said. ``I think
when you come to see the golf course, you want to make sure you're
mentally prepared for June. Now, the weather will be different. The
golf course will be set up with deeper rough, but you get a feel
for a golf course the more times you play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods also acknowledged the modifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different than I've ever seen it with the rough on a lot
of the holes,'' Woods said. ``They've taken some of the lining
areas and moved them a little bit. Some of the holes that were
traditionally slight doglegs are now more of a dogleg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take for instance No. 16. They have moved the rough about 30
yards and pretty far over to the right. Now, the bunkers are in
play. Before, you used to pound it. Now, you really have to
concentrate on putting the ball on the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the course to play in June as it did the past
week. The rough will be deeper, and the fairways and greens will be
significantly firmer from the summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know what you're going to see, but it's not going
to do you much good if you're looking to prepare for the Open this
week because of the fact the course is so soft,'' Tom Lehman said.
``You might be able to learn the fact that there are some pretty
narrow spots out there and that `this hole' might not be an iron
and `that hole' might be a 1-iron _ strategic things like that.
When you can't see it bounce and roll, it's not real almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach also will play to a par-71 for the U.S. Open. The
502-yard, par-5 No. 2 _ the course's easiest hole _ will become a
par-4 by June after the removal of a tree. The tree forces players
to keep their drives down the right side of the fairway to prevent
the obstacle from coming into play on their approach shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big strategic part of that hole,'' Lehman said.
``With it being gone and it being summertime when the ball is going
to roll from the up tee, it's going to be a driver, 5-iron. It's
still a small green, and it'll be a tough par-4.''
</P>
<P>
   The greens also will be significantly harder and will not hold
approach shots as well. The greens measured about 9.0 on the
Stimpmeter, which measures the speed of greens, for the Pro-Am and
will be closer to 11.0 for the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think here at Pebble you can have some paths where it's
almost impossible to putt it,'' Garcia said. ``You have to be
really careful of being in the right place of putting for birdie.
You can have a 5-footer downhill and a 15-footer uphill, and you're
going to be much more pleased with a 15- or 20-footer than the
5-footer.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, and those of Scott McCarron, Pebble Beach will
be ``totally different'' for the U.S. Open. nn

WOODS' RALLY STUNS UNSUSPECTING GOGEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Notah Begay predicted Sunday that Tiger
Woods' roar would be heard during yesterday's final round of the
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   Begay forecasted an 8-under-par 64 from Woods at Pebble Beach
Golf Links, and Woods delivered to erase a seven-stroke deficit
with seven holes remaining and captured his sixth consecutive PGA
Tour title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said \RSunday\S that he's going to be there at the end,''
said Begay, a college teammate of Woods on Stanford's 1994 national
championship squad. ``It adds to the mystique of Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour rookie Matt Gogel, who shared the lead with Fort Worth
resident Mark Brooks through 54 holes, never saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed to be quite honest,'' said Gogel, who led Woods
by seven strokes after his par on No. 10. ``I won't ever be amazed
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogel expected the late-afternoon run at him to come from Begay
or Vijay Singh after his bogeys at Nos. 11, 12 and 14, and he
checked the scoreboard between the 14th and 15th holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of needed to know the last four or five holes,'' Gogel
said. ``I knew I was still one or two shots up, but I didn't know.
The scoreboards were pretty delayed back there on 14 and 15, and
Tiger was just about finished at that time. So, I didn't really
know that it was him. I thought the guy I had to worry about was
Vijay or Notah.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Woods after his eagle on No. 15 triggered the
improbable. Woods carded birdies on Nos. 16 and 18 to finish 15
under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he made eagle until I was on the 18th green and
saw his hole-by-hole,'' Gogel said. ``I heard a couple of loud
noises, so I assumed he birdied 18 because I heard a loud ovation
about 30 minutes before I finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' finish left Gogel needing a birdie on No. 17 or 18 to
force a playoff. Gogel's birdie attempt on No. 17 stopped one roll
short of the cup, and he misread his putt for birdie on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about destiny,'' Gogel said of Woods' sixth
consecutive tour victory. ``He's just damn good. He had all eyes on
him. The press was following the story all week, and he ``is'' the
story and will be again next week.'' nn

MAVERICKS GO FROM LAUGHINGSTOCK TO RISING STOCK

<P>
   DALLAS _ How 'bout them Mavericks?
</P>
<P>
   Winners in 10 of their past 13 games, including seven of eight,
the Mavericks are one of the NBA's hottest teams, along with
Minnesota and Portland. Recently a laughingstock _ the Mavericks
had the worst winning percentage in professional sports during the
1990s _ they are the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing excellent basketball,'' said guard Michael
Finley, who scored 34 points against Vancouver and was selected
yesterday as NBA Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 7-1, and we've been doing it on the defensive end.
Offensively, we have a lot of scorers on our team. But we take a
lot of pride in our defense, and that's been the key to us in
getting our wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have won as many games (10) during a 27-day span
from Jan. 11 through Sunday as they did during the first 69 days of
the season. Granted, the Mavericks have defeated only three teams
with winning records, but their 103-99 victory Sunday against
Vancouver indicates the Mavericks are learning how to win.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 7 at Reunion Arena, the Grizzlies snapped a 30-game road
losing streak with a 105-94 victory, outscoring the Mavericks 29-17
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Vancouver, the Mavericks blew an 11-point lead and
missed two late free throws, allowing the Grizzlies to force an
overtime session. This time, the Mavericks prevailed by outscoring
the Grizzlies, 12-8, in the extra period, improving to their best
record after 47 games (20-27) since the 1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendously exciting game,'' Mavericks
coach//general manager Don Nelson said. ``I think we're playing
great, and we're playing at the best level we have in a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   During their hottest streak since the 1994-95 season, the
Mavericks have beaten Portland (113-105) and Charlotte (106-96),
and won at Detroit (99-91), which was playing without the injured
Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were competitive in two of the losses, 98-95 at
New Jersey and 101-100 to Philadelphia at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably needed something like this,'' guard Erick
Strickland said of the overtime victory. ``For so long, we've been
on the other side of close games like this, and we would lose them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we needed something like this to show us and teach us what
we need to do to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players and front-office personnel have attributed the
team's new attitude to Mark Cuban, who agreed Jan. 3 to buy
controlling interest in the Mavericks from Ross Perot Jr. Cuban's
enthusiasm has excited the organization and long-suffering fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think \RCuban\S is the best thing that ever happened to the
team,'' said Lee Coulter, 56, of Arlington. ``I had given up going
to the games, \Rbut\S I'll start going again now. I probably won't
be able to get a seat if this \RDennis\S Rodman thing works out and
Cuban gets the team winning again.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Don Denton, 39, of Arlington: ``Since Cuban announced he's
buying the team,'' added Don Denton, 39, of Arlington, ``we've been
talking more Mavs in the past weeks than the past seven years.
``I'm definitely going to watch \Rtomorrow's\S game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who is expected to make his Mavericks debut tomorrow
against Seattle, has generated some of the surging interest in the
Mavericks. Team officials say ticket sales have improved since
Rodman signed, and The Worm's presence has been a hot topic on
sports-talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Mark Cuban announced he was going to be the owner,
interest has risen steadily,'' said Jeff Catlin, assistant program
director for KTCK//1310 AM. ``People are calling all of our shows
several times every day. Some, of course, like what he's done and
some don't, but he's given people something to talk about with the
Mavericks, and that hasn't happened in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rodman, Catlin said: ``We haven't gotten a lot of calls
now that he's actually signed. I expect we'll get a ton of calls
Thursday as people will want to react to how he played, is he in
shape, are Cuban and Nelson geniuses?''
</P>
<P>
   As for their recent play on the court, Finley would seem to
deserve most of the credit. An All-Star selection, Finley is also
the team's first NBA Player of the Week in four years. He averaged
26.5 points, 8.0 rebounds and 6.3 assists as the Mavericks went 3-1
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the confidence,'' Finley said. ``Confidence does wonders
for teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're winning _ and we like winning _ the guys are
enthusiastic in the locker room, and we want to continue having
that feeling. In order to do that, we have to continue winning
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   In six of the Mavericks' past 10 victories, they've held
opponents to less than 100 points despite being outrebounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been taking it upon ourselves to go out there each
and every night and put in 110 percent effort and throw our cards
in there at the end and see what happens,'' Finley said.
``Fortunately for us, we've been winning.'' nn

3 STARS EXPECT TO WORK OUT WITH TEAM TUESDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Rarely do hockey players use the word excited to
describe their feelings about a random practice in February. But
today isn't just any practice for the Stars. For the first time in
a long time, defenseman Derian Hatcher (lacerated right calf) and
wingers Jamie Langenbrunner (pinched nerve in his neck) and Jere
Lehtinen (right ankle) are expected to practice with the rest of
the team. ``Whenever a player puts his full equipment on and comes
to practice, you know that he's thinking that he's getting ready to
play, and I think the team gets excited by that,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``I think \Rtoday's\S practice will determine a lot
for a timetable on all three guys.'' Langenbrunner is the only one
who is likely to be in the lineup for tomorrow's game in Anaheim,
Calif. Hatcher and Lehtinen aren't likely to return until Sunday's
game against Washington. At the earliest. But, at least, they're
close. ``I've been really antsy actually. I think I'm antsy because
I know I'm close but I'm not there yet,'' said Hatcher, who has
missed almost eight weeks. ``For me to say I'll play this week, I
think would be far-fetched. ... Out there right now, it's still
bugging me.'' Lehtinen, meanwhile, says he still has pain in the
ankle he originally injured Oct. 16. ``Maybe, it's going to be
there all season, but I have to feel like it's 100 percent,''
Lehtinen said. SURGERY CONSIDERED
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner came very close to having his return delayed
much longer. He said he seriously considered having surgery on the
pinched nerve. ``I was pretty sure I was going to do it,''
Langenbrunner said. ``Scary? Yeah. I didn't want anybody cutting
into my neck.'' He considered it because numbness in his arm
persisted after a hit he took Dec. 17. He missed only one game then
but hasn't played since Jan. 7. nn

FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR VISITS WITH COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Imminent was the buzz word around Valley Ranch
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Zampese, the Cowboys' former offensive coordinator who
apparently will be brought back in some kind of advisory role for
the upcoming season, was sighted in the hallways between meetings
with club officials.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old Zampese would not comment on his situation, but
his presence at Valley Ranch this week would suggest that an
announcement could come as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   New offensive coordinator Jack Reilly will have assistants who
will help the Cowboys run the offense they used to win three Super
Bowls in the 1990s. Zampese worked with Reilly the past three
seasons with the Cowboys (1997) and New England (1998-99).
</P>
<P>
   Finalization of the coaching staff should come early in the
week. The necessity to complete the staff is heightened because
deadlines for qualifying offers to restricted free agents, such as
Pro Bowl linebacker Dexter Coakley, and the start of the NFL
free-agent signing period are scheduled for Thursday and Friday,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Chandler, a four-time Pro Bowl selection who caught 555
passes for 8,933 yards and 56 touchdowns at New Orleans (1978-81)
and San Diego (1981-87), is the leading candidate for the Cowboys'
wide-receivers coaching job, according to a source. He would
replace Dwain Painter, whose contract was not renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions continue between Jerry Jones and Jason Garrett over
the possibility of the 33-year-old backup quarterback retiring to
become the Cowboys' quarterbacks coach, replacing Buddy Geis. Geis
could be moved to another position or might not return. Geis and
Painter were hired by former coach Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends coach Les Miles, also hired by Gailey, is thought to
be safe because no coaches have been interviewed for that position.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese's son, Ken, who interviewed last week for an offensive
assistant position with the Cowboys, was hired yesterday by the St.
Louis Rams. nn

INJURIES HELP STARS DEVELOP DEPTH

 INJURIES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Brenden Morrow is young, but he sure isn't
timid.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is the same as Mike Keane, Grant Marshall, Scott
Thornton, guys like that. Go in there and get your nose dirty, get
under the skin of the opponent, open up ice,'' said Morrow, who
turned 21 on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Irritate the opponent, eh? Say hello, Phoenix. Morrow made the
Coyotes' skin crawl worse than a hissing swarm of desert rattlers
Thursday in the Stars' 2-0 victory. It pulled the Stars into a
points tie with the Coyotes atop the Pacific Division with 29 games
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are expecting injured veterans to return soon but
still expect rookie contributions _ especially from their young
forwards _ as they begin their charge toward the playoffs tomorrow
night against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Morrow scored the Stars' first goal early in the
opening period, assisted on Mike Modano's goal and, in a unanimous
decision, got in a couple of good whacks to the face of the
Coyotes' Travis Green.The Stars needed quick results from young
players, and they got it. They've helped keep the Stars near the
top of the Western Conference, and now the Stars hope to benefit
from their experience.
</P>
<P>
   As forwards Jamie Langenbrunner, Jere Lehtinen and eventually
Brian Skrudland and Joe Nieuwendyk return from injury _
Langenbrunner could be back as soon as tomorrow _ lines will be
shuffled and ice time will probably drop for the three impressive
rookie forwards: Morrow, Blake Sloan and Roman Lyashenko.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Stars will finally practice with Langenbrunner,
Lehtinen and defenseman Derian Hatcher on the ice together. Then,
coach Ken Hitchcock must start meshing lines back together without
disrupting the Stars, who won six of seven before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pleasant quandary. Healthy, the Stars could have the
makings of a club that resembles the 1998 Detroit Red Wings, who
were strong on all four lines and able to go physical or finesse.
Those Red Wings defeated the Stars in six games en route to winning
the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us an interesting dilemma,'' Langenbrunner said.
``You have guys that have played really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Stars will have 26 players practicing. Clubs can
carry 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side of things is everybody can count here, too,''
Hitchcock said. ``And I think people are going to be a little bit
nervous, too. So, I think there is a downside to this because those
people have put in yeoman's service to put us into the position
we're in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, Sloan and Lyashenko probably don't have to worry about
their lockers being moved to Kalamazoo, Mich., home of the Stars'
minor-league affiliate. They likely will be called on to supply
energetic, hard-nosed play on the third or fourth lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to bring up players we didn't feel we would
need this early,'' said Stars assistant general manager Doug
Armstrong, who serves as the team's liaison with its minor-league
affiliate. ``These players were the top players early for our team
in Kalamazoo, and they had earned the right to come up. They've
impressed our coaching staff, and, even more importantly, they
impressed their teammates with their work ethic and their ability
to play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how will Hitchcock manipulate the lines? He isn't saying.
</P>
<P>
   If pieces fall back together like they were before the injuries,
Brett Hull would rejoin Lehtinen and Mike Modano on the No. 1 line.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Hitchcock would have plenty of choices to put with
Langenbrunner and Kirk Muller on the second line or with Guy
Carbonneau and Keane on the third line. Hitchcock would have
Morrow, Sloan, Marshall, Thornton, Lyashenko and eventually Muller

USE OF KARLOFF'S IMAGE PROMPTS SUIT
</HEADLINE>

BY MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The horror: Boris Karloff's daughter is suing
Universal Studios and one of its executives for more than $10
million, claiming the movie company has been using her father's
image to secure promotions and licensing deals without paying her
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Karloff's suit, filed last week in Los Angeles Superior
Court, alleges fraud, unfair business practices and breach of
contract. It claims the movie studio has been using Boris Karloff's
image to secure promotions and licensing deals with third parties.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, who changed his name from William Henry Pratt
because he thought Boris Karloff it sounded more menacing,
portrayed such classic horror characters as Frankenstein and The
Mummy in a series of films beginning in the early 1930s. Universal
is still capitalizing on those characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sara Karloff is owed millions by Universal because the studio
ran roughshod over her rights,'' said Allan Browne, Karloff's
attorney. ``(Universal) used unsavory business tactics and
wrongfully used Boris Karloff's image and likeness.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of Universal, owned by Montreal-based Seagram
Co., said the studio does not comment on litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Universal has made a concerted effort for at least the past five
years to exploit such classic monsters as Dracula, Frankenstein and
The Mummy. Much of this initiative has come out of Universal's
consumer products division, whose president, Cynthia Cleveland, is
named as a co-defendant in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The studio has big plans for its horror classics: It produced a
successful remake of ``The Mummy'' last year, and a new version of
``Frankenstein'' is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Karloff is one of many celebrity heirs who claimed inherited
rights of publicity under a California law passed in the mid-1980s.
Until that time, a celebrity's rights to his or her image were not
``descendible,'' but ended at death.
</P>
<P>
   Bela Lugosi, the son of the ``Dracula'' actor of the same name,
helped to bring about the legislation after he sued Universal in
the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Under agreements with these heirs, Universal can use ``generic''
Dracula and Frankenstein characters that don't directly copy facial
features of the original actors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, vampires and mummies per se are not the property of any
one company. But the line between legality and illegality in a case
such as Karloff's can be open to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Browne admitted he couldn't give an exact definition of how much
Universal would have to change a Karloff character to avoid paying
royalties to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   His suit alleges that Universal ``passed off'' slightly changed
versions of Karloff characters _ which, according to Browne, were
``substantially similar'' to Karloff's. The company also engaged in
``bait and switch'' tactics with licensees who pay Universal to
make products in the image of their characters.
</P>
<P>
   No outside licensees are named in the suit. Browne declined to
name any, saying he would hold back specific examples to use as
evidence in his case.
</P>
<P>
   But Universal has dozens of licensees for its monsters, making
everything from Halloween masks to Christmas ornaments to high-end
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Browne and Karloff contend that Boris Karloff himself created
the unique look of the characters he portrayed.

COMPANIES LOOK FOR INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>

BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Artificial eyes, microscopic plumbing, saliva
analysis and a stretcher that doubles as an intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   The products are as varied as the companies offering them, but
the goal is the same: Raise money, launch your product, go public
or be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   So 21 of Southern California's most promising biomedical
start-up companies on Monday pitched potential investors at the
Southern California Biomedical Council's second investment
opportunities conference.
</P>
<P>
   Although the goal of the conference was to match companies with
potential financiers and business partners, the actual result is
much more difficult to track, said Ahmed Enany, the council's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of our effort to help local firms get noticed.
People get interested, and hopefully something will pop,'' Enany
said. ``You have to get on the radar screen of people who have
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies vying for the attention of investors was
Pasadena-based Nanostream Inc., a company in its infancy that makes
tiny systems of tubes for moving and measuring miniscule amounts of
liquid. The company said its product will allow as many as 1,000
tests from DNA analysis to alcohol content analysis to be performed
on a sample as small as one drop.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting attention was the major reason Valencia-based Second
Sight attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Greenberg, the company's president, said the year-old
Second Sight has enough money to carry it into 2001, when it hopes
to complete a second, $15 million round of financing.
</P>
<P>
   Second Sight makes eye implants that connect a glasses-mounted
video camera to the patient's optic nerve, giving people who have
gone blind their sight.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the companies represented at the conference, Second
Sight, a spin-off of Sylmar-based MiniMed Inc., has no revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company only has a prototype product that is a
shadow of the technology's potential, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the academic researchers developing the technology have
tested it in a few patients who have lost their sight because of
disease. Greenberg said there are 3 million people in the
industrialized world who are completely blind because of macular
degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to begin human trials next year and predicts
it will have a product on the market by 2003. At some point,
Greenberg said, the company will decide whether to go public or be
acquired by a larger company company such as Bausch &AMP; Lomb or its
sister company, Advanced Bionics, which makes similar implants for
the ears.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies at Monday's conference discussed their ``exit
strategy'' in their presentations. That's start-up lingo for the
way the company expects to pay off investors.
</P>
<P>
   The most common are an initial public offering or being acquired
by a larger corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Holding an IPO or negotiating a buyout are the two major options
for South Pasadena-based Nova Therapeutics Systems, which makes a
new type of cancer radiation treatment that focuses several beams
of gamma radiation on tumors in the brain, kidneys, liver or
pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Whittell, the company's director of marketing and
sales, said the company is looking for $6 million to bring its
already developed products to market.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its concentration of major universities, existing
biotechnology companies and a skilled pool of technology workers,
Southern California is uniquely positioned, said William Robbins,
chief executive officer of Convergent Ventures, a Los Angeles-based
investment and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Los Angeles is a very underserved but a very
high-promise area,'' said Robbins, who was at the conference
looking for potential clients. ``A lot of academics leave their
labs once they come up with a great idea.''

 WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant has found a favorite new sparring
partner. Actually several. They're called the Denver Nuggets and
they have become regulars at absorbing Bryant's deadly repertoire
of quick jabs and devastating body blows.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant single-handedly knocked out the Nuggets in a 35-point
Lakers rout last month and for an encore, he nearly dropped his
first career triple-double on them Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Igniting a second-half comeback from 17 points down, Bryant led
the Los Angeles Lakers to a 106-98 victory at Staples Center that
had the Nuggets looking dazed and wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   The final Kobe tally: 29 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds,
with three blocked shots and an immeasurable decibel level to serve
as the sound track.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of Bryant's 30-point explosion Jan. 10, when
the Lakers last beat the Nuggets, and everyone wondered if it was
inspired by the presence of Michael Jordan. His Airness wasn't in
the house this time, and Bryant finally divulged the true source of
his fire versus the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Lucas,'' Bryant said, referring to the Nuggets' assistant
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known John Lucas (since high school). He gave me my first
opportunity to play as a professional basketball player in
Philadelphia when he was coach of the Sixers. And every time we
play against them, he has something to say. Always. Even during
shootaround, talking trash, talking trash,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant isn't a high school player trying to prove himself
against the pros anymore, though. And he looked every bit the NBA
All-Star as he led the Lakers to their second straight win _ their
first consecutive victories since the streak ended Jan. 14 at 16
games.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal benefited from Bryant's show, as the receiving
end of several assists, and finished with a game-high 35 points, 13
rebounds and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   A near double triple-double.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't always look as good as that sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, paced by 24 points from Antonio McDyess and 18
points from ex-Laker Nick Van Exel, led from early in the second
quarter until the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant got eight points in the third quarter to start the
comeback and 11 more in the fourth to finish it. He was good on
three straight 3-point tries in the final quarter _ hitting two of
them on feeds from O'Neal _ as the Lakers pulled within three
points. Rick Fox hit another 3-pointer, and the game was tied for
the first time since the first half, 87-all.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Bryant maybe tried a little too much. He tried a
fourth 3-pointer, a wild pull-up, and Jackson promptly sat him for
four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was a heat check,'' Bryant said with a laugh.
``I'm fine with (the benching). It was a bad shot. I knew it was a
bad shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said coach Phil Jackson: ``I vacillate between wanting to spank
him and wanting to pat him on the back. And sometimes it ends up
about the middle. But he had a wonderful game in many respects. And
in other respects as a guard, there's a certain amount of
resistance and patience that you have to have in a game like that,
and a feel for it. He's still learning that feel.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal did the rest, scoring six points down the stretch to
finish with 10 in the final quarter. Fox scored eight of his 10
points in the fourth and played the last 17 minutes of the game,
all in place of Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Jackson continued a recent trend of sitting Rice,
thesubject of constant trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make some personnel decisions about players out
there, and Rick and Derek (Fisher) came off he bench in the second
half and gave us a big boost,'' Jackson said. ``Rick's playing
right now with a lot of good decisions and shooting the ball well.
He's hot. And his defense has been solid, so it just seemed like
the right matchup. We had to get some defense out on the court, a
little more quickness, strength.''

   LIVING-WILLS (Albany, N.Y.) _ As few as one in five Americans
have a living will or health proxy. The result has often been some
highly publicized cases, such as Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy
Cruzan, about individuals languishing in limbo, kept alive in a
vegetative state only because of medical technology. By SYLVIA

   FLYING-FEARS (San Francisco) _ For some passengers, merely
climbing onto an airplane involves an act of faith. Some turn to
talismans for comfort. Others indulge in alcohol, headphones or
medication. But mostly fliers, whether they are jittery and
occasional travelers or tranquil and frequent, simply try to avoid
thinking about it. By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ.

   CANCER-ADS (San Francisco)_ Controversial breast cancer
awareness ads _ some of them showing bare-chested women with
mastectomies _ will get a public viewing on billboards in San
Francisco after all. The ads, considered so shocking that sign
companies and transit agencies decided last month to censor them in
San Francisco and other Bay Area cities, were picked up by
billboard company Eller Media. By RACHEL GORDON.

   POOR-MAGAZINE (San Francisco) _ The mother-daughter team that
created Poor magazine is accustomed to doing the impossible:
putting out a glossy publication with next to no money while
simultaneously trying to sidestep the potholes of poverty in their
own lives. Now, Lisa Gray-Garcia and Dee Gray have embarked on
another ambitious program: training low-income people, most with
little or no writing or publishing experience, to be journalists.

small-town radio station. KFAN, with its eclectic adult tunes, is a

   COSTUME-MUSEUM (New York) _ Walking down the broad curving
staircase, past Richard Avedon's psychedelic portraits of the
Beatles, into the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute, your

``Rock Style.`` The thrill continues as you turn to peer into the

   CHEVRON-OUTLOOK (San Francisco) _ With the market driving a

have more market capitalization than decades-old oil companies. You

National Pro-Am just two weeks after he tied for seventh at the Bob

   PARK CITY, Utah _ ``You got some padding for your rear end?''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-something clerk behind the rental counter was just making
conversation, but I was nervous enough already. Could he tell?
</P>
<P>
   ``I may need some tomorrow,'' I told him, forcing myself to
laugh. Padding? I was more worried I'd need a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of skiing in the Wasatch Mountains east of Salt
Lake City _ and nearly 20 years, on and off, as an intermediate
skier _ I was about to take my very first snowboard lesson. And
feeling more than a little bit sheepish about it.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly don't fit the image of a stereotypical snowboarder.
My hair isn't dyed blond. I'm neither pierced nor tattooed. And at
42, I'm twice the age that many snowboarders appear to be as they
scream past me on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder, then, that as I hoisted my 5-foot turquoise
and olive-green board over my shoulder I sneaked a look around.
Good. Nobody was laughing.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, snowboarding has become big business at ski
resorts across the West. ``About 30 percent of our skier days are
constituted by snowboarders,'' said Melissa O'Brien, communications
manager at Park City Mountain Resort, the site of Olympic
snowboarding events in 2002. ``That's been basically the number
since Park City opened its doors to snowboarders in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, snowboarders make up 31 percent of people who
participate in downhill snow sports, reports the Leisure Trends
Group, a market research and consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of Utah's 14 ski resorts, Alta and Deer Valley, don't
allow snowboarders, according to Ski Utah, a marketing
organization. Among the 25 resorts that belong to the trade group
Colorado Ski Country, only chic Aspen keeps snowboarders away. But
even Aspen's sister resorts, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk and
Snowmass allow snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the forecast called for rain in Salt Lake City, but that
was a good thing, I decided. That surely meant snow 6,900 feet
above sea level at Park City. In mid-January, conditions on the
slopes had been springlike, even slushy. A few inches of fresh
powder could only help the 40-inch base.
</P>
<P>
   And it did snow _ 3,000 feet higher at the top of the mountain.
At the bottom, as I wandered around looking for my snowboard
teacher and fellow students, rain was the only thing coming from
the sky _ steady, cold rain. The easiest green slopes that led to
the ski lodge and resort shops were conspicuously empty.
</P>
<P>
   Was Somebody trying to tell me something?
</P>
<P>
   I slogged ahead. Fewer witnesses, I figured.
</P>
<P>
   My confidence grew infinitely when I met Martin Drayton of
London. At 39, he is a granddad among snowboarders, he said. In the
United States for the first time, Drayton is spending the winter in
Utah, teaching snowboarders and training to qualify for the 2002
Olympics. After a few minutes, Drayton and I determined that I
would be his only student for the next three hours. Under his
tutelage I knew I could master the mountain on a snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   In my mind I pictured myself racing down the mountain, a royal
blue blur to those middle-agers schussing down the slope in the
more conventional way, on two skis.
</P>
<P>
   Reality check. On my first day on skis, I remembered with
embarrassment, I had fallen so many times at Keystone Mountain in
Colorado that eventually I decided it would be easier and safer to
walk down the slope called Schoolmarm. And I was 19 years younger
then, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fallacy that snowboarding is just for youth,'' said
Joy Spring, vice president at the Leisure Trends Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ten percent of downhillers 55 and older are snowboarders, Spring
said. In the 45-54 age group, 16 percent snowboard, and the figure
rises to 22 percent for those between 35 and 44.
</P>
<P>
   Drayton has seen evidence of that at Park City. ``People are
becoming aware that it's not a sport of just snotty 16-year-olds,''
said Drayton, a member of the British snowboarding team. ``Over in
Europe it's even more so. You get a lot of older snowboarders.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowboarding should be even more appealing than skiing to some
older downhillers, Drayton said, because it's an easier sport, once
they get the hang of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have clients in their 50s and 60s who've been skiing 20, 30
years, who find they're not fit enough to ski powder all day. But
on a snowboard they can ride all day and the next, because they're
using fewer muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowboarders usually can handle difficult runs and a wider
variety of terrain much sooner than skiers, he said. ``Once you can
make a turn, you can take that turn in powder, breakable crust,
even death cookies (little lumps of hard snow).''
</P>
<P>
   Snowboards aren't particularly high tech, Drayton told me as he
started clamping my left foot into place. It's just a board. The
snowboarder has complete control. Whatever his body tells the board
to do, it does. Simple.
</P>
<P>
   And for good or bad, it was just as he said. With only one foot
attached firmly to the board, I slowly learned to maneuver myself
back and forth down the snow-blanketed incline that led to the
First Time lift.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly.
</P>
<P>
   I stretched both arms out for balance (like a gunfighter in the
old West, Drayton said). I gingerly set my right foot down on the
board. Sliiiiiide. Panic. Flail. Fall.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I started to lose my balance, I finally learned, my
brain would advise me to stand straight up. But I should have been
bending my knees and getting lower to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times you have to switch your brain off, because it
gives you bad info,'' Drayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. But Drayton was encouraging. And there
was a bit of Olympian in me, he noted. I looked a lot like Mark
Spitz, thrashing through the air the same way he thrashed through
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   With great patience, Drayton and I made our way down this
gentlest of hills. And even after I locked my remaining foot onto
the board, sliiiiiide-panic-flail-fall eventually became
sliiiiiide-sink-stop. At least sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally I managed some successful J-turns, more or less by
raising my toes and sinking the back edge of the board into the
snow. And by the time we reached the chairlift, I could even see
the possibility of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never too late to have a happy childhood.'' That's part
of snowboarding's allure, according to Kevin Delaney, whose Delaney
Snowboarding Camps specialize in teaching adults.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing segment of snowboarders is 24- to
40-year-olds, said Delaney, who operates camps at Copper Mountain
in Colorado and Mammoth Mountain in California. His average
customer is 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier on your body,'' said Delaney, a former world
snowboarding champion. ``It's easier to learn. It might not be
easier to stand on Day One, but the learning curve is much
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   He advises potential snowboarders to prepare by stretching their
calves and thighs, the predominant muscles they'll be using. ``You
also should be strengthening, flexing and stretching your triceps
and shoulders and forearms, because you're going to be pushing
yourself up out of the snow a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   His oldest customer to date was 84, Delaney said. ``You know, he
lasted three days, had a great time and said he'd be back, but he
got tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes on the chairlift and I'd forgotten practically
everything I learned in my first hour of snowboarding. At least
that's what I feared as Drayton helped pull me out of the snow,
where I'd landed after hopping ungracefully from the chair.
</P>
<P>
   But there was so much to remember: Bend your knees. Lift your
toes. Lift your heels. Look in the direction you want to go. Hold
your arms out to your sides. Don't stand straight if you start to
fall. Squat. Don't imitate Mark Spitz. And when all else fails,
fall on your elbows, not your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. I have to remember all that while I'm listening to my
body instead of my head?
</P>
<P>
   By now it seemed pretty obvious the rain wasn't going to let up.
I'd already given up on seeing through either my goggles or
sunglasses. But I wasn't about to give up on the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Back to those J-turns. Sliiiiide. Lift the toes. Panic. Flail.
Fall. Sliiide. Lift the toes. Sink. Stop.
</P>
<P>
   Was this all there was to snowboarding? Cool.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, I'd been facing up the mountain, traversing across
it. Drayton decided I should also learn to cross the slope by
facing forward, down the mountain. To do that, I had to lift my
heels, not my toes.
</P>
<P>
   Sliiiiide. Panic. Flail. Fall.
</P>
<P>
   I won't pretend it ever got easy, but every small victory felt
great. By the end of three hours, I had been up the lift twice and
down the First Time run, as well as two others. I had learned those
pesky J-turns on the heel and toe edges, as well as some other
simple techniques: the ``falling leaf,'' some ``garlands'' and even
a couple of basic single turns. Sometimes I did even more than the
teacher asked. Just not on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I managed about as much as a first-timer could be expected to.
What you can accomplish in one half-day lesson depends on your
physical aptitude, fitness and age, Drayton told me. It would take
another lesson, he assured me, for me to be ready to go up the
mountain and down by myself. But nobody knew that better than I
did.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as suddenly as it started, my snowboarding day ended. I
was bushed and ready to hit the hot tub. But my mind was still on
the mountain, and I left Park City with more questions about
snowboarding than I arrived with.
</P>
<P>
   I still don't know whether I'll strap on another snowboard when
I return to the slopes. The truth is I love to ski, and I'm not
sure I want to trade in one sport for another. Fortunately I've
been told again and again that I don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: The exhilaration and the challenge of
snowboarding will be hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting out the 'board
</P>
<P>
   Craig Robinson of Prairie Village knew last March that his
skiing days were over.
</P>
<P>
   He was teaching a group of Boy Scouts to ski at Winter Park in
Colorado when he realized he had become a much better snowboarder
than skier.
</P>
<P>
   After the merit badge course, ``I hooked up with a couple of the
older boys and said, `I know about a fun run in some trees,' ''
Robinson said. ``Ordinarily I wouldn't think twice about going in
the trees because I was going on a snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in there on the skis and essentially knew I was putting
myself in danger because I knew I wasn't as good on a pair of skis
anymore as I was on snowboard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision was a long time coming for Robinson, a Kansas
City Ski Club member who works for Spangler Printers in Kansas
City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started skiing when I was 18 years old, and the first time I
ever got on a snowboard was Thanksgiving of 1990, when I was 40
years old,'' he said. Robinson is now 49.
</P>
<P>
   The first three or four years after that, Robinson said, he
split his time between skiing and snowboarding. ``Then, three or
four seasons ago, I decided, well, my skiing is getting worse.
Let's see if I can maximize the snowboarding. It had hit a point on
the skiing where I had hit a plateau, and I wasn't getting any
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I snowboarded 23 days that season and only skied two days. I
got a whole lot better on the snowboard. I got to the point where I
could go where I normally didn't go on skis ... double-black tree
runs. I just felt more confident, more in control. I was having
more fun doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   He advises beginners to devote three days to snowboarding. ``The
first day is likely to be brutal,'' he said. ``By the third day
most people are able to get on more difficult greens and some
intermediate slopes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He tries not to proselytize about his conversion, but there are
definite advantages, he said, especially for older skiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have comfortable boots and I'm not sore at the end of the
day. Just imagine a powder day. I've gone out with the best skiers
in the Kansas City Ski Club, and we'll take an expert bump run on a
powder day, and I will beat all of them on that run, going from the
top of the mountain to the bottom. I will float down that mountain,
and they'll be working their butts off.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems pretty convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll meet a lot of people who used to ski and now they
snowboard,'' he said, ``but you'll never meet anybody who used to
snowboard and who now skis.''

   GOING SNOWBOARDING
</P>
<P>
   Three-hour group snowboarding or ski lessons at Park City
Mountain Resort run $60 for adults. On the day of my lesson, no
other students showed up in the rain, so I got the full attention
of my instructor. Three-hour private lessons for adults ordinarily
cost $230.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a lesson is in addition to the lift ticket, which
runs $57 for one day at Park City. (Check ski shops in Kansas City
about buying discount tickets before you go.)
</P>
<P>
   One-day snowboard rental at Park City Mountain cost me $30. But
snowboard and ski rental shops operate all over town, including
some at the mountain's base. At Park City Sport, where I rented
skis earlier in the week, one-day snowboard rental costs $26. Call
(435) 645-7777.

&HT;     CRASHES DO LITTLE TO EASE FEAR OF FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an article of faith: Once an airliner safely achieves level
flight, it's not coming down until the pilot's ready to bring it
down.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 25 million Americans who are afraid to fly, merely
climbing onto an airplane involves an act of faith. Some turn to
talismans for comfort. Others indulge in alcohol or headphones.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to air anxiety, cold logic is seldom involved. And
saturation news coverage of aircraft accidents, like the Jan. 31
crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 with 88 people on board, only
add to apprehensions about flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fatalist at heart,'' said Bob Jones, president of Plush
Creations, a stuffed toy manufacturer in San Mateo, Calif. ``I
travel for a living, but this one really struck close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after Flight 261 crashed off the California coast, Jones
and his wife made a pact: no longer will they fly together when
their two young children stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in the fearful flier phenomenon say that proximity
to a plane crash engenders heightened compassion and magnifies
edginess.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nance, a psychologist at Wichita State University, said the
fear of falling is one of the most innate fears of the human
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the passengers were coming back from vacations, which
gives us an image of people who are happy who then had their lives
snuffed out,'' Nance said the of doomed Alaska Airlines flight,
which was bound for San Francisco and Seattle from Mexico. ``Also,
water crashes create more fear because there is a lack of
closure.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of years ago, a similar phenomenon occurred in
Cleveland when a plane nearly crashed into Lake Erie, said William
Scott, chairman of the psychology department at the College of
Wooster in Ohio. The plane pulled up scant yards above water and
landed safely, but the near-crash triggered an acute reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people, not just those aboard or waiting at the airport,
developed severe anxieties about flying,'' said Scott, a clinical
psychologist who for 20 years has treated flight fears. ``It really
shook people up. It becomes something that could have happened to
you rather than someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the fatal journey of Flight 261, which led a
corkscrew path through the sky before it plummeted into the
Pacific, may make it much more difficult to mollify misgivings
about flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 20 years, we have told people a plane can't drop out of
the sky like a stone. We used to say that was near impossible,''
Scott said. ``But some crashes have been in mid-flight when the
planes have gone nearly straight down. We are going to have to deal
with this. We are going to have to change what we teach.''
</P>

<P>
   Plane crashes seem to trigger a vicarious chain reaction,
experts say, with many people conjuring unbidden but ghoulish
images despite the overall safety record of the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question people seem to have in their minds is what it
must have been like aboard Flight 261 once a problem developed,''
said Robert R. Butterworth, a Los Angeles clinical psychologist and
an authority on trauma. ``There is a morbid
</P>
<P>
   fascination with what it would have been like, how they slammed
into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of flying is a phobia that often begins around age 27,
Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequent fliers who could tolerate air travel in the past may
now experience thoughts and fears about crashing popping up in
their heads that they are unable to control,'' he said. ``This
crash will hit the phobic flier hardest. It reminds them that what
they fear most, well, it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One of our strongest instincts is that of survival, ``and
survival in turn rests largely on how much control we have over our
lives,'' said Joseph Tecce, a Boston College psychology professor.
``It is only natural that we fear flying, since we have no control
over the destiny of the plane. The courage to fly requires a
suspension of `reality testing' as well as a faith in the pilots,
mechanics and aircraft to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   That faith and confidence, Tecce said, is aided and abetted by
the laws of probability _ ``the strong unlikelihood that the
aircraft will crash. In addition, we are comforted by statistics
that driving a car is more likely to be fatal than flying a
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cognitive knowledge that air transportation is
considered the second safest mode of public transportation (after
elevators) isn't sufficient to calm some nerves.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Capt. David Linsley, a retired United Airlines
pilot, tries to lessen the mystique of aeronautical operations.
Through Pegasus Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Florida, he
teaches fearful fliers about a plane's mechanics, encouraging them
to learn not just relaxation techniques but even to visit the
cockpit before departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crash like this drives fearful fliers deeper into their
fears for a while,'' Linsley said of the Alaska Airlines accident.
``Statistics have nothing to do with fears. We want people to know
about the flying environment ... and the pilots. It usually helps
to see what's up there.''

&HT;     POOR PUBLICATION HELPS NEEDY LEARN JOB SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EMILY GURNON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The creators of Poor magazine are accustomed to
doing the impossible: putting out a glossy publication with next to
no money, renting an office and stocking it with 10 donated
computers, while simultaneously trying to sidestep the potholes of
poverty in their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they have embarked on another ambitious program: training
low-income people, most with little or no writing or publishing
experience, to be journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core ... is making media accessible to folks who would
otherwise never have that media access,'' said Lisa Gray-Garcia,
29, who edits the magazine with her mother, Dee Gray. ``They'd only
be the subjects of stories, they'd never be the creators of
stories,''.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mother-daughter editing team has launched a new on-line
news service and they are teaching some of the classes in the
journalism training program.
</P>
<P>
   They concede their venture is a difficult one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that anybody with a dream or a vision is going to have
to work very hard to make it happen. In a certain way, you could
say it exceeds our resources, but you could also look at it and
say, look at what we've achieved on nothing,'' Gray-Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't do this, I'd die,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest hurdle is not teaching poor people. It is
convincing those who support the program, notably the Department of
Human Services, which pays for the welfare-to-work program, and the
Private Industry Council, which administers it, to believe the
training can work, Gray-Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real challenge to convince DHS and PIC that we are
a valid training program, because we take longer to train people,''
she said. Agencies are told to keep the training short, generally
under six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's impossible when you're teaching folks things as
complicated as journalism,'' Gray-Garcia said. To make matters
worse, Poor has not yet received any of the approved funds, even
though the program has been running for nearly a year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the rent has gone unpaid, but the program has
continued with help from artists and designers, technicians and
tutors who have volunteered their time or worked for little money,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   What Poor is doing is different from most welfare-to-work
programs, said Paul Boden, executive director of the Coalition on
Homelessness in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In Poor's classes, ``You're not just giving what they call life
skills training to get poor and homeless people to ignore their
life history and get a job at Bank of America,'' Boden said.
``You're empowering people to think for themselves and be creative
and teach the next ones in line.''
</P>
<P>
   The classes are conducted through a collaboration among Poor
magazine, the City College of San Francisco and Media Alliance.
Students learn the mechanics of writing itself: grammar, sentence
structure, and spelling; word processing and desktop publishing;
and different types of writing and reporting, such creative writing
and investigative reporting. Advanced classes include graphic art
and on-line publishing.
</P>
<P>
   After the program is completed, the staff of the magazine help
students put together resumes, prepare for job interviews and look
for work.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the training is ``community newsroom,'' a weekly
meeting in which Poor staff and students discuss the stories they
will tackle in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the Poor program works, observers and
participants said, is that both of its directors understand what
the students want and need.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an amazing ability to reach people,'' said Phil
Clark, interim director of Central City Hospitality House, whose
homeless artists have contributed poems and drawings to Poor
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of the people involved in Poor magazine are
either currently homeless or (had been) previously,'' Clark said.
``They have a deep understanding of the situations that people are
finding themselves in and they're not pejorative. ... They see
people as whole people.''

<P>
   Jeri Engstrand joined the program in the spring of 1999, after a
series of financial setbacks led her and her husband to lose their
jobs and, eventually, the home that they owned. They ended up
living on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those people who swore I would never be on the
dole, no matter how bad it was,'' Engstrand, 46, said. ``I was
raised upper-middle class, real strong work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   But after losing the graphics arts business she owned, shortly
after her husband, a painter, fell from a ladder and hurt his back,
they were reduced to panhandling and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a place to live, if you don't have a phone
number, if you don't have a way to keep clean and if you don't have
a way to keep your clothes clean and presentable ... how the hell
do you get a job?'' she said. ``It has nothing to do with being
lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The years of financial ruin prevented Engstrand from keeping up
on the latest computer technology. She needed some training to hone
her skills, she said. The Poor magazine/Media Alliance classes led
to a job teaching other students at Media Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Poor magazine program does is teaches and assists
people in giving us a voice, a way to express our experiences and
our knowledge,'' Engstrand said.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to homelessness, ``we are the experts,'' she said.
``You can talk to statisticians and human relations people and
various government agencies and all the do-gooders in the world,
but unless you've been there, you don't have a clue. You really
don't.''

<P>
   PRAGUE _ Austria's Central European neighbors, some of which
hope to join the European Union one day, have reacted cautiously to
the inclusion of Joerg Haider's xenophobic Freedom Party in the
Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   While echoing the condemnation of the Austrian developments
heard in the West, these countries also are hesitating to shout too
loudly at a country with which their historical ties are long and
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Central European countries think they are playing it
safe: Don't get Haider mad and keep a low profile,'' said Jiri
Pehe, head of New York University's program in Prague and a former
adviser of President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Havel and President Milan Kucan of Slovenia both roundly
condemned the compromise that has brought rightist extremists to
power in a democratic Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Hungary and Slovakia, both of which were allied with Hitler
during the War, have played down the importance of Haider's
newfound power. The Czech government broke with Havel and also took
a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The EU move to isolate Austria has also fueled the significant
Euroskeptic movement in Central Europe. Populist politicians have
painted an intrusive and bureaucratic Union as a modern version of
the Soviet Union, which occupied the region for close to half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It plays well into the hands of people who describe the EU as
an interventionist organization which does not respect the
sovereignty of its members,'' said Jiri Sedivy, director of the
Institute for International Relations in Prague. ``They say, `Look
what will happen to us in five years' time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Czech Parliament, Vaclav Klaus, said last
week, ``It seems very strange to me that Austrian voters elected
someone, and somebody from outside wants to dictate to them who
will be in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said he was ``surprised''
by the EU move. ``It must be considered whether anybody has the
right to intervene,'' he said, adding that the EU was ``laying out
paths which to some extent run against the will of the Austrian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   His foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, has said that Hungary does
not plan to join EU states in isolating Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   In Slovakia, the deputy foreign minister, Jan Figel, said his
country, which has just joined the EU expansion short list, had to
look after its own interests first. Austria is Slovakia's biggest
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with Austria are fraught with historic overtones.
Austria sees itself as Nazi's Germany's first victim, but
historians generally agree that Austria was a willing ally of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And until World War I broke up the Austro-Hungarian Empire, most
of Austria's neighbors had been its imperial subjects for
centuries. During the Cold War, Austria's neutrality made it one of
the few openings the captive countries of Eastern Europe had to the
free world.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a certain amount of sympathy for Haider's agenda
in Central Europe. Still struggling with their transitions from
communism and central planning to democracy and free markets, many
of the Central European countries have suffered the same problems
that won Haider so many votes in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Six Central European countries hope to join the EU this decade,
but Haider's party has openly called for the EU expansion eastward
to be halted and for tighter controls on immigration from what it
calls ``the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Haider agreed with his coalition partners, the
conservative People's Party, to support the EU's planned expansion
eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Havel, who is hospitalized with the flu, said through a
spokesman that ``what Haider has said conflicts with the principles
on which a unified Europe was built after World War II, as well as
the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights.''

<P>
   PRAGUE _ Austria's Central European neighbors, some of which
hope to join the European Union one day, have reacted cautiously to
the inclusion of Joerg Haider's xenophobic Freedom Party in the
Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   While echoing the condemnation of the Austrian developments
heard in the West, these countries also are hesitating to shout too
loudly at a country with which their historical ties are long and
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Central European countries think they are playing it
safe: Don't get Haider mad and keep a low profile,'' said Jiri
Pehe, head of New York University's program in Prague and a former
adviser of President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Havel and President Milan Kucan of Slovenia both roundly
condemned the compromise that has brought rightist extremists to
power in a democratic Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Hungary and Slovakia, both of which were allied with Hitler
during the War, have played down the importance of Haider's
newfound power. The Czech government broke with Havel and also took
a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The EU move to isolate Austria has also fueled the significant
Euroskeptic movement in Central Europe. Populist politicians have
painted an intrusive and bureaucratic Union as a modern version of
the Soviet Union, which occupied the region for close to half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It plays well into the hands of people who describe the EU as
an interventionist organization which does not respect the
sovereignty of its members,'' said Jiri Sedivy, director of the
Institute for International Relations in Prague. ``They say, `Look
what will happen to us in five years' time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Czech Parliament, Vaclav Klaus, said last
week, ``It seems very strange to me that Austrian voters elected
someone, and somebody from outside wants to dictate to them who
will be in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said he was ``surprised''
by the EU move. ``It must be considered whether anybody has the
right to intervene,'' he said, adding that the EU was ``laying out
paths which to some extent run against the will of the Austrian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   His foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, has said that Hungary does
not plan to join EU states in isolating Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   In Slovakia, the deputy foreign minister, Jan Figel, said his
country, which has just joined the EU expansion short list, had to
look after its own interests first. Austria is Slovakia's biggest
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with Austria are fraught with historic overtones.
Austria sees itself as Nazi's Germany's first victim, but
historians generally agree that Austria was a willing ally of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And until World War I broke up the Austro-Hungarian Empire, most
of Austria's neighbors had been its imperial subjects for
centuries. During the Cold War, Austria's neutrality made it one of
the few openings the captive countries of Eastern Europe had to the
free world.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a certain amount of sympathy for Haider's agenda
in Central Europe. Still struggling with their transitions from
communism and central planning to democracy and free markets, many
of the Central European countries have suffered the same problems
that won Haider so many votes in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Six Central European countries hope to join the EU this decade,
but Haider's party has openly called for the EU expansion eastward
to be halted and for tighter controls on immigration from what it
calls ``the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Haider agreed with his coalition partners, the
conservative People's Party, to support the EU's planned expansion
eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Havel, who is hospitalized with the flu, said through a
spokesman that ``what Haider has said conflicts with the principles
on which a unified Europe was built after World War II, as well as
the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Kucan said Haider's success was ``not a good omen for the future
of Europe'' and ``a danger to Slovenia,'' which had been one of the
victims of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a turning to the wrong pages of history is dangerous for
Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring countries are also worried by Haider's calls for
them to return confiscated property to Austrians who, as citizens
of Hitler's greater German Reich, were expelled at the end of World
War II from what is now Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ There is considerable introspection in Europe these days
regarding the role of countries other than Nazi Germany in abetting
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland recently, a panel of historians produced a
350-page report strongly critical of that country's wartime policy
of turning away Jews attempting to flee Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   And in Stockholm recently, political leaders and experts, most
of them from Europe, gathered to discuss how the bleak lessons
learned from their own racist past could be applied to prevent
similar outbreaks in the present.
</P>
<P>
   The current furor over political developments in Austria
resonates with memories of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are praising the Europeans for their new
willingness to confront a shameful past, when many looked away or
did nothing, but they seem to have forgotten that the United States
itself had a despicable record during that same era.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the charges that have been leveled against the
Swiss and some other European countries over the question of Jewish
refugees and virulent anti-Semitism could have been directed
against the United States, Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nazis were the murderers, but we were the all too passive
accomplices.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds remarkably like Jean-Francois Bergier, the historian
who headed the Swiss panel. But those were in fact the words of an
American historian, David Wyman, a Protestant, who, after years of
the most thorough research, in 1984 produced an extremely
disturbing book, ``The Abandonment of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not talking about Switzerland but about the United States
and its allies, and his findings have not been disputed. There have
been similar books on the subject, documenting chapter and verse.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, little Switzerland accepted as many Jewish
refugees during the war _ 21,000 _ as did the vastly greater United
States. That pitifully small number represented only 10 percent of
the number who could have been legally admitted under U.S.
immigration quotas at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Jews were turned away or dissuaded from
applying for visas by U.S. officials intent on keeping the inflow
to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   We forget how rife anti-Semitism was in the United States and
the other Allied countries during World War II. In the spring of
1942, the sociologist David Riesman described American
anti-Semitism as ``slightly below the boiling point.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that by the summer of 1942, Washington had confirmed
accounts of Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews. But, according
to Wyman: ``The American State Department and the British Foreign
Office had no intention of rescuing large numbers of European Jews.
On the contrary, they continually feared that Germany or other Axis
nations might release tens of thousands of Jews into Allied hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any such exodus would have placed intense pressure on Britain
to open Palestine and on the United States to take in more Jewish
refugees _ a situation the two great powers did not want to face.
Consequently, their policies aimed at obstructing rescue
possibilities and dampening public pressures for government
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, according to Wyman, British Prime Minister Anthony
Eden even opposed a joint plea from the Allies to Germany to
release the Jews because of his fear that Germany might actually
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Strong popular pressure could have made a difference. Why wasn't
it there? Anti-Semitism and anti-immigration attitudes were
widespread in American society and entrenched in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, as Jews were scrambling to escape from
Europe, a Roper poll showed that 70 to 85 percent of the American
people opposed raising quotas to help Jewish refugees enter the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even more shocking, another set of polls taken in the years
between 1938 and 1945 revealed that as much as 35 to 40 percent of
the U.S. population was prepared to approve an anti-Jewish campaign
in America. Only 30 percent would have opposed it, and the rest
would have remained indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the failure of the mass media _ including
newspapers like the New York Times _ to publicize Holocaust news,
even though the wire services and other sources made most of the
information available early on.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that were the near silence of the Christian churches
and most of their leaders and the indifference of American
political and intellectual nabobs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest American journalists, Walter Lippmann, for
instance, wrote not a single column about the Holocaust or the
death camps.
</P>
<P>
   As for President Franklin Roosevelt, according to Wyman, he did
nothing about the mass murder for 14 months after first learning
about it. And then he ``moved only because he was confronted with
political pressures he could not avoid and because his
administration stood on the brink of a nasty scandal over its
rescue policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Even most of America's Jewish leaders at the time were remiss,
caught up in internal bickering, concerned about provoking
anti-Semitism, more worried about establishing the state of Israel
than saving Jews from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a chapter of American history that Americans have
done their best to bury and forget. They have been very successful.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough to encourage the Germans, the Swiss and others
to deal with their past. The United States should start delving
into its own. &QL;

   NATO breached international law in its air attacks on Yugoslavia
last year, a respected human-rights body says in a report issued

</P>
<P>
   Austria's head of state has been accused of overstepping his
authority by trying to thwart Joerg Haider's rise to power. Just
over 100 years ago, another head of state did resort to dictatorial
powers to keep a democratically elected demagogue out of office.
But new elections merely augmented the politician's support, and
eventually the state had to yield to the new force _ with tragic
consequences for mankind.

I hate the inevitable problems that go with it. I am also a bit of
a Luddite when it comes to buying them. Why is it that computers
have that irritating ability to evolve to a more advanced stage the
second after you spend your life savings on one?

   2000 SATURN LS1: It's taken Saturn nearly 10 years to move up to
selling midsize sedans. That it was not a step taken lightly can be
seen, felt and heard in the 2000 LS1. The LS1 is, for the most

   Austria's head of state has been accused of overstepping his
authority by trying to thwart Joerg Haider's rise to power. Just
over 100 years ago, another head of state did resort to dictatorial
powers to keep a democratically elected demagogue out of office.
But new elections merely augmented the politician's support, and
eventually the state had to yield to the new force _ with tragic
consequences for mankind.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO breached international law in its air attacks
on Yugoslavia last year, a respected human-rights body says in a
report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Human Rights Watch, is particularly critical of
the use of cluster bombs. The United States stopped using the
munitions halfway through the war, but Britain continued using
them, raising serious issues about the British government's concern
for civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO killed at least 500 civilians during the Kosovo conflict,
the report concludes after visits to the sites of many of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Rights Watch has found no evidence of war crimes,'' it
says. But, it adds, ``the investigation did conclude that NATO
violated international humanitarian law.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says that NATO may have breached the Geneva
Convention in five areas: it conducted air attacks using cluster
bombs near populated areas; attacked targets of questionable
military legitimacy; did not take adequate measures to warn
civilians of strikes; took insufficient precautions to identify the
presence of civilians when attacking mobile targets; and caused
excessive civilian casualties by not taking sufficient measures to
verify that targets did not have concentrations of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attacks resulted from missing military targets. But
``nine incidents were a result of strikes on nonmilitary targets
that Human Rights Watch believes were illegitimate,'' including
Serb Radio and Television in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At least one-fifth of those who died were killed by cluster
bombs, which spray bomblets over a wide area. ``Overall,
cluster-bomb use by the United States and Britain can be confirmed
in seven incidents throughout Yugoslavia (another five are possible
but unconfirmed),'' the report says. ``Some 90 to 150 civilians
died from the use of these weapons.''

hitherto secret presidential order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Widespread reports of civilian casualties from the use of
cluster-bombs and international criticism of these weapons as
potentially indiscriminate, in effect, led... to an unprecedented
U.S. executive order in the middle of May to cease their further
use in the conflict,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House issued the order only days after civilians
were killed by NATO cluster bombs in the city of Nis on May 7.''
But Britain, according to the RAF's own reports, continued to use
the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cluster bombs should not have been used in attacks in
populated areas, let alone urban targets, given the risks,'' it
says. ``Nevertheless, the (RAF) continued to drop cluster bombs,
indicating the need for universal, not national, norms regarding
cluster-bomb use.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says there is ``some evidence'' Yugoslav forces
used civilians as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   The body calls on NATO to ``establish an independent and

targeting and bombing doctrine to ensure compliance with
international humanitarian law.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO breached international law in its air attacks
on Yugoslavia last year, a respected human-rights body says in a
report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Human Rights Watch, is particularly critical of
the use of cluster bombs. The United States stopped using the
munitions halfway through the war, but Britain continued using
them, raising serious issues about the British government's concern
for civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO killed at least 500 civilians during the Kosovo conflict,
the report concludes after visits to the sites of many of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Rights Watch has found no evidence of war crimes,'' it
says. But, it adds, ``the investigation did conclude that NATO
violated international humanitarian law.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says that NATO may have breached the Geneva
Convention in five areas: it conducted air attacks using cluster
bombs near populated areas; attacked targets of questionable
military legitimacy; did not take adequate measures to warn
civilians of strikes; took insufficient precautions to identify the
presence of civilians when attacking mobile targets; and caused
excessive civilian casualties by not taking sufficient measures to
verify that targets did not have concentrations of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attacks resulted from missing military targets. But
``nine incidents were a result of strikes on nonmilitary targets
that Human Rights Watch believes were illegitimate,'' including
Serb Radio and Television in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At least one-fifth of those who died were killed by cluster
bombs, which spray bomblets over a wide area. ``Overall,
cluster-bomb use by the United States and Britain can be confirmed
in seven incidents throughout Yugoslavia (another five are possible
but unconfirmed),'' the report says. ``Some 90 to 150 civilians
died from the use of these weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   It reveals the United States stopped using the weapons after a
hitherto secret presidential order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Widespread reports of civilian casualties from the use of
cluster-bombs and international criticism of these weapons as

U.S. executive order in the middle of May to cease their further

<P>
   DOVER, DEL. _ A newly ``retooled'' George W. Bush _ the term was
used by his campaign _ flew into the small East Coast state of
Delaware Monday, intent on finishing off his pesky challenger,
Steve Forbes, and simultaneously banishing the memory of his
chastening defeat in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidential bid appearing suddenly vulnerable and less
than two weeks to go before the key primary in South Carolina, Bush
is having to treat Tuesday's Delaware primary as a serious test.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware may be small _ it has only 750,000 inhabitants and
elects only one member of the U.S. House of Representatives _ but
as the first state to ratify the Constitution, it enjoys a certain
cachet.
</P>
<P>
   It also has two highly experienced senators and wields
disproportionate legislative clout, thanks to its relative wealth
and its prowess in banking and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Its liberal tax laws have attracted many corporations to site
their headquarters here, among them some of Bush's most generous
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is one reason why he is campaigning here in person: among
supporters in the miniature state capital, Dover; among servicemen
at the nearby Air Force Base (one of the major shipping points for
aid to Kosovo last year); and among big corporate sponsors in the
state's business powerhouse, the city of Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the billionaire publisher, Steve Forbes, whose
own base lies just to the north, in the state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Forbes may not look the greatest threat to Bush's
presidential prospects. That honor currently goes to Senator John
McCain, who trounced him by 18 points in New Hampshire and has
drawn level in opinion polls in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the big money of either a Bush or a Forbes, however,
McCain has picked his contests carefully, choosing to disregard
Delaware, as he did the Iowa caucuses two weeks ago. He is applying
all his effort to South Carolina, and the primary shortly
thereafter in the northerly state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In his newly aggressive campaign mode, Bush scorned his rival's
tactics. McCain's absence, though, leaves him in a straight fight
with Forbes _ who actually won the Delaware primary four years ago,
beating the party favorite, Robert Dole, into second place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dole had chosen, like McCain this year, not to campaign
in Delaware, but the notion persists that Delaware is Forbes's sort
of state, and he has campaigned here as though that were so.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, election day, he will have spent four full days
here, breaking only last Friday to speak at a state party gathering
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Often an awkward campaigner, Forbes has nonetheless gone from
town hall to town hall, spreading his message of tax reform and
presenting himself in the guise of ``independent outsider'' that
has proved so successful for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of Dover, in the small town of Smyrna _ a town whose
commercial heart has been comprehensively killed by the nearby
shopping center _ Forbes found a typical standing-room-only crowd
of around 200 waiting for him in the fire station hall.
</P>
<P>
   They were small business people and pensioners mostly, none of
them wealthy, and not all of them loyal. The name John McCain was
on many lips, even though he had not deigned to campaign in their
state.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush appeared to be widely disliked, except by the dozen
or so young pickets who stood on the pavement outside with large
Bush placards.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has some good lines. He compares the length of the
Gettysburg Address, the Declaration of Independence and even the
Bible with the 7 million plus words of the U.S. tax code.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that redundant taxmen could usefully be redeployed
shovelling away some of the snow piled up beside Delaware's roads.
</P>
<P>
   And to all those in Washington who say we cannot scrap the tax
code? ``Well, hello guys! Whose country is this?''
</P>
<P>
   In the televised Republican debates, it was clear that there is
little love lost between the stolid Forbes and the smooth George W.
And rumors abound that the Republican Party has urged Forbes to end
his bid so that Bush can take on McCain without lesser
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush needs is another poor primary showing. But
Forbes has the money (his own) to fight on, and he might not be
averse to diluting Bush's effort.
</P>
<P>
   At least as of Monday, the Forbes camp was adamant: ``We are in
this to the end.'' &QL;

Forbes has the money (his own) to fight on, and he might not be
averse to diluting Bush's effort.
</P>
<P>
   At least as of Monday, the Forbes camp was adamant: ``We are in
this to the end.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The tightening of the Republican race this week
following John McCain's spectacular victory in the New Hampshire
primary plunged into the spotlight two women who had hitherto done
their best to remain in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, wife of George W. for the past 22 years, and Cindy
McCain, married to John for almost 20 years, were both at their
husband's side in the last days of campaigning and again at their
post-campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush, unaccustomed to hearing her husband concede defeat,
stood stoically beside him at the microphone, with their
17-year-old twins _ the very picture of blonde, cheerleading young
womanhood - behind.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher and librarian before she met and married George W.,
Mrs. Bush, 53, has done the traditional thing as first lady of
Texas, devoting herself to good works _ children's literacy above
all _ and what Americans call ``homemaking'' (being a housewife).
</P>
<P>
   Dressed most often in trousers and cardigan, she exudes an air
of capable common sense and wifely loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Present or absent, she always features at the start of her
husband's standard stump speech: Marrying Laura, he says, was the
best decision he ever made, then he habitually draws a laugh by
adding ``though it may not be the best decision she ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   He also claims that a pre-marriage pledge to her that she would
not have to make speeches is the ``only promise I have ever
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mrs. Bush has made relatively few solo appearances on
her husband's behalf and sometimes seems sullen when traipsing
after him in public.
</P>
<P>
   She gave a rare glimpse of relaxed domesticity last week when
she watched her husband reveal himself as a dab hand with a spatula
during a pancake-tossing contest.
</P>
<P>
   Absent or demurely submissive during campaigning, Mrs. Bush is
quite capable of speaking for herself. But when she does, she
wisely keeps to homely subjects, as she did in a pre-Christmas
television interview, where she appeared jointly with her
formidable mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, beside the family Christmas
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking extempore, she comes across as surprisingly strident
and broadly Texan, suggesting another side to her that could be a
liability to her husband when the campaign trail goes fully
national.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Hensley, 45, became John McCain's second wife in 1980,
several years after he divorced his first wife _ a divorce for
which he takes abject responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing utterly terrified by the razzmatazz and the
crowds at the start of his presidential campaigning, she has
recently relaxed a little and frequently appears solo, deputizing
for her husband when Senate duties keep him from fulfilling
campaign engagements.
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 years as a congressman and senator, she has hardly
come to Washington at all, staying with their family in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter of a wealthy Arizona family and _ like Laura Bush _ a
teacher by training, Mrs. McCain founded a children's medical
charity in 1988 that works in war zones and regularly travels with
its missions, most recently to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, she started a second children's charity that
works in Arizona and neighboring states. The McCains have four
children, and one adopted _ a child she brought back from one of
her charity trips to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   She tells how, when she arrived at the airport, he was there to
meet her and asked where the child would stay. ``With us,'' she
replied, to which he responded: ``I thought so,'' _ just like that.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain, who is strikingly good-looking and always
impeccably dressed and coiffed in a suburban American way, brought
a skeleton out of her closet early by admitting last spring that
she had been addicted to painkillers, even to the point of stealing
the drugs from shipments intended for her charity.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, for his part, went on the record to regret that he
had been perhaps ``wrapped up too much in Washington and my
ambitions'' to notice her problem until a very late stage. The
sting thus drawn, reporters have left the subject alone. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ A prominent Austrian journalist who is fiercely
critical of the country's far-right leader Joerg Haider has become
one of the first victims of the new political realities sweeping
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Marschall 47, a journalist at the leading independent
regional paper Oberosterreichische Nachrichten, was given his
notice on Friday, the day that the new Austrian government was
sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   He told The Independent that the editor and the paper's owner
said that ``my commentaries and style were not liked'' and ``due to
the new political situation I could no longer be afforded.''
</P>
<P>
   The editor Hans Koppl said that there had been 500 subscription
cancellations and ``massive expressions of displeasure'' with
Marschall's columns. ``A paper lives from its readers and their
satisfaction. Marschall's style was insulting for many of them...
Something has to be done about it. I admit that it doesn't look
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   SOS-Mitmensch, the Austrian human rights group that organized
the first demonstrations against the new government, called
Marschall's case ``the first breach of the preamble to the
government's program.''
</P>
<P>
   The preamble was the declaration that the new government would
respect human rights, which President Thomas Klestil forced Jorg
Haider and Wolfgang Schussel to sign before they were sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   SOS-Mitmensch called for Marschall's reinstatement, saying ``the
freedom of press and freedom of expression is a human right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the demonstrations in the capital grew placid and
were petering out Sunday. Austrians have accepted that a government
including Haider's Freedom Party is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first consequences of the country's pariah status
are making themselves felt. An international congress of orthodox
rabbis, planned to take place in March in Vienna, will now be held
in the Slovak capital Bratislava instead.
</P>
<P>
   The famous Opera Ball, the highlight of the social season, has
also been dealt a crippling blow. This was the year when it went in
search of its old-world charm and ditched the fading Hollywood
stars, usually paid handsomely to grace the event.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the international favor, Portugal's President Jorge
Sampaio was to be guest of honor on March 2. But he has cancelled _
EU state visits are off.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a foretaste of things to come, as Austrians
themselves realize. A poll in Sunday's Format magazine finds that
two thirds of Austrians expect their country's economy to be
damaged by the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for Austria's sudden image problem is not
helping. Trying to be conciliatory Sunday, Haider promised in the
same breath to compensate Holocaust survivors, Sudeten Germans and
Austrian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite everything he has said and been forced to retract, he
still seems to think that Jews and Austrian soldiers in the
Wehrmacht were victims of equal rank.
</P>
<P>
   And he is still playing his divisive politics, looking for
scapegoats. His latest targets are the outgoing Social Democrat
Chancellor, Viktor Klima and President Klestil, whom he accused of
organizing the EU sanctions in an attempt to keep his party out of
power.
</P>
<P>
   He threatened them with parliamentary inquiry for ``political
high treason,'' Sunday if evidence emerged that either had
orchestrated the EU campaign to stop his party from entering
power. &QL;

<P>
   VIENNA _ A prominent Austrian journalist who is fiercely
critical of the country's far-right leader Joerg Haider has become
one of the first victims of the new political realities sweeping
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Marschall 47, a journalist at the leading independent
regional paper Oberosterreichische Nachrichten, was given his
notice on Friday, the day that the new Austrian government was
sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   He told The Independent that the editor and the paper's owner
said that ``my commentaries and style were not liked'' and ``due to
the new political situation I could no longer be afforded.''
</P>
<P>
   The editor Hans Koppl said that there had been 500 subscription
cancellations and ``massive expressions of displeasure'' with
Marschall's columns. ``A paper lives from its readers and their
satisfaction. Marschall's style was insulting for many of them...
Something has to be done about it. I admit that it doesn't look
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   SOS-Mitmensch, the Austrian human rights group that organized
the first demonstrations against the new government, called
Marschall's case ``the first breach of the preamble to the
government's program.''
</P>
<P>
   The preamble was the declaration that the new government would
respect human rights, which President Thomas Klestil forced Jorg
Haider and Wolfgang Schussel to sign before they were sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   SOS-Mitmensch called for Marschall's reinstatement, saying ``the
freedom of press and freedom of expression is a human right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the demonstrations in the capital grew placid and
were petering out Sunday. Austrians have accepted that a government
including Haider's Freedom Party is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first consequences of the country's pariah status
are making themselves felt. An international congress of orthodox
rabbis, planned to take place in March in Vienna, will now be held
in the Slovak capital Bratislava instead.
</P>
<P>
   The famous Opera Ball, the highlight of the social season, has
also been dealt a crippling blow. This was the year when it went in
search of its old-world charm and ditched the fading Hollywood
stars, usually paid handsomely to grace the event.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the international favor, Portugal's President Jorge
Sampaio was to be guest of honor on March 2. But he has cancelled _
EU state visits are off.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a foretaste of things to come, as Austrians
themselves realize. A poll in Sunday's Format magazine finds that
two thirds of Austrians expect their country's economy to be
damaged by the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for Austria's sudden image problem is not
helping. Trying to be conciliatory Sunday, Haider promised in the
same breath to compensate Holocaust survivors, Sudeten Germans and
Austrian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite everything he has said and been forced to retract, he
still seems to think that Jews and Austrian soldiers in the
Wehrmacht were victims of equal rank.
</P>
<P>
   And he is still playing his divisive politics, looking for
scapegoats. His latest targets are the outgoing Social Democrat
Chancellor, Viktor Klima and President Klestil, whom he accused of
organizing the EU sanctions in an attempt to keep his party out of
power.
</P>
<P>
   He threatened them with parliamentary inquiry for ``political
high treason,'' Sunday if evidence emerged that either had
orchestrated the EU campaign to stop his party from entering
power. &QL;

   VIENNA _ Austria's head of state has been accused of
overstepping his authority by trying to thwart Joerg Haider's rise
to power.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, President Thomas Klestil should have long ago asked
the second biggest party _ Haider's _ to form a government when it
became clear that the marriage between the Social Democrats and the
conservative People's Party was on the rocks. Or, failing that, he
should have called new elections.
</P>
<P>
   President Klestil did neither, and for sound historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 100 years ago, another head of state did resort to
dictatorial powers to keep a democratically elected demagogue out
of office. But new elections merely augmented the politician's
support, and eventually the state had to yield to the new force,
with tragic consequences for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels with today's developments are uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1895. In the twilight of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, a man named Karl Lueger was campaigning for the post of
Vienna Mayor. Lueger, son of a janitor, had started off as a
liberal, but made little headway. Then he discovered that preaching
hatred against Jews got you a lot more votes than advocating free
trade, and his future was made.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Franz Joseph, hardly a liberal himself, was disgusted.
``Anti-Semitism is a disease that has spread to the highest
circles, and the agitation is unbelievable,'' the Kaiser wrote to
his wife Sissi.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Joseph instructed his government to dissolve any gathering
of anti-Semites. Lueger won the Vienna elections in June 1895, but
fell short of an outright majority. That came three months later in
a re-run.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser was faced with a dilemma. He was terrified of
Lueger's populism but keeping Lueger out would only boost his
support.
</P>
<P>
   After much imperial dithering, Franz Joseph vetoed Lueger,
dissolved the council and replaced it with an imperial commission.
The people of Vienna rose as one, and were prevented from storming
the Hofburg only by a bloody intervention of the police.
</P>
<P>
   New elections were held in April the following year, giving
Lueger an increased majority. The Kaiser began to yield, allowing a
Lueger ally named Joseph Strobach to take office. A year later, in
April 1897, Lueger triumphed in elections for the fourth time, and
Franz Joseph no longer had the strength to say no.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Lueger was to run Vienna for the ensuing 13 years. There
was no outright persecution of Jews during his reign, only petty
harassments.
</P>
<P>
   He had made anti-Semitism respectable, and created an
intellectual climate in which hatred of foreigners was becoming the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   One individual deeply influenced by his formative years in
Luegner's Vienna was a young dilettante painter who had washed up
impoverished on the city's streets. His name was Adolf Hitler. &QL;

   VUKOVAR _ They voted amidst the rubble of Vukovar Monday,
choosing a new Croatian president to lead them out of the ruins of
war that reduced this once picturesque Danube city to a pile of
shell-scarred wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The second round of the presidential election is a run-off
between Stipe Mesic, a former president of Federal Yugoslavia, and
his center-left political ally, Drazen Budisa, of the Social
Liberal party, which is currently in coalition government with the
Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning stopped on Saturday afternoon but late-night opinion
polls put Budisa slightly ahead of Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is more one of style than substance, with the
dry, uncharismatic former librarian Budisa versus the folksy,
joke-cracking Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates emphasize their commitment to bringing Croatia
out of the international isolation into which it fell during the
Tudjman era, and accelerating as rapidly as possible Croatia's
entry into both NATO and the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Among the younger generation Budisa was seen as offering hope
for a new era in Europe, while Mesic was too redolent of the old
system, having had a long political career in the former
Yugoslavia, as well as independent Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vote for Budisa, because he offers young people hope
for a better future, with a Croatia that is going towards Europe.
He is a new style of politician, but Mesic is from the old school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budisa's program is better, because he will bring jobs for
young people and orientate us towards the west,'' said Ognjen
Plavsic, 25, a student.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever is Croatia's next president, little will change for
this war-ravaged city in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The scars of war are everywhere. The bumpy roads leading into
Vukovar are pockmarked with shrapnel marks and potholed by incoming
shellfire.
</P>
<P>
   Once picturesque pink and yellow Hapsburg era buildings have
collapsed inwards, beams and shattered walls piled on top of each
other, while grass and moss grows on top.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ghost town. Only the battered facades with the
remnants of the once ornate plasterwork on these 19th-century
buildings bear silent witness to the memory of another Vukovar that
was a jewel on the Danube, where Serbs, Croats and Hungarians lived
together in peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Pounded for months by Serb guns during the Croatian war of
independence in 1991, Vukovar became known as Croatia's Stalingrad
for its steadfast resistance against the Yugoslav army and their
paramilitary allies.
</P>
<P>
   When the city fell in the winter of that year, many of the
surviving inhabitants were murdered en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Others accused the former President Franjo Tudjman of
sacrificing the city to create a rallying point for his nascent
nation. Either way the city remains neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Vukovar, who note that Serbs now outnumber the city's
Croat population by more than 2-1, suggest the situation could be
even more complicated. Of the city's original population of 84,000,
only 18,000 have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of investment in areas of return is part of a
continuation of ethnic cleansing,'' said local Serb leader Milorad
Pupovac. ``Some people believe it is better to have a ghost city or
town than when they are ethnically mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   The new geography of the Balkans also hurts the city. While
Vukovar was centrally located in former Yugoslavia, it is now
situated close to Serbia, an international pariah state.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovar's prime location on the Danube is also of little use
because wreckage from allied attacks on Serbia during the 78-day
NATO bombardment over Kosovo has blocked virtually all river
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1991, a few days after Vukovar fell to Serb
forces, the dull thud of nearby shellfire still echoed across the
heaps of blackened rubble. The scene resembled present-day Grozny.
The streets were filled with Yugoslav soldiers and Serb
paramilitaries, pumped up on the adrenaline of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vukovar has returned to Croatia, and many wonder why so many
lives were ended and to what end. The city has begun to reawaken:
there is a market, shops and bars are open. But an almost tangible
bitterness runs through its once pretty streets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some have returned to try and rebuild their lives in the
wreckage of their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible at first when we came back to see the
destruction, especially when it is your hometown, although we had
an idea what to expect from the television pictures,'' said
beautician Darija Matkovic, 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not voting because although the situation is bad in
Croatia, whoever wins it will be better in the future.'' &QL;

Croat population by more than 2-1, suggest the situation could be
even more complicated. Of the city's original population of 84,000,
only 18,000 have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of investment in areas of return is part of a
continuation of ethnic cleansing,'' said local Serb leader Milorad
Pupovac. ``Some people believe it is better to have a ghost city or
town than when they are ethnically mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   The new geography of the Balkans also hurts the city. While
Vukovar was centrally located in former Yugoslavia, it is now
situated close to Serbia, an international pariah state.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovar's prime location on the Danube is also of little use
because wreckage from allied attacks on Serbia during the 78-day
NATO bombardment over Kosovo has blocked virtually all river
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1991, a few days after Vukovar fell to Serb
forces, the dull thud of nearby shellfire still echoed across the
heaps of blackened rubble. The scene resembled present-day Grozny.
The streets were filled with Yugoslav soldiers and Serb
paramilitaries, pumped up on the adrenaline of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vukovar has returned to Croatia, and many wonder why so many
lives were ended and to what end. The city has begun to reawaken:
there is a market, shops and bars are open. But an almost tangible
bitterness runs through its once pretty streets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some have returned to try and rebuild their lives in the
wreckage of their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible at first when we came back to see the
destruction, especially when it is your hometown, although we had
an idea what to expect from the television pictures,'' said
beautician Darija Matkovic, 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not voting because although the situation is bad in
Croatia, whoever wins it will be better in the future.'' &QL;

&HT;     SMALL RADIO STATION GOES GLOBAL WITH ECLECTIC WEB SOUNDS

<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ A peek into the lobby of KFAN-FM, where
ancient sound-mixing boards, bulky chrome microphones and other
relics of radio's Golden Age are displayed, makes this look like
any other small-town Texas music station.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, the station is playing commercials for
hometown merchants, Texas State Network newscasts, and, on a recent
weekend, live updates from a junior livestock show.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Combine small-town radio, the World Wide Web and eclectic
musical programming, and the result is KFAN-FM 107.9, a
trailblazing station that in its brief history has helped launch
two new radio formats.
</P>
<P>
   These are the heady days of new media, where radio stations _ an
early worldwide web of information and entertainment _ are hooking
up to the Internet, delivering music to computers all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   According to the initial ratings of these so-called Webcasts by
the Arbitron rating service in New York, KFAN's on-line alter ego,
www.texasrebelradio.com, had 90,000 listeners in October, the
inaugural month of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   That beat out the nearly 2,000 other stations on the Web,
perhaps because of its music.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fritz, who co-owns the station with his wife, Jan, described
the station's repertoire as a combination of the Americana and
Adult Album Alternative sounds, genre-bending formats that appeal
to a more educated, more music-savvy listener.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners landing on KFAN's Web radio site are exposed to a
scattershot of rock, blues, jazz, country, zydeco and folk. An hour
of music might include Merle Haggard, Melissa Etheridge, Lynyrd
Skynyrd, B.B. King and Br5-49.
</P>
<P>
   Plus those live updates from junior livestock shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the joy of the Web,'' said Jhan Hiber, ratings and
research editor for the San Francisco-based Gavin Report, a radio
industry publication. ``You'll hear a grocery store commercial,
then a song.''
</P>
<P>
   The lofty position atop the Web heap isn't that unusual, given
KFAN's brief history, said Jan Fritz, nor is it surprising or
accidental.
</P>
<P>
   She notes the station got a Web site in 1994, just before the
Internet surged in popularity and years ahead of other stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our plan from the beginning to be big on the Internet,
because we felt we had a product that would have international
appeal,'' she said. ``We chose to position our radio station in
Fredericksburg, knowing that the Texas music mystique and the Hill
Country mystique would work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fritz family has been in broadcasting here for nearly 50
years. Jay Fritz's parents bought the local AM station in 1953. His
mom was an on-air personality and program director in the days when
women didn't do those jobs. She was on the air when she went into
labor, went to the hospital, then did a taped interview about the
birth from her hospital room to announce Jay's birth.
</P>
<P>
   He got his start working at the station in high school, as did
program director J.D. Rose, who began as a gofer and parlayed that
into an after-school, on-air job while still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Rose and the Fritzes are the brains behind the station's format,
which didn't do well when first tried on KONO-FM in San Antonio,
but has soared since they bought KFAN in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fritz said he was in his pickup truck, driving on the family
ranch, and became frustrated as he roamed his radio dials looking
for music he liked _ some old-fashioned country, some Southern
rock, some blues.
</P>
<P>
   Other stations were toying with the same mix in the early '90s,
said Jessie Scott, Gavin's Americana editor. But KFAN is considered
one of the pioneers of the Americana format.
</P>
<P>
   KFAN's format is a musical smorgasbord where the formula is
simple _ there is none.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't generate a play list for our station,'' Rose said.
Instead, a song's tempo, artist or age simply dictates a category.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our jocks have to be thinkers,'' Jan Fritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the station's location near Austin, it gets heard by an
influential community of musicians and music industry
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the station is popular because it is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of things that federal deregulation of the airways has
caused has been the homogenization of the airwaves,'' she said,
adding that corporations rely on audience-tested music to program a
station. And when that works in a market, it's cloned all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the history of radio, the maverick has always
ascended,'' she said. ``The reality is that radio that's done for
the art of it _ reflecting the community it's in, reflecting a
station's personality _ are the ones being sought out on the Web.
With radio now such a wasteland, the Internet has assumed the rebel
position that FM radio had in the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a magic to that,'' she said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for KFAN's popularity on the Web, Hiber said the top three
stations in the Arbitron listings are Americana stations.
</P>
<P>
   The KFAN Web site contains a guest book for listeners to post
thoughts about the station and its music. The comments indicate the
listeners are Texas expatriates pining for chicken-fried music,
wayward surfers in search of something new or, more likely, part of
a worldwide cult addicted to the eclectic mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love your sound and the `different' music,'' wrote a listener
from Portage, Mich. ``I will be a steady listener _ you have
converted me. Very refreshing!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great station! Nothing like this in good old blighty!'' wrote
another fan from Grimsby, England.

   THE HAGUE _ Hans Brinker must be turning in his grave. For the
Dutch are beginning to turn their backs on the celebrated little
boy who saved their forefathers by sticking his finger in a dike.
</P>
<P>
   The government is drawing up plans deliberately to break some of
the country's famous sea defenses to let water on to the land. It
should be ready to implement the scheme _ which strikes deep into
the national psyche _ later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the plan is to save the most densely populated parts
of the country from the rising waters by sacrificing relatively
unimportant farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Amid huge controversy, the government is locked in delicate
negotiations with local authorities about which areas should be
surrendered to the flood.
</P>
<P>
   When these are complete specially selected areas will be set
aside to be inundated when the waters rise and new housing will be
banned on vulnerable land.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management
told the Independent on Sunday that the question was not whether
the plan would be implemented but how.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand years ago all of what is now the Netherlands was
above sea level. But now half of the country and most of its people
would be drowned if its flood barriers were all to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The land has long been sinking as the Dutch have pumped out
underground reservoirs, lowering the water table and digging it up
for peat. Meanwhile the seas are rising faster than ever, as a
result of global warning, and wetter weather is increasingly
filling rivers to bursting point.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now the Dutch have responded by building ever higher
dikes. But they have had some narrow escapes all the same. In 1995
250,000 people had to leave their homes, in the biggest evacuation
since the Second World War, when rivers almost burst their banks.
</P>
<P>
   And 1998 was the wettest year on record, bringing another
desperately close call.
</P>
<P>
   This year the country will complete a $1.6 billion crash program
of strengthening 465 miles of dikes but a report by four government
ministries has concluded that this process will not work in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature does not let itself so easily be shackled,'' the report
says. ``There is a growing realization that this approach is
subject to a law of diminishing returns. Procrastination is no
longer an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have painted ourselves into a corner; the cost of
water management just keeps rising and flooding is expected to
become more common. We will have to decide where the high cost of
intensive water management can be justified and where not. The
longer we delay the harder the choices will become.''
</P>
<P>
   And Monique de Vries, the secretary of state for water policy,
told a symposium last year: ``Despite all our work, it remains
difficult to keep our heads above water. We must reserve space now
for extreme conditions. It is a calculated sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Henk Zomerdijk, mayor of the villages of Echteld and Ochten in
the central Netherlands which narrowly escaped disaster in 1985,
adds: ``We just can't go on endlessly building dikes higher and
higher. The higher they are the more danger there is if they
break.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to computers, I must admit I have a love-hate
relationship. I love the things they pretend to be able to do, but
I hate the inevitable problems that go with it. I am also a bit of
a Luddite when it comes to buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have that irritating ability to evolve to a more
advanced stage the second after you spend your life savings on one.
In fact, I am so put off by knowing that whatever I buy will be
out-of-date by the time you get it unwrapped that it seems useless
replacing the one you have.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. My present computer is a wonderful little Compaq
laptop I won as a prize some seven years ago. In computer terms, it
is about as advanced as a cretaceous dinosaur, running on a 386
chip with Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen.
</P>
<P>
   It is so ancient that whenever my Internet service provider asks
me what I am running their software on, I immediately change the
topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If only computers would stop evolving, then everything would be
fine. I would be perfectly happy with my miserable little screen (a
veritable Imax compared with the one that came with my previous
computer _ a steam-age ``portable'' Osbourne, which was about as
portable as a suitcase full of bricks).
</P>
<P>
   I would be perfectly happy with my limited ability to send
e-mail and surf the Web if only I wasn't made constantly aware of
just how antediluvian it has become.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I would be eternally satisfied with a bit of
word-processing, communications and limited surfing. But along
comes the Pentium chip, color screens, CD-Roms, DVDs, Windows 95
and 98 and other evolving life-forms in the computer kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, my neat little Compaq is an embarrassment, something
which should be confined to an attic room like a mentally deficient
relative.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came when my machine was hit by the millennium
bug. The date flipped to January 1980. The time had come, I
thought, to accept the onslaught of the 21st century and to find
myself a new laptop, or rather notebook as they now seem to be
called.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt that it had to be a notebook. A desktop
PC is just too static. For me, moving around the house to write and
think is just as important as being able to move a computer between
office and work.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the sad pages of the computer press made me realize
just how difficult that decision was going to be. The variety of
choice is stupendous. Of course there are the usual names, IBM,
Compaq, Toshiba and the Macs, but which one should I go for?
</P>
<P>
   My eye settled lazily on a magazine review of a selection of
notebooks running at a speed of 400Mhz with a Pentium II. It was
billed as about the fastest around but with an ominous warning that
something even faster _ a mobile Pentium III for notebooks _ was
already in production.
</P>
<P>
   Should I wait a few more months, I thought? (No need, they are
now on sale.) I recognized few of the manufacturers being reviewed,
with names such as Elonex, Aci, and Rock, but find myself attracted
to the winning machine, the Hi-Grade UltiNote.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine it fulfills most of the requirements
you can expect of a notebook in its price range. ``Sleek, slim and
silver,'' it says, ``Hi-grade's UltiNote is undoubtedly the most
portable of the notebooks we looked at, and arguably one of the
most attractive.'' It is also one of the most solid, apparently
discerned by the lack of ``flexing'' in the space between keyboard
and screen.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot tell a lie: a trial run on the UltiNote puts my Compaq
to shame. The screen is large and clear. It is also very fast.
Surfing is like a powerboat ride compared with a slow row around
the duck pond on my old laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is slim and lightweight, with an interchangeable
slot for either a floppy disc drive, CD-Rom or DVD drive. But an
extra box no bigger than a video with two other drives can be used
for expansion, without adding to the weight or size of the machine
itself. And its silver casing makes it perfectly presentable for
any public performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a nagging doubt in my mind that my new machine
might somehow become as redundant as a Yorkshire coal miner. A
little voice is telling me to wait another six months or year, when
a faster, more capacious machine will come on to the market for the
same price.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the thorny issue of who are Hi-Grade Computers
anyway? Before opening this magazine, I'd never heard of them.
</P>

   No, the time has come. I've got to reach for my checkbook and
finally enter the 21st century. &QL;

<P>
   When it comes to computers, I must admit I have a love-hate
relationship. I love the things they pretend to be able to do, but
I hate the inevitable problems that go with it. I am also a bit of
a Luddite when it comes to buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have that irritating ability to evolve to a more
advanced stage the second after you spend your life savings on one.
In fact, I am so put off by knowing that whatever I buy will be
out-of-date by the time you get it unwrapped that it seems useless
replacing the one you have.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. My present computer is a wonderful little Compaq
laptop I won as a prize some seven years ago. In computer terms, it
is about as advanced as a cretaceous dinosaur, running on a 386
chip with Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen.
</P>
<P>
   It is so ancient that whenever my Internet service provider asks
me what I am running their software on, I immediately change the
topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If only computers would stop evolving, then everything would be
fine. I would be perfectly happy with my miserable little screen (a
veritable Imax compared with the one that came with my previous
computer _ a steam-age ``portable'' Osbourne, which was about as
portable as a suitcase full of bricks).
</P>
<P>
   I would be perfectly happy with my limited ability to send
e-mail and surf the Web if only I wasn't made constantly aware of
just how antediluvian it has become.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I would be eternally satisfied with a bit of
word-processing, communications and limited surfing. But along
comes the Pentium chip, color screens, CD-Roms, DVDs, Windows 95
and 98 and other evolving life-forms in the computer kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, my neat little Compaq is an embarrassment, something
which should be confined to an attic room like a mentally deficient
relative.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came when my machine was hit by the millennium
bug. The date flipped to January 1980. The time had come, I
thought, to accept the onslaught of the 21st century and to find
myself a new laptop, or rather notebook as they now seem to be
called.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt that it had to be a notebook. A desktop
PC is just too static. For me, moving around the house to write and
think is just as important as being able to move a computer between
office and work.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the sad pages of the computer press made me realize
just how difficult that decision was going to be. The variety of
choice is stupendous. Of course there are the usual names, IBM,
Compaq, Toshiba and the Macs, but which one should I go for?
</P>
<P>
   My eye settled lazily on a magazine review of a selection of
notebooks running at a speed of 400Mhz with a Pentium II. It was
billed as about the fastest around but with an ominous warning that
something even faster _ a mobile Pentium III for notebooks _ was
already in production.
</P>
<P>
   Should I wait a few more months, I thought? (No need, they are
now on sale.) I recognized few of the manufacturers being reviewed,
with names such as Elonex, Aci, and Rock, but find myself attracted
to the winning machine, the Hi-Grade UltiNote.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine it fulfills most of the requirements
you can expect of a notebook in its price range. ``Sleek, slim and
silver,'' it says, ``Hi-grade's UltiNote is undoubtedly the most
portable of the notebooks we looked at, and arguably one of the
most attractive.'' It is also one of the most solid, apparently
discerned by the lack of ``flexing'' in the space between keyboard
and screen.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot tell a lie: a trial run on the UltiNote puts my Compaq
to shame. The screen is large and clear. It is also very fast.
Surfing is like a powerboat ride compared with a slow row around
the duck pond on my old laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is slim and lightweight, with an interchangeable
slot for either a floppy disc drive, CD-Rom or DVD drive. But an
extra box no bigger than a video with two other drives can be used
for expansion, without adding to the weight or size of the machine
itself. And its silver casing makes it perfectly presentable for
any public performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a nagging doubt in my mind that my new machine
might somehow become as redundant as a Yorkshire coal miner. A
little voice is telling me to wait another six months or year, when
a faster, more capacious machine will come on to the market for the
same price.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the thorny issue of who are Hi-Grade Computers
anyway? Before opening this magazine, I'd never heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out they have been operating for more than a decade and
are one of the market leaders _ so much for my knowledge of the
computer industry _ and the machine comes with the standard year's
guarantee and technical support.
</P>
<P>
   My fingers are itching. The UltiNote AS8300 beckons me like a
stricken mariner to a siren. Will this sleek keyboard allow me to
surf the waves like a true Nethead, or am I going to end up
shipwrecked on a hardware hulk?
</P>
<P>
   No, the time has come. I've got to reach for my checkbook and
finally enter the 21st century. &QL;

&HT;     HEALTH WORKERS URGE PATIENTS TO GET LIVING WILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As few as one in five Americans have a living
will or health proxy. The result often has been some highly
publicized cases, such as Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan, about
individuals languishing in limbo, kept alive in a vegetative state
only because of medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Jane Sanders' father was diagnosed with acute
pancreatitis. Within days, his condition worsened to the point
where he was unresponsive and needed a machine to help him breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said there was no chance of recovery. ``We knew he would
not want to be kept alive that way,'' said Sanders, 42. ``We knew
that wasn't what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, a social worker at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, knew
that her 74-year-old father would prefer to die than be kept on a
ventilator. He had made his wishes known three years earlier, when
he filled out a health proxy.
</P>
<P>
   That document outlines the medical care someone wants, or
doesn't want, at the end of life. ``We went by his wishes, which
made it easier for the family,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Black, the geriatric case manager at St. Peter's, said she
has seen families torn apart when loved ones become too sick to
think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to understand the importance of these documents
is to see what happens in the absence of them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Black is part of a movement in the health care profession to
encourage more people to plan for the future, before a catastrophic
illness strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Congress recognized the need for more people to perform
end-of-life planning and passed a law requiring hospitals, nursing
homes, managed care companies, home health and hospice agencies to
provide information about advance directives, a term that refers to
both health proxies and living wills.
</P>
<P>
   Such documents include written instructions that kick in when
individuals can't communicate their own wishes because of coma,
chronic illness, traumatic injury or brain death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as studies have shown, the percentage of people who have
filled out these forms is still small.
</P>
<P>
   That's prompting some health experts to push for more aggressive
outreach on the part of doctors and nurses in bringing up the topic
of advance directives with their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people tend to want to talk about advance directives and
they want their physicians to bring it up,'' said Liva Jacoby, the
director of research for The Center of Medical Ethics at Albany
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But barriers remain, including an overall reluctance in American
society to talk about dying and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's something that a lot of families don't like to
talk about,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders knows firsthand that aversion. Despite urging others to
take that step, she has avoided filling out her own health proxy.
The form has been gathering dust on a dresser now for months. ``I
think about it all the time and know I need to do it,'' she said.
``It's hard to look at your own mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Black, in a recent speech to the Health Care Managers
Association of Northeastern New York, said she believes more people
would fill out advance directives if they understood the language
in these documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with these forms is the terminology tends
to be vague,'' she said. But a conversation with a nurse or doctor
can help clarify confusion about life support and orders to not
resuscitate, known as a DNR.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think if I put DNR in place it means don't treat,''
Black said. ``DNR does not mean you're not going to get your
medications.''
</P>
<P>
   For those whose doctors have yet to bring up the topic of
advance directives, health experts urge people to take the first
step. Such conversations should also be initiated with spouses,
parents and other loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of these documents is to keep people in control,''
Black said. ``I want to put it on the front page of the paper every
day, `Hey, you need to be concerned about this.'''

TURNING A NOSE UP ON STRIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nasal strips, which had only recently been introduced, became
the rage of the Breeders' Cup card at Gulfstream Park Nov. 6, as
four of the winners on the 10-race program wore them. Even more
eye-catching, the three highest-priced victors wore nasal strips.
Cash Run, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, won the Juvenile Fillies and
paid $67; Anees, trained by Alex Hassinger, won the Juvenile and
paid $62.60; and Cat Thief, also trained by Lukas, won the Classic
and paid $41.20. In addition, favored Nite Dreamer ($3.80 to win)
scored on the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 35 of the 114 horses who competed on the Breeders' Cup
card wore a nasal strip. For the special three-day Breeders' Cup
meeting, 10 of 30 winners, and 74 of the 287 horses who ran, wore
the strip.
</P>
<P>
   Nasal strips could not have gained better publicity. The
4-inch-by-6-inch strips sell for $15 and can be used only once. A
horse can breathe only through its nose and the strips purportedly
hold the nasal passages open, increasing air flow, and reduce the
chances of bleeding. Prior to the Breeders' Cup, the Massachusetts
State Racing Commission requested that chief steward Richard
DeStasio, a former trainer of note, conduct a study to determine
whether the strips improve a horse's performance. From Oct. 30
through Dec. 18, DeStasio carefully monitored 99 horses who wore
the strips while racing at Suffolk Downs. He concluded that the
strips do not assist a horse and that whether a horse is wearing
one need not be listed in racing programs. After studying the
report, the commission recently adopted DeStasio's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it made any significant difference at all,
certainly not enough for the public to be informed,'' said
DeStasio, a trainer for 45 years who had a fine run in New York and
won the Massachusetts Handicap in 1982 with Silver Supreme.
``Blinkers make a difference, but I didn't see anything with nasal
strips that made me think the public needs to know. Plus, the
strips are visible. I don't think the horsemen will use them to any
extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 99 horses who ran with nasal strips during DeStasio's
study, 11 were winners. Seven of 19 favorites won, 4 of 44
middle-of-the-board (from 3-1 to 10-1) horses won, and, perhaps
most important to the study, none of 36 long shots won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anybody in the country who did the survey we
did,'' said DeStasio, who was assisted by commission steward
William Keen and association steward James Gigliotti. ``The
horsemen have cut back on using them now that they know the results
of the test. They see that they don't make any difference. In
racing, I wouldn't count out anything. All I can go by is the
study, and the study showed nasal strips did not improve
performance. Certainly, I would want the public to know about it if
they did.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what briefly looked like a hot idea in Florida has been
chilled by the results of DeStasio's study.

   Lukas, never shy about traveling coast to coast, has switched
his top 3-year-old colt and best 3-year-old filly from California
to Florida. High Yield, who was third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile
and most recently second in the Santa Catalina at Santa Anita Jan.
30, will be pointed for the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Feb.
19. ``He'll be flown in on Feb. 10,'' said assistant trainer Barry
Knight. ``If everything goes all right, he'll be our Florida Derby
(March 11) horse.'' Cash Run will join High Yield and be aimed at
the Davona Dale Feb. 20 and the Bonnie Miss March 16. After her
Breeders' Cup tally, Cash Run ran second in the Golden Rod at
Churchill Downs, and was fourth in her seasonal debut in the Santa
Ynez Jan. 23. This does not appear to be the greatest of years for
3-year-olds in Florida, which Lukas obviously has figured out . . .
Jockey Pat Valenzuela, whose career has been plagued by drug
problems, tested positive for amphetamines Saturday and has been
suspended by the Santa Anita stewards, pending a hearing Wednesday.
The positive test violates conditions set forth when Valenzuela was
allowed to return to racing last fall following a two-year hiatus.
The regular rider of 1989 Triple Crown champion Sunday Silence,
Valenzuela finished a strong second in the Hollywood Park standings
upon his return last year. He currently stands sixth at Santa Anita
. . . Frank Stronach already owns Gulfstream and Calder, and it now
looks like he may complete the Southern Florida trifecta. On
Saturday, Stronach talked to owner Frank Brunetti about buying
storied Hialeah. ``We've talked, but there was no conclusion,''
said Brunetti. ``I'll let you know if anything happens.'' . . . The
Maryland Jockey Club has raised the purse of the May 13 Pimlico
Special from $500,000 to $750,000. ``We increased the purse with
the hope that the Pimlico Special's position in the NTRA Champions
on Fox Series would attract the top handicap horses in the
country,'' said Wayne Wright of the Maryland Thoroughbred
Horsemen's Association. The Pimlico Special is the third of five
events in the series, which concludes with the Whitney at Saratoga
Aug. 6.

three winners Sunday . . . Suffolk has added two turf events for
Massachusetts breds to its spring stakes calendar. The $25,000
Boston Common Stakes, for 3-year-old fillies, will be raced at 1
mile May 14, and the $25,000 Beacon Hill Stakes, for 3-year-old
colts and geldings also at 1 mile, will be run May 29 . . . Suffolk
will give away a $1,000 bet on the feature race Feb. 21 (Presidents

track will also give away $20 betting vouchers throughout the

HARRIS EXPECTS TO JELL WITH REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Wolde Harris played in an MLS Cup final
with the Colorado Rapids in his first year in the league. In his
second season, Harris converted 13 goals, an average of one every
87 minutes. But the success rate of Harris and the Rapids did not
continue last season, so he requested a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution might not advance to the MLS Cup _ they have
never been better than the eighth-best team in the regular season
and have played only two playoff matches _ but Harris should be
comfortable with the style of play here, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Harris learned the game in Kingston, Jamaica, where you either
play soccer with skill and style or you simply do not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the ball at my feet,'' said Harris, who joined the
Revolution Sunday in a trade from Colorado for a first-round draft
choice. ``Jamaicans are skillful players, like South Americans. We
look up to Brazil. I prefer to play that way rather than just
running. At Colorado I added the running aspect to my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 26, should be able to mesh with midfielders Leonel
Alvarez and Mauricio Ramos and striker Eduardo Hurtado to transform
the Revolution into the Latin-style team coach Fernando Clavijo
desires. He was unlikely to get that in Colorado, especially after
the Rapids lost Uruguayan wing Adrian Paz after the '98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I would start and sometimes I wouldn't,'' Harris
said of his Colorado experience. ``The coach would see some things
that would affect his decisions and I respect that. But I put the
numbers up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a direct style that to me was predictable and that
makes it tough on the forwards because it is easy for defenders to
mark us, because they know what type of balls we are going to get.
Plus, we weren't getting the crosses from the outside. With Paz,
you knew he was coming down the wing every single time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was in a similar situation soon after moving to the US in
1990. He followed a former Kingston classmate, Michael Saunders, to
the University of Connecticut, but the Huskies were playing a style
that was too direct for him. He transferred to Clemson, where he
scored 76 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got used to New England weather in Connecticut,'' Harris
said. ``But the soccer wasn't to my liking.''
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo said Harris must improve his conditioning, though Harris
was in good enough shape to perform for Jamaica in a tournament in
China last month. The Reggae Boys lost to Uruguay (2-0) and
defeated New Zealand (2-1) to finish in third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of goals I want to accomplish and I couldn't
accomplish them with (Colorado),'' Harris said. ``Every player has
personal goals, and to reach them you have to do it within the team
concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good group of guys and everyone has respect for each
other. The only question mark is chemistry but it seems like the
team is a lot more together from what it was in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder John Harkes has signed a two-year contract with MLS
and will report to Revolution training Tuesday . . . Bo Oshiniyi, a
starting goalkeeper with Columbus in 1996, joined the Revolution.

A CELL PHONE SO SMALL YOU CAN JUST TOSS IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Some day in the not unimaginably distant
future, you might find yourself buying a new cell phone with a
block of minutes, and when your time is up you simply throw the
phone out.
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind a concept-level prototype for a
disposable phone developed by engineers at Motorola, for which
researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are
contributing some crucial ideas at a new Motorola
product-development lab opening this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make a phone literally the size of a credit card
that fits inside a 50-cent plastic holder to make it easier to
handle. The card would have 12 slim round bumps making up a
1-to-(NU) phone keypad, plus a miniature earpiece, microphone,
hair-size antenna, and a processor chip, and would come loaded with
as many minutes of airtime as you wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Once the minutes were up, it might be just as easy to buy a new
phone as to take it someplace to have the minutes replenished.
(Hopefully, you could recycle the old phone like a disposable
camera.) The cost of the new phone might add barely pennies to the
per-minute calling fee.
</P>
<P>
   Among other advantages, such a system would be a huge leap of
convenience over the current prepaid wireless market, which is
small but rapidly growing.
</P>
<P>
   Texas market researchers Frost &AMP; Sullivan estimate that more
than 5.3 million Americans are using prepaid wireless calling
plans, accounting for nearly $2.3 billion of the industry's $51.1
billion in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   These are plans in which consumers buy a phone but have to pay
$50 or $100 upfront for calling time before they can use it.
Generally speaking, the unlucky souls using this service _ many of
them people with bad credit histories who are shunned by wireless
carriers _ have to dial an endless stream of access numbers or
identification codes just to make a call, the same way you would if
you were using a prepaid long-distance card at a pay phone. Not a
lot of fun at 65 miles per hour, and you tend to pay ripoff
per-minute prices.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers with Motorola's Advanced Concepts Group have developed
a version of the disposable cell phone. It was one of several toys
that aides to Motorola chief executive Robert Growney showed when
they came to Cambridge in December _ including Dick Tracy-style
wristwatch phones _ to announce a new consumer products research
center they are opening near MIT this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the idea to market, though, will likely require the
help of people at the new research lab and the MIT Motorola Fellows
program, which the Schaumburg, Ill., company uses to let loose some
of the nation's brightest minds creating the new wireless world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Motorola Fellows, Silicon Valley expatriate Rob Poor,
a former Grateful Dead recording engineer and technician at George
Lucas's film studio, has been working on a concept he calls
``embedded networking'' that could prove crucial to making
disposable phones work, by greatly reducing the amount of power
they need to function.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cell phones must have strong-enough batteries to send
their signal as far as five or six miles to a tower. Strong
batteries mean big batteries, which means big phones _ not phones
you can slip into your wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, however, that each phone only had to send its signal as
far as the next nearest phone in service, which in turn forwarded
the signal hopscotch-fashion to the cell tower and on to the
landline phone network. With enough units operating, each phone
could work on a battery no bigger than what you might put in a
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by giving out the phones, you create the network,'' Poor
said during a recent visit to his office at MIT's Media Lab, where
he illustrates the concept with a batch of glowing light diodes
that can tell each other, by infrared communication, to change
color on demand. ``You cut the power demand of each phone from
watts to microwatts.''

TAX-CUT PANDERING HAS LOST ITS MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this age of new politics, voters show signs of demanding some
old-fashioned arithmetic: numbers that add up.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona not only beat Governor George W.
Bush of Texas in last week's New Hampshire primary; he also beat
the notion that today's voters are so fixated on tax cuts that they
don't remember simple math.
</P>
<P>
   In those heady pre-New Hampshire primary days, the Bush campaign
announced a $483 billion tax cut proposal. It was all about giving
money back to the taxpayers, with little emphasis on shoring up
Social Security or reducing the national debt. MIT economist Paul
Krugman, who also writes for The New York Times, last week put the
real cost of the Bush tax cut at a stunning $1.3 trillion and
suggested that ``it's time he had a little chat with his numbers
guys.`` (The candidate's father, former president George Bush,
might once have called that kind of promised giveback ``voodoo
economics,'' but that was before the elder Bush learned the thrill
and chill of ``Read my lips, no new taxes.'')
</P>
<P>
   Whether the George W. Bush tax cut proposal is $483 billion or
more than $1 trillion, it didn't tempt New Hampshire's famously
tax-shy voters. The power of McCain's personality and his message
of campaign finance reform were critical to his victory there. But
the voters also accepted his more modest tax-cutting plan, with its
emphasis on priorities like Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush lost the tax debate in New Hampshire, where does that
leave it everywhere else?
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who supports Vice President Al Gore,
says: ``John McCain has it right. You need some investment, some
tax cuts, that go to people who deserve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry says McCain understands what the Republican establishment
still doesn't quite get: ``The American voter has smartened up. You
can't pander to them on taxes anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean someone won't try.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Governor Cellucci is pushing a plan to cut the
income tax to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Cellucci said he is sticking with the plan even
after the news that the cost of the Big Dig is expected to jump
$1.4 billion, to $12.2 billion. He would rather raise tolls so he
can give back tax money.
</P>
<P>
   At a child-care education center in Weymouth, Mass. Monday,
Kerry equated the amount of money it would need to give every child
in Massachusetts a quality education with the amount Cellucci is
proposing to give back in taxes _ roughly $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   John Brockelman, executive director of the Massachusetts
Republican Party, insists that he is ``convinced, absolutely'' that
Massachusetts voters want what Cellucci is determined to give them
_ $1.64 a day for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   As proof of that, he points to two old polls and the fact that
Bill Clinton called for a $350 million tax cut in his recent State
of the Union Message. ``We know that Bill Clinton is one of those
politicians who poll on a daily basis,'' says Brockelman, ``and if
he didn't think people wanted a tax cut, he wouldn't have asked for
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the tax cut debate in Masschusetts is a microcosm of
the larger national debate.
</P>
<P>
   How much should we spend, how much should we save, and how much
do we really expect back?
</P>
<P>
   Are we willing to put our money where we say our priorities are
_ in education, technology, and infrastructure?
</P>
<P>
   What do we think is worthy of public investment? Nationally,
that means deciding how much to commit to shoring up Medicare and
Social Security. Locally, it could mean choosing between plugging
the gap for a bankrupt HMO or building a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a long while, could Democrats and
Republicans end up somewhere near the same place when it comes to
tax cut philosophy? Post-New Hampshire, and before South Carolina
votes, that is an intriguing possibility.
</P>
<P>
   With the strong economy comes security and a sense that this is
a good time to invest in the future. Americans also have less to be
angry about when it comes to their tax dollars. Washington is doing
a better job of balancing the budget and giving tax credits and
cuts whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   We are also more sophisticated when it comes to finance. We know
the drag of credit and debt on our family budgets. We know that in
order to make money, you have to invest money and that you can't
invest it if you spend it or give it away.
</P>
<P>
   Very simply, we know that if you are running a household or a
country, the numbers have to add up.

BUSH GOES ON THE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON  &UR;  &LR; -- George W. Bush's assault on Senator John
McCain in pivotal South Carolina has a veneer of substance, but in
fact it is personal. McCain is being portrayed as a Washington
insider hypocrite, an influence-peddling corporate jet passenger in
league with the hated liberals in politics and the media to keep
taxes high and government huge. Bush avoided this kind of behavior
in New Hampshire because it could not have survived scrutiny. The
calculation that conservatives in South Carolin are dumber and
easier to manipulate is suspect, however.
</P>
<P>
   In just the first few days it has already boomeranged once, over
McCain's record on veterans' issues. If it boomerangs once more,
Bush could easily lose the Feb. 19 primary and with it another
layer of his once-assumed inevitability as the kind of Republican
leader who can appeal across ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   And it deserves to boomerang, because the lynchpin of Bush's
assault on McCain's character _ economics _ is patently fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush assault commenced Friday, when he began broadcasting
the first, honest-to-badness attack commercial of the 2000
campaign. The key sentence: ``McCain's own economic advisor says he
supports Bush's plan that earmarks $2 trillion to protect Social
Security, pays down debt and gives a real tax cut for every
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of that sentence is false. The statement reflects a
continual need by Bush for the trappings of respectability for a
tax proposal that deserves none.
</P>
<P>
   The ``economic adviser'' is actually a supporter, Washington
lobbyist and former Minnesota Congressman Vin Weber, a onetime
acolyte of Jack Kemp on economics and Newt Gingrich on politics,
who doesn't advise McCain on policy and who made an innocuously
gracious comment about Bush's plan that the governor's campaign has
directly misstated as support.
</P>
<P>
   Another falsehood in the commercial is more substantive. The
truth is that Bush's plan ``earmarks'' nothing, not a dime. There
is a tax proposal that would cost at least $1.4 trillion over the
next ten years, and a pork-filled but otherwise vague proposal to
spend even more on the military than is programmed for the next
several years by the Clinton administration. Far from protecting
the Social Security system it is a dagger aimed right at its fiscal
heart.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush has done is falsely use the figure of $2 trillion as
if it were one concept, when in fact it is two. On the simpler
level, it represents the annual surpluses within Social Security
payroll taxes and benefits spending that are certain to accumulate
until the main impact of the Baby Boom generation's retirement
hits. Everybody running for president in both parties, as well as
the GOP Congress and the Clinton administration, supports the
retention of those surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain also favor the establishment of individual
investment accounts for future retirees, financed by a two
percentage-point cut in each willing individual's payroll tax. But
Bush has no way to finance the huge, upfront costs of such a
partial privatization except from within the system _ meaning by
definition future benefit cuts. So much for protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain difference stems from the concept of what could be a
second $2 trillion. This is the outer range of estimates of the
operating surpluses in the government outside Social Security that
could accumulate over the next decade. McCain doesn't believe it
for a second, while Bush clings to the figure like a life
preserver. For starters, half the figure would disappear without
deep budget cuts that neither Congress nor Clinton has been willing
to even propose, largely for good reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, McCain really does ``earmark'' whatever operating
surplus occurs by using percentages in his proposals: 60-plus
percent for Social Security (on top of the $2 trillion saved within
the system, thus making provision for investment accounts), another
ten percent for Medicare (ignored by Bush), and the rest for
national debt reduction (which also shores up the pension fund).
</P>
<P>
   The Bush commercial's claim about debt reduction is false by
comparison because there is no earmarking. And that ``real'' tax
cut would be an illusion for most Americans, its few dollars
drowned in the program cuts that would have to accompany it. It
would, however, be ``real'' for the one percent of income earners
who would get nearly 40 percent of the dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is, in short, preposterous. Lamer stuff has
worked before, but as this campaign goes down the stretch in South
Carolina, Bush sounds more desperate than determined. Wrong, too.

RIDING THE CREATURE: DAVID WETHERELL DRIVES CMGI TO NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ANDOVER, Mass. _ The Nasdaq closing bell was still two hours
away when the Creature began marching up the stock ticker. Big
leaps and scary tumbles are common for the Creature _ that is why
devotees use its nickname instead of its bland, formal name, CMGI
Inc. But on Jan. 3, the beast was making an awesome run, and one
group of CMGI investors who talk on line was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   The first word came from Jon Simmons, a computer programmer in
Fullerton, Calif. ``Something tells me I'll be a millionaire after
I add everything up tonight,'' he wrote to other CMGI fans on an
Internet message board. ``YeeEEEhhHHHHAAAAA!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Then Roger Dikon of Vermont weighed in. ``I'm there buddy!!!
Millionaire!!!'' wrote the retired chef. ``GO CREATURE!!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew, just busted firmly into the `multi' arena!'' wrote David
Kaiser, signaling his new status as a multimillionaire. At 36,
Kaiser had already retired as an oil company geologist and bought
his dream home on 20 acres in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   By the closing bell, no fewer than eight of the 50 or so
regulars on the CMGI board announced they had reached the Promised
Land of million-dollar portfolios, thanks to CMGI's 49-point leap
that day to an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   After congratulating one another, some of the new paper
millionaires began typing notes to the man who had created all the
wealth: David Wetherell. ``You're making us all rich!'' wrote
Simmons. ``Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wetherell is the man you wished you had paid more
attention to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The founder and driving spirit of Andover-based CMGI, he has
quietly built a small and unsteady marketing company into an
Internet powerhouse. Riding the mania for high-tech stocks, CMGI
now equals FleetBoston Financial Corp. in market value and towers
over such old-line stalwarts as Raytheon Co. Since CMGI went public
in 1994, its shares have increased an eye-popping 71,000 percent,
more than any other Nasdaq stock of the past six years. Last year
alone, shares rose 940 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time farm boy of modest means, Wetherell, at age 45, is
worth an estimated $3 billion, though the volatility of CMGI stock
_ it is the Creature, after all _ has boosted him closer to $4
billion at times and can change his net worth by $250 million in a
single day. Still, he is one of the four or five wealthiest people
in Massachusetts, on par with cable pioneer Amos Hostetter and
Fidelity Investments magnate Ned Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when only academics and computer techies had embraced
the Internet, Wetherell figured out what kinds of businesses were
likely to make money on line, then started buying or building them
all at once. It was as if he saw the untamed American West and
decided to build, in one swoop, all the towns, railroads, and
factories needed to make it grow _ while everyone else was still
wondering if the place was even habitable.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Web surfers often start their on-line travels at CMGI's
AltaVista search engine, or at Lycos, the fourth most-visited site
on the Web, in which CMGI is the largest shareholder. The ads they
see are often created by CMGI companies, which have become a force
in the burgeoning field of on-line advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen CMGI-related companies sell specialty items on line,
from vitamins to art to auto parts. Others help companies launch
Web sites. Still others are developing the infrastructure needed to
deliver more sophisticated graphics and video on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In all, CMGI now owns or has major stakes in more than 60
companies, which often aid one another like a Japanese keiretsu, or
business network. CMGI already employs more than 1,260 people in
Massachusetts at its own companies, while hundreds more work at
companies it has backed with millions in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   And the network is still growing. Each month, Wetherell gets as
many as 2,000 business plans from Internet wannabes anxious to join
the CMGI fold. He plans to start two to four companies this year
and invest in four to six each month.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, he says, is ``absolutely the most fundamental
change in the economy since the history of the economy. It's as
significant as the Industrial Revolution . . . and it's happening
in a far shorter period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   To many who have followed CMGI's rise, Wetherell is nothing less
than a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He single-handedly put Massachusetts on the Internet
bandwagon,'' said Hemang Dave, who helped start five companies at
CMGI before leaving for the less ``lunatic'' pace of running a
single Internet start-up. ``You can't point to a second person in
Massachusetts who has that much influence on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But CMGI, like the Internet itself, is a work in progress, and
some former employees say that certain units have adopted and shed
business strategies so quickly that they are left in chaos. Like
many other on-line ventures, CMGI has also built a spectacular
share price before its Internet start-ups have turned a profit _ a
high-wire act that could produce an unhappy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without an element of faith, you can't make these numbers add
up,'' says technology analyst Scott Lundstrom of AMR Research in
Boston. ``If it doesn't play out that these companies are worth
what they're valued at, people may well look at (Wetherell) as a
con artist. He'd be in good company, but in 10 years we could be
writing books about this massive group delusion. And he'd be a
chapter in that book.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell, the youngest of six children, was born in Hartford.
His father worked for hire on nearby farms, tried potato farming in
Vermont, and construction in Florida. It was a life of tiny homes
and hand-me-downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have money, but I didn't know that,'' says Wetherell
during a recent interview in his office. Sensitive to bright light,
he keeps the modest space dark. There is no wood paneling, no
trophy model of his Martha's Vineyard vacation home or his new jet,
a Bombardier Challenger, which seats 10.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell saw his first computer in high school. He was a strong
math student and signed up for a programming class, only to end up
with a C-minus and a bruised ego. But he was hooked and continued
to study programming at Ohio Wesleyan University.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1976, he worked in several computer jobs and
in a few years had saved more than $20,000 _ enough seed money to
start his own company. But he decided to wait. ``I didn't know how
to hire people,'' he says. ``I didn't know anything about equity. I
didn't know much about how to put together a business plan.'' So he
worked as a technical recruiter for 16 months to learn more about
the software industry and how to spot talent.
</P>
<P>
   When Wetherell did make his move, in 1982, it turned into a
major disappointment. The company he started, Softrend, designed
software that allowed users of desktop computers to pull
information from mainframe computers. Just as he was ready to
launch the product, however, the venture capital firm backing him
had a staff shakeup and pulled the plug on his funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest thing I've ever had to encounter,'' he
says, still sounding bitter. ``But I'm grateful. It made me realize
there's a niche in the world for venture capitalists who had vision
and ethics. And more than anything it made me want to be a venture
capitalist one day.''
</P>
<P>
   But he took a decidedly low-tech detour. He managed to sell
Softrend, earning ``a few hundred thousand dollars,'' and used that
money in a leveraged buyout of the College Marketing Group, later
called CMG, which compiled lists of professors and their courses
and sold them to textbook publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Sleepy CMG, based in Wilmington, hardly seemed a platform for
launching a high-tech empire. But by the early 1990s, after a few
years with CMG, Wetherell grew to understand direct marketing as
well as software. And he began thinking about how to link his
marketing business with a new medium he had been tracking for
years: the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked to me like a better channel for direct marketing,
and that was our business,'' he says. The Internet was still crude,
though, carrying only text and no graphics. Arguing that CMG had to
move college professors on line before the publishers did,
Wetherell persuaded his board to spend nearly $1 million to develop
software to make the Internet more user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell put together a team that created InternetWorks, one of
the first Web browsers. He planned to give the software away to
professors to lure them onto the Internet, then ``monetize the
eyeballs'' _ sell that audience to advertisers. But only 10 months
after work began, the browser was considered so valuable America
Online bought it for stock eventually worth $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell had no browser, but he had plenty of capital. ``It was
like I lost my one true love,'' he says. ``What do I do?''

 &HT;    FOR SOME, DONATING IS EASIER THAN DECIDING AMONG CANDIDATES
 &HT;    430&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SOFIA BASSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the movie ``Air Force One,'' Harrison Ford
played a decisive U.S. president. In real life, he finds
presidential choices more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign contributions records show that last Nov. 8, Ford
donated $1,000 to Democratic candidate Bill Bradley. The next day,
he gave the same amount to Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Ford wasn't alone in his indecision. An analysis of Federal
Election Commission (FEC) records for the last three months of 1999
shows that 132 people split their money between two of the main
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Giving to both Bush and McCain was the most popular option, with
94 people giving a total of $123,430. Another 33 people split
$54,875 between Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Three people gave to both Bush and Bradley, but the oddest
couple was Gore and McCain. Only two people, including Graham
Allison, director of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University, gave to both. The records showed no one who contributed
to both Gore and Bradley, or Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for political action committees to give to
opposing candidates in a race. In most cases, they are hedging
their bets, ensuring access to the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   With individuals, it is more complicated. Some just like
insurgent reform candidates. But longtime political activists often
have personal ties to the competing factions and want to maintain
those relationships, or they too are hedging their bets.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations of last fall's double donors ranges from
corporate CEO to artist, from engineer to homemaker. The reasons
they give for their choices were almost as diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ensure that we had good insurgencies,'' explained
Paul Roman, a publisher from Connecticut who donated $1,000 to
Bradley and another $1,000 to McCain. ``I'm an independent, and at
this point I don't have a preference. We have to see how the
campaign progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman acknowledged that the two candidates have different
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, one is conservative and the other is quite liberal,'' he
pointed out. ``I don't know where I'll wind up. I voted both sides
in time past. It depends on what I feel the country needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most double donors gave to the two Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five or six Republicans that are running,'' Coleman
Donaldson, a retiree from Virginia who donated $750 to Bush and
$400 to McCain, said before the GOP race tightened to four
candidates. ``I wanted to make sure that we'll have the best of
them. I want both to have a chance. I like them both and I haven't
made up my mind yet.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   John Herrick, a real estate executive from Cleveland, ended up
contributing to two candidates because a friend asked him for a
favor. According to his wife, he gave $2,000 to Bush because he
believes in him very strongly, and $1,000 to McCain because one of
his friend was supporting the Arizona's candidate. Because the
maximum legal contribution to a candidate is $1,000, half the Bush
donation was re-attributed to Herrick's wife.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of double donors, some lose track of all
transactions. Thelma Graham, a retiree from Cincinnati, contributed
$1,000 to Bush and $620 to McCain in a series of several small
donations over a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving to Republicans,'' she said. ``I gave to Forbes and
I'm planning to give to McCain because it turned out that I've
worked with him. I don't remember that I gave to Bush, but I might
have done that. Maybe I'll pick up some other candidates.''

 &HT;    FOR SOME, DONATING IS EASIER THAN DECIDING AMONG CANDIDATES
 &HT;    430&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

   WASHINGTON _ In the movie ``Air Force One,'' Harrison Ford
played a decisive U.S. president. In real life, he finds
presidential choices more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign contributions records show that last Nov. 8, Ford
donated $1,000 to Democratic candidate Bill Bradley. The next day,
he gave the same amount to Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Ford wasn't alone in his indecision. An analysis of Federal
Election Commission (FEC) records for the last three months of 1999
shows that 132 people split their money between two of the main
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Giving to both Bush and McCain was the most popular option, with
94 people giving a total of $123,430. Another 33 people split
$54,875 between Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Three people gave to both Bush and Bradley, but the oddest
couple was Gore and McCain. Only two people, including Graham
Allison, director of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University, gave to both. The records showed no one who contributed
to both Gore and Bradley, or Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for political action committees to give to
opposing candidates in a race. In most cases, they are hedging
their bets, ensuring access to the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   With individuals, it is more complicated. Some just like
insurgent reform candidates. But longtime political activists often
have personal ties to the competing factions and want to maintain
those relationships, or they too are hedging their bets.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations of last fall's double donors ranges from
corporate CEO to artist, from engineer to homemaker. The reasons
they give for their choices were almost as diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ensure that we had good insurgencies,'' explained
Paul Roman, a publisher from Connecticut who donated $1,000 to
Bradley and another $1,000 to McCain. ``I'm an independent, and at
this point I don't have a preference. We have to see how the
campaign progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman acknowledged that the two candidates have different
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, one is conservative and the other is quite liberal,'' he
pointed out. ``I don't know where I'll wind up. I voted both sides
in time past. It depends on what I feel the country needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most double donors gave to the two Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five or six Republicans that are running,'' Coleman
Donaldson, a retiree from Virginia who donated $750 to Bush and
$400 to McCain, said before the GOP race tightened to four
candidates. ``I wanted to make sure that we'll have the best of
them. I want both to have a chance. I like them both and I haven't
made up my mind yet.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   John Herrick, a real estate executive from Cleveland, ended up
contributing to two candidates because a friend asked him for a
favor. According to his wife, he gave $2,000 to Bush because he
believes in him very strongly, and $1,000 to McCain because one of
his friend was supporting the Arizona's candidate. Because the
maximum legal contribution to a candidate is $1,000, half the Bush
donation was re-attributed to Herrick's wife.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of double donors, some lose track of all
transactions. Thelma Graham, a retiree from Cincinnati, contributed
$1,000 to Bush and $620 to McCain in a series of several small
donations over a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving to Republicans,'' she said. ``I gave to Forbes and
I'm planning to give to McCain because it turned out that I've
worked with him. I don't remember that I gave to Bush, but I might
have done that. Maybe I'll pick up some other candidates.''

   What Wetherell did is now the stuff of Internet legend. He
funded dozens of on-line ventures, taking advantage of a new
economic order in which high-tech companies that often have no
profits are nonetheless awarded stratospheric market values on the
promise that they might be the next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   His bet on Waltham-based Lycos cemented his reputation and
illustrates the art of the Internet deal. CMGI paid only $2 million
for an 80 percent stake in Lycos in 1995. The 15 percent CMGI still
owns is now worth $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wetherell enjoys cult-like status. At CMGI's last annual
meeting, investors lined up for his autograph. If he was not well
known at Ohio Wesleyan during his college years (his picture does
not appear in his class yearbook), he is now. A private man, he
will say little about his family, except that he and his wife,
Celeste, have three children. But he clearly enjoys getting out and
taking in the view from the top. An avid golfer with a six
handicap, he played last week in the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am, hobnobbing with corporate titans.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell is also a strong advocate for the view that Internet
companies need no lifeline from the old-media world. When Barry
Diller, a veteran television and movie executive, sought to merge
his USA Network with Lycos last year, Wetherell, after tentatively
blessing the deal, led the charge to kill it. He argued that
placing old media borders around a new media company could limit
its potential as a pure Internet concern. The deal with Diller
ultimately collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day (Wetherell) became a little bit bigger than life,''
says Jack Connors, the Boston advertising executive, who serves on
the Lycos board of directors. ``How many guys successfully stand up
to the Barry Dillers of the world?''
</P>
<P>
   Given his reputation and the capital at his command, Wetherell
can move quickly into new areas. He sleeps only about five hours a
night, rising around 3 a.m. to begin work at home. CMGI executives
say it is not unusual to get a call from him by 6. Just before his
first meeting at 10, he makes the four-mile drive to CMGI
headquarters in one of Andover's renovated mills.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he is betting heavily on Internet advertising.
One set of statistics that ``motivates me every day,'' he says, is
that North Americans spend 9 percent of their media time on the
Web, but only 2 percent of advertising revenues have followed. In
time, he believes 70 percent of media time and 80 percent of ad
dollars will be spent on ``interactive'' media.
</P>
<P>
   Another big bet is iCast, an Internet company that some say is
an example of the best and worst of the CMGI culture.
</P>
<P>
   When an idea does not work, CMGI often changes business models
and tries again, a strategy that has produced several winning
firms. But some former employees say the constant reshuffling,
including changes at iCast, creates confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell predicts iCast, based in Woburn, will become ``the
premier entertainment destination on the Web.'' He has pledged to
spend as much as $100 million on the site, and he hired former NBC
president Neil Braun to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   But according to some former executives, Wetherell kept changing
his vision of what iCast should be. ``We had $100 million and the
business plan kept changing,'' says Jonathan Cropper, a former
iCast executive brought in by Braun. ``We changed our business
strategy several times, so that it was difficult to execute
things.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cropper, Braun believed iCast could distinguish
itself by cutting deals with top celebrities to draw the initial
traffic to the site. He says Wetherell signed off on part of that
strategy by authorizing iCast's purchase of the on-line licensing
rights to a stable of pop stars, including Bruce Springsteen,
Celine Dion, and Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   But Wetherell changed his mind, Cropper says, making iCast more
of an entertainment guide. Braun was ultimately forced out last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Braun declined to comment, citing a lawsuit he has filed over
his compensation. Wetherell says only that he laid out some ideas
for iCast but that Braun went another way. He also says Braun never
took to the culture of the Internet. ``This is Internet time, and
you can't wait forever,'' Wetherell says.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Internet, change is a fact of life. ``The Internet is
chaos management by definition,'' he says. ``It's fast paced. It's
running a marathon at the speed of a 100-yard dash. It really is.''

A SPECIAL REPORT FROM LINUX WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linux creator Linus Torvalds admits the upstart
software system still lags behind Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT. But
at last week's LinuxWorld Expo here, Torvalds vowed that Linux is
moving quickly to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, we had our (butts) kicked on certain
benchmarks, and we didn't want that to happen again,'' Torvalds
told a crowd of Linux loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   So Torvalds is working hard on the next version of the Linux
``kernel,'' the part of the operating system that controls its most
basic operations. Torvalds said the upgraded kernel, set for
release this summer, will run on server computers containing up to
eight processors. Better multiprocessor support is vital for Linux
to handle the biggest corporate computing tasks. In another
enticement to corporate users, the next Linux will be tuned to run
on IBM's S/390 mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   And to make Linux more consumer-friendly, the kernel will allow
the use of Universal Serial Bus and FireWire connectors, to make it
easier to attach keyboards, mice, and external disk drives to Linux
computers. Torvalds also promised better support for 3-D graphic
acceleration, which will be good news for computer gamers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite big improvements in ease of use, installing Linux can
still be fairly intimidating to many computer users. Cosmos
Engineering Co. of Los Angeles (www.cosmoseng.com) has come up with
a creative solution called Linux On A Disk. Not a floppy disk or
CD-ROM, but a full-sized, multigigabyte hard disk with Linux
already installed. The purchaser installs the Linux hard drive
right alongside the computer's existing drive. Linux On A Disk
comes with software that installs a ``dual-boot'' feature, so that
the user can choose at start-up whether to run as a Windows or a
Linux machine. Linux On A Disk comes on hard drives ranging from
8.4 to 27 gigabytes, with prices ranging from $219 to $449.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Linux may become even more popular south of the border than it
is in the United States, if a Brazilian businessman has his way.
</P>
<P>
   Sandro Nunes Henrique is chief executive of Conectiva, a company
that's aggressively marketing Linux versions in English, Spanish,
and Portuguese. The goal is to distribute high-power computer
software to people who can't afford the latest computers, or
legally-licensed copies of commercial software.
</P>
<P>
   ``At minimum, 60 percent of our software in Latin America is
illegal,'' says Henrique. ``We don't have money to pay for our
license.'' Besides, many Latin American individuals and businesses
can't afford to upgrade their computer hardware, to keep up with
the demands of newer software. But Linux can run even on old PCs
from the early 1990s. In addition, Linux comes with a license that
sets no limits on copying the software. So a company can buy one
copy of Conectiva Linux for about $50 US dollars and install it on
every one of its PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Henrique says his company distributed 450,000 copies of Linux
last year, and he estimates that 5 percent of all the computers in
his country now run Linux.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One key theme at LinuxWorld was concern for the care and feeding
of programmers. Open source software is written by hundreds of
volunteers, many of whom will never earn a dime from their labors.
Will they keep toiling away for free, while major corporations earn
millions from their work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually that is the question of the year,'' says Timothy Ney,
managing officer of the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge,
Mass. The foundation, established by Richard Stallman, produced a
great deal of the software that has become part of Linux. Now Ney
is trying to find ways to ensure that the free software well
doesn't run dry. He's working with students at the Harvard Business
School to design ways to compensate producers of open source
software. One possibility: a fund established by for-profit
software firms that could pay substantial one-time stipends to
programmers who produce major new contributions to Linux or other
open source projects.
</P>
<P>
   Ney doesn't think free software creators will stop work any time
soon, even as their efforts enrich firms like Red Hat Software Inc.
``There still is the love of programming and the challenge of
creating superior code,'' he said. ``But we wouldn't want
alienation to set in.''

OK REGIS, I'M READY TO BE A BLACK MILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regis Philbin wants me to be a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   He said it right on television last week, in the presence of 30
million witnesses. At the start of last Tuesday's edition of ABC's
mega-successful game show, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' there
was Philbin practically begging for me to ring him up so he could
give me a cool, crisp million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anybody explain this to me?'' he asked. ``Why is it that
nearly all our contestants are white men? I'm a white man, so, you
know, I have nothing against them. But come on! We would really
like a little more diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the part about me: ``Here's the challenge. Everyone
out there who has thought about being on the show _ who isn't a
white male _ dial that 800 number, and let's get you into the game.
What's the worst thing that could happen to you? You might become a
millionaire. You have a problem with that? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a problem with that, Reege. I'm black, I'm female,
and I'm ready to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Joey
settling onto one of those comfy sofas at Central Perk and saying
they wish they had more ``Friends'' of color? Yet there was the
host of TV's top show, which for better or (probably) worse has
altered the prime-time landscape, making an impassioned plea for
more diversity among his program's contestants. It certainly has to
rank as one of the more unusual moments of the TV year.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this is the same television season branded ``a
virtual whitewash'' last spring by NAACP President Kweisi Mfume for
its lack of minority characters. In the face of protests and
threatened boycotts, the networks reacted with 11th-hour cast
additions and, more recently, with promises to step up their
efforts to increase minority representation behind the cameras as
well as in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Millionaire'' garnering so much attention, Philbin and
Michael Davies, the show's executive producer, have been hearing
grumblings about the show's lack of contestant diversity. Davies
said such complaints are ``the one criticism of the program that
really sticks with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the show premiered last August, the program has found its
players among callers to a toll-free number who then answer a few
sample questions. (Right now, actually getting through may be more
difficult than any million-dollar question. The line is a perpetual
busy signal.) Yet so far, this system has yielded only 11 women and
one Latino. Other than that, ``Millionaire'' has been as white and
male as a hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   Davies told the New York Daily News that Philbin's on-air appeal
was ``my last-ditch effort before considering revolutionary changes
in the selection process. It indicates an incredibly stong level of
concern on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   So now I'm training for my big turn on ``Millionaire.'' I'm
hitting the encyclopedias and watching lots of classic TV. I've
picked my lifelines and informed my significant other to practice
her proud, pleased, and panicky on-camera expressions. I'm ready to
compliment Reege's monochromatic shirts and ties (although I'm sort
of over that look), to blather on about my hobbies, and to wink and
chuckle at his stale jokes. Most of all, I'm really working hard to
get over the fact that I find ``Millionaire's'' runaway success
utterly perplexing and more than a little depressing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm ready, Reege.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to attract different contestants, Davies said they've
been moving away from ``the canon of white male trivia in music and
film and literature.'' What would that be? Black Sabbath songs,
Adam Sandler movies, and Tom Clancy novels? And already there's a
version of ``Who Wants to Be a Black Millionaire'' making its way
through cyberspace. A sampling of the questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Which civil rights leader is depicted on the front of many
church fans?
</P>
<P>
   A. Malcolm X
</P>
<P>
   B. Jesse Jackson
</P>
<P>
   C. Martin Luther King, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   D. Al Sharpton
</P>
<P>
   _ Someone who is jealous is often referred to as what?
</P>
<P>
   A. A buster
</P>
<P>
   B. A mark
</P>
<P>
   C. A pimp
</P>
<P>
   D. A player hater
</P>
<P>
   _ What phrase was coined by W.E.B. DuBois?
</P>
<P>
   A. The talented tenth
</P>
<P>
   B. The five percent nation
</P>
<P>
   C. Forty acres and a mule
</P>
<P>
   D. The few, the proud, the brave
</P>
<P>
   (The answers are C, D, and A.)
</P>
<P>
   We'll see in coming weeks if Philbin's plea is answered or if
more drastic measures are needed in this brave new age of
affirmative action TV. Hope to see ya soon, Reege. In the meantime,
get ready for some disgruntled white guy to file a lawsuit claiming
reverse discrimination when an equally qualified woman or person of
color finally gets his or her chance in the hot seat.

MARIAN ANDERSON, IN MUSICAL PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MARIAN ANDERSON 
A Singer's Journey 
By Allan Keiler 
Scribner, 447 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the icons of America in the 20th century is the image of
contralto Marian Anderson singing on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial in Washington, after she had been barred from singing in
Constitution Hall because of her race.
</P>
<P>
   This event, in 1939, a milestone in the nation's civil rights
struggle, lifted Anderson to a symbolic status that she had never
sought and that she felt uncomfortable with _ though she bore her
symbolic status with dignity right to the end of her singing
career, 26 years later, and indeed to her death in 1993, at the age
of 96.
</P>
<P>
   The great value of Allan Keiler's new biography of Anderson is
that it aims to place the focus where Anderson always wanted it to
be, on her musical accomplishments. In nearly every photo in
Keiler's section of illustrations, Anderson looks stiff,
uncomfortable, and posed _ except in an outstanding image from a
recital in Goshen, Ind., an image that catches her as she sang;
music was her natural element.
</P>
<P>
   Keiler, a professor of music at Brandeis University, wrote with
the cooperation of Anderson's nephew, the conductor James DePreist,
and met with Anderson herself on two occasions in the months before
her death.
</P>
<P>
   In a fascinating appendix Keiler summarizes her repertory, which
was far larger than even her substantial recorded legacy might
indicate. What she sang is amazing _ and so is what she didn't. She
never had the opportunity to sing the Bach Passions or the Verdi
Requiem, and she sang Mendelssohn's ``Elijah'' only once (here in
Boston, with Roland Hayes as Obediah and Henry T. Burleigh as the
prophet).
</P>
<P>
   Keiler's emphasis on Anderson's artistic accomplishments does
not lead him to stint on re-creating the controversy and drama of
her life _ her struggle to gain a musical education against all the
odds, and to establish herself before the world musical public; her
prolonged efforts to master the German language and the
international song literature; her marriage to the architect
Orpheus Fisher; her initial failure in New York; her successes in
Europe, particularly Scandinavia; her triumphant return to America;
the Lincoln Memorial Concert; her debut at the Metropolitan Opera,
the first appearance of an African-American singer there; her
goodwill trip to Asia, documented by Edward R. Murrow on
television; her farewell tour; her public and private life after
the close of her career. All these are part of the Anderson myth,
familiar from countless retellings, including her own ghost-written
autobiography, ``My Lord, What a Morning.'' What Keiler's carefully
researched accounts add is light, shade, depth, perspective,
context.
</P>
<P>
   He also marshals a number of facts that were never public
knowledge. Only at the time of Anderson's death was it revealed
that she had shaved 5 years off her age throughout her career;
Keiler accounts for the missing years when Anderson had to drop out
of school to help support her family. Kosti Vehanen, Anderson's
collaborative pianist from 1930-40, returned to Finland after a
sexual indiscretion, so Franz Rupp became Anderson's accompanist
for the next quarter-century. Keiler doesn't make a point of it,
but it is nice to learn that Anderson stayed in touch with Vehanen
and visited him every time her trips took her to Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   Some facts prove elusive. Keiler's account of the Lincoln
Memorial concert occupies an entire chapter, but he doesn't answer
a question this reader has always wondered about. Eleanor Roosevelt
contributed to the fame of this event by resigning from the
Daughters of the American Revoluton, which owned Constitution Hall.
It's very clear that race was the reason; dates ``unavailable'' to
Anderson proved to be open to the Polish pianist Paderewski. But
the DAR has always argued that the hall was unavailable on that
particular Easter Sunday because of a commitment to the National
Symphony. Was there such a commitment, and did the National
Symphony concert actually take place?
</P>
<P>
   Keiler writes straightforwardly and sometimes eloquently, but he
has not been copy-edited with sufficient care: The names of Rudolf
Bing, who took credit for bringing Anderson to the Met, and of Max
Rudolf, the conductor who actually made it happen, are consistently
misspelled. Keiler ``reads'' the newsreels of the Lincoln Memorial
concert with sensitivity. ``Those moments of hushed expectancy
before Anderson began to sing are there on film, moments in which
Anderson seems so vulnerable and alone, so nearly terrified of the
awesomeness of the occasion, that those around her must have
wondered if she would be able to sing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The music transforms her almost immediately. With her eyes
closed and her head raised proudly, a look of determination takes
over.'' But only rarely does Keiler let himself listen to
Anderson's recordings with comparable attention, and those
recordings are what bear the strongest continuing witness to her
greatness. (In the liner notes to some recent CDs, he writes with
more insight into her singing than he does here.) The result is a
damaging lacunagap in a book that sets out to concentrate on
Anderson the artist: This is a very good book about a great woman
and a great musician, but there isn't much music in it.

UN'S TOP MAN IN LEBANON HOPES FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAQOURA, Lebanon _ In Timur Goksel's office at the United
Nations' peacekeeping force headquarters, a two-way radio was
crackling with urgent messages from the field: ``Warning. Warning.
Operational activity at the following AORs.''
</P>
<P>
   Goksel listened and jotted down the codes and coordinates of the
``AORs,'' the UN ``areas of responsibility.'' He explained that
Israeli warplanes were at that moment slamming missiles into the
chalky, terraced hillsides of south Lebanon where Hezbollah
guerrillas hide out.
</P>
<P>
   This is the hit-and-run war that has become chillingly routine
here, even during flare-ups like the one that began 10 days ago.
And after 21 years of monitoring and surviving the fighting, Goksel
is the most plugged in _ if not the most pivotal _ man in south
Lebanon, the last active front in a half century of Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Goksel, 56, is the senior adviser of the United Nations Interim
Forces in Lebanon. UNIFIL, now 4,500 strong, has been ``interim''
since 1978, and Goksel has been here since the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   His insights into the conflict are widely respected. Despite the
escalation that began last week and continued through Monday, he
said, the fighting is at a crossroads. Pressure is mounting on
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has vowed to have Israeli
troops out of Lebanon by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to end as soon as everyone thinks it is,''
he warned. ``But it is going to end, and we should be preparing for
that. The aftermath could be a very difficult scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Goksel's job is a blend of doing political and military analysis
for the UN Security Council and providing humanitarian aid to
Lebanese civilians caught in the middle of Israel's declared
``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Any journalist or diplomat who has been into ``the zone'' _ a
nine-mile-wide tract that Israel occupies _ knows Goksel is the
nerve center. Some say he can broker a cease-fire over the
telephone, although Goksel scoffs at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   He is certainly the only man in the world who travels freely
across the deadly boundary between Israel and south Lebanon. In one
recent day, he met with Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim
Sneh in the morning in his Tel Aviv headquarters, then in the
afternoon traveled to meet the regional commander of Hezbollah's
guerrilla army, Sheikh Kaouk, in a secret location in Lebanon's
port city of Tyre. And, he said, he made it home in time to pick up
his kids from after-school sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all gets a bit surreal,'' Goksel said.
</P>
<P>
   His portfolio allows him to meet all sides, and he often ends up
carrying messages between them.
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized, ``This is not shuttle diplomacy. Ours is very
practical work. We are trying to save the lives of the people
caught in the way. . . . And we've been doing this for a long time.
Too long.''
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, he has won respect in high places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timur wants to preserve his access. If he becomes
controversial, that ends,'' said a senior adviser to Barak on
Lebanon and one of Israel's most experienced diplomats, who spoke
on the condition he not be identified. ``So he has mastered the art
of listening a lot and saying little.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is honest. He is fair. And he is direct,'' said Hezbollah
commander Kaouk in an interview last year. ``This is the basis of
the respect that people hold for him.''
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues say Goksel is a man obsessed, and that he can be
dangerous to cross. Tall and notoriously gruff, he has had run-ins
with UNIFIL force commanders, and outlasted them all.
</P>
<P>
   He counts as his proudest achievement the slow return to south
Lebanon of native villagers. When he arrived in 1978 there were
only 5,000 people in the zone. The villages were desolate fiefdoms
of warlords in Lebanon's 20-year civil war. today, there are
500,000 in the area under UNIFIL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're building homes, returning to schools, and starting
families,'' Goksel said. ``They trust that this fighting is going
to end someday, and that in the meantime we will protect them. That
makes us feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fighting is not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tuesday morning, and it had already been ``one hell of a
week,'' as Goksel put it. It began Jan. 30 with the assassination
of the field commander of the pro-Israeli militia, the South
Lebanon Army. The bomb attack by Hezbollah was a devastating blow
to morale for the SLA, a proxy army whose soldiers are on Israel's
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the SLA and Israeli brass were burying the commander
Monday, news came that three Israeli soldiers had been killed in a
Hezbollah ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli retaliation was inevitable, but the will to sustain such
casualties seems to be fading.
</P>
<P>
   The recently renewed Syrian-Israel peace talks have also hit a
snag, but Goksel said they still have momentum. There can be no
lasting peace in Lebanon, he added, without an agreement between
Syria and Israel. Syria, a close and controlling military ally of
Lebanon, has some 35,000 troops stationed there. In the end, Israel
is expected to give up the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in
the 1967 Six-Day War in exchange for peace with Syria and an end to
the Israel-Lebanon conflict, and Goksel says all sides in this
intricately webbed conflict have never been closer to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Goksel is driven to glean facts, to sort truths from the lies
and rumors put out by the various sides of this opaque conflict. He
seems to get it right more than most.
</P>
<P>
   The ``big misconception'' he said he was fielding last week was
Israel's assertion that the stepped-up attacks by Hezbollah were
ordered by Syria in an effort to derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah hates to be told they are doing someone else's
bidding,'' he said. ``They are focused on forcing Israel out of
their country. That is why they have been successful. The Israelis
have a hard time understanding this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Israel does withdraw, UNIFIL may still have an important
peacekeeping role in the vacuum of power that probably would
follow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But UNIFIL has its hands full right now, with Hezbollah
increasingly using UNIFIL positions as shields for rocket attacks
on Israel, putting UNIFIL troops in harm's way when Israel strikes
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our men are being put in a lot of danger these days,'' Goksel
said.
</P>
<P>
   A former lieutenant in the army of his native Turkey, Goksel
speaks in the cadence of a military man. His father was a Turkish
Air Force colonel and military attache to Washington. Goksel went
to high school there and perfected his English _ with all the buzz
of the beltway.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Israel's coastal city of Haifa with its trendy cafes
and bars and Miami-style architecture. He and his wife, Nilgun,
have two children, Zeyneb, 10, and Emir, 12.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 a.m every workday he drops the children off at a school
bus that takes them to the American International School in
Herzliya. He then drives along the coast to the concertina wire and
machine-gun turrets of the Rosh Hanikra border post.
</P>
<P>
   He continues into ``the zone'' along roads patrolled by Israeli
and SLA tanks and routinely booby-trapped with Hezbollah's deadly
road-side bombs. A blue-bereted UN soldier salutes him sharply at
the UN compound in Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
   In his office, a green Kevlar combat vest was slung over a desk
chair. Well-worn army boots, caked in dried mud, were stashed under
his desk. He lit a Marlboro and turned up the volume a bit on a CD
player pulsing with the Cuban beat of ``Buena Vista Social Club,''
and sipped his coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, a bookcase sagged with documents, the accounting of
21 years of fighting: 77 UNIFIL soldiers killed in action, along
with about 1,500 Hezbollah fighters, 400 SLA troops, 250 Israeli
soldiers; and along the way, hundreds of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Goksel lived through it all. He remembers 1982, when UN forces
futilely watched as Israel's war machine _ 1,200 tanks, 4,000
armored vehicles, and 90,000 troops _ invaded Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   He'll never forget the first horrifying dispatches of massive
Israeli bombardment of a UN compound in the village of Qana. The
April 1996 bombardment that killed 104 Lebanese civilians, most of
them women and children, was ``by far the most traumatic day'' in
his tenure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he was working two phones. On one line was a ``very
high ranking official'' in the Israeli Defense Ministry. On the
other was a Maronite priest whose parishioners, all SLA families,
were worried because Islamic militants of Hezbollah in nearby
villages were celebrating the death of the SLA commander.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he hung up, his mobile phone chirped. It was a Lebanese
journalist with a rumor, proven false within a half-hour, that a
roadside bomb had killed more Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Goksel flipped the receiver back up on his Motorola phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile phones have done a lot to exacerbate the tension,'' he
said. ``Things start clicking on mobile phones . . . and very fast
we can have a big problem. I miss the days when I used to have the
only phone in south Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This conflict is not over yet,'' he sighed. ``It's going to
take some time. But I'll be here to put the lights out when it's
really over.''

MORE COMFORT FOR FLIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is good news for air travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Two airlines, American and British Airways, will make
improvements that should make flying in economy class a bit more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Most airline improvements benefit first- or business-class
travelers, but these affect those of us in the back of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   American is removing two rows of economy-class seating to
provide up to five extra inches of legroom. The first aircraft with
the roomier coach cabin goes into service Saturday, and all planes
will have the seating within a year. The new ergonomically designed
seats will have six-way adjustable leather headrests.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways is making the biggest change in the comfort
level of its planes, including the introduction of a fourth class
of service _ World Traveller Plus _ that will offer more space and
facilities than other economy products, as well as a doubled
hand-baggage allowance.
</P>
<P>
   World Traveller Plus will have its own cabin, with wider seats
and greater legroom than the present World Traveller economy-class
seating. Economy passengers will find new seats, seatback video,
and a focus on family travelers that will include ``feed families
first'' in-flight toys for the young set.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is also offering a ``Lounge in the Sky'' for its
business class Club World, with a fully flat bed for those who need
to work and sleep in private on long-haul trips. The bed features a
6-foot bed, with a seat pitch of 73 inches, 50 percent more than
now and, the airline says, more than a foot more than its leading
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Both Club World and World Traveller Plus will also have added
amenities, including in-seat power and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways is planning to spend about $970 million in the
next two years to make these and other changes, including a
revamped first-class cabin, a totally refurbished Concorde,
upgrades at airport terminals for check-in and lounges, and more
entertainment choices.
</P>
<P>
   While all these enhancements are nice, they could mean higher
prices for economy-class travelers. British Airways said its Plus
service will be ``at an affordable premium for the cost-conscious
traveler.'' While American says its better seating will not affect
prices, having fewer seats could mean fewer discounted fares.
</P>
<P>
   Another improvement on American, at least for first-class
passengers on long-haul flights, is headsets that not only give
improved sound quality but cut airline noise by some 60 percent.
The headsets made by Framingham-based Bose are quite comfortable,
and who knows, maybe someday they'll work their way to the back of
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Air surcharge
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you're paying for an airline ticket, expect a $20
surcharge on domestic round-trip flights. The airlines say the
surcharge is for added fuel costs. It does not show up in the price
of the ticket but, like taxes and other airport fees, is added to
the ticket as a separate cost. Reportedly not all airlines are
charging the fee, so check with your airline when buying a ticket.

Senior deals
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Single travelers will find no single-supplement fees on selected
all-inclusive tours from Grand Circle Travel. ``Single travelers
represent about one-third of our business,'' said Mark Frevert of
Grand Circle. ``In addition to offering these select departures
with no single-supplement fees, we will also pair together single
travelers who are willing to share, at no additional cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyatt Hotels are offering seniors 62 and over new rates that are
up to 50 percent off regular room rates. The rates, most in the $99
to $129 range, are available at 94 domestic Hyatt properties.

   During World War II the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon, a
village in the center of France, rescued 4,000 Jews. In June, a
tour sponsored by the American Friends of the College Cevenol will
explore the area, a volcanic and unspoiled region 3,300 feet in the
Massif Central. While there, they will meet with villagers featured
in the US Holocaust Museum's permanent exhibit and film. College
Cevenol is an international high school funded since the war by
interested Americans and the French government. The tour also
visits Avignon and Provence. The cost is $1,380 a person. For
information, call Eveline Weyl, one of the tour leaders, at
781-862-6847.

Carnival season
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Islanders will again be dancing in the streets of St.
Thomas in celebration of the 48th annual Carnival. This year's
carnival, April 8-May 6, will feature nonstop music, dancing, and
festivities centered on the theme ``Jump Up and Sway, It's Carnival
for Y2K.'' The St. Thomas Carnival is one of the largest festivals
in the Caribbean.

   Golf is just $12 a day on Jekyll Island in Georgia. The greens
fee deal is good through March 1 for golfers who stay at
participating accommodations. The island has three 18-hole courses
and 10 hotels, many of which offer a Sweet Spot golf package that
combines golf and accommodations at a reduced rate. Golf cart fees
of $14 a person are required per 18 holes. For information, call
877-453-5955 or visit www.jekyllisland.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Swissotel Boston is offering a Breakfast in Bed package at
$139 for two that includes accommodations and complimentary room
service with breakfast delivered to your room, or if you prefer,
breakfast for two in the Cafe Suisse, which specializes in Swiss
cuisine. For information on the Friday-Sunday package, good through
March 31, call 800-63-SWISS.
</P>
<P>
   The Ciboney Ocho Rios spa and beach resort in Jamaica has a
Diamond Package that for $99 a person above the standard provides
an upgrade to a Diamond Villa suite (all-inclusive rack rates begin
at $240 a person through March 31, and $205 April 1-Dec. 22). The
villa package includes an attendant to prepare breakfast, do light
washing and ironing, and pack. The package also includes an
in-villa romantic dinner for two with a personal balladeer, and
five spa treatments a day per person. The nine-year-old resort is
undergoing a complete renovation, which ``will not disturb the
guest experience,'' said Peter Trench, co-general manager. For
information, call 800-CIBONEY.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
More flights
</P>
<P>
   Travelers seeking the sun of the Caribbean now have added air
service to the islands. TWA has not only increased its daily
service to San Juan from Boston and other US cities, but also
expanded that service with connecting flights from San Juan to St.
Thomas, St. Croix, Tortola, Virgin Gorda, and St. Maarten. Cape
Air, which also serves Cape Cod, is now offering hourly service

BUSH GOES ON THE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON  &UR;  &LR; -- George W. Bush's assault on Senator John
McCain in pivotal South Carolina has a veneer of substance, but in
fact it is personal. McCain is being portrayed as a Washington
insider hypocrite, an influence-peddling corporate jet passenger in
league with the hated liberals in politics and the media to keep
taxes high and government huge. Bush avoided this kind of behavior
in New Hampshire because it could not have survived scrutiny. The
calculation that conservatives in South Carolin are dumber and
easier to manipulate is suspect, however.
</P>
<P>
   In just the first few days it has already boomeranged once, over
McCain's record on veterans' issues. If it boomerangs once more,
Bush could easily lose the Feb. 19 primary and with it another
layer of his once-assumed inevitability as the kind of Republican
leader who can appeal across ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   And it deserves to boomerang, because the lynchpin of Bush's
assault on McCain's character _ economics _ is patently fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush assault commenced Friday, when he began broadcasting
the first, honest-to-badness attack commercial of the 2000
campaign. The key sentence: ``McCain's own economic advisor says he
supports Bush's plan that earmarks $2 trillion to protect Social
Security, pays down debt and gives a real tax cut for every
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of that sentence is false. The statement reflects a
continual need by Bush for the trappings of respectability for a
tax proposal that deserves none.
</P>
<P>
   The ``economic adviser'' is actually a supporter, Washington
lobbyist and former Minnesota Congressman Vin Weber, a onetime
acolyte of Jack Kemp on economics and Newt Gingrich on politics,
who doesn't advise McCain on policy and who made an innocuously
gracious comment about Bush's plan that the governor's campaign has
directly misstated as support.
</P>
<P>
   Another falsehood in the commercial is more substantive. The
truth is that Bush's plan ``earmarks'' nothing, not a dime. There
is a tax proposal that would cost at least $1.4 trillion over the
next ten years, and a pork-filled but otherwise vague proposal to
spend even more on the military than is programmed for the next
several years by the Clinton administration. Far from protecting
the Social Security system it is a dagger aimed right at its fiscal
heart.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush has done is falsely use the figure of $2 trillion as
if it were one concept, when in fact it is two. On the simpler
level, it represents the annual surpluses within Social Security
payroll taxes and benefits spending that are certain to accumulate
until the main impact of the Baby Boom generation's retirement
hits. Everybody running for president in both parties, as well as
the GOP Congress and the Clinton administration, supports the
retention of those surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain also favor the establishment of individual
investment accounts for future retirees, financed by a two
percentage-point cut in each willing individual's payroll tax. But
Bush has no way to finance the huge, upfront costs of such a
partial privatization except from within the system _ meaning by
definition future benefit cuts. So much for protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain difference stems from the concept of what could be a
second $2 trillion. This is the outer range of estimates of the
operating surpluses in the government outside Social Security that
could accumulate over the next decade. McCain doesn't believe it
for a second, while Bush clings to the figure like a life
preserver. For starters, half the figure would disappear without
deep budget cuts that neither Congress nor Clinton has been willing
to even propose, largely for good reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, McCain really does ``earmark'' whatever operating
surplus occurs by using percentages in his proposals: 60-plus
percent for Social Security (on top of the $2 trillion saved within
the system, thus making provision for investment accounts), another
ten percent for Medicare (ignored by Bush), and the rest for
national debt reduction (which also shores up the pension fund).
</P>
<P>
   The Bush commercial's claim about debt reduction is false by
comparison because there is no earmarking. And that ``real'' tax
cut would be an illusion for most Americans, its few dollars
drowned in the program cuts that would have to accompany it. It
would, however, be ``real'' for the one percent of income earners
who would get nearly 40 percent of the dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is, in short, preposterous. Lamer stuff has
worked before, but as this campaign goes down the stretch in South
Carolina, Bush sounds more desperate than determined. Wrong, too.

ON THE TRAIL OF CHOCOLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Participants in Boston's Original Old Town Trolley Chocolate
Tour get to taste a lot of that sweet, sinful stuff during a 2
1/2-hour, three-stop tour. But between stops they also learn a lot
from the trolley driver's narration. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   --Chocolate was originally a luxury enjoyed only by wealthy men.
</P>
<P>
   --Contrary to popular belief, dark chocolate has a milder
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   --The world's largest chocolate Easter egg weighed 4,484 pounds
and was made by an Australian company, according to the Guinness
Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   --The nation's first chocolate factory was established in
Dorchester around 1765. The Baker company stayed until 1965, when
operations were moved to Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   --Tollhouse Cookies were ``invented'' in 1930 by Ruth Wakefield
at the former Tollhouse Restaurant in Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   --The best-selling chocolate bar in America is Snickers.
</P>
<P>
   --Americans annually spend $13 billion on 3 billion pounds of
chocolate. That's an average of more than 11 1/2 pounds per person.
</P>
<P>
   (The Original Old Town Chocolate Trolley Tour is conducted every
Saturday and Sunday in February and March at 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.
from the Old Town Trolley Stop at the corner of Boylston and
Charles streets. Stops are at the Chocolate Bar Buffet at Le
Meridien Hotel, which features more than 25 items; the
Ritz-Carlton, where a surprise called Chocolate Obsession is in
store; and the Hampshire House, where roasted maple walnut
chocolate soup is prepared tableside. Along with the narration
there are chocolate-related sound bites, including the voices of
Willy Wonka, Lucille Ball, and my hero, Forrest Gump. The cost is
$50 a person. For more information or reservations, call
617-269-7150.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Here's a question from the tour: Which holiday
generates the most chocolate sales? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: A Boston company that markets specialty chocolate bars
is named Filthy Rich Enterprises. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Tourism is an odd thing. You fly off to a strange land,
eagerly abandoning all the comforts of home, and then expend time
and money in a futile attempt to recapture the comforts that you
wouldn't have lost if you hadn't left home in the first place'' _
Bill Bryson in ``Neither Here Nor There.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's fractured English lesson: Escape magazine reports that a
foreign-born client of a speech pathologist was confused about the
``ou'' sound in English and had been calling his boss, Doug,
``Dog'' for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing sea creatures: It's not cheap but it sounds like fun _
and there will be no lines to wait in. When Discovery Cove opens in
Orlando, Fla., next summer, guests will have the opportunity to
swim and play with dolphins, rays, and many other fascinating sea
creatures. Admission to this reservations-only park is $179 plus
tax. The admission covers all attractions including the dolphin
swim, plus a meal, snorkel gear, wet suits, various amenities, and
a personal guide. It also includes a seven-day,
come-and-go-as-you-please ticket to SeaWorld Orlando, its sister
park across the street. For more information, call 877-4-DISCOVERY
or visit www.discoverycove.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
How's that again? In the version of the movie ``Get Shorty'' that
was shown on airplanes, the phrase ``plane crash'' mysteriously
became ``train crash.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Snappy slogan: ``Why go schlocko, when you can go to Morocco?''
asks Club Valtur, an all-inclusive resort in Morocco. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pueblo joke (Taos, N.M.):
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you from?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Long stagecoach ride, huh?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wonder if they used a ruler: The United States covers approximately
100,877,060,000,000 square feet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Halloween. Runners-up, in order, are
Christmas/Hanukkah/New Year's, Easter, Valentine's Day, and
Mother's Day.

   FRANCE-ABORTION-PILL (Trappes, France) _ The students stopping
in at the high school infirmary on a recent morning were making
their usual requests for aspirin or cold medicine. But soon they
will also be able to pick up morning after pills. Last month,
France became the first country to give its school nurses the right
to dispense emergency contraception pills. The pills are to be
available in both high schools and junior high schools. Although
the nurses are advised to make efforts to inform the child's

LIKELY NEW EPA OFFICIAL HAS AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR N.E. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Moments after her bio was faxed to reporters, Mindy
Lubber, the acting New England administrator of the US
Environmental Protection Agency, asked that it be changed and faxed
again.
</P>
<P>
   The second version was identical to the first, except for one
addition. ``They always forget the important stuff,'' Lubber wrote
on the bio. ``Ms. Lubber is married and has two wonderful children,
ages five and ten.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is expected to make another alteration soon,
taking ``acting'' out of Lubber's title and officially naming her
the next New England administrator, replacing John DeVillars, who
left last month. It is New England's most influential environmental
job, one that has a huge effect on what happens ecologically in the
region, and thus politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
   Lubber has already put forth an ambitious, if familiar, agenda
for the year. It includes improving air and water quality,
maintaining a tough enforcement posture while assisting companies
and communities in complying with laws, enhancing the agency's
efforts on children's health, and communicating better with those
outside of the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of Lubber's environmental vision, and the premise
of her agenda, is the well-being of her children, Abe and Jessie.
``If I'm passionate about making sure my kids walk out the door in
the morning with their hats and jackets on, then I ought to be just
as passionate about the quality of water they drink,'' she said in
an interview at her Congress Street office.
</P>
<P>
   That focus can be traced to the 10 years Lubber spent lobbying
at the State House a few decades ago for the Massachusetts Public
Interest Research Group, championing such causes as the bottle
bill. ``I still consider myself a strong activist,'' said Lubber,
46. ``I want to push the envelope. I want to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Foy, the Conservation Law Foundation's executive director,
said that Lubber's ``levelheadedness,'' coupled with her boundless
enthusiasm, should serve her well as she directs the 800 staffers
of the complex, evolving, and relentlessly scrutinized agency,
which is striving to become more innovative in protecting New
England's environment.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA underwent a major, and difficult, reorganization under
DeVillars, who took charge in 1994. The changes left some dissent
in the ranks. Environmentalists now criticize the agency for being
too soft on polluters, while industry and government officials
criticize it for being too tough.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is embroiled in contentious issues all across New
England. In Massachusetts, they include the proposed runway
addition at Logan Airport, which the EPA opposes, and the cleanup
of the Housatonic River in Pittsfield and the Massachusetts
Military Reservation on Cape Cod, both of which it supports.
Depending on who wins the White House in November, Lubber could be
replaced a year from now by a political appointee of the next
president's choosing.
</P>
<P>
   And while Lubber is better known in the EPA than DeVillars was
when he arrived, she is not nearly as well-known outside of the
agency as was the former Massachusetts Environmental Affairs
secretary. She is especially foreign to the business community at a
time when EPA administrators must increasingly forge partnerships
with nearly every entity outside of the agency, and especially
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many expect Lubber to thrive. ``It's been a good six
years for John, with a lot accomplished, and I expect over the
coming year that the legacy will continue,'' said Bob Zimmerman,
executive director of the Charles River Watershed Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lubber was hired at the EPA after DeVillars became New England
administrator. She was press secretary for former governor Michael
Dukakis in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Lubber said she wants to spend more time meeting with interest
groups. She said she believes environmental problems are more
complex than they once were and require more sophisticated
solutions.

   ``All it takes is one alpha particle whizzing through at the
speed of light and it knocks out the entire component,'' said
Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   David Desrocher of California-based Aerospace Corporation, a
satellite services company, found that three satellites were
temporarily incapacitated on a single day in 1994, including one
that was not fully operable for seven months. During the solar
maximum, he recently told Popular Mechanics magazine, ``There is a
possibility that a satellite or two could fail entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Pentagon, the energy industry has procedures to ward
off dangerous power surges _ but only if they get enough warning.
Kappenman, whose firm Metatech just installed an early storm
warning system for the British power company, National Grid, said
many utilities don't know a geomagnetic storm is about to hit until
it is too late to react.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of education that needs to be done in the
industry yet,'' Kappenman said.
</P>
<P>
   However, New England utility officials say the unusual number of
scorched transformers in this region long ago taught them to pay
attention to the sun, even if that means occasional false alarms.
At the first sign of a possible geomagnetic storm, they cut voltage
on the most vulnerable lines to prevent an overwhelming power
surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know enough about solar storms to know what the impacts
are,'' said Jim Sinclair, spokesman for ISO-New England, which runs
the region's electricity distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   Solar storms also threaten animals that can't prepare. Animals
such as whales and dolphins and even lowly bacteria may rely
partially on the Earth's magnetic field to navigate, some
scientists believe. When the field is disturbed by a solar storm,
according to this theory, living things become disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only bacteria have been found to contain
magnetically-sensitive internal organs, but homing pigeons seem to
get lost during geomagnetic storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we organize pigeon races, I look to see what the space
forecast is,'' explained Kent Hughes, a New York-based pigeon racer
and researcher. His just completed Pigeon Project found that
disturbances in the magnetic field help explain why large numbers
of pigeons sometimes disappear during races.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, airline pilots and passengers are beginning to worry
about excess radiation from the sun. A private company, In-Flight
Radiation Protection Services Inc., recently set up a hot line,
1-877-SUNFLARE, to let people know about radiation risks and the
times when solar storms cause radiation peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say radiation exposure is slightly higher than
normal during a long plane flight, but still tiny unless the plane
flies at extremely high altitudes over the Polar Region during a
solar storm. Even then, the main risk is to flight crews and
passengers who fly more than 75,000 miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the dangers, space weather watchers are anxious for
the solar maximum to begin. With all the satellites and researchers
ready to witness the event, they are ready to take a leap forward
in understanding the sun's weather, and to better prepare for it in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem now with space weather prediction is that they are
pretty lousy at it,'' said NASA's Withbroe. ``Between this maximum
and the next maximum, if we study it properly with this kind of
robust system, we should really make tremendous progress in
understanding how the sun varies and how the Earth reacts.''

INCREASE IN SUN SPOTS MAY DISRUPT EARTHLY EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Luckily, no astronaut was trolling around the moon that day in
October 1989 when the sun bombarded the lunar surface with enough
radiation to kill a person in his tracks. Though the sun appeared
normal to the untrained eye, it released a burst of gases so
powerful that even airplane passengers near the North Pole absorbed
unusually high radiation doses.
</P>
<P>
   Six million people in Montreal, Quebec, also felt the invisible
power of the sun that year. A solar storm disturbed the magnetic
field around the Earth, burning out electrical transmission
equipment as far south as New Jersey and plunging Montreal into
darkness for nine hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those poor (electric company) operators went from virtually
quiet conditions to blackout in about 90 seconds,'' recalled John
Kappenman, a Minnesota-based consultant to the power industry.
``There was literally nothing you could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun may appear to be innocent and unchanging, but its
weather is every bit as complicated _ and sometimes as dangerous _
as Earth's. The blackouts and radiation storms of 1989 marked the
peak of an 11-year weather cycle, a time when frequent violent
storms spewed great barrages of matter into space without warning,
disrupting anything in its path from electronic devices to animals'
sense of direction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, space weather forecasters warn that solar disruptions like
those of 1989 may soon return as the sun approaches another ``solar
maximum.'' Sometime this summer or fall, the face of the sun will
reach a peak of dark areas called sunspots, beginning two to three
years of solar storms that may buffet the Earth's magnetic field
and atmosphere, and shower space with radiation that can be
dangerous at high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   People in the Northeast have particular reason to keep an eye on
the sun, both because of geography and geology. The region is
relatively close to the magnetic North Pole, where solar
disturbances often enter the Earth's atmosphere, and the granite
bedrock below readily conducts surges of electricity. As a result,
one study found that the Northeast suffered 60 percent more
electrical transformer failures than the US average.
</P>
<P>
   Though NASA scientists say the solar maximum this year may not
be as potent as the last one, society is more vulnerable to damage
today because so much more technology orbits the Earth. Hundreds of
satellites, most of them used for telecommunications, have been
launched since 1989, while construction crews are scheduled to
begin building the International Space Station, which will orbit
Earth later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Americans have gotten a taste of what space weather can
do to daily life. In May 1988, 45 million pagers as well as
pay-at-the-pump gasoline station service failed when a
telecommunications satellite called Galaxy 4 abruptly went dead.
Though the sun's role remains unclear, the failure of the satellite
followed an unusual surge of electrons, evidence that space weather
hastened its demise.
</P>
<P>
   But the weathermen at the Space Environment Center in Colorado
say poor pager service is small potatoes compared to what else the
sun can damage. In a worst-case scenario, they say solar storms
could knock out all high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of the
Earth or expose airplane passengers in northern latitudes (near the
North Pole) to the equivalent of 100 chest X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Space weather forecasters concede, given their limited knowledge
about solar weather patterns, the solar maximum could turn out to
be more hype than disaster. But, minimally, they say that solar max
could play havoc with construction of the space station by making
spacewalks dangerous, and also cause isolated power outages and
satellite crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely expect we will see episodes of days to weeks over
the next three or four or five years when there will be lots of
adverse solar activity and geomagnetic storms . . . and some very
noticeable effects on many types of systems,'' warned Joseph
Kunches, lead forecaster of the Space Environment Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the growing threat of solar storms has created
a golden chance for sun researchers, who are still trying to answer
basic questions about how the sun works. NASA plans to launch four
satellites starting next month that will give them unprecedented,
new information, such as video of radioactive rays shooting from
the sun, and the shape of the Earth's magnetic field under solar
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to study the solar maximum like it's never been
studied before,'' said George Withbroe, director of NASA's
Sun-Earth Connection Program.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have known for millenia that the sun was not
unchanging, instead following a predictable cycle of gaining and
losing sunspots. When these spots were at their peak, people on the
ground often saw the aurora borealis, the colorful Northern Lights.
But, until recently, few suspected the sun was responsible for
other strange occurences _ like scrambled messages on
trans-Atlantic telegraph cables.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, of course, that the sun sends far more than light
and heat across the 93 million-mile void to the Earth. The sun is
an extraordinary furnace, putting out enough energy every second to
power the United States for the next 9 million years, but it also
produces enormous burps and hiccups of charged particles and
radiation that can reach Earth in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watches the night sky can see the impact of solar
weather on the heavens: The tails of comets always point away from
the sun as the turbulent solar wind sweeps over them. The magnetic
field around the Earth is similarly shaped like a teardrop,
determining the magnetic forces on Earth that pull a compass needle
to the north.
</P>
<P>
   As solar winds vary _ as they do during a solar storm _ both
magnetism and the behavior of electricity on Earth can change. The
aurora borealis, for example, occurs as charged solar particles
build up inside the ``tail'' of the magnetic field, creating
streams of white, red and yellow light as they race to Earth at 300
miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect of a solar storm can, on the other hand, be quite
serious, bringing harmful radioactive gamma rays to the upper
atmosphere, or causing electrical surges through the ground that
can burn out power transmission equipment. In addition, they can
bombard satellites with particles, something that hastened the
crash of the Skylab space station in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Though solar storms can come anytime, they are much more likely
to occur during the solar maximum when there are more sunspots,
relatively cool spots that can be launching pads for radioactive
gas explosions called solar flares. In addition, sunspots often
foreshadow other storms, such as coronal mass ejections that
release a billion tons of matter into space.
</P>
<P>
   However, space weather forecasters admit their knowledge is too
crude to predict exactly when the Earth will feel the effects of
the solar max. So far, in fact, the uptick in sunspots has had
relatively little effect on Earth, perhaps because solar particles
have simply gone in other directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One funny thing about predicting solar activity is some people
actually expect you to get it right,'' said David Hathaway, a
researcher at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, who
had expected more geomagnetic storms by now.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a wide array of space-sensitive businesses must
keep track of space weather. Indeed, a million computer users check
the Space Environment Center forecast each week, preparing for the
solar hurricane that may _ or may not _ come.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials might be among the most prepared,
since they long ago hardened their satellites against particle
bombardment and set up the 55th Space Weather Squadron in Colorado
to give advance warning of coming disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   The military weathermen admit they sometimes predict disasters
that don't come, but they always take the threat seriously, because
the consequences, such as faulty readings in radar that monitors
aircraft and missile launches, are so grave.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial satellite operators generally are much less ready
for solar storms. Not only are these satellites _ used for global
position systems, cell phones, and other private purposes _ far
more numerous than they were in 1989, they are less armored against
high-energy particles, and contain smaller electronic parts that
are more easily damaged.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What happens when Cleveland meets Fisherman's
Wharf? Consider ``San Francisco at the Wharf,'' a
``reality-based,'' ``interactive'' theme park proposed by Cleveland
developers for Pier 45.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors would enter the 71,000-square-foot San Francisco
history attraction through a ``highly themed indoor esplanade''
filled with ``themed adventures'' and ``food an beverage
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the proposal by the Malrite Co. of Cleveland says,
and it sounds perfect for the themy side of town.
</P>
<P>
   A street of ``diverse architectural styles'' of San Francisco
will feature ``vaudevillian actors straight out of Barbary Coast
days,'' or perhaps ``a `beatnik' reading in the spirit of Jack
Kerouac or Allen Ginsberg.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ``rich multimedia tour,'' visitors will be shaken by a
simulated 1906 earthquake, join the Merry Pranksters on Ken Kesey's
bus, ride through the Summer of Love and visit City Lights
Bookstore without having to walk to North Beach. They can learn
about the Bay and Wharf history with ersatz salt air blowing on
them, while protected from the real salt air just outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Malrite Co., which developed Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame and Museum, has spent $41,736 lobbying the Port Commission
for approval of this $30 million development on the underutilized
Pier 45.
</P>
<P>
   Malrite's proposal modestly says, ``While there is no substitute
for experiencing the city, San Francisco at the Wharf provides a
year-round, day and night alternative, particularly during
inclement weather.''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to San Francisco, and it isn't Paris?
</P>
<P>
   The Port Commission wants something at Pier 45 that will attract
locals to the Wharf, not just tourists. Many San Franciscans have
never been to Fisherman's Wharf. To them, it's as exotic as, well,
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt locals will find fake poetry readings at a fake City
Lights Bookstore as an acceptable ``day and night alternative'' to
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked the president of Malrite, Dennis Barrie, if this
would be just another tourist trap like Pier 39, he said, ``We used
Pier 39 as a non-model.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the test is to look at the resumes of the people working
on the project. ``They're really grounded in substance and
education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Malrite has an impressive group of designers.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie has a doctorate in American history and is former museum
director for the Smithsonian Institution. He also was the director
of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, where he staged a
controversial exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in candy-coating our stories,'' Barrie said.
``We examine Chinese immigration and the racial tensions of
modern-day San Francisco. ... You could tell the story of San
Francisco in a very vanilla way, but we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Barrie said something that made me wonder if I was being
too cynical about his company's proposal. ``It's interesting to
me,'' he said, ``that historians are less afraid of using
entertainment to teach history than the general public is.''
</P>
<P>
   One historical problem: Malrite wants to put tourists on Ken
Kesey's bus for a trip through recent San Francisco history, but
the first stop is backwards in time (a good trick even for the
Merry Pranksters) at a 1950s poetry reading featuring Lawrence
Ferlinghetti in his City Lights Bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   I called Kesey in Oregon to see if he knew his bus might be used
to take tourists tripping through time at Fisherman's Wharf. He
sounded a little grumpy, and just said ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first we've ever heard about it,'' said Kesey's
wife, Faye, who assured me the real bus was still in their barn.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti said he had no idea that his City Lights Bookstore
might be reproduced at the Wharf and that he, or some faux
Ferlinghetti, might be reading poetry there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the store is out there, so they're welcome to it,
as long as they have real books,'' Ferlinghetti said. ``I can see
what it's going to be, total kitsch, but we've encountered kitsch
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti had some suggestions for stocking a fake City
Lights at the Wharf, starting with Gray Brechin's ``Imperial San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm open to it,'' Barrie said. ``Now, if only we could
get the Grateful Dead to give their blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. And don't bet on easy approval by the Port
Commission.

   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ You have to love a city where the icon on
signs directing visitors to its attractions is none other than Dr.
Seuss's impish Cat in the Hat. And who can have anything but warm
feelings for the city where basketball was invented as an indoor
antidote to frigid winter days?
</P>
<P>
   Springfield has no lack of answers and options for the antsy on
a cold February day. The birthplace of both basketball and Dr.
Seuss, it's home to the Basketball Hall of Fame and the zoo a young
Theodore Seuss Geisel often visited with his park commissioner
father. Springfield also boasts a downtown cultural complex, the
Quadrangle, where the city's imposing main library and four museums
are grouped around a central green that is easily traversed even on
the nippiest of days.
</P>
<P>
   At the Basketball Hall of Fame, which draws visitors from around
the world, you learn that Dr. James Naismith invented the sport in
1891 to vanquish winter blahs.
</P>
<P>
   Naismith wanted to give bored students at the YMCA International
Training School (now Springfield College) an exciting game they
could play indoors with minimal equipment: a soccer ball and two
peach baskets. Within a few years alumni of the school, most of
whom became YMCA directors, had introduced Naismith's new sport
around the country and to many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   No solemn shrine, the Basketball Hall of Fame is a colorful,
vibrant place decorated with the multi-hued jerseys and jackets of
basketball greats. Illuminated panels depict great players and
plays. Films and videos of historic games and interviews with
legendary players and coaches run constantly. Interactive exhibits
include a free-throw area where visitors can practice their shots
and a room equipped with basketball video games.
</P>
<P>
   Historical displays focus on the game's early years, noting, for
instance, the role of the Harlem Globetrotters in popularizing the
sport. Here's where you learn that women's basketball initially
banned dribbling as unladylike. Among the basketball memorabilia on
display are Naismith's hand-scribbled 13 original rules and the
bronzed size 22 sneakers of Hall of Famer Bob Lanier, the awesome
6-foot-10-inch former center for the Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee
Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a mile away, the Zoo in Forest Park, home to
a barnyard, petting area, and collection of exotic animals, is
where young Teddy Geisel learned to love animals and draw them. It
is closed during the coldest part of the season, but reopens
February 19 with a program of school vacation activities. After
that, it will be open weekends until spring and then daily through
summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Geisel, a.k.a. Dr. Seuss, by the way, never lost touch with his
Springfield roots. One of his most popular books, ``And to Think
That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,'' was set on a downtown street
just a few blocks from the Quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
   The Quadrangle offers everything from high art to the lowdown on
what dinosaurs ate (sometimes each other) in its four distinct but
cooperating museums: George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum,
Springfield Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield Science Museum, and
Connecticut Valley Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts has a first-rate painting and sculpture
collection ranging from late medieval to contemporary American.
Dominating one gallery is the extraordinary ``Historical Monument
of the American Republic'' by the local 19th-century painter
Erastus Field, a huge canvas with 10 towers representing a
fantastical vision of American history. Abraham Lincoln, for
instance, is shown rising to heaven in a fiery chariot from the
central tower. The art museum also has a well-stocked gift shop and
a pleasant cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith Museum houses the personal collection of its namesake,
an engagingly but astute eccentric (he sported a huge forked beard
and usually wore a kimono) who was a 19th-century Springfield art
lover. It includes superb examples of Chinese and Japanese arts,
Islamic prayer rugs and 19th-century American paintings, among them
some fine examples of the Hudson River School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art From the Roof of the World,''a major exhibition of Tibetan
art _ which is characterized by brilliantly colored representations
of gods, goddesses, demons, and mythical creatures _ opened this
week at the two museums.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mystical Arts of Tibet'' exhibit at the fine arts museum
consists of more than 100 religious and secular art objects,
including scroll paintings, bronze statues, temple musical
instruments, rugs, jewelry, and altars _ about a third of them from
the personal collection of the Dalai Lama. Two Tibetan monks will
be at the museum from Feb.20 through April 30 and can be seen
creating ``mandala'' sand paintings, intricate traditional designs
symbolizing the Wheel of Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathmandu''a three-dimensional installation representing a
Tibetan temple, is on view in a gallery of the Smith Museum. It
consists of four brightly painted rooms containing statues of such
distinctively hued Tibetan deities as Green Tara and Black
Mahakala. Focal point of the temple is a 9-foot-tall gilded statue
of a seated Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   Less exotic (but fun) things are also happening at the other
Quadrangle museums.
</P>
<P>
   Eons before basketballs began bouncing off gymnasium floors, the
heavy tread of dinosaurs _ some of which had feet even larger than
Bob Lanier's _ shook the ground of the Connecticut Valley. Their
fossilized tracks can still be seen in several places in the area,
such as the Dinosaur Footprints site run by the Trustees of
Reservations on Route 5 in nearby Holyoke.
</P>
<P>
   The Science Museum exhibits a collection of smaller fossils in
its Dinosaur Hall. However, the centerpiece of the hall _ and a
particular favorite with children _ is a life-size fiberglass
replica of Tyrannosaurus Rex, the 20-foot-tall carnivore that
roamed the earth some 65 million years ago. The museum's African
Hall is dominated by ``Suicide Sam,'' a mounted bull elephant. The
museum is also home to a planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Valley historical museum has exhibits on local
history and archeology and displays portraits by regional folk
painters. A special millennial exhibition, ``Springfield Visions
and Visionaries,'' includes displays of the wide variety of things
manufactured in Springfield, including airplanes, automobiles,
motorcycles, firearms, board games, and shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Quadrangle are several unusual museums where visitors
to Springfield can also warmly while away a winter day.
</P>
<P>
   The Springfield Armory National Historic Site occupies one of
the historic buildings of the sprawling former U.S. arsenal, in
operation from 1794 to 1968. The arsenal once made most of the
rifles used by the U.S. Army. Exhibits include firearms from one of
the world's largest weapons collections. The museum also displays
innovative machinery developed at the arsenal that contributed to
the industrial revolution and made the Connecticut Valley the
nation's ``precision corridor.'' How prosperous Springfield became
in its industrial heyday can be seen in the McKnight District, near
the armory, where streets are lined with once grand 19th-century
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycle buffs might want to visit the Indian Motorcycle
Museum and Hall of Fame. The Indian, the country's first commercial
gasoline-powered motorcycle, was produced in Springfield from 1901
to 1953. It is considered one of the most beautiful motorcycles
ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, anyone who thinks ``Titanic'' was the greatest movie
ever made might want to check out the Titanic Historical Society
Museum in Indian Orchard, a Springfield suburb. The society has a
collection of more than 3,600 objects recovered from RMS Titanic.
But be warned. There are no autographed photos of Leonardo
DiCaprio.

POLITICAL TAUNTS MINE A PUERILE VEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential campaign season has been pretty tame so far,
languagewise, so we were probably overdue for something juicy.
Apparently we got it a week ago, when US Senator Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska and US Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan _ both
Bill Bradley supporters _ tried to speak on behalf of their guy at
a Gore rally in New Hampshire, and got dissed and dirtied for their
pains.
</P>
<P>
   While details are still in dispute, Kerrey has told some
reporters he was called a ``loser'' and a ``cripple,'' and a New
York Post report says Nadler was jeered as ``fatso.'' Both were
allegedly splattered with mud by Gore supporters (and here we
thought mudslinging was just a colorful metaphor).
</P>
<P>
   Nasty as these epithets are, they could be considered progress.
It's not so long ago that we had ``scumbag'' from US Representative
Dan Burton of Indiana, and ``Hymietown'' from Jesse Jackson. But
when a South Carolina state senator called the NAACP a bunch of
``retarded people'' last month, the candidates denounced his
language (though Bush had to think about it a bit too long,
considering that his mom probably told him 40 years ago not to use
retarded as an insult). Maybe the candidates have secretly pledged
to use only the words they picked up on the playground, and we'll
be hearing them trade insults like dork, dweeb, pond scum, and
four-eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Republican contenders seemed to be heading down
that road in the final New Hampshire debate, when they disputed
whether liking Nine Inch Nails was more reprehensible than moshing
to the music of Rage Against the Machine. Dudes, you wanted to say,
get a grip!
</P>
<P>
   In this latest dust-up, though, the focus is on cripple, and it
brought to mind an e-mail I got last year from Peter O'Hara of
Vineyard Haven. He objected to a sentence referring to
``aftereffects that leave many open-heart surgery patients mentally
hobbled,'' on the grounds that hobbled was the politically correct
cop-out. ``Writers . . . seem more and more reluctant to use the
perfectly good and ancient word cripple,'' he said. ``These words
are not interchangeable. You can be crippled without being hobbled,
or hobbled without being crippled.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point, it turns out, about the decline of cripple. In
the Globe, the word (in all its forms) appeared in only 60 percent
as many stories last month as in a comparable period 20 years ago.
(This is a very rough count, with no distinction between noun and
verb, literal and metaphorical, physiological and military uses of
the words. And it's true that cripple, noun and verb, is an ancient
word, first found in 10th-century English to mean a lame or
disabled person. But hobble is hardly a PC novelty: It shows up in
the 14th century, meaning to wobble, and hence, of a person, to
walk with a limp. So you can be both hobbled and crippled. Indeed,
one sample in the Oxford English Dictionary finds them together:
``Many cripples were seen hobbling about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbled, in some cases, is a temporary condition; a horse or cow
is hobbled by having two feet roped together so the animal can
move, but not take long enough strides to run away. (You're hobbled
when you try on shoes in the discount stores that yoke each pair
with a plastic tether.) And hobble seems milder than cripple: If
you deal the enemy a crippling blow, you probably win the conflict.
But there's plenty of overlap in their meanings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the political correctness issue _ well, long before PC
was invented, many of us learned that you didn't call people
cripples, as if that were the sum and substance of their being.
Even doctors, these days, are being taught not to call you ``the
kidney in Room 407'' _ at least not within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Applying that thinking to other conditions has brought some
cumbersome locutions, it's true _ ``people with disabilities,''
rather than ``the disabled,'' or ``people with AIDS'' rather than
``AIDS victims.'' But the point is to remind us that the handicap
is not the person (a point not easy, apparently, for humans to
grasp). Look at Stephen Hawking _ he's barely mobile, yet he can do
theoretical physics and ditch his wife for another woman. Crippled
is as crippled does, as our grandmothers might have said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, too, the euphemism is a temporary stage in usage: Many an
oppressed group has reclaimed an offensive epithet for its own.
Black is beautiful, we're here, we're queer, girl power _ some
disabled people even embrace the word cripple.
</P>
<P>
   As for our candidates _ each flawed in his own way _ they'll
have plenty of time to reveal their handicaps. We can only hope
they'll keep the invective at a 9-year-old's level, and save their
creativity for more important matters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ When the legendary, ivy-covered Phillips in
Andover approved a new policy allowing gay faculty members to live
in student dormitories with their partners as house counselors,
Bill Constantine applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But Constantine, a parent from New York, admits that the topic
made him hesitate when it was first raised. Although at home he
preaches tolerance and understanding of all kinds of people, with
his daughter, Claire, an 11th-grader at Phillips Academy, the issue
seemed more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is a same-sex couple the right role model in the dormitory?''
Constantine said he wondered. ``Is this a role model you want? Does
this encourage young kids to consider a same-sex relationship as a
course they should follow? I don't know that it does or doesn't.
The thought just went through my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine's contemplation was shared by officials at Phillips
Academy, where the new policy takes effect in the fall, and at
least three other New England boarding schools that have quietly
made gay faculty house counselors and their partners at home in the
dorms.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the schools play down the practice, saying it is
consistent with the institutions' liberal traditions. However, they
acknowledge, it is one thing to support theory and another to
embrace it. The move remains a bold one in a world in which gays
still risk being attacked because of their sexual orientation.
(Recently, a 16-year-old Boston girl was attacked on the T by a
group of classmates who thought she was a lesbian.)
</P>
<P>
   And with boarding schools educating many future leaders _ former
President George Bush graduated from Phillips _ what happens at
these small institutions has the potential to influence the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled with the question of whether or not the world
beyond Concord Academy was ready to deal with what we felt was a
clear issue,'' said Thomas Wilcox, headmaster of Concord Academy in
Concord. His school approved a policy allowing same-sex couples to
serve as dorm parents, but it took three years for nervous school
officials to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition never materialized and gay faculty house parents now
can live in dorms if they are in an established relationship
similar to marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the role modeling we need to do is about setting the
right example in the way adults relate to each other,'' said
Wilcox. And that in his view has nothing to do with sexual
orientation, but rather with maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Peck, a former Concord Academy teacher and chair of the
history department, was the first to live in the dorms with her
partner. ``I was the poster child,'' said Peck, 37, who now teaches
at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay and lesbian movement has put a human face on us, and
people have understood that no human being committed to teaching
and supporting youth should be denied,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peck and her partner were together for five years when they
moved on campus and asked to be placed in a boys dorm to head off
homophobia. The couple have since broken up, but at Concord, Peck
said, ``people could see me as their daughter or granddaughter. I
was a human face. I wasn't a sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike public schools, boarding schools operate as communities
where students and faculty live, work, and play together on campus.
Lessons about life extend beyond the classroom, particularly for
students who live in dorms with counselors who check homework,
enforce curfews, push students to keep their rooms clean, and help
them through personal crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school is the parent,'' said Kevin Jennings, a former
Concord gay teacher who now is head of the Gay, Lesbian, and
Straight Education Network. ``Twelve years ago when I came out,
good parenting for boarding schools meant denying the existence of
gay and lesbian people in the eyes of most schools. Today, that
means the acceptance of gays and lesbians and dealing with it in a
forthright manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Phillips and Concord, the Williston-North Hampton
School in East Hampton and Proctor Academy in Andover, N.H., allow
gay faculty to be house counselors and live in the dorms with their
partners, although they have no formal policies.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and Concord also were two of the first in the state to
create gay/straight alliances for their students. Phillips extended
medical benefits to gay partners years ago, so approving the new
dorm policy in October was just another step, said school
spokeswoman Sharon Britton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For gay students it's going to be very important for them to
see gay faculty members able to live the kind of normal life to be
fully invested in the community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the response to Phillips' decision has been positive
overall, there were parents who had misgivings, Britton said.
``Some of them have moral concerns about homosexuality. Some of
them think we are promoting a homosexual lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is familiar with the argument. ``Every parent shares
the same fear: Is my child safe? If you can convince people a group
is a threat to a child's safety, they will work to prevent that
group's rights. . . . So there will be people who will want to
manipulate what's happening in Andover to some massive plot by gay
people to take over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At Concord Academy, science department chairman Brian Racine and
his partner, Bob Giannino, live on campus. While they are in an
apartment and not in the dorms, each partner takes turns working in
the dorms from 7:30 to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   For Racine, who has a 6-year-old son from a previous marriage,
moving on campus was mostly an economic consideration given the
free rent. But, ``the number one most important thing is that there
be gay adults visible and approachable so students feel
comfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, while he is not a faculty member, Giannino says he still
feels he is teaching. ``When students on campus see Brian and I
together they see us as a comitted couple who love each other
deeply. . . . They are able to see a side of a lifestyle they might
not witness at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of such gay couples with solid relationships, say
gay students at Phillips and Concord, supports those who are at a
vulnerable period in life when the struggle toward self identity is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   Gay, lesbian, and bisexual students are five times more likely
to have attempted suicide than heterosexual youths and five times
more likely to miss school because of feeling unsafe, according to
a 1997 Massachusetts Youth Risk Survey conducted in 58 randomly
selected public high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, it's very hard being gay,'' said Ronalda Sedeno, 16,
student co-head of the Gay/Straight Alliance at Phillips. ``You
really have to seek out help and really be screaming for it in a
world where you think you're not normal. This gives you a sense of
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay teachers, meanwhile, say it allows them to be complete
people, bringing all of who they are to the table in dealing with
students.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Perry, adviser for gay, lesbian, and bisexual issues at
Phillips, does not want to call what her school is doing a trend
because trends are fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Said Perry: ``The real key here is the world is a very diverse
place, and gay, lesbian, and bisexuals have always been here and
will be here in the future.''

THE DOCS' REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care situation is looking up. In
the interval before Attorney General Tom Reilly delivers his
report, pause to consider that, no matter what happens to the
troubled health plan after receivership, there is a another crisis
in health care in Massachusetts waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   When it eventuates, it will make the present receivership look
like a choir practice.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Question X _ potential Question X, to be precise. (The
order in which initiatives appear on the ballot is determined by
drawing.)
</P>
<P>
   Innocently entitled ``An Act to Protect the Rights of Patients
and to Promote Access to Quality Health Care for All Residents of
the Commonwealth,'' the measure is so far-reaching that hardly
anyone pretends to understand it all _ including its framers.
</P>
<P>
   They include Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bernard Lown, health
care economist Rashi Fein, hospital chief Mitchell Rabkin, Harvard
professor John Kenneth Galbraith, community activist Jim Braude and
sometime candidate John O'Connor. Many health care professionals
are among the signatories.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the measure is best described as the Doctors Revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Among its consquences:
</P>
<P>
   --HMOs would be required to abandon most efforts to control
costs. Closed networks would be banned. Attending physicians'
decisions ``consistent with generally accepted principles of
professional medical practice'' could not be overruleed. Strict
limitations would be placed on contacts between insurers and
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   --Plans' and insurers' administrative expenses would be capped
at 10 percent of revenues. With the other 90 percent mandated to be
spent on patient care, for-profit HMOs would stop selling in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   --A moratorium on conversion of nonprofit health care insurers
and hospitals to for-profit institutions would be declared until
all the other provisions of the bill were met _ effectively ruling
out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   --Massachusetts would be required to ``have in place by July 1,
2002'' a system of universal healh care.
</P>
<P>
   --Premiums would be required to be ``affordable,'' in that they
would be permitted to rise no faster than national rates.
</P>
<P>
   --The entire commune would be in the hands of a Health Care
Council, with members representing health care and other
organizations, empowered to hold hearings and write regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of the initiative is simply exhortatory, an
extensive patients bill of rights would become law six weeks after
the election, precipitating many of the above changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the equivalent of passing a law requiring water to run
uphill,'' says Jon M. Kingsdale, senior vice president for planning
and development of Tufts Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has the option until May 3 to pass the law
itself, or seek to mollify the petitioners with a watered down
version. If it fails to do so, and if the petitioners collect
another 10,000 signatures (they collected 57,100 to get this far
last fall,) the measure will be on the ballot this November.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the Doctors Revolt come from? It boiled up out of a
terrible and inarticulate anger after a decade in which businessmen
and politicians failed to find equitable ways to cap medical costs
and broaden coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the doctor's plan would only make matters worse, sending
state's economy into a competitive tailspin of soaring insurance
premiums. Are the voters also angry enough to pass a such measure?
It is entirely possible.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for? The first unmistakable symptoms of crisis will
appear in May, when health plans begin to quote their rates for
2001. They'll offer one set if the ballot initiative in question
passes, another, lower schedule if it doesn't. Once accused
recently of underpricing, the plans will bend over backward to
resist the temptation to overprice, lest they be accused of
alarmism.
</P>
<P>
   Former state legislator John McDonough and professor Stuart
Altman of Brandeis University's Health Policy Forum are working on
a white paper laying out the issues scheduled for completion next
month. Then they hope to convene a conference. Look for a
disciplined discussion to begin then. Look for the turmoil to
continue.

 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Fannie Sanchez arrived at Boston University, a
campus that was 1,500 miles and a world away from Miami-Dade
Community College, where she had started her higher education.
</P>
<P>
   While ensconced at the Miami school, where students spoke her
language and understood her culture, the 22-year-old native of
Honduras thrived. But on BU's predominantly white campus, her sense
of isolation was intense. ``I felt I had to find Hispanics,''
Sanchez, a senior, says shyly in a voice a few steps above a
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   The comment brings nods of recognition from Barbara Escobio, a
Harvard University junior; Idania Ramirez, a recent BU graduate and
Michelle Sazo, an alumna of SUNY Albany, as the Latina women relax
with Sanchez in the basement of Escobio's
</P>
<P>
   Harvard dorm.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sanchez, these women had battled alienation by joining
student organizations focused on spreading awareness about Latino
culture. And, like Sanchez, they had found the groups wanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The males are, like, sometimes . . .,'' Sanchez says of
Latinos Unidos, a co-ed club at BU, fumbling for words.
</P>
<P>
   ``More chauvinistic?'' Sazo, 31, suggests archly as laughter
bubbles from the group, memories of Latino machismo bonding them.
It's with women like Sazo, Escobio, and Ramirez that Sanchez
finally found the community and support she desperately craved. In
the spring of 1998, Sanchez became their hermana (Spanish for
sister) by joining the Latina sorority, Hermandad de Sigma Iota
Alpha (SIA).
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of Latinos and Asian-Americans, both female
and male, are finding their niche in sororities and fraternities.
At least seven Latino and two Asian-American Greek organizations
have been formed by students at Harvard, BU, Tufts University and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the past few years.
The growth here reflects a boom that's occurring throughout the
country, particularly in the Northeast and California, as the
number of Asian-American and Latino college students rise.
</P>
<P>
   Internet pages like latinoGreeks.com introduce newcomers to
various Latino Greeks organizations, their social or community
events, and the professional network they offer after college. It's
now estimated that there are more than 60 Latino fraternities and
sororities nationwide, says Monica Lee Miranda, vice chairwoman of
the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations, a group
started in 1997 to unite far-flung Latino Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   And those numbers will probably increase. ``There are a lot of
locals that we have yet to find,'' says Lee. The number of
Asian-American sororities and fraternities is harder to estimate
because they don't have an umbrella group. However, the national
Web page of the Asian-American fraternity Lambda Phi Epsilon, which
has a chapter at BU, lists 17 of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These new societies, alternately called ethnic Greeks or
culturally based Greeks by people in the field, weren't created in
the image of mainstream Greek organizations, whose activities have
become synonymous with behavior immortalized in the movie ``Animal
House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pledge process that's dry,'' explains Kenny Chan, a
former president of Lambda Phi Epsilon, which began at BU in 1996.
``No one's permitted to drink. No one's permitted to smoke. We
don't believe in that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they take their cues from the African-American Greeks
that began popping up on campuses in 1906. The emphasis is placed
on academics and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Students mentor local youths and educate peers about their
culture by inviting local Asian-American women to discuss their
experiences in the business world or holding rallies to promote
awareness about Vieques, the Puerto Rican island the US Navy has
used for bombing practice for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these students are first-generation college
students,'' says Danny Oliveira, assistant coordinator of
fraternity and sorority life at San Diego State University, which
has experienced an explosion in culturally based Greek
organizations. The college now has 11 Asian-American and Latino
Greeks on its campus, up from four in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a real personal sense of responsibility ,'' Oliveira
says of the students turning to these organizations, ``in terms of
ensuring that their brothers and sisters and cousins after them can
come to college and have a support system that's going to help them
survive and graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of culturally based Greek organizations are as
varied as the number of groups. Armed with a two-inch black binder,
Edward Sazo, husband of Michelle, proudly explains the complicated
birth of his Latino fraternity Phi Iota Alpha.
</P>
<P>
   The group started in 1901 as Union Hispano-Americana, a secret
society of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute international students.
Sazo, a graduate of Rensselaer who guided the pledges of BU's
charter chapter into the organization in 1996, thumbs through pages
showing photographs of grave-looking members outfitted in suits and
ties. These men merged their group with other Latino fraternities
they found around the country until it became Phi Iota Alpha in
1931.
</P>
<P>
   The group was inactive for 11 years before being revived at
Rensselaer in 1984. Most of the Greeks active in this area are
satellites of national organizations that started in the 1980s and
1990s. Now these Asian-American and Latino groups are fanning into
Texas, Michigan and Pennsylvania with bases at New York University,
Columbia University, University of California, Berkeley, and Baylor
University.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda and Oliveira attribute the growth to the surge of
Asian-American and Latino students at colleges. In 1990, the fall
enrollment of Hispanics at higher education institutions was almost
800,000, according to the US Department of Education. In 1997,
those numbers had reached 1.2 million. Asian-American enrollment
during that same period leaped from almost 600,000 to 850,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are other factors encouraging students to go Greek.
Some join because, unlike student organizations, these groups offer
a sustained level of activity and an almost cliched promise of
friendships that last beyond college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other Latino-based organizations on campus are more social
clubs,'' complains Christina Rodriguez, 24, an active SIA alumna
who was on SIA's founding line at BU (the chapter currently has two
members). ``People go there in the beginning of the year and
there's like 50 members. At the end of the year, there's like
two.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Edward Sazo speaks fondly of the 25 Baylor brothers
who knew who Sazo was when he visited the school. He mentions the
Harvard brother who offered him a place to stay for three weeks
when Sazo's company transferred him to Boston from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys make me feel like I have a home away from home,''
says Sazo, whose wife, Michelle, helped students at BU and Harvard
form SIA chapters at their respective schools in 1996. ``We look
alike, we share the same language. I feel comfortable with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Students also turn to the Greeks for unity. There isn't a
shortage of cultural groups for people of Korean, Japanese or
Chinese descent at BU. The problem is, ``Everyone is doing
different things,'' says Ernie Kang, 19, a BU sophomore who joined
Lambda Phi Epsilon the second semester of his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity, which began its life at UC-Berkeley in 1981,
brings together Koreans, Chinese, Taiwanese, Filipinos, and
Japanese, says Johnny Lin, 21, the BU chapter's current president.
It tries to be the bond linking the various Asian-American student
groups.

&HT;     OLD NAVY'S LABOR OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometimes it is a trendy toy. Sometimes it's a
hot new television star. More often than not, it's an
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Some single entity leaps from the collective chaos and becomes,
for me, the perfect symbol of how screwed up a culture we can be.
</P>
<P>
   This month's winner: Old Navy clothing store's Valentine's Day
ad campaign. Simple, almost cartoonish on the billboard version, it
is constructed around this slogan: ``Old Navy Loves You.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time I see this message, in giant letters on the side of a
building, I imagine trying to explain it to a spaceship full of
gentle-but-curious extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is Old Navy that the proclamation of its love belongs in
giant letters on the side of a building?'' they would ask (through
an interpreter). ``It must be some kind of god or leader, yes?''
No, at least not literally.
</P>
<P>
   Old Navy is a national chain of about 500 apparel stores. Its
line is aimed primarily at teens and young adults, but all age
groups shop there. Only five years old, Old Navy is the
fastest-growing arm of San Francisco-based Gap Inc., which sells
youthful clothing in two other chains, the Gap and Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   I'd tell the E.T.'s that during the four weeks of the Christmas
holiday season alone, the 3,000 stores of Gap Inc. sold about $716
million worth of T-shirts, jeans, pants, jackets and cashmere
shawls. The company's earnings were up more than $2 billion from
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Navy does not hold office or make laws?'' the E.T.'s would
ask, incredulously. ``Old Navy does not cause the seas to rise and
fall or answer fervent prayers?''
</P>
<P>
   No, it just sells lots of clothing _ cheaply made by poor people
under less-than-lovely conditions in 50 foreign countries _ to
young Americans who already have closets full of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how can part of a multibillion-dollar corporation LOVE
anybody?'' the E.T.'s would persist. ``In your society, is not love
the ultimate emotion? And is it not true that love can be
experienced only by human beings _ and maybe dogs? Possibly a
person could love Old Navy _ though one must wonder about such a
person _ but is it not impossible for Old Navy, which is not a
human being or even a dog, to love anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I would tell the E.T.'s. It is indeed impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the billboard?'' And I would shrug.
</P>
<P>
   We are sometimes a pathetic people, I would tell them. As a
nation, we have the highest standard of living that has ever
existed in the history of humankind. At the same time, our streets
and public spaces have never been so populated with the poor,
deranged, addicted and unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of our country's children live in poverty and
are malnourished. Many children are educated in a public school
system that is overwhelmed and underfunded.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few decades, the number of citizens who
participate in the election of national and local leaders has
steadily dwindled to a minority. Middle-class and affluent children
have their own TVs, computers and telephones in their bedrooms, but
fewer and fewer of them can tell you where New Zealand is or from
whom their country gained independence in 1776.
</P>
<P>
   Families rarely sit at the same table and share a meal;
10-year-olds listen to and repeat rhyming songs about rape, murder
and mayhem; whole communities lock themselves behind electronically
controlled gates, and legions of folks sit in restaurants and
ignore their dinner companions while screaming into cellular
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Books about how to find lasting happiness in five easy steps
sell almost as well as books about how to be a millionaire in five
weeks. From Christmas to Groundhog Day, every official holiday has
become an excuse to buy something, especially from a Web site, and
the more expensive, the better.
</P>
<P>
   One of those holidays is Feb. 14, a day that has always been
dedicated to love. Where, in the Year 2000, do millions of people
in our culture look for love? Behold again, my extraterrestrial
friends, that giant billboard. ``Old Navy Loves You.''
</P>
<P>
   Read it and run away.

 UNDATED: ... student groups.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like mainstream Greeks, ethnic sororities and fraternities
welcome members from other racial and ethnic groups. Lambda Phi
Epsilon has a white brother. An alumni of Phi Iota Alpha is
Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
   At SIA meetings, you'll find Harvard junior Ourania Tserotas,
the daughter of Greek immigrants who grew up in an African-American
and Latino neighborhood in Chicago, and Carla Moore, a Harvard
junior from a Latino neighborhood in Queens, N.Y., who jokes, ``I
didn't figure out that I was white until I was like 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard doesn't recognize Greeks organizations. The cost of a
fraternity or sorority getting caught sponsoring events or
representing themselves as a Harvard entity is so harsh the Harvard
students who make up Phi Iota Alpha, formed in 1996, chose not to
participate in this story. But Tserotas and Moore were drawn to SIA
because they felt a kinship with its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York Puerto Rican culture is so not at Harvard,'' gripes
Moore, 20, who helped organize the Vieques event. ``None of the
(SIA) sisters were from New York, but they were similar. We had
something in common.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing these students have in common is a desire to do
academically well at school. Ten of Lambda Phi Epsilon's 16 members
were striving toward that goal a few days ago in a basement of BU's
Theology building. Deep into a mandatory two-hour weekly study
session, their heads were bent over computer science, law, and
economic books.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you study in a dorm there are a lot more distractions,''
explains Jason Hua, 19, a BU sophomore, citing such evils as
computer games, television, and ICQ, the instant e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students in most culturally based Greek organizations must have
specific grades to join and, sometimes, to continue membership.
They range from minimums of 2.67 at Alpha Rho Lambda, a Latina
sorority at Tufts, to 2.8 at Alpha Kappa Delta Phi, an
Asian-American sorority at BU consisting of ten sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Saucedo, 22, president of BU's Phi Iota Alpha chapter,
credits the frat with teaching him about time management,
presentation skills, and team work. Such training helps the
students become leaders on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, for instance, started a program at BU to help ease
transfer students into the BU community. She's also president of
the school's step squad and an active member of Latinos Unidos and
UMOJA, a black and Latino student group on BU's campus.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the students focus on the surrounding Latino or
Asian-American community. In November, Alpha Rho Lambda's six
sisters organized an evening of song, dance, and poetry at Tufts to
raise money for a three-year-old scholarship that provides a Latina
with book money during her first year of college.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez and Escobio, SIA members, act as mentors in the Viva La
Cultura program. Run by Sociedad Latina Inc., a youth organization
based in Mission Hill, it combines mentoring with a film and book
club.
</P>
<P>
   A scene from the film ``Stand and Deliver,'' a recent Viva La
Cultura subject, was frozen in pause on a television screen in
Sociedad Latina's office a few evenings ago. Spurred by the film,
Ramirez and Escobio joined six teenagers and five twentysomething
women in a discussion that ranged from the increasing importance
Latinos place in education to the lack of emotional support
provided by some Hispanic parents.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old, who Ramirez started mentoring a few months ago,
was absent due to illness. But weeks earlier, Ramirez was looking
forward to helping the teen wade through the college process, a
type of aid Ramirez, a 22-year-old New Yorker, didn't have when she
was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to show youngsters that they can be more,'' says
Ramirez, explaining the role she plays in the Hispanic community as
a college-educated Latina. ``They can go to college, they can
become professionals, they can go beyond their communities and do
better things with themselves.''

MERGER MANIA CATCHING UP WITH FAST-PACED NET INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days, in the old economy, mergers were a midlife
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   When companies reached a point in their development where they
could no longer grow rapidly, they bought other companies as a way
to boost sales and increase market share.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the new economy, companies merge before they ever get
out of diapers. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Monday, two e-commerce software firms, Kana Communications and
Silknet Software, announced a nearly $4 billion combination. Kana
went public in September; Silknet, based in Manchester, N.H., had
its initial public offering in May.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai Technologies, a Cambridge, Mass. Internet company, Monday
paid $2.8 billion in stock for a company with a complementary
product line. It was the second acquisition for Akamai since its
IPO in October.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two Linux companies, including Andover.Net of Acton,
announced a merger. Both companies involved went public in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are moving at Internet speed,'' said Marc Klee, manager
of the John Hancock Global Technology Fund. In the Internet world,
he said, speed is critical for success or even survival. In this
kind of environment, companies either grow up very fast or risk
being stillborn. So why merge, if your goal is to get there faster?
Portfolio managers and analysts list a number of reasons. Mergers,
they say:
</P>
<P>
   --Let you get products to market quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, which Monday paid $2.8 billion for Ortel
Corp., a maker of fiber-optic parts, is in a race to come up with
the next generation of telecommunications gear. Lucent makes some
of that gear itself. But over the past year it has been acquiring
little companies that make products Lucent needs now, but can't
take the time to develop. Klee calls them ``research and
development'' acquistions.
</P>
<P>
   For Lucent, the deals are critical. The company announced
disappointing earnings in its most recent quarter, in part because
it did not have the equipment its customers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   --Let you grow revenue faster. Ben Hock, who manages AIM's
Global Growth Fund, said what the stock market wants today is rapid
sales growth. Earnings are not essential, but momentum is. ``So a
company says, `Hey, I can buy someone who has the hot concept or
the niche product and keep up my sales growth,' '' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   --Improve your chances of survival in a crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably not a category in technology today that does
not have too many entries. Internet companies are easy to start, so
lots of people start them. Shakeouts are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is how the system works in technology,'' said Christopher
Ely, manager of the Loomis Sayles Aggressive Growth Fund. ``A lot
of companies are created, some survive and prosper, and a lot fall
by the wayside and disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Mergers eliminate rivals and give the survivors the scale and
heft that may help them stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   --Let you get big before the stock market crashes.
</P>
<P>
   All of Monday's deals, and nearly all of the recent technology
deals, were made with stock. Because the stock prices of the
acquiring companies are sky-high, those companies have the ability
to do deals that would be unthinkable if they had to be financed in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Akamai. The Cambridge company had sales of $2.7 million
in fourth-quarter 1999. In that same quarter, Akamai lost $29
million. But with a stock market value of $20 billion, it has
wealth that more traditional companies can only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't criticize either side in these transactions,'' said
Nick Moore, a money manager with Jurika &AMP; Voyles in Oakland, Calif.
``You can't tell a company not to accept a $4 billion offer. Nor
can you tell the acquiring company not to go shopping. These stock
prices create new kinds of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opportunities could disappear fast, however, should the
Nasdaq dive. Analysts say some of the merger activity is motivated
by a desire to make hay while the sun shines.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a Nasadq collapse, money managers expect more deals like
Monday's. ``This will be a huge year for consolidation,'' said Mark
Klee of John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

LOW-COST FUND-RAISING ON WEB AIDS CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go to gore.com.
</P>
<P>
   There you find W.L. Gore &AMP; Associates, who specialize in
fluoropolymer technology and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Try gore2000.com
</P>
<P>
   That will take you to PoliticalShop.com of Kansas City, which
sells Gore campaign paraphernalia. Also Bradley, Bush, and McCain
campaign items. Algore.com? That link goes to PoliticalShop, too.
Not an impressive on-line introduction to the candidate who once
claimed to have been a father of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But algore2000.com, the official Gore home page, also may be the
jazziest Web site of the country's first major Internet
presidential campaign, with offerings tailor-made to ethnic and
social minorities who traditionally favor the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates' sites are easier to find, and radically
different in focus. Bill Bradley concentrates on organization, John
McCain on fund-raising and recruitment, George W. Bush on his
tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Such groping for focus and function is widespread among
businesses competing on the Net, and was unremarkable in the
presidential campaign until this week. Then the McCain campaign
stunned political activists and outside observers alike by raising
$1 million on its Web site in two days after the Arizona Republican
won the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God! You're kidding!'' a worker for a competing campaign
sputtered at week's end as word of the fund-raising spread and
McCain vaulted well into the lead in Internet-based fund-raising
with $2.5 million, compared with $1.6 million for Bradley, $1.1
million for Gore, and $340,000 for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Reed, who headed Clinton-Gore Internet operations in 1996
and now leads Bradley's Internet effort, said the McCain coup
illustrates movement of Net-based operations from the periphery of
the campaign four years ago to a central role now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, I was badgering people to remember the
Internet, now they are coming to me and saying it is really
important to have things on the Net,'' Reed said. ``Because McCain
had a good, effective Web site, and he as a candidate is very good
about sending people to the Web site, when he got a unique moment,
he was able to capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Fose, head of Internet operations for McCain, said use of
the Web site for fund-raising and recruitment undercut the belief
of establishment Republicans backing Bush that even if McCain won
in New Hampshire ``he couldn't turn it around fast enough to take
advantage of it in South Carolina,'' site of the next closely
watched Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   It would have taken at least five to 10 days to process $1
million in relatively small contributions without the Net, Fose
said, and many of those who donated might not have given at all had
they been required to look up addresses and write checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding that 39 percent of the people contributing to
McCain through the Internet have never before contributed to a
political campaign _ ever,'' Fose said, adding that the campaign
also gained 1,200 volunteers in South Carolina in the same two-day
period.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of most of the candidates said that as interest
in the primaries rises, candidates are focusing increasingly on
visitors to their Web sites who might contribute time or money,
rather than on people who are just surfing by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who sign up for Goremail are the live ones, your
prospects,'' said Ben Green, director of Internet operations for
Gore. ``We use a really short form'' to sign them up, which ``sets
the bar really low for getting involved. . . . We are starting to
see a lot of success in up-selling people from Goremail to
volunteering.''
</P>
<P>
   Though other campaigns admired McCain's fund-raising success
this week, their representatives said the phenomenon was more
impressive for the magnitude by which previous standards were
eclipsed, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the Net, than for
the fact of the $1 million. The other major campaigns are all
considerably better financed than McCain's, and have other
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Because of spacing of the Republican primaries and Bush's huge
4-1 lead in fund-raising, ``McCain's challenge is to raise millions
quickly,'' said Bradley strategist Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for us, because we have this five
week period'' of relatively little activity ``is to mobilize
supporters in the 28 states holding primaries and caucuses between
March 7 and 14,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward using Web sites primarily for fund-raising and
organizing rather than general information shows candidates are
recognizing, and reacting to what Tobe Berkovitz, a veteran media
buyer who teaches a course in political advertising at Boston
University, said is a fundamental difference between the Net and
television ads.
</P>
<P>
   While they share characteristics prized by politicians,
specifically, that the politicians control the message and cannot
be interfered with by rivals or reporters, ``the essence of the Web
in this cycle is that it's targeted to people who are already
interested,'' Berkovitz said. ``The commercials track you down in
your living room. The Web sites you go looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big factor intensifying campaigners' interests in the
Web is the amount of time people spend at the sites. A typical
visitor to Gore's site now spends over 30 minutes there, Green
said, and all the candidates say the average time visitors are
exposed to the site's message is well over 10 minutes, at a tiny
fraction of what it costs a campaign to communicate with TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the campaigns say their Web operations have improved
over the past year and are essentially set.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is the exception. On Thursday, he will hold a
cyber-fund-raiser, during which people nationwide will be able to
send in e-mail questions, then see and hear McCain answer them over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people across the country who are trying to touch John
McCain,'' Fose said. ``It is one of the key things we have to sell.
If they are not going to be able to do that, this is a way for them
to at least interact.''

EARLY SIGNS OF A BUSH ROMP IN MICHIGAN FADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, Mich. _ The good news here for George W. Bush is that he
enjoys all the political advantages of the party's favorite son:
The governor is with him, the state GOP leadership is with him and
he has the means to field a gold-plated organization on primary day
Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is those are the same advantages Bush enjoyed in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   This bustling, prosperous state of nearly 10 million people was
supposed to the Texas governor's firewall _ the first big
industrial state to vote for a presidential nominee, the state that
could stop the McCain surge.
</P>
<P>
   Should anything go wrong in the early primary states of New
Hampshire and South Carolina, Michigan Governor John Engler once
bragged, ``I'm solid asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   So confident was Engler that he pushed to move up Michigan's
primary, from March to February, in the hope that his could be the
state that would seal Bush's nomination, with all the political
bragging rights that could flow from that.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's bragging now.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's resounding victory in New Hampshire is echoing here
loudly. The first new polls are not expected until this week, but
the Arizona senator is drawing big, boisterous crowds, and early
predictions of a Bush romp have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's advantage has been that he's inevitable,'' said Joseph
A. Schlesinger, an emeritus professor of political science at
Michigan State University. ``You take that away from him and what's
left?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see where Bush's air of inevitability came
from: The governor, the lieutenant governor, the secretary of
state, 50 out of 58 Republican legislators and 21 of 23 GOP
senators are with him. Phone banks have been set up throughout the
state to help get out his vote. His television commercials run
frequently. And just three weeks ago, he led McCain 51 percent to
17 percent in a Detroit News poll.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's television presence, on the other hand, is limited. He
has one state senator at the helm of his campaign and not much else
to speak of in the way of institutional allies. But some believe
the McCain wave, particularly if it leads to a win in South
Carolina Feb. 19, could wash away the Bush advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing takes on the character of a groundswell that
just comes out of the earth, that's a firestorm sweeping across the
American landscape, it may not matter how much money you have or TV
you have or phone banks, and I can see it happening,'' said Bill
Ballenger, editor of the influential Inside Michigan Politics
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Like South Carolina, the Michigan primary is open, which means
that independents and Democrats can vote in the Republican contest.
In New Hampshire, the Republican primary was open to independent
voters. McCain beat Bush there in all categories, among all types
of voters, according to exit surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously seeking the Republican vote first,'' McCain
said Monday morning as he campaigned in the heart of Macomb County,
home to many blue-collar Democrats. ``We want the independents and
we'd appreciate the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we would appreciate the Democrats is that a
formula for success for Ronald Reagan was the so-called Reagan
Democrats,'' he said. ``The whole essence of the Republican Party
should be to reach out across party lines and appeal to a broad
cross-section of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ukrainian Cultural Center here, McCain was greeted by
almost 1,000 people. As he does at just about every campaign stop,
he promised to always tell them the truth, decried the special
interests, mocked the establishment and fielded questions about
Belarus, Grozny and the Ukraine with ease. He also reminded
everyone that it was ``dear, dear, beloved'' Reagan's 89th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions he took came from people who were already
fans, many of whom clutched his new book, hoping for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stewart, a General Motors worker and member of Local 735
of the United Auto Workers union, sat in the front row of the
auditorium and told McCain how much he admires him and admires the
campaign he is running.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, so many people in the Republican party are harmful
to the union I belong in and I depend on for my standard of
living,'' Stewart told McCain, crediting the UAW with his good pay,
health and education benefits. ``If you were president, would I
have any reason to be worried about that?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain didn't equivocate, though he prefaced his reply by
complimenting Stewart and other auto workers for making American
cars competitive once again with foreign brands. And he praised
unions for playing a ``vital role'' in American history.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain went on to tell Stewart that he comes from a
right-to-work state and he doesn't believe in shops where all
employees are obliged to join a union. He also complained that the
teachers unions ``are fighting us tooth and nail'' to prevent
charter schools and vouchers from taking root.
</P>
<P>
   That said, McCain told Stewart, ``I don't think it's appropriate
for any president of the United States to be antiunion.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart says he is voting for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Constantino, a bookkeeper from Harper Woods, arrived
early with 13-month-old Catherine to listen to McCain thrash the
lobbyists, the special interests and the corrupting influence of
money in politics. Originally, she said, she was supporting Bush
for president. Now, she said, she's supporting McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to have a president we can trust,'' Constantino
said. ``I think he can butt heads with the establishment and win.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of talk that gives the McCain campaign the giddy
sense that there are cracks in the firewall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to have a Republican firewall in South Carolina
and Michigan if a third of your electorate are Democrats and
independents coming into your primary to vote for John McCain,''
said Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain, whose photo appeared on the cover of four
newsmagazines Monday, spent much of the day calling himself the
underdog who is up against the Engler machine.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Engler still insists that Bush will win in
Michigan, but there is much less swagger behind his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I wanted to suggest was that people are being
told what they have to do,'' said Engler.
</P>
<P>
   He believes McCain will have a far tougher time in Michigan than
he had in New Hampshire, which he contends is smaller than half of
Wayne County.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he covered Michigan the way he covered New Hampshire he'd
have to spend 630 days here and hold 1,080 town hall meetings,''
Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks to go, that's not possible. And history may be on
Bush's side. While McCain invokes Reagan's name everywhere he goes,
Reagan was trounced, 57 to 32 percent, in the 1980 Republican
primary by none other than George Bush, the Texas governor's
father.

STATES CANNOT FORCE TEN COMMANDMENTS ON THEIR CITIZENS

<P>
   There are a number of things government should not do. Pushing
religion is one of them; telling people when and how to pray is
another. Some Colorado legislators, however, don't see a problem
with state government intruding on its citizens' private religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Legislature is set to vote on a measure that would
mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public school
classroom and in the main entryway of every public school in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other states are currently considering legislation to
authorize state governments to push the Ten Commandments on the
citizens of their states: Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Whose Ten Commandments _ the Jewish, Catholic, Lutheran,
Protestant?
</P>
<P>
   The text of the Ten Commandments that must be posted, according
to the Colorado bill, ``is a compromise version.'' Neither this nor
that, neither Jewish nor Protestant. The Colorado legislature's
version of the Ten Commandments more closely conforms to the
Catholic version.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you get when government tells you what the Ten
Commandments are _ a mishmash that glosses over the deep
theological questions and controversies involved in the wording and
selection from the 16 laws set down in Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Colorado legislation also mandates a brief period
of ``quiet reflection'' at the start of every school day, ``with
the participation of all the pupils therein assembled.'' The law
requires teachers to announce the period of reflection with these
words: ``The class will now observe a moment of silence for
reflection on our heritage as a free people in one nation under
God.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the period of quiet reflection is
meant as a moment of prayer. The legislative declaration makes it
clear by creating the context in which this bill's mandates exist.
The declaration mentions a ``Supreme Being and the authority of
transcendent standards for human conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the requirement to post the Ten Commandments in public
schools and the mandated brief period of quiet reflection for
public school students are in direct conflict with the state's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In Article II, Section 4, the Colorado Constitution states: ``No
person shall be required to attend or support any ministry or place
of worship, religious sect or denomination against his consent. Nor
shall any preference be given by law to any religious denomination
or mode of worship.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue of a state
requiring a moment of silence at the beginning of the public school
day. An Alabama law required the moment of silence to be used for
``meditation or voluntary prayer.'' In Wallace vs. Jaffree, the
high court found the state law had a religious purpose and was
therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Children can pray in public schools, on their own initiative, as
long as no student is coerced into joining or listening and the
activity does not interfere with the normal running of the school.
But the state cannot force anyone to pray or to join others in
prayer, even silent prayer. Religion is not within the state's
province.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's proposed legislation's mandated version of the Ten
Commandments seems, by default, to give preference to the Catholic
religion. It certainly doesn't conform to the Jewish version of the
Ten Commandments in which the first commandment states, ``I am the
Lord your God'' and the sixth commandment states, ``You shall not
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it conform to the Protestant version of the Ten
Commandments, which includes in the second commandment a
prohibition against graven images. The 10th commandment in the
Protestant version forbids coveting your neighbor's house and
coveting your neighbor's wife. The Colorado Legislature's version
separates those prohibitions into the ninth and the 10th
commandments, as does the Catholic version of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's mandated Ten Commandments definitely violates
the Colorado Constitution's requirement: ``Nor shall any preference
be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it didn't show preference to Catholicism, it would show
preference to Judeo-Christian religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other eight states considering Ten Commandments
legislation, seven _ Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota _ have state constitutions
forbidding state government from intruding upon the religious
consciences of their citizens or giving preference to any religion.
Oklahoma is the only exception.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Supreme Court spoke to this issue in 1980 with
the case, Stone vs. Graham. A Kentucky statute had required the
posting of the Ten Commandments on the wall of every public school
classroom in the state. The high court struck down the Kentucky law
for violating the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The high court wrote: ``The Ten Commandments are undeniably a
sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faith, and no legislative
recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact.
The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular
matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder,
adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness. Rather, the
first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of
believers: worshiping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not
using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments is a religious document. However, there is
no agreement on exactly what constitutes the Ten Commandments.
There is no standard version. The Bible lists more than 10
commandments. And Jewish and Christian theologians have debated the
issues involved for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   States have no right to push any religion's version of the Ten
Commandments on their citizens. That's precisely what the
Establishment Clause means. States cannot favor any religion or set
of beliefs. This nation is home to nearly 2,000 different
religions, denominations and religious beliefs. Any preference
shown toward one or a group of religions discriminates against the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools and public buildings must show neutrality toward
all religions so that none are favored or are seen to be favored.
Children and citizens of all religious faiths have a right to equal
treatment by all government agencies, including the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that state legislatures may be reacting to
the tragedies suffered as a result of a number of school shootings
around the nation. However, posting the Ten Commandments in public
schools is merely a symbolic gesture and not a solution to the
troubling social problems that cry to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spending thousands of dollars to purchase tens of
thousands of copies of the Ten Commandments, it would be wiser to
use that money to pay for in-depth sociological and psychological
studies of the school-shooting incidents to see whether it is
possible to discern the reasons behind those disasters. That would
be a first step to finding a real solution.

&HT;     JARRING BREAST CANCER TO BE USED AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An outdoor advertising company has agreed to use
controversial breast cancer awareness ads, some of them showing
bare-chested women, on billboards in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising was considered so shocking that sign companies
and transit agencies decided last month to censor them. But the
outdoor advertising company Eller Media says it will erect the ads
for free as a public service gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising needs to be used to promote social change,'' said
Eller representative Michael Colbruno.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are part of a campaign by the San Francisco-based Breast
Cancer Fund. One ad shows a bare-chested woman in a sexy pose with
scars where her breasts used to be. The others show women with
single mastectomies. The ads are made up to look like a magazine
cover and ads for Calvin Klein perfume and Victoria's Secret
lingerie, which often use full-breasted women to sell their
products.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are intended to bring attention to the disease
that strikes one in eight women nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created a stir with this campaign,'' said Andrea
Martin, the director of the Breast Cancer Fund. ``Our intent,
really, is to assure against complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbruno said Eller hopes to place the ads on five or more
billboards in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The posters have been removed by authorities in Santa Clara and
Napa counties and the city of Pittsburg. Outdoor Systems, which has
a contract with the City of San Francisco to advertise on bus
shelters, was planning to put use the ads at no cost, but after
review, rejected them for being too jarring.

Hodgson was not a focus of the investigation, nor was he ever
charged with any crime. But he contends that the investigation
destroyed his businesses, and, along with two former partners, he
sued FBI agents and companies that aided in the sting. Though the
partners have failed in their legal efforts to be compensated for

powerful idea. They said that a business should think of itself not

   MAINE-SHRIMP (New York) _ Even as some places in New York are
trying to jump-start spring with softshell crabs and shad roe in
February, a shellfish with its own short season is suddenly turning
up in fish markets and restaurants all over town. This winter
bounty is Maine shrimp, tiny shellfish from deep waters that are
rarely available fresh and almost never in the quantities flooding
markets this month. These are shrimp so tender and flavorful they
can be eaten raw. By Florence Fabricant.

   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The column: About a decade ago, Bruno
Prats, then the owner of Chateau Cos d'Estournel, in St.-Estephe,
declared that there would be no more bad vintages of wine. At the
time I considered his remarks the height of arrogance, a
characteristic not unknown among the Bordelais. I was wrong. His
was a bit of an overstatement, perhaps, but essentially, Prats was
right on the mark. Great wine may still be elusive, but rarely now
does a year go by that doesn't produce good wine, even in marginal
regions like Bordeaux where the weather is as risky as a dot-com
stock. The fact of the matter is that in the cellar and the
vineyard, the winemakers of the world have rendered the vintage
chart obsolete. By Frank J. Prial.

&HT;     `BLOOD MONEY' AND `SICK PUPPY' MAKE ENTERTAINING READING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   (``Blood Money.'' By Thomas Perry. Random House. $24.95. 351
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Perry's series featuring Native-American ``vanisher''
Jane Wakefield just keeps getting better.
</P>
<P>
   For years Jane has been helping people disappear, but she has
promised her husband, Carey, that now she will stay at home. That
vow soon is broken when 18-year-old Rita shows up at Jane's door.
Rita had worked as the housekeeper for Bernie the Elephant, the
mob's money launderer for 50 years. Now Bernie is dead and the mob
wants to interrogate Rita to see if she knows anything about the
more than $10 billion Bernie invested and hid over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing to help, Jane goes to Rita's hotel room and finds two
men playing cards: The still-alive Bernie and his bodyguard.
Knowing the mob would be after Rita, Bernie wanted to find her
first, and give her some money and help her get away. Before Jane
can get the three safely out of the hotel, mob hit men show up and
kill Bernie's bodyguard. Jane, Rita and Bernie get away; Jane gets
them new identities, new places to live, then agrees to help Bernie
give all the mob's money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Life gets very tricky now and the tension builds as the mob gets
closer and closer. Jane has gotten away from many dangerous
situations in the past, but in ``Blood Money'' she must use all her
wit and wisdom to keep the three alive.
</P>
<P>
   Perry has created a very strong and likable protagonist who
continues to evolve as a human being. An interesting plot backed by
good writing, intriguing characters and realistic dialogue makes
``Blood Money'' a winner.

   (``Sick Puppy.'' By Carl Hiaasen. Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 341
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   If I were a stand-up comic, I'd buy everything ever written by
Carl Hiaasen and just read this comic genius' gems _ from his
columns to the latest novel. Everything he writes is wild, wacky
and just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   Twilly Spree is an independently wealthy do-gooder, with a short
temper. When he spots lobbyist Palmer Stoat throwing litter out of
his Range Rover, Twilly decides to teach him a lesson. He follows
Palmer home, then follows Palmer and his wife to a restaurant where
he arranges to have a truck full of garbage dumped on the wife's
convertible. Then he sneaks into Palmer's home and removes all the
eyes from Palmer's hunting trophies and leaves them on the desk
arranged as a pentagram. He steals Palmer's dog, but discovers
Boodle has just had surgery. He returns to Palmer's house to get
the dog's medicine and runs into Palmer's wife, Desei, who insists
that she be taken to check out the dog.
</P>
<P>
   When Twilly learns Palmer is involved in a plan to develop Toad
Island, he goes bonkers and pulls out every trick he can come up
with to stop Palmer and his pals.
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen's plot is over-the-top outrageous, but the outlandish
dialogue will keep you laughing. If you need a pick-me-up, curl up
with ``Sick Puppy'' by one of American's top humorists.

<P>
   (``Kiss of the Bees.'' By J.A. Jance. Avon Books. $24. 389
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   J.A. Jance's latest thriller deals with two serial killers _ one
a mentor who plots a heinous crime against a victim who got away.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Andrew Carlisle attacked Diana Ladd Walker in
her home, but she escaped by throwing scalding oil in his face.
Then her dog attacked and maimed his arm. In prison, Carlisle finds
Mitch Johnson, another psychopath whom he trains to commit his
final revenge on the Walker family. Carlisle also convinces Diana
to write their story and the book wins a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's husband has just been defeated in his bid for
re-election as county sheriff in Tucson, Ariz. He's also upset that
Diana wrote the book against his advice, and now he begrudges her
time in the limelight. As they work to restore their marriage,
their adopted Native-American teen-age daughter, Lani, disappears.
And it takes all their will and spirit to fight off the new
psychopath who is trying to destroy their family.
</P>
<P>
   A little reminiscent of Tony Hillerman's mysteries, ``Kiss of
the Bees''' strongest point is deftly defined characters,
especially Lani. Jance should have made his serial killers more
evil, but the storyline works.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (``Monster.'' By Jonathan Kellerman. Random House. $25.95. 396
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kellerman's latest psychological thriller featuring Dr.
Alex Delaware and L.A. Detective Milo Sturgis is pure fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Sturgis is known for solving the unsolvable cases. But the
murder of an actor who was sawed in two and left in a car trunk is
still not closed. Then months later, a female psychologist, Claire
Argent, is found murdered, her eyes gouged out and left in a car
trunk. Nothing links the two victims, but Delaware and Sturgis set
out to link the two cases. Their investigation leads them to the
hospital for the criminally insane where Argent worked and to a
patient whose incoherent ramblings seem to predict more murders.
They learn that the patient, Ardis Peake, killed an entire family
years ago and took the eyes of the daughter. Then they learn that
Argent's brother also wiped out an entire family when Argent was
just 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When more murders happen, Delaware and Sturgis slowly begin to
piece together the portrait of a sociopath who will keep on
murdering the innocent if they can't stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monster'' is an interesting read, but totally unbelievable. No
detective would spend so much time going back so many years on so
many unrelated cases to solve this crime. A good thriller has to
have a grip on reality and ``Monster'' is total fiction.

&HT;     DRESSING UP THE WORLD OF ROCK `N' ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID BONETTI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walking down the broad curving staircase, past
Richard Avedon's psychedelic portraits of the Beatles, into the
Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute, your heart beats a little
faster as you enter the galleries housing ``Rock Style'' to the
strains of the Velvet Underground's ``Venus in Furs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same effect a good rock concert will have on anyone
whose blood courses at a reasonable rate.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill continues as you turn to peer into the first vitrine,
jam-packed with outfits worn by the Beatles and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   The text panel for these ``Icons'' gives credit for rock 'n'
roll's emphasis on style to the swivel-hipped one, and the
transformation of his fashion persona from the restrained wool suit
he wore on his 1956 Ed Sullivan Show debut to the Liberace-inspired
gold-lam jumpsuits of his embarrassing, not-so-golden Vegas years
is amazing and profoundly depressing.
</P>
<P>
   But the British mop-tops, who did more than put a white face on
black rhythms, are more interesting, both musically and
sartorially. Among the television sets playing vintage concert
clips, there are two startling quartets of suits. In the rear are
the identical mod suits the Beatles wore in 1963 on their first
album cover. Like Presley's early fashion choices, they are gray,
restrained; their only extravagance is their velvet collars and
cuffs. In front of this display, like four butterflies burst from
their gray chrysalises, is an entirely different fashion statement:
The suits the foursome wore on the 1967 cover of ``Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.'' What a tumultuous four years are marked
by those two sets of garments!
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock Style,'' conceived by the Costume Institute's Richard
Martin, and realized after his death by its associate curator Myra
Walker, abounds in legendary rock-fashion costumes and accessories:
Madonna's Jean-Paul Gaultier bustier. Bruce Springsteen's Levi's
and flannel shirt. The three pink net floral gowns exemplifying
``uptown'' style worn by the Supremes when they sang ``My World Is
Empty Without You'' on Ed Sullivan in 1967. Janis Joplin's
piano-throw shawl. David Byrne's ``Big Suit.'' Michael Jackson's
black suit from his ``Bad'' video. Tina Turner's Versace minidress.
Mick Jagger's jumpsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Along with outfits that changed the way America (and Britain)
dressed, are the fashion disasters that set new standards of bad
taste. In other words, Cher and Elton John, in the section titled
``Brilliant Disguise,'' are well represented.
</P>
<P>
   Although for most viewers of a certain age the show (which opens
at Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on May 12 after it closes
in New York on March 19) will be a stroll down memory lane, it does
come with a few ideas about aesthetics and history _ it is, after
all, the product of the country's leading art museum.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement in the Tommy Hilfiger book (Rizzoli, $35)
that casually accompanies the show, Martin, comparing the current
show to one the Costume Institute organized 25 years ago on
Hollywood style, wrote, ``... today, rock has surpassed film to
become the great interlocutor with fashion in the vivid visual
contest of contemporary living.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 19th century, intellectuals pursued a Gesamtkuntswerk
of drama and music suitable to its pageant-filled era,'' he
continued. ``It would be difficult to overestimate the influence of
rock on late-20th-century style. More than movies and/or the
fashion industry, rock has been a dynamic force in visual style.
Every generation of rock history has commanded visual image as much
as sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock's history is brief but complex, and its rapid development
of a visual sense, neatly summarized in the juxtaposition of the
Beatles' two sets of suits, is the interesting story here.
Performers who originally strut their stuff in small clubs and
halls needed a way to project their image to those in the balcony
seats of the arenas they were soon filling. When you see from his
doll-clothes-like outfits how tiny David Bowie is, you realize why
his designers put wings on his jumpsuits. If they didn't, no one
would have been able to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the remarkable historical artifacts gathered here, the
show's initial thrills are not fulfilled, and it soon runs out of
steam. I suspect that its failure falls in the gap between the idea
and the practice of organizing a rock fashion show. These garments
were not intended to look good on mannequins in vitrines. They were
meant to be transformed through action.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most uninspired fashion designer knows that his
creations look best in motion on the runway. These outfits, which
were designed for performers, frequently end up looking strangely
diminished behind a layer of glass.

 &HT;    PARENTS WORRY ABOUT VIOLENCE TO OR BY THEIR KIDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Violence done to or committed by their children is
the biggest worry of today's busy parents, according to a national
poll released here Tuesday by Parents magazine and Rob Reiner's I
Am Your Child Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Violence was mentioned by 30 percent of the parents with
children 12 or younger as the one thing they ``worry about the
most.'' It topped worries over the quality of their child's
education (mentioned by 14 percent), drug use (12 percent), social
pressures (6 percent), teaching values to children (6 percent) and
health (5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   When the pollsters asked the parents about specifics:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than one-fifth (22 percent) said they know a child who
has been a victim of violence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty percent of all parents, and 43 percent of those with
children between six and 12, said they know a child who is capable
of violence.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than a quarter (27 percent) said they worry ``a great
deal'' that their own child will commit a violent act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents fear they are losing control over their own
children,'' said Sally Lee, editor in chief of the magazine. ``They
have confidence in their ability to raise their kids, but their
answers to a whole series of questions show they believe they're
just not spending enough time with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most parents agreed on how much time they want to spend with
their children during the work week _ five or more hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   But 68 percent of dads and 30 percent of moms spent less than
five hours. Among working parents, 66 percent of dads and 51
percent of moms were unhappy with the amount of time they spend
with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents know their kids are not getting enough adult
supervision, and that's very scary for them,'' Lee said. ``They
also know that it's not as safe a world as the one they were raised
in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fears are very intense. Asked about violence-related
issues, 41 percent said they worry ``a great deal'' about having
their children taken by a stranger. Violence in schools was
mentioned by 39 percent. As it happens, children are almost never
abducted by a stranger, and children are safer in schools than
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``While those particular fears are blown out of proportion to
the risk, they point to a bigger issue 0 parents' pervasive fears
for their child's safety,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The distress over violence was greater among moms than among
dads, and mentioned more often by parents who were younger, less
educated, poor or had a child 6 or younger. In each of those
categories, the concern among black and Hispanic parents was more
intense than it was among whites.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,431 parents of children 12 and younger contained a
statistically reliable over-sample of black and Hispanic parents.
It was conducted in November by two polling firms, Penn, Schoen &AMP;
Berland and the Luntz Research Companies. The margin of sampling
error for the entire sample was under 3 percent.

 &HT;    Latest home style gives paints more vivid colors
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ It's fast.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy.
</P>
<P>
   It can do wonders for a room.
</P>
<P>
   A new coat of paint adds color, texture and dimension to any
wall in the house. It's one of the simpler ways for homeowners to
dramatically change the appearance of their house.
</P>
<P>
   Trends in interior wall designs aren't the same as they were
five or 10 years ago. No longer are neutral or dark colors popular.
Instead, brighter means better, said Joe Brewer, co-owner of Brewer
Paint &AMP; Wallpaper Co. in Rocky Mount. Bright colors make rooms look
larger by creating the illusion of space. They alter the atmosphere
and give rooms a fresh appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Tobias, owner of Tobias Interiors in Rocky Mount, has been
decorating homes for 20 years. She has seen trends come and go.
Some have disappeared without a trace. Others have resurfaced after
years of being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong, bright colors are back,'' Tobias said. ``Yellow is the
most popular. Teamed up with red, it creates a warm feeling. Teamed
up with blue, it creates a cool sensation. Spice colors are
popular, too. And so is green, just about every shade of it except
for teal.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners tend to choose colors that match something in the
room - the fabric on a couch, the design on a rug, a painting on a
wall or a piece of porcelain. The object that homeowners pull the
color from doesn't have to be prominent. In a lot of cases, it's
very incidental, Tobias said. People even gravitate toward personal
or favorite colors.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners aren't just using brushes or paint rollers to get
desired results. Instead, they're trying new tools, like rags and
sponges. ``It's called a faux finish,'' Tobias said. ``It adds
texture to a wall. It's a great way to get three or more colors on
the same wall. And for families with young children, it's great way
to hide any imperfections on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Faux finishes originated in Europe. When the trend made its way
to America, it was first used by professional designers. Today, the
general population is trying it. Paint companies even have faux
finishing kits on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``These finishes have changed paint entirely,'' Tobias said.
``They're gaining popularity fast, and taking much of the spotlight
off of wallpaper, which isn't nearly as popular as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   What's popular today may not be popular tomorrow. Trends change
with little warning, leaving some people out of touch and behind
the times. It's nothing to worry about, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything goes today,'' said Tony Martin, an interior decorator
with Brewer Interiors in Rocky Mount. ``Dress up your house how you
like. Just like your clothing says something about you, the
appearance of your house says something about how you live. Be
creative and design your home to suit your needs.''

 &HT;    FOREIGN JOURNAL: FACIAL HAIR A POLITICAL MATTER IN MIDEAST
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Before my first visit here years ago, a veteran
Middle East correspondent told me to shave my beard. It might make
me look like an Orthodox Jew, he said, and draw hostile glares in
Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   On the trans-Atlantic flight, I sat next to a Palestinian man
from New Jersey who also told me to shave. The beard, he said, made
me look like an Arab and would get me hassled by Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Just like where you live, shop or pray, how you shave is a
political statement in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   For better and worse, people rely on stereotypes in deciding who
they should trust or suspect. Arabs in Israel can count on being
pulled aside at the airport for extra inspection or pulled over on
the road for searches. Israelis can expect an occasional cold
shoulder in Arab areas.
</P>
<P>
   A couple years ago, a Benetton catalogue featured Israelis and
Arabs in photos together. Some readers were bothered that they
could not always tell them apart, clad as they were in the Benetton
duds. It clouded the rules.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me that I could have an instructive social
experiment right under my nose _ a mustache.
</P>
<P>
   According to the stereotype, Arab men wear mustaches and Israeli
Jews do not, unless it's with a trendy goatee or the full beard of
Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is as unreliable as other stereotypes. Former
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has a mustache. Amir Peretz,
an Israeli labor leader and member of the Israeli parliament, wears
a bushy mustache like a trademark.
</P>
<P>
   However, a mustache can still generate suspicion in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After I grew my mustache, Israeli police began stopping me and
asking for identification. It happened once when I was walking a
street near my house and twice on the Ben Yehuda outdoor mall _
bombed by terrorists in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt about whether these approaches were mustache-related
was erased one day on the Ben Yehuda mall.
</P>
<P>
   I was approached by two young women soldiers on patrol. Unarmed
and tentative, one asked in Hebrew to see my identification. I
answered in English. Her partner faced her and said, also in
English, ``You see, I told you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it the mustache?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the first soldier. ``It was.''
</P>
<P>
   The mustache has worked to my advantage in Arab locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an Arab face!'' a smiling Cairo taxi driver said to
me recently, asking if I was an Arab.
</P>
<P>
   I thanked him, but told him no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then maybe one of your grandfathers,'' he said, insisting that
I must have Arab lineage.
</P>
<P>
   When I was clean-shaven and crew-cut on another trip to Cairo,
two Egyptians refused to talk to me until I assured them that I was
not an Israeli. So much for the ``Arab face.''
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Iran, I added a couple day's beard to the mustache.
It made a good impression on a mullah, or religious teacher, I met
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   He said I had the beard of a good Muslim. When I explained that
I was just too lazy to shave every day, he explained that any
slight growth qualifies for Islamic piety.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I could be reading too much politics in these
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   I once noticed an Iranian woman speaking in hushed tones to my
translator. After some coaxing, I got a reluctant translation:
``She said you have the ugliest mustache she's ever seen.''

 &HT;    Buddies reunion brings up memories of youthful pranks
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Henry and my Uncle Edgar were best friends.
They'd been inseparable since they were old enough to graduate from
lap babies to yard babies (an old southern way of defining the
various stages of childhood), and tall enough to hitch illicit
rides on the ice wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar and Henry were what was called in their day, ``rip
snorters,'' and according to Grandmother Parker, were as creative
as they were exasperating. What one didn't dream up, the other one
did.
</P>
<P>
   Like the afternoon Mrs. Parker found the boys in the kitchen,
knife in hand, ready to cut into a steamy sweet potato pie she'd
just pulled from the oven. She shooed them out the back door and
told them they'd have to wait until after dinner just like everyone
else. Unfortunately, she underestimated the siren call of a warm
pie to a pair of cunning lads.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar and Henry, fully aware of Mrs. Parker's reputation for
never turning a hungry man from her door (these were Depression
days), hid themselves in Henry's attic and raided the rag bags his
momma kept up there filled with well-worn, discarded clothing. A
little charcoal from a bedroom grate, a stoop, a shuffle, and the
con was on.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the ``hobos'' were well into seconds that Mrs.
Parker recognized one of the backporch bums scarfing up her potato
pie as her first born and only son and took out after the pair with
a broom.
</P>
<P>
   Granddaddy Parker tried to reassure his wife the boys would soon
outgrow this kind of foolishness, and by golly he was right.
Youthful pranks were abandoned the day Edgar and Henry discovered
the pleasure of fast cars (and ladies of equal speed), much to the
delight of their daddies but the embarrassment of their mommas.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday morning in the Dorcas Circle Sunday School class,
Mrs. Parker was so undone when Thomasine Faircloth told her that
``nice'' girls weren't allowed out with Edgar anymore, that she
snatched up her hand-illuminated Bible with
</P>
<P>
   the initials on the front in gold, and stomped out of the
Riverside Baptist Church for good.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, the young bounders' good times came to a
screeching halt. One morning over breakfast Edgar was served up an
acceptance letter to a military school in Georgia along with his
orange juice. His momma was crying.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Edgar didn't want to go. He complained that military
school would ruin his social life. Granddaddy said that was just
what he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar said he couldn't go off and leave Henry. Granddaddy
assured him that would not be a problem since Henry's folks were
deporting him to North Carolina where they'd located a seminary so
desperately in need of money that even Henry
</P>
<P>
   looked good to them.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar learned to box, and Henry became a preacher.
</P>
<P>
   One summer evening, many years after both boys had hit the
straight and narrow and been allowed back among polite company, the
old friends were deep in discussion on Mrs. Parker's front porch.
Edgar congratulated Henry on his new
</P>
<P>
   church (the same one Grandmother had left in a huff) and asked
after his family. Henry said his wife and daughter were well, and
returned the courtesy. Edgar said his wife and son were just fine
too. The boyhood friends rocked and reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   Until Edgar came up with a clinker of an idea. Wouldn't it be
great, he asked Henry, if their children got together and maybe
even married someday?
</P>
<P>
   Henry thought not. Absolutely. There was no way, he told his old
buddy, that any daughter of his was going to be allowed out with
Edgar Parker's son.
</P>
<P>
   The best buddies rose, shook hands, and slapped each other on
the shoulder, promising to get together again soon.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, isn't it? The way life likes to complete the circle.

   MAINE-SHRIMP (New York) _ Even as some places in New York are
trying to jump-start spring with softshell crabs and shad roe in
February, a shellfish with its own short season is suddenly turning
up in fish markets and restaurants all over town. This winter
bounty is Maine shrimp, tiny shellfish from deep waters that are
rarely available fresh and almost never in the quantities flooding
markets this month. These are shrimp so tender and flavorful they
can be eaten raw. By Florence Fabricant.

   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The column: About a decade ago, Bruno
Prats, then the owner of Chateau Cos d'Estournel, in St.-Estephe,
declared that there would be no more bad vintages of wine. At the
time I considered his remarks the height of arrogance, a
characteristic not unknown among the Bordelais. I was wrong. His
was a bit of an overstatement, perhaps, but essentially, Prats was
right on the mark. Great wine may still be elusive, but rarely now
does a year go by that doesn't produce good wine, even in marginal
regions like Bordeaux where the weather is as risky as a dot-com
stock. The fact of the matter is that in the cellar and the
vineyard, the winemakers of the world have rendered the vintage

A DAY TRIP FROM RIOJA IN SEARCH OF SPANISH REDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Americans think of Spanish red wines, they most likely
think of Rioja, Spain's best-known red wine region. Yet Spain's
most prestigious winery, Vega Sicilia, whose long-lived wines have
often been likened to first-growth Bordeaux, is not in Rioja but in
Ribera del Duero, just southwest of Rioja and due north of Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Vega Sicilia, which can cost several hundred dollars a bottle,
is the kind of wine most shops keep under lock and key. But these
days, more than a few excellent Riberas are on the shelves in the
more affordable range of $18 to $30 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   As in Rioja, the principal red wine grape in Ribera is the
tempranillo, although in Ribera it usually goes by the name tinto.
Many Riberas are 100 percent tinto, though winemakers often blend
the tinto with grenache (or garnacha, as it is called in Spain) or
even cabernet sauvignon and merlot.
</P>
<P>
   Tinto produces a dark purple, almost inky black wine that is
both naturally acidic and tannic, but not overwhelmingly so. The
wines are almost always aged in oak barrels, and the best of these
midrange Riberas offer delicious fruit flavors balanced with the
toasty, vanilla cushioning of the oak.
</P>
<P>
   This precarious balance is crucial. Without it the wines can be
either mouth-puckeringly tannic or weak and without structure.
</P>
<P>
   Wines labeled crianza must have spent at least a year in
barrels, while reservas must age at least a year in barrels and
another two in bottles. Gran reservas spend two years in barrels
and another three in the bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The following wines are listed in order of preference. One note:
The Abadia Retuerta is technically just outside the limits of
Ribera del Duero but is often included by virtue of proximity. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HERMANOS CUADRADO -GARCIA, FINCA VILLACRECES, CRIANZA, 1996 $27 &QL; 
Aroma of chocolate and coffee, rich and concentrated. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARZUAGA, CRIANZA, 1995 $20 &QL; 
Peppery scent, beautifully balanced oak and fruit flavors. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ABADIA RETUERTA, SARDON DE DUERO, 1996 $26.50 &QL; 
Rich and lush, tasting of chocolate, berries and pepper. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EMILIO MORO, 1996 $26 &QL; 
A big, fat, loosely knit wine, tasting of cherry and tobacco. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONDADO DE HAZA, 1997 $23 &QL; 
Smooth and concentrated, coffee aroma, mint and berry flavors. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEOFILO REYES, TINTO COSECHA, 1997 $39 &QL; 
Very oaky, sweet fruit flavors with an herbal edge. &QL;

<P>
   Though tongs have become ubiquitous as a chef's second set of
hands, they are not the right tool for every task. Chefs also
depend on another utensil, a fish spatula, to be their extended
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The fish spatula is long and limber and, unlike tongs, will
never puncture delicate fillets as you turn them in a hot pan. It
differs from a regular spatula, as well. It has an angled edge and
slots that lend it flexibility and let oil drain away. And it works
with precision on anything tricky to turn, from sole to crepes to
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Its curved shape mirrors that of the palm of a hand: It is
turned upward and slightly cupped. It moves like a hand, too. When
you press the spatula into a pan, it flexes, allowing you to
maneuver it in tight spaces _ between the food and the edge of the
pan, for example. The slots allow steam to pass through so that
food slides onto it easily. The angled edge also lets you wedge it
sideways, working it under large pieces (like a halved endive).
</P>
<P>
   Its real advantages surface, though, when doing something
difficult like turning a filet of fish. The spatula is thin enough
and flexible enough to slide between the fish and a hot pan without
damaging the skin.
</P>
<P>
   The one problem with the spatula applies only if you are
left-handed. It is designed for right-handed people. You can use it
with your left hand, but instead of scooping toward yourself you
have to play your backhand and scoop away from you.
</P>
<P>
   I tried five models, using them to flip fish, blini, eggs and
sliced eggplant. All of them performed well, though the best three
were similarly designed with wood or plastic handles and stainless
steel heads.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest looking spatula worked the best. The Peltex, made
for professionals, is $18.95 at Bridge Kitchenware, 214 East 52nd
St., (212) 688-4220. It has a brown handle with brass rivets and a
stainless steel head with the shine of a Cadillac's bumper. The
edge has a wide curve, so you can wedge it even into super-narrow
spaces, and its head is totally flexible, allowing you to lay it
perfectly flat. The delicate fish, thinly sliced eggplant, sticky
blini and a sputtering egg could all be lifted from the pan
effortlessly and flawlessly. The pan was left clean.
</P>
<P>
   One made by Wusthof was adequate but a little stiff, and its
head had too much curve _ so much that when I tried to turn a
fillet of branzino, I had difficulty getting the fish onto the
spatula. And when turning blinis, its stiffness made it tough to
work around a crowded pan. It's $26.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway
(80th Street), (212) 787-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lamson Sharp's version is almost identical, but more flexible,
with a sharper, beveled edge that made it easy to slip it under the
fish and wedge under the blini and eggplant. It is $21.99 at Chef
Central, 240 Rt. 17 North, Paramus, N.J., (201) 576-0178.
</P>
<P>
   I also tried two plastic models designed for nonstick pans, a
Matfer and a Kuhn Rikon. In practice, they more closely resembled
traditional spatulas than fish spatulas. They were stiff and thick,
and the Matfer, made of Exoglass, actually melted against a hot
pan. The Matfer is $5.95 at Bridge Kitchenware; the Kuhn Rikon is
$9.95 at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome St. (Wooster Street),
(212) 966-3434.

&HT;     CHEVRON CHIEF SEES HIS COMPANY IN THE GROWTH MODE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GEORGE RAINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the market driving a one-way street called
technology, some young technology companies have more market
capitalization than decades-old oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   In these heady days on Wall Street, you would have to be the new
chairman and chief executive of the Chevron Corp. to see the San
Francisco-based oil company as a growth stock.
</P>
<P>
   David J. O'Reilly may have a point: ``With the economies of the
world all growing, energy demand is on a growth pattern, and one of
the big surprises of this decade is that energy is going to be a
much better business than investors thought,'' O'Reilly said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, 52, succeeded Kenneth Derr on Jan. 1. Derr won praise
from Wall Street for trimming fat and inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly's fingerprints are also on the makeover. In his 31-plus
years at Chevron, the Irish-born executive has held a series of
management positions that led to his appointment as vice chairman
in 1998. It was a clear signal O'Reilly was the heir-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   This move provided for as seamless a transition as possible. But
as fortunate as O'Reilly was to take over at a time when prospects
for both near-term financial results and long-term growth are quite
good, competition in the much-changed, consolidated oil industry is
enormous. Also, Chevron stock has been listless. Its shares rose by
just 4.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly outlined his administration's four-point plan to boost
earnings and make the company attractive for investors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Run safe, reliable and efficient operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think of creative ways of reducing costs to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make good decisions in investing for the future and then
execute.
</P>
<P>
   _ Continue to increase the base business while seeking new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   All of these objectives require people skills and teamwork as
well as sharing information and identifying better methods,
according to the new chief executive, whose philosophy is boiled
down to a postcard for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are very clear about what you are trying to accomplish,
set some good goals and then support people to get it done, that is
what I think is the formula for success,'' O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants 15 percent growth in operating earnings per share
over the next two or three years, a minimum of 12 percent return on
capital employed and an annual growth rate of 4 to 4.5 percent in
worldwide oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron has had some recent production successes and says
prospects are promising.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a 45 percent interest in the Tengiz Field in
Kazakhstan, ``an enviable opportunity by any standard,'' O'Reilly
said. Production there may exceed 260,000 barrels a day in the
second half of the year. A consortium, in which Chevron holds a 15
percent equity interest, is laying pipe to connect western
Kazakhstan to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron developed the first deep water field in Angola, where
production of 600,000 barrels a day is expected by 2002, up from
450,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company has six new prospects this year in the Gulf of
Mexico. ``We haven't found an elephant _ the big one _ out of the
Gulf yet,'' O'Reilly said. Still, two fields came on stream in
1999, one producing oil equivalents of 63,000 barrels a day and the
other 37,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, Chevron lost $150 million in 1999 in missed
retail opportunity due to the July 10 explosion at its refinery in
Richmond, Calif. Production fell from the average of 4 million
gallons a day to 1 million. Full operations at the Richmond
refinery will resume in the first quarter, O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   By midyear, 3,500 Chevron employees will have left in a
cost-saving strategy, bringing the worldwide workforce to 31,000.
Most of these people volunteered for severance packages, and the
majority of the reduced force has already left the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question I would rather be adding people. We would
love to be in a growth mode. It is much more fun to add people than
it is to subtract,'' O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we are in a competitive business. We have to do our
work in the most efficient way we can to compete, and it makes for
a stronger company, which is in the long-term interests of, I
think, all of our employees,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Exxon has acquired Mobil, British Petroleum has
acquired Amoco, and Texaco and Shell are in a marketing venture. BP
Amoco may acquire Atlantic Richfield if its merger plan survives a
challenge by the Federal Trade Commission, which fears that such a
union would raise the price of crude oil and hurt motorists at the
pump.
</P>
<P>
   Can Chevron grow and compete in the top tier in such a changed
landscape dominated by behemoths? ``There is no question there are
some big companies out there,'' O'Reilly said. ``However, the
bigger you are, I would argue, the harder it is to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is out on whether big is best or small is best or
medium is best, but I do know we have identified the strategies we
are going to pursue, and we are going to pursue them with vigor. It
is our intention to be a top performer.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly is careful in talking about potential mergers. ``If we
can find acquisitions that will help us achieve our goals, that
will create value for our shareholders, as well as the other
party's shareholders, we will obviously consider,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a cautionary note: These (mergers) are not easy. When you
have them, you have to execute them. Just getting partners that are
compatible to begin with is difficult enough. You have to make the
marriage work.''

   For nearly a decade, genetically engineered food has been sold
in the United States just like any other food. There are no labels
telling consumers that their tortilla chips contain genetically
altered corn _ about a third of the total crop _ or that almost all
canola oil is made from genetically altered rapeseed.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago the United States signed an international
trade agreement on genetically altered foods, and some
environmental advocates are interpreting that as an enormous shift
in position. By agreeing to specific regulations for genetically
altered foods, they say, the United States has acknowledged for the
first time that such foods are different. And that may be the first
step toward more stringent regulations and labeling in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This treaty completely undercuts the idea that the technology
and crossbreeding are so similar they should be treated the same
way,'' said Dr. Margaret Mellon, the director of the agriculture
and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an
environmental watchdog group in Washington. ``The U.S. has now
signed on to a protocol that these foods are different, which makes
it much harder for them to resist strengthening the U.S. domestic
regulatory framework.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sandalow, the assistant secretary of state for oceans,
environment and science, would not comment on Mellon's speculation.
``I would not speculate on trends in domestic regulations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, with more than 130 countries, will allow any of them
to bar the import of genetically altered foods even though there is
no conclusive scientific evidence that they are harmful. The
agreement also increases the likelihood, advocates say, that
gene-altered crops meant for commercial processing will be labeled
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   European countries already require labeling at the retail level.
The decision would also pressure American farmers to separate their
gene-altered crops from the overall supply in order to sell them
abroad, which could pave the way for labeling for the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
   Foods created by genetic engineering _ the insertion of the DNA
from one species into another _ have been controversial since 1992,
the day a bacterial gene was inserted into a tomato to make it
ripen more slowly. Supporters say that the process is not
substantially different from crossbreeding a tangerine and a
grapefruit to produce a tangelo, and that it offers enormous
potential benefits like higher nutrient value and less dependence
on pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of genetically altered food are troubled by the
potential harm of such crops to humans and the environment. For
example, some evidence suggests that corn that has been modified
with a gene that acts as a natural pesticide could be poisonous to
monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   There is an almost complete lack of human safety data. So few
studies have been conducted on these new foods that little is known
about their impact on human health.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year there has been increased pressure in this
country for more stringent regulations, like mandatory testing and
labeling. And recently, some important segments of the food
industry have begun rethinking their use of gene-altered food.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Frito-Lay Inc. told the farmers who grow about 95
percent of the corn used in the company's snack foods like Doritos,
Tostitos and Fritos to stop using genetically engineered seed for
this year's corn planting. Lynn Markley, the spokeswoman for
Frito-Lay, a division of PepsiCo, said the company thought it was
``a prudent business decision now that the FDA has renewed its
interest in biotech and we are hearing from our consumers that
there is confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 5 percent of the corn the company buys on the open
market may be genetically altered. Next year, Markley said, the
company will inform the farmers who grow potatoes for the company's
Lay's and Ruffles potato chips not to plant genetically altered
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some other companies, meanwhile, are spinning off divisions that
make genetically altered products.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the only way consumers can be certain they are buying
products free of gene-altered ingredients is to look for foods that
have been certified organic. But only a few companies specifically
make such claims on their labels.
</P>
<P>
   Like other American companies, Frito-Lay does not sell products
containing gene-altered ingredients in Europe and Japan, because
they are barred there.
</P>
<P>
   Many other major companies, like Kellogg's, Kraft Foods,
McDonald's, Nestle USA and Quaker Oats sell gene-altered foods in
the United States but not overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In a pamphlet provided to its customers, Whole Foods Markets, a
chain of 104 natural foods supermarkets, said it is ``committing to
a goal of no genetically modified ingredients in our own Whole
Foods brand and 365 brand private label products.''
</P>
<P>
   There is often more concern about baby food than other products.
Sheldon Jones, a spokesman for Gerber Products, said the company
``has taken all steps possible to remove genetically enhanced
ingredients from our baby food.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Foster, the director of corporate communications for the
H.J. Heinz Co., said any baby foods produced after the first of
this year would not contain genetically altered ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber is owned by the Swiss company Novartis A.G., whose
agriculture division is a leader in bioengineered foods. But
Novartis, which is merging with AstraZeneca, will spin off the
combined agricultural divisions, in part because of consumer
backlash against genetically engineered food and a resulting
decline in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Monsanto also seems to be retreating. As
part of its proposed merger with Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the company
will sell off almost 20 percent of its agricultural division.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these actions are part of a trend or unrelated
incidents, they have prompted environmental advocates like Charles
Margulis, a spokesman for the environmental group Greenpeace, to
predict big changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers here should realize they are being offered a double
standard by their own government,'' he said. ``And this is going to
make that position increasingly untenable.''

AIRY CRAB CAKES, REINVENTED WITH TOFU
</HEADLINE>

   Crab cakes should just taste of crab, in an almost unaltered
state. The meat is so sweet and rich that it needs very little
enhancement to elevate it into a decadent eating experience. And
that means crab cakes themselves should be anything but the dense,
heavy hockey pucks seen in so many restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   To make the most of succulent crab meat, I borrow from the
technique for French quenelles, the airy dumplings made from fish
mousse. But I take the concept a step further and deep-fry the oval
crab cakes, making them crisp and light, tender and fluffy, with
big lumps of crab meat inside.
</P>
<P>
   These crab cakes may start out like a French dish, but they are
transformed by Asian ingredients, starting with tofu. The
neutral-flavored bean curd lightens and binds the crab cakes
without the oiliness associated with mayonnaise, the usual binder.
For crunch and color, I add green soybeans (edamame); they
contribute the brightness that Western chefs get from bell peppers,
but the flavor is better.
</P>
<P>
   The crab cakes are formed like quenelles, molded with a spoon
into ovals. I sit each one on a half-slice of lotus root and
lightly dust it with cornstarch instead of flour. When fried, the
two add crispness.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor of the crab cakes is quite mild, because I season
them before cooking with nothing more than a tiny bit of soy sauce.
Once they are fried, they need a light sauce, one with acidity,
flavor and pungency.
</P>
<P>
   We often serve them with a dipping sauce of seasoned tomato
water. You can make it at home, but it takes time. Puree two canned
tomatoes and a little salt, pour into a strainer lined with a
napkin or other fine cloth (cheesecloth is too porous) and set over
a bowl. Let it stand for several hours, until all the liquid has
been extracted. Season the liquid with salt, pepper, olive oil, soy
sauce and minced shiso.
</P>
<P>
   When I don't have the time to make tomato water at home, I put
together a classic dipping sauce of soy sauce, lemon and ginger
that has the right pungency and acidity. In fact, it goes with any
fried food.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRAB CAKES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 1{ hours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   20 or 30 green soybeans (from about 10 pods)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   8 [-inch-thick slices peeled lotus root, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   { pound firm tofu
</P>
<P>
   1 egg white
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cornstarch, approximately
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon plus 2 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 pound jumbo lump crab meat, picked over to remove cartilage
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 cups vegetable oil for deep frying
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely grated ginger.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil, and cook
soybeans until tender, 2 or 3 minutes. Drain, rinse and cool, then
peel. In a separate pot, bring vinegar and 4 cups of water to a
boil. Cook lotus slices until crisp-tender, just a couple of
minutes. Drain, rinse and set aside to dry on paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   2. Squeeze tofu firmly in a napkin, over sink, to remove as much
water as possible; it will become dry and crumbly. Put it in a food
processor with egg white, olive oil, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, some
salt and pepper and { teaspoon soy sauce; puree until smooth,
scraping sides of container if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   3. Combine puree with crab meat and soybeans and mix gently with
your hands or a rubber spatula, trying not to crumble the crab.
Refrigerate for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   4. Heat vegetable oil to 325 degrees. Use 2 soup spoons to shape
the mixture into ovals, transferring mound from one spoon to
another and smoothing until uniform. Attach a piece of lotus root
to one side; it should stick readily. Keep forming the oval with
spoons for another few turns. Put some cornstarch in a fine
strainer and sift over the crab cakes, until they are lightly
dusted.
</P>
<P>
   5. Combine remaining soy sauce and lemon juice; pour into 4
small bowls and add a pile of grated ginger to each. Fry the crab
cakes a few at a time; they are done in about 3 minutes, or about a
minute after they rise to the surface. Serve, with the dipping
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 8 appetizer servings.

 SAN FRANCISCO _  Lissa Doumani may have given up the pastry kitchen
for the front of the house when she opened Terra with her husband,
Hiro Sone, but she still oversees the desserts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most popular and delicious concoctions is the
Chocolate Bread Pudding with Sun-Dried Cherries. While other
versions are dry, this one is intensely rich and moist, and it's
given distinction from both the sun-dried cherries and a hefty dose
of Cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Terra has maintained its status as one of the most beautiful _
and creative _ restaurants in the Napa Valley. Doumani adds a
light-hearted warmth to the front of the house, and Sone crafts
dishes, including a wonderful salmon curry, that bridges the
cultures.

 &HT;       
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; There are some words, like Lolonis, that are
simply fun to say. Plump, round and pleasant, Lolonis rolls off the
tongue, just like their consumer-friendly wines.
<P>
   Lolonis Winery, founded in 1982, is an extension of Lolonis
Vineyards, established in Mendocino's Redwood Valley in 1920 by
Tryfon and William Lolonis. For years, the Lolonis family sold
grapes to local wineries like Fetzer Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when I first tasted a wine made from Lolonis grapes, I
didn't know of the Greek heritage, but the name stayed with me. My
wife and I and our youngest son, who was 9 years old, were visiting
with the late Barney Fetzer, a one-time lumber baron turned
vintner, who had brought his 11 children into the Mendocino wine
business. Fetzer often had his children taste the wines, valuing
their honest opinions. So he was amused by our son's frank
assessment that the Fetzer Zinfandel he had just sipped tasted like
peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember if the wine was a Lolonis Zinfandel, one of
three vineyard-designated Zinfandels Fetzer made in the early 1980s
(the others were Scharffenberger and Ricetti). But our evening with
Barney Fetzer was an early opportunity for a Zin fan to see how
grapes from different vineyards in the same area can produce
different wines.
</P>
<P>
   Lolonis is practically an all-in-the-family winery. Petros
Lolonis is the winery president; his brother Ulysses is the
vineyard manager, and his other brother, Nick, is the vineyard
consultant. Petros' wife, Maureen O'Reilly-Lolonis, is in charge of
sales; and their son, Phillip, handles marketing. Jed Steele, owner
of Steele Wines, is consulting enologist.
</P>
<P>
   With such an impressive collection of veteran California wine
industry professionals, I was anxious to taste the current Lolonis
wines. They are all from the family's 300-acre organic vineyard in
the Redwood Valley and are made in the fruit-forward style to taste
good with food.
</P>
<P>
   Among the whites, I enjoyed the 1998 Lolonis Fume Blanc ($12), a
light, zesty wine with lime juice flavors and crisp acidity.
Lolonis 1997 Private Reserve Chardonnay ($25) had the scent of new
French oak, yet offered bright mineral flavors with subtle spicy
oak accents, good structure and length. Lolonis uses oak in white
wines as a delicate instrument, not an overpowering tool.
</P>
<P>
   The Lolonis 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon ($27) was pleasant but
simple; a trio of reds, all priced at $27, showed more promise.
Lolonis 1997 Reserve Zinfandel has old-vine concentration and
bright berry flavors. Lolonis 1997 Private Reserve Merlot is
plummy, with forward berry and coffee notes; and Lolonis 1997
Orpheus, a blend of Petite Sirah and a Gamaylike grape called
Valdiguie, is perfumed with intense richly textured flavors and
great length.
</P>
<P>
   Lolonis also makes a charming 1998 Carignane ($14) sold only in
restaurants, and a high-end dense Bordeaux blend called Petros
($35).
</P>
<P>
   Lolonis wines are now beginning to appear in Bay Area
restaurants and wine shops and markets with good selections of
wines.

 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; In a shocking instant on January 31, the wine
community lost Tom Stockley, one of its most ardent and friendly
members. Stockley, wine writer for the Seattle Times, and his wife,
Peggy, were among those lost in the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight

</P>
<P>
   Among wine fans, Stockley was known best for his fair and
enthusiastic endorsement of Washington and Oregon wines. But he
believed in the power of all wine to bring people together in the
community of the dining table. Those lucky enough to share a meal
with the Stockleys on their houseboat in Seattle came away feeling
they were now members of a growing, extended international wine
family.

POT ROAST GOES ASIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pot roast with Asian flavors is becoming more common, but the
recipe usually calls for a full shelf of ingredients and a day or
two of marination, both of which defeat the purpose of this
super-simple main course.
</P>
<P>
   Pot roast should be the epitome of a minimalist meal. Since the
meat has to be braised until almost falling apart, timing is
flexible. Since it is cooked in a covered pot with liquid, it never
dries out, whether you cook it on top of the stove or in the oven,
at low or high heat. You can serve pot roast as soon as it is
finished or cook it in advance and reheat it. In any case, the
cooking turns a tough cut of beef tender for a one-pot supper.
</P>
<P>
   The usual pot roast has roots in France or Britain and so is
cooked with onions, garlic, mushrooms and red wine or stock. There
is no tradition of Asian pot roasts, since a scarcity of fuel in
east Asia precluded long, slow cooking. But if you substitute soy
sauce and water for red wine or stock, and ginger and star anise
for onions and mushrooms, the meat takes on Asian flavors.
</P>
<P>
   And pot roast really is pretty effortless, especially if you
skip browning the meat. Browning does create complexity, but there
is so much flavor in this Asian dish that it is not so important.
Once everything is in the pot, your only job will be to turn the
meat occasionally, if you like, and to make sure the liquid in the
pot does not evaporate. Keep the heat fairly low, so that the
liquid does not boil away quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The one tricky part of pot roast is choosing the beef. Tender
cuts, like sirloin and tenderloin, will cook much quicker but will
not develop the same rich, silky sauce as the tougher cuts do. It
is the tough connective tissue, combined with the seasoned braising
liquid, that makes the sauce great. Inexpensive cuts like chuck or
brisket are best. Chuck turns tender a little faster, but it is
fattier and you will never be able to cut nice, even slices from
the roast. Brisket becomes a little drier, but the sauce takes care
of that, and it slices beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Many new recipes for Asian-flavored pot roast advise seasoning
or marinating the meat overnight, but because the star anise,
ginger and soy sauce are so strong you can easily dispense with
that step.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables added to the pot at the start of cooking, whether
ginger or garlic, contribute to the sauce's development, but those
at the end, like the rutabagas and turnips, draw on the sauce for
flavor, often making them the best part.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASIAN POT ROAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 3 to 4 hours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 3- to 4-pound piece of brisket or boneless chuck
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup dark soy sauce (or { cup light soy sauce)
</P>
<P>
   5 nickel-size slices ginger (peeling is not necessary)
</P>
<P>
   4 star anise
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 cups peeled and cubed rutabaga or white turnip
</P>
<P>
   { cup trimmed and minced scallions.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place oil in a large skillet, and turn heat to high. A minute
later, add meat, cover the pan loosely to reduce spattering and
sear about five minutes on each side, or until nicely browned.
Meanwhile, combine soy, ginger, star anise and 2 cups of water in a
casserole big enough to fit the meat snugly. Bring to a boil, then
lower to a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   2. When the meat is browned, add it to casserole and cover.
Cook, turning meat once or twice an hour and adding more water if
necessary, for about 3 hours, or until meat is just about tender _
or until a thin-bladed knife inserted into the meat meets little
resistance. Fish out star anise, and add rutabaga or turnip,
stirring to make sure it is coated with liquid (again, add more
water if necessary). Re-cover, and cook until rutabaga is very
tender, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove meat, and slice very thin. Either return it to the pot
or place it on a platter with the sauce and rutabaga. Garnish with
scallions and serve, preferably with white rice.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: For a European pot roast with carrots, substitute
olive oil for peanut oil, carrots for rutabagas and chopped parsley
for scallions. For the liquid and flavorings, use 2 cups red wine,
20 peeled pearl onions, 5 cloves of peeled and lightly smashed
garlic and 1 cup trimmed, chopped mushrooms. Add more wine (or
water) if necessary to the pot as the meat cooks. Serve on buttered
noodles or with crispy bread.

A BIG CHEF, A TINY TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)

<P>
   It is no secret that many great chefs are perfectionists. They
are precise technicians in the kitchen and just as demanding in
running their dining rooms. But Charlie Trotter, the chef and owner
of Charlie Trotter's in Chicago, might take his drive for
perfection a step further than others.
</P>
<P>
   His obsession? Lint balls.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Lessons in Excellence From Charlie Trotter'' (Ten Speed
Press, $19.95), the author, Paul Clarke, writes that Trotter was
``haunted'' by lint balls that seemingly had ``a life of their own,
gravitating almost purposely onto the restaurant's fine dining-room
carpets.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his staff could not vacuum these unsightly wads while
guests were seated, Trotter had to come up with another way to rid
his dining room of lint.
</P>
<P>
   And he found it, Clarke reports in his chapter on taking
responsibility for details. After much deliberation, Trotter
decided to have his staffers put double-sided adhesive strips on
the bottoms of their shoes, ``to allow them to discreetly pick up
lint, debris and crumbs on the dining-room floor, return to a
station, peel the adhesive off, and throw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clarke writes: ``Some readers might say to themselves, `All
that for lint balls? This guy must be nuts.' In Trotter's mind, the
lint balls reflect poorly on his establishment, and he'll do
anything to remove them without disturbing his guests.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if Trotter is losing sleep over the lint that napkins
leave on diners' dark clothing. Or over the guests whose greasy
fingers smudge the wineglasses, spoiling their sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   How would he solve these problems?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I'm not sure I really want to know.

 The Foods of Love: Can tomatoes make you tremble? Bananas make  you
blush? Here's what the experts say about (ahem) 
 aphrodisiacs.   By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The lights are dim, Frank Sinatra is on the stereo
and you're all ready to serve your love a meal designed for
seduction.
<P>
   What would that meal of aphrodisiacs look like? Flutes of
Champagne, bowls of caviar and platters of tender veal perfumed
with truffle and cream? And chocolate. Lots of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up, friends. You'd better rewrite the menu to include some
low-fat protein, legumes and leafy greens. Fill the flutes with
water, pack away the chocolate and put out a plate of fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, science gets in the way of a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 5,000 years of folklore and human endeavor, experts from
nutritionists to biochemical researchers say there is no specific
food that will increase libido.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the idea of an aphrodisiac is intriguing, I have not
seen evidence along those lines,'' says researcher Pierce J.
Howard, director of the Center for Applied Cognitive Studies in
North Carolina and author of ``The Owner's Manual for the Brain:
Everyday Applications from Mind-Brain Research,'' (Bard Press,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``What I advocate is that sexual performance is related to full
alertness,'' he says. ``That means no alcohol, not too much
caffeine, no fats but plenty of complex carbohydrates and protein
mixed with regular aerobic exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   And make sure you're rested. But not too rested. Excessive
amounts of fats and carbohydrates will produce extra seratonin.
That will make you so relaxed all you'll be thinking about when you
hit the bed is sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, sexual arousal is no different from reading
Aristotle,'' he says. ``If your mind is fully alert and you're
prepared, you're capable of full enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to Casanova, who ate 60 oysters a day. Or to
Montezuma, who imbibed gallons of liquor made from cocoa beans to
prepare himself for orgies. In fact, human beings from all cultures
have spent an inordinate amount of time seeking out foods to
enhance sex.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese culture, the penis of an elk or tiger is considered
an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks you will be like a tiger,'' says Roy Fong,
owner of the Imperial Tea Court in San Francisco. In some parts of
China, he says, fried silkworms or dried lizards are thought to
enhance sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese people use numerous kinds of herbal medicines to
enhance sexual ability,'' he says. But the overriding approach is
one of balance, not silver bullets. ``A lot of it is in your mind,
but a lot of it is balancing your  &LR; yin &LR;  and  &LR; yang &LR; , or male and
female energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the sexual organs of animals can help is an
ancient belief. Eating foods that look like sexual organs is based
on a principle called the law of signatures or similarities, which
states that like things produce like results. The notion has long
provided a link between food and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ginseng, asparagus, oysters, figs, artichokes and sea cucumbers
all have been ascribed powers by the mere virtue of their shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologist Lionel Tiger, author of ``The Pursuit of
Pleasure,'' (Little Brown, 1992; reissued by Trans Action
Publishers) lectures at Rutgers University on the social uses of
food. He doesn't believe that food has any physiological sexual
implications, nor does he buy the law of similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never found a woman fascinated by zucchini,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, food is sexy because of the social and emotional power
ascribed to it. Fresh baked bread might evoke familial feelings of
love and warmth. Caviar and oysters connote wealth and largesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any man who is ordering oysters obviously feels good about
himself. He feels providence by ordering a luxury item,'' Tiger
says. ``The fact is that food and sex are irretrievably linked to
the provision of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin resident Isabel Allende, author of ``Aphrodite: A Memoir
of the Senses'' (HarperCollins, 1998), writes that food and sex
have been forever entwined in the human experience, which is simply
one long, uninterrupted cycle of digestion and fertility.
</P>
<P>
   Although she spent months trying various sex-inducing recipes on
her friends, she concludes that there is likely nothing physical
that makes food an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like black magic,'' Allende says. ``It works because it's
in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Chef Chad Callahan of Masa's in San Francisco fancies himself
something of an expert on aphrodisiacs. He believes it's not so
much what you eat but how you eat it _ anything eaten with the
fingers is good. Champagne is good. Chocolate is good. White
truffles are good.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, ``Temperature changes are very sexual. Maybe a hot
oyster with some leeks and caviar or a cold oyster with a little
warm broth. Once you get that contrast and that explosion of
flavors, it's like, wow.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing better, he says, is Champagne and slightly frozen
grapes or lychees. Especially fed to each other in a hotel room in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   What it comes down to is this: If you believe a food is an
aphrodisiac _ and you're not too full or too tipsy _ it likely will
work.
</P>

 &UR; Aphrodisiacs at a Glance &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Kim Severson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Although science says food and sex have little direct connection,
some foods have properties that might contribute to a better love
life. Here is a list of some of them:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Avocados. &LR;  These contain vitamin B6, which decreases
prolactin, a hormone that kills sexual desire in women. And as an
added bonus, B6 increases the testosterone-regulating hormone in
men. Plus, folklore is in the avocado's favor. During the avocado
harvest, the Aztecs kept virgins inside to preserve their virginal
state.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Alcohol. &LR;  Although poet Ogden Nash believed that candy is
dandy but liquor is quicker, he was dead wrong. Sure, the
effervescent nature of Champagne is seductive and it might put
stars in your eyes for a while. But ultimately, alcohol is a
depressant which can desensitize the sex organs and lead to
impotence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Asparagus. &LR;  Long, delicate and erect, well . . . you get the
idea. Asparagus also contains vitamins key to general good health
and a chemical called asparagine, an amino acid that can lend a
peculiar odor and color to urine. The smell has been compared to
the scent of cats in heat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Carrots. &LR;  Not only do you get the advantages of the law of
similarities, you get a lot of beta carotene, which becomes vitamin
A _ essential to producing sex hormones.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Chocolate. &LR;  Good chocolate is silky and flawlessly smooth in
the mouth. It also contains phenylethylamine, or PEA, which is the
same amphetaminelike chemical released by the brain when people
fall in love. PEA produces a happy, dreamy feeling. But, in another
of the brain's great mysteries, eating more chocolate doesn't raise
the level of PEA. Still, thousands of Aztecs can't be wrong. For
those using sugar substitutes, PEA can be found in NutraSweet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Chile peppers. &LR;  Eat a chile and your heart rate increases;
you might even start sweating. Endorphins, which produce a feeling
of well-being, flood the brain. It feels like sex.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Coffee. &LR;  A study of 744 Michigan residents over the age of 60
published in 1990 in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed
coffee consumption can increase sexual activity. But it can also
make you jumpy. At the very least, you'll be able to stay awake
after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Cinnamon and cloves. &LR;  Some Eastern herbalists believe the two
spices have libido-enhancing qualities. They're often combined in
Chinese cooking to produce fragrant, sensual dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Garlic. &LR;  Good and bad news here. Garlic thins the blood and
helps maintain good circulation, which is key to sexual arousal.
But it can give you bad breath, so make sure both parties indulge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Liver. &LR;  Foie gras _ fattened goose liver _ has an amazingly
silky, sexy mouthfeel. It's chic and expensive, which can add to
the sexual nature of a meal. And, like avocado, it has lots of
vitamin B6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Ginseng. &LR;  Although ginseng is often mentioned as an
aphrodisiac, many Western researchers are skeptical of the powers
of this mild stimulant. Many Korean and Chinese herbalists are
proponents of its ability to enhance sexual performance. Here's the
tiebreaker: Mae West drank cups of ginseng tea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Okra. &LR;  The stiff but slimy vegetable is a favorite among
Creole cooks, who certainly have a reputation for rollicking, sexy
food. It doesn't hurt that okra contains calcium, phosphorus, iron
and vitamin A, all vital nutrients for sexual _ and overall _
health.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Oysters. &LR;  Roman emperors demanded oysters at their orgies.
Casanova ate dozens a day. Whether they used lemon or Tabasco we do
not know. What we do know is that oysters contain lots of zinc, and
not getting enough zinc has been correlated with low testosterone
levels and prostate problems in men. Never mind that the oyster's
appearance and its briny, soft-crisp texture have very sexy
connotations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Tomatoes.  &LR; Originally known in France as  &LR; pomme d'amour &LR; , or
love apple, the tomato is full of potassium, which has been linked
to male sexual health.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Truffles. &LR;  Truffles emit a sweet, gamy smell reminiscent of
sweat. They release pheromones that attract the pigs and dogs that
hunt them and which are said to elicit a strong sexual response in
humans. Roquefort cheese is rumored to have a similar effect, and
is much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Walnuts. &LR;  The appearance of a halved walnut has a certain
female sexual characteristics. Nuts contain manganese, which helps
produce dopamine. This neurotransmitter heightens sexual arousal.
Beets and legumes offer the same sexy nutrient package.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Yams. &LR;  Some varieties of yams have been found to contain high
levels of diosgenin, a chemical similar to estrogen, the female sex
hormone. Wild yam salve has been an American folk remedy for
vaginal dryness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Yohimbe. &LR;  So far, the best clinical research on food-based
sexual stimulants is on yohimbe, an extract from the bark of a West
African tree. A 1984 study by Stanford researchers showed yohimbe
increased the sexual activity in male rats. Subsequent studies
showed similar results in humans, especially in men with diabetic
neurological impairments. But yohimbe soup isn't exactly the stuff
romantic meals are made of.

 &UR; Sex and Food Go to the Movies &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Laura Perkins &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Sitting in a New York City deli, Meg Ryan fakes an impressive
orgasm to prove a point to Billy Crystal in ``When Harry Met
Sally.'' She is so convincing another diner tells the waiter,
``I'll have what she's having.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies have a long history of exploiting the links between
passion and food. Here are a few films with memorable food scenes.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Tom Jones &LR;  (1963). This Academy Award winner has  &LR; the &LR; 
classic lusty eating scene. Albert Finney, as Tom Jones, tears into
a bawdy meal with Joyce Redman, as Mrs. Waters. They begin eyeing
each other demurely over their soup spoons and as their passion
seems to increase end up shredding chicken, grease dripping down
their forearms, eyes locked.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Like Water for Chocolate &LR;  (1992). The film adaptation of
Laura Esquivel's magical novel focuses on a character whose
repressed passions infuse her cooking with the power to evoke
emotional responses. When Tita prepares Quail in Rose Petal Sauce
she uses petals from a bouquet given to her by her beloved and the
meal becomes an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Tampopo &LR;  (1986). Called the first ``noodle Western,'' this
Japanese film satirizes ``spaghetti Westerns'' while telling the
story of a heroic truck driver searching for the perfect noodle. In
the process he helps a widowed restaurant owner master the art of
cooking noodles. Often very silly, the movie parodies several film
genres in episodes that include a gangster and his moll getting
creative with shrimp and a raw egg.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Fried Green Tomatoes &LR;  (1991). Food is always in the
foreground in this adaptation of Fanny Flagg's novel. In one scene,
Idgie Threadgoode endears herself to Ruth when she retrieves a
chunk of honeycomb from a buzzing hive. Ruth dips her fingers in
the jar of fresh honey and declares Idgie a bee charmer. The women
fast become the closest of friends.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; 91/2 Weeks  &LR; (1986). Director Adrian Lyne's tale of sexual
obsession promises more than it delivers, as do many aphrodisiacs.
The scene in which Mickey Rourke feeds a blindfolded Kim Basinger
juicy fruits and hot chiles has been parodied in ``Hot Shots'' and
in a TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Big Night &LR;  (1996). Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott
co-directed this quiet but sweet movie about two Italian immigrant
brothers struggling to make their restaurant a success. The
brothers stage an elaborate meal thinking noted Italian entertainer
Louis Prima will visit. While not what they had hoped, the meal
still is a joyful celebration of pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Babette's Feast &LR;  (1987). In this film one sumptuous feast
transforms a group of pious, bickering villagers. During the meal a
visitor tells the story of a famous woman chef who could transform
a dinner ``into a kind of love affair.'' This chef's artistry works
miracles.

INDOOR GARDENING: HOW DREAMS OF SPRING YIELD FIELDS OF LEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   February is the end of the leek season _ and the beginning. Once
the last of the fall crop has been sauteed, the garden catalogs set
the mind to dreaming of how green the frozen landscape once was and
will be again.
</P>
<P>
   As the first of the new year's plants to be seeded into starter
flats, leeks are a simple way for the impatient gardener to start
growing, indoors, while snow still blankets the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Leeks are the sort of crop that makes both the gardener and Alan
Greenspan happy. By my reckoning, the return on investment in
growing leeks exceeds even the best of dot-com stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A package of seeds costing $3.10 produces about 1,000
transplantable leeks that would be worth more than $500 at
supermarket prices when fully grown, and that's not counting the
free exercise involved in tending the plants.
</P>
<P>
   As you hill and hoe, you can contemplate all the ways those
leeks can be cooked and eaten: in vinaigrette, in potato or squash
soup, in salads. Leeks have been around in culinary circuits since
at least the Middle Ages, but the flavors accompanying them seem to
have changed considerably over the years.
</P>
<P>
   I have an ancient German recipe for a leek and cabbage soup made
with lard, for instance, that calls for saffron, coriander seed and
cinnamon. A simple combination of potatoes, leeks and thyme with
lots of heavy cream is more contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Leeks like a very rich soil, but don't use potting soil to fill
your flats. Use the special seed-starting mixture available bagged
at most nurseries and gardening-supply stores. Potting soil is too
dense and heavy for starting seeds, particularly those as fine as
leeks.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, you should plant the seeds in a \-inch-by-\-inch
grid and cover them with a light dusting of soil. If Job were a
gardener, this would truly try his patience. Theoretically, you
should also transplant the leeks once they are about two inches
tall into individual cell-type containers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying this method won't give you the largest, plumpest
blue-ribbon leeks _ but it will also probably occupy almost all the
space you have for starter flats in your home.
</P>
<P>
   And so I just broadcast or scatter 300 or so seeds to a flat of
premoistened seed-starter soil. Then I dust some soil on top, mist
with water and cover the tray with plastic wrap. After a few weeks,
when the seeds are pushing up green, I raise the plastic wrap about
six inches and continue to let the young plants grow.
</P>
<P>
   Come April or so, I go out and hack a row in the garden. You can
dibble individual holes and set the plants out 5 to 6 inches apart.
But what is much easier and works just fine is using a 6- to
7-inch-deep trench and simply laying the plants along one side and
then going back over the row, pushing it closed so that the young
plants are almost completely buried.
</P>
<P>
   When you transplant leeks whose seeds have simply been broadcast
across a starter flat, you will find that their roots have grown
into a Medusa of white strands. Just tug and pull gently on each
individual leek, and it will break free from the mass without
damage. But because the roots will be almost completely bare, you
need to get them into the garden immediately and water them well.
</P>
<P>
   Every three or four weeks as the plants grow, pull some soil up
to the sides of the leeks and bury them farther. This blanches the
leeks, increasing the amount of flavorsome tender white bulb that
you get. It is also the reason you need to cut the leeks in half
and wash out the grit before cooking them.
</P>
<P>
   You could grow leeks in a container on a terrace, but they do
take room. The box would need to be at least a foot deep to keep
the leeks buried, and it would have to be quite long so that the
leeks could be planted six inches apart. A three-foot box would
yield only about 10 leeks. Leeks are like potatoes: you get one
good dinner out of a pot.
</P>
<P>
   You can eat leeks anytime after they have developed the white
bulb; the flavor does not become stronger or milder as they grow.
If they are too close, I harvest them when they are barely thicker
than a pencil. A diameter of one or two inches, however, is ideal. &QL;

<P>
   Time: 1 hour 45 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup thinly sliced leeks (white part only)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup lightly packed fresh thyme sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon butter
</P>
<P>
   4 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   10 Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring small pot of water to boil. Wash sliced leeks well, and
blanch for 15 seconds. Drain, and rinse with cold water. Drain
again, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chop thyme sprigs, removing any woody stems. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Butter bottom and sides of
9-by-12-by-2-inch roasting pan. Pour in just enough cream to coat
bottom. Set aside enough potatoes to cover pan, in overlapping
slices, in one layer; these will be used to top the gratin. In the
pan, arrange a third of the remaining slices evenly, overlapping
the slices in rows. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and
sprinkle with a third of the thyme and a third of the leeks.
</P>
<P>
   4. Drizzle small amount of cream over the potatoes, and again
top with a third of the potatoes, salt and pepper to taste, and a
third of the thyme and leeks. Repeat the layers once more. Top the
gratin with the reserved potato slices, arranging the slices in
decorative overlapping rows. Season again with salt and pepper to
taste, and pour remaining cream over the potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cover pan with aluminum foil, and make a hole in the center
for steam to escape. Bake until gratin is just tender in the center
when pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove foil, and increase
heat to 400 degrees. Continue to bake until gratin is soft and
creamy and top is golden brown, about 20 minutes longer. Serve hot.

   ISRAEL-ATTACK (Jerusalem) _ The conflict in Lebanon continued to
heat up Tuesday as Shiite Muslim guerrillas killed another Israeli
soldier, the sixth in two weeks, and Israelis warplanes retaliated
less than 24 hours after their first bombardment knocked out power
stations and shut down civilian life in much of Lebanon. As Arab
and some European countries condemned Israel for its air strikes,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak lamented that civilian targets had to be
struck and that the regional peace effort was dealt a blow. But he
staunchly defended his decision to order a harsh reprisal for what
he called the guerrillas' systematic violations of the rules of
engagement in the low-level war zone of southern Lebanon. By

Clinton's order will protect 2.8 million federal employees. White
House officials said they knew of no other employer who had adopted
such a policy. Information about the human genome and a person's
genetic makeup can transform medical care, making it easier to
detect, treat and prevent serious diseases, Clinton said. But, he
said, the misuse of genetic test results can also erode personal
privacy. By Robert Pear.

 &HT;    Timing vital for baby boomers
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Davis, a 65-year-old retiree from Roswell, Georgia, could
be a case study for baby boomers who are just beginning to think
about the legacy they will leave their families.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from IBM 10 years ago, Davis sat down with a
financial planner and hammered together his estate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I needed more than just a simple will,'' he
recalled. He and his wife, Gale, got their wills updated, set up
several trusts, wrote living wills and powers of attorney, and made
decisions on what they would leave to their children, grandchildren
and church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new experience to go through this kind of
preparation,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers should take notice. The youngest of that generation
are now 36, and the oldest are 54. That covers everything from
child-raising years to peak-earning years _ crucial times to start
planning ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Estate planning, in a narrow sense, is about money. You decide
which kinfolk, friends or institutes will get your property, and
you draw up the paperwork to make it happen. For the upper
middle-class and wealthy, an estate plan also includes minimizing
the taxes your estate will owe.
</P>
<P>
   For all of us, estate planning also includes health-related
issues and peace of mind issues. You want to say who can make
medical and financial decisions for you. Parents want to determine
who would finish raising young children. Everybody wants their
heirs to know where the important paperwork is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is important to sit down with your kids before you
die and make sure you know what's really significant to them,''
said John J. Scroggin, a Roswell attorney.
</P>
<P>
   On the money side, estate planning can be a very big deal.
Georgians paid $279.3 million in estate taxes in 1997, according to
the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Note, however, that a very small percentage of people pay estate
taxes. For example, only 1,868 Georgians filed estate tax returns
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most estates pay no tax because the first $675,000 of any estate
is exempt from federal income tax. That figure will gradually
increase, reaching $1 million in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   But if your estate is worth more than the protected amount, the
bite can be fierce. Estate tax rates go as high as 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is why both estate planning attorneys and the IRS pay so
much attention to methods for escaping the tax. In turn, that level
of interest helps explain why the laws on trusts and the like can
get so complicated.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got enough to worry about taxes, you'll need an
expert. Referrals are always the best way to find one. Davis' first
adviser was a friend, and his second is a man he met at his church.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, you can ask for a list of attorneys with tax
expertise through www.actec.org, the Web site of the American
College of Trust &AMP; Estate Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Estate taxes may be less important in the future. Congress has
been considering abolishing the tax, and most Republican
presidential candidates agree. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) would
raise the exemption, while Democrats tend to prefer the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it went away, many people would still be interested in
forming trusts, said Patrick G. Renn, a certified financial
planner. ``Preserving assets is no longer the driving force,'' he
said. ``The big issue now is preserving the family. What's my
legacy? What will my kids get? What will charity get?''
</P>
<P>
   On the peace-of-mind side, you can organize your effort around
the documents you'll need to prepare. Take a look at these:
</P>
<P>
   Wills. A surprising number of people haven't prepared them. ``It
forces them to deal with their own mortality, and that can be a
problem,'' explained Scroggin. ``Other people just don't take the
time to focus on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not having a will is a big mistake. This is where you decide who
benefits from the assets you leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   If you have young children, this is where you name guardians for
them. If you have complicated family issues _ children from
different marriages or of varying levels of maturity, for example _
this is where you protect each one's interest. If you want
charities to get some of your money, you do it here.
</P>
<P>
   Doing it yourself is a possibility. You can find useful books
and software at www.nolo.com. But if you have substantial assets or
complex needs, don't skimp: Hire an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Living wills and medical powers of attorney. A living will is a
statement of whether you want to be kept on life support. It's
important if you can no longer decide for yourself. A medical power
of attorney authorizes someone else, usually a family member, to
make medical decisions when you are unable to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in emergency rooms with a number of clients,''
said Scroggin. ``It is a horrific decision to have to withdraw life
support. It helps if that is his (the dying relative's) decision.''
</P>
<P>
   General powers of attorney. These documents authorize another
person to make financial decisions for you, if you are
incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   A legacy file. Once your affairs are in order, you need to make
sure your survivors know the details. That includes people to
contact, documents, assets and the like (see box for details).
</P>
<P>
   When your file is assembled, spread copies around to family
members as well as an attorney or other adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process can be arduous.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't started yet, you are not alone. Scroggin often
speaks to groups of lawyers, usually those interested in estate
planning. He asks those who have wills to raise their hands. ``The
highest I've ever seen was about 60 percent,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But finishing the process has its satisfactions. ``Just knowing
where it is, and that all the pieces are there, is a lot of comfort
to me,'' said Davis. ``I know it won't be a problem for my wife,
who does not like to deal with these kinds of things.''

 &HT;    Ford Windstar SEL ready for fun
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even a cursory glance at Ford's 2000 Windstar SEL minivan
identifies it as a serious family hauler and car-pooler and a
vehicle nicely suited for good-time outings.
</P>
<P>
   With its maximum capacity of seven passengers and a full load of
options to augment the standard features expected on line-topping
vehicles, the Windstar is quite capable of entertaining youngsters
and placating adults during routine outings and extended trips.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has yet to make bathroom facilities or kitchen sinks
available, but the Windstar, a leader in crash-test ratings and
usable space, can seriously be faulted only because it's noisy and
doesn't earn high marks for the comfort of its generous seating.
</P>
<P>
   After a major reworking last year, the Windstar gets no big
changes for the 2000 model year. Prices start at about $19,000 for
a bare-bones cargo van and peak at the $30,515 base price of the
SEL. Stand-alone options _ including side air bags _ and packages
mean it's relatively simple to set up for a variety of uses.
</P>
<P>
   Ford likes to call the Windstar a wagon, but it looks and drives
about the same as most vans. It's big _ a 121-inch wheelbase and an
overall length of nearly 17 feet _ so the Windstar isn't something
to be driven nonchalantly. Ford combats this awkwardness with lots
of glass, mirrors and an optional back-up warning system that
really helps because straight-back vision _ either through the
mirrors or by twisting the neck _ is poor.
</P>
<P>
   With the 200-horsepower, 3.8-liter, six-cylinder engine, power
is good, but the trade-off is fuel mileage figures that justify the
presence of a 26-gallon tank, giving the vehicle a range of more
than 500 miles. A 3.0-liter engine that makes 150 horsepower is
available, but it lags way behind the 3.8 in performance.
</P>
<P>
   The SEL's standard features include automatic climate control,
leather seating, and lots and lots of storage nooks and crannies.
The VCR player and screen are convenient, and the screen, which
flips up from the center console, is easily viewed from the rear
seats. The image is surprisingly sharp, and the sound is
satisfactorily distributed around the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The driveability factor isn't as pleasing. The Windstar has a
seat-of-the-pants feel and steering that won't let you forget its
considerable size. The brakes are stout _ 60 mph to zero in a
carlike 130-plus feet _ and start-ups, too, are made with alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   But niceties such as dual power sliding doors and
power-adjustable pedals _ over-engineering or a real boon? _ lend
appeal and show that Ford refuses to accept the idea that its
Windstar can't be all things to all buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Ford Windstar SEL front-wheel-drive minivan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $33,050 (base: $30,515), plus $605 delivery
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.8-liter, six-cylinder engine (200 horsepower);
four-speed automatic overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, optional side air bags ($390);
power anti-lock brakes with front discs and rear drums; optional
back-up warning system ($245); height-adjustable shoulder belts in
first two rows of seating
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: entertainment center with CD
player, console-mounted VCR and screen, $1,295; four bucket seats
with power-adjustable driver's seat, $1,070

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ When Deena Harrison Dark plants U. S. flags
at the graves of fallen soldiers, it's considered an act of
patriotic devotion. But when she and others publicly display the
Confederate flag, it sparks controversy, fueling a revived national
debate between those who view the Rebel battle flag as a symbol of
pride, and those who see it as a symbol of white supremacy. The
generations-old dispute over the meaning of Confederate symbols has
flared anew in Texas and the nation in the wake of the latest push
to remove the Rebel flag from atop the South Carolina Statehouse,
where it has flown since 1962. By KAREN ROUSE and R.A. DYER. Story

   Ten years ago, it couldn't have made much of a ripple in Dorothy
Kosinski's day planner. Kosinski, the current curator of European
art at the Dallas Museum of Art, had a provocative conversation
about photography's influence on Gauguin's art with a colleague, a
discussion that soon after all but disappeared into the ether of
another busy work day. But years later, Kosinski used a tidbit from
that long-ago dialogue to build on the concept that a swirl of
visual information _ including photography _ churns an artist's
creative juices. In plumbing this premise, the first molecule of a
big exhibition was born and, years later, Kosinski would bask in
the glow of ``Degas to Picasso: Painters, Sculptors, and the

CROSSOVER CHEF BLENDS 2 CULTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raji Jallepalli, the chef and owner of Restaurant Raji in
Memphis, was a late bloomer. In her book, ``Raji Cuisine: Indian
Flavors, French Passion'' (HarperCollins, $35), she writes that she
began her restaurant after having had another career and after
having children. She was just a home cook, with no professional
training.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to tell whether Jallepalli is being vague or
modest when she tells her story of success in this book, written
with Judith Choate. She says she experimented, took risks, and
followed her instincts, and finally arrived at a successful
business serving a very personal cuisine fusing French and Indian
flavors and techniques. She no longer cooks like a home cook.
</P>
<P>
   That became apparent the moment I tasted her green beans with a
coriander-coconut crust. It was clear there was a brilliant palate
and an innovative chef behind the dish. Playing off a fresh bean
flavor was a complex mixture of chana dal, coriander, cinnamon and
a healthy wallop of cumin. The coconut enriched the dish, coating
the beans and mellowing the spices.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of Jallepalli's more unusual recipes. There are
several others like it _ a consomme of green apricots and shrimp,
for instance, and mung bean dumplings with tomato raita. But she
offers many mildly fused ones, too, like a cardamom creme brulee
and a potato gratin with onions, garlic and saffron.
</P>
<P>
   Another wildly impressive dish was Dover sole with a curry leaf
emulsion. Dover sole is the kind of fish whose delicacy can easily
be lost in a sauce, but the emulsion, made with leaves unrelated to
curry powder, was perfectly fresh and vibrantly flavored, yet not
overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   It was also an easy dish. The fish was sauteed and served on
thin slices of sauteed Japanese eggplant, and the sauce took about
a minute to make, combining curry leaves, balsamic vinegar, white
wine and olive oil in a food processor.
</P>
<P>
   In a book with nearly 100 recipes, the discovery of two great
new ones is truly unusual. Two other dishes I cooked were also
good, though they paled in comparison. A cool cucumber soup was
tart and revitalizing, with buttermilk, fresh dill and mustard
seeds. And spiced apple tarts on phyllo were tasty, just not as
seductively spiced as I expected.
</P>
<P>
   One fault with the book, however, is spotty recipe editing. In
the Dover sole recipe, for instance, there are no instructions to
season either the eggplant or the fish with salt and pepper. And
the recipe for Jallepalli's curry spice blend yields one and a
third pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people would be willing to invest in the amount of the
12 spices needed to make such a large mix, unless they cook Indian
food twice a day. You could, of course, simply halve or quarter the
recipe, but why didn't the authors?
</P>
<P>
   There are very few dishes with the milelong ingredient lists
typical of chefs' cookbooks. And many recipes are simply long with
spices, which are essential to Indian cooking and so require a trip
to an Indian market. (Most of the core ingredients can be found at
the grocery store.)
</P>
<P>
   None of this is so discouraging. Jallepalli accomplishes
something rare with her cooking. As she puts it, she ``retains the
basic principles and balance of French cuisine while introducing
the profound bouquets of Indian cooking.'' She may no longer be a
home cook, but she is a good cook who should connect with any
sensible one, home or professional. &QL;

I LAUGH. I FOCUS. I CAN'T HEAR. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Lawrence D. Burns is vice president for research, development
and planning   at the General Motors Corp.) 
 (DW) 
 By   LAWRENCE D. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I lost my hearing six years ago in November. I went to bed one
night _ I had watched ``Seinfeld,'' so I know it was a Thursday
night _ and I woke up about 11, nauseated and dizzy, and I couldn't
hear, and went to the hospital. Evidently there was a virus that
had attacked the cells in my inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   I went about a year with no hearing at all. A stenographer who
traveled with me would record all conversations and I'd be able to
read what was going on. Now I have this technology called a
cochlear implant. It is a small wire that is threaded into your
inner ear with 22 electrodes. It is attached to an antenna and
magnet imbedded in my skull.
</P>
<P>
   When people talk, they sound like a poorly tuned AM radio
station, so when I listen I have to concentrate pretty hard.
</P>
<P>
   I have two daughters _ 8 and 11 _ and the younger one had not
started speaking when this happened. So my first fear was that I
was never going to hear my daughter's voice. She sounds great now.
</P>
<P>
   My wife was just wonderful when I lost my hearing. Every day she
would call around to try to get more expert opinions, and every day
I'd come home and read in a journal what she had learned. One night
I came home and I was pretty crabby, because this can wear on you.
I came back the next day and I read in the journal, ``Dr. Kevorkian
called today.''
</P>
<P>
   So there was a message in that _ when you have a hearing
impairment you have got to deal with it with a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   When I was younger, I would never have dreamed that I would end
up at General Motors in a job like this. I thought engineers drove
trains. It's like no other industry. It is hard to identify other
consumer products where people get so passionate. The artist
formerly known as Prince wrote a song called ``Little Red
Corvette.'' He didn't write ``Little Red Laptop Computer.''
</P>
<P>
   I was trained as a scientist to do research, to work on
complicated problems. My laboratory today is this whole industry on
a global scale, and it's a ball.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at my research and development and planning
responsibilities as really being innovation and market
responsiveness. It is pretty simple stuff. We've got groups of
people who collect market and technology intelligence. We've got
groups of people who scheme ideas.
</P>
<P>
   I always try to keep about five objectives each year where I
decide I'm going to put a lot of my personal energy. I have learned
that you have to be able to focus. When you have a wild card like
losing your hearing thrown at you, the focus is even more
important.
</P>
<P>
   After GM, I want to go to a small college somewhere and teach
calculus, because I think it's a beautiful way to communicate the
mathematics of engineering and science.

 HARMONY AND THE BOTTOM LINE: Hmm . . .  
 (bl)  
 By JOBERT E. ABUEVA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last spring, everything seemed to go wrong at Lunch at the Ritz
Earwear Inc., a maker of custom jewelry in Lake Katrine, N.Y.,
about 100 miles north of New York City. Several wholesale dealers
it had served went out of business and sales plunged 30 percent.
Key employees quit for no apparent reason and absenteeism soared.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, Esme Hecht and Alexis Watts, were perplexed. Overall
demand in the industry had not changed and neither had the way they
ran their business. So they brought in a consultant, Sophia Tang
Shaul, for advice. She offered this prescription: position a couple
of boulders outside the front doors of the company's
15,000-square-foot plant to ``protect'' the organization; install a
water fountain near the boulders to attract positive energy; move
the office of Watts, the company president, from the southeast end
of the building to the ``wealth quadrant'' on the south side to
improve the bottom line, but keep Hecht, a vice president and
designer, in the west end, or ``creativity sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the company's fortunes improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``When sales picked up, I thought it was a fluke, but it hasn't
died down,'' Hecht said. ``We also have a much happier group of
employees and are hiring more than the number we lost last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the turnaround to Shaul's recommendations. So does
his staff. Miriam Gibbons, the executive sales manager, who has
been with the company since 1995, said, ``I find myself drawn to
the building even on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes, she says, have also increased her productivity.
``When I was moved to the center of the building, which they call
the wealth and power section, I thought, `Sure, whatever,'''
Gibbons said. ``But I, too, started exceeding my goals.''
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, she added, she won two big lottery prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Just what management medicine did Shaul dole out, anyway?
Actually, it may be better described as alternative therapy. It is
called feng shui, the ancient Chinese principles of creating a
harmonious environment.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of Asia, it is routine for businesses and
government agencies to call a feng shui specialist, or
practitioner, to ensure that the lighting, furniture, doors and
windows make up a harmonious whole, enabling  &UR; chi &LR; , or cosmic
energy, to flow freely and bring good fortune and high morale among
employees. Lately, the practice has fast been finding its way into
America's cubicles, factories and boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two years, I've seen a significant shift in my
clientele toward work-related projects,'' said Shaul, co-founder of
168 Feng Shui Advisors in Burbank, Calif., who says her clients
include the movie production company Imagine Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The American Feng Shui Institute in Monterey Park, Calif., says
enrollment in its training classes reached 140 students last year
from just a handful in 1991. The number of consultants listed in
FengShuiDirectory.com has grown to more than 250 since it went
online in 1998. And several books aimed at showing managers and
workers how to harness its force have been published, including
``Feng Shui at Work,'' by Kirsten M. Lagatree (Newleaf, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where you work, you can create an environment that
will enhance your natural gifts and propel you toward success,''
Lagatree wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Because feng shui (pronounced ``fung shway'') combines elements
from astronomy, astrology, geology, mathematics and philosophy,
there is some debate on exactly what it is. To inspect and suggest
rearrangements of work sites, for example, traditional
practitioners use compasses, but the Black Hat Sect School of
Berkeley, Calif., regarded as the catalyst for the movement's
growth in the United States, uses a bagua, an octagonal chart.
</P>
<P>
   Its disciples agree on one thing: it works. Gail Vogel is
convinced that her consultations with Ann Billow, an interior
designer and feng shui specialist in Manhattan, helped her find a
marketing job with Gottesman Co., a mergers and acquisitions
broker. One action she took to enhance her search, she said, was to
add mirrors to her home's ``career'' sector.
</P>
<P>
   Another believer is Janet M. Loeffler, a co-owner of Bath
Island, a personal care and gift shop on Manhattan's Upper West
Side. Business was slack, so she called Judith Wendell of Sacred
Currents, a feng shui design firm, for advice. Wendell suggested
simple changes like adding windsocks and chimes to the entranceway
and eliminating clutter from the office situated in the store's
wealth sector.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in traffic was instantaneous, Loeffler said. People
who thought the shop was relatively new to the neighborhood were
surprised to learn that it had been there 10 years. Other changes
included opening up aisle space, improving lighting and ventilation
and introducing soothing aromas intended to put shoppers in a
buying mode. ``In my six years here, this last one has been the
best,'' said Kenna Kolaitos, a sales clerk.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some skeptics dismiss feng shui as quackery. Craig
Safian, a finance senior manager for Bristol-Myers Squibb who has
worked in Hong Kong, said the practice of reconstructing buildings
there because of feng shui was ``fiscally irresponsible and a sign
of a chemical imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some adherents say the principles are being exploited.
``Someone was interviewed on radio recently because they came up
with feng shui makeup,'' said Wendover Clover, manager of
FengShuiDirectory.com. ``That's ridiculous.''

 &HT;    Is the ACC slipping?
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As college basketball approaches March Madness, the perceived
order of merit has been turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC, long the blueblood of college basketball conferences,
suddenly is on the short end of some important numbers. And in the
SEC, perceived as a football league, the basketball seldom has been
better. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   The polls: The ACC has only two teams (Duke and Maryland) ranked
in the Associated Press Top 25. For the first time, the SEC has six
_ Tennessee, Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, Vanderbilt and LSU.
</P>
<P>
   RPI ratings: The ACC is ranked sixth among conferences in the
Ratings Percentage Index (RPI), one of the components used by the
NCAA Tournament selection committee. The SEC is ranked first.
</P>
<P>
   Non-conference records: The ACC's non-conference winning
percentage (.685, 76-35) is its worst since since 1969. The SEC's
non-conference record (119-35, .773) is the best among all
conferences. The ACC's non-conference schedule is ranked the
sixth-toughest; the SEC's is 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches in the ACC claim the conference is simply a victim of
competitive balance. They howled after the ACC received only three
bids to the NCAA Tournament last season, the least since the field
was expanded to 64 in 1985. And they started lobbying in January
for more bids this time.
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski says critics are scrutinizing the ACC
more than other leagues because of its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me that people will say that we're down and other
conferences are strong,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I don't know what the
difference is, whether it be the Big 12, Big Ten, Big East or
Pac-10. They're very similar. Those conferences will get five (NCAA
bids) or so. I don't understand why everyone is so hard on the
ACC.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in the SEC, coaches are enjoying the conference's
unprecedented success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, without a doubt, our league and the Big Ten from
top to bottom are the strongest I've ever seen,'' Auburn's Cliff
Ellis said. ``Every conference has some great teams, but look at
what our teams have done up and down the league. There are no easy
games in the SEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is the SEC, which had nine Final Four appearances and three
national championships in the 1990s, continuing to climb? And why
is the ACC, with at least one team in the Final Four all but two
years since 1986, perceived to be struggling?
</P>
<P>
   Some factors:
</P>
<P>
   Coaching: An infusion of new coaches has energized some of the
SEC's once-dormant programs. Tennessee's Jerry Green (three years),
Auburn's Cliff Ellis (six years) and Florida's Billy Donovan (four
years) all have had their teams in the Top 10 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt's Kevin Stallings is in his first year and LSU's John
Brady is in his third. Only one coach in the SEC, Arkansas's Nolan
Richardson (15 years), has been at his post more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the ACC lost college basketball's all-time
winner in North Carolina's Dean Smith. The Tar Heels continue to
win under Bill Guthridge, but the program appears to be slipping.
Clemson lost Rick Barnes, who led the Tigers into the Top 10, to
Texas, and the program has declined under his replacement, Larry
Shyatt. Two veteran coaches, Georgia Tech's Bobby Cremins (19
years) and Wake Forest's Dave Odom (11 years) are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Talent drain: In the 1990s, the ACC lost 18 underclassmen to the
NBA draft. Just last season Duke lost two sophomores (Elton Brand,
William Avery) and a freshman (Corey Maggette). Maryland's Steve
Francis jumped after his lone season as a junior, and Georgia
Tech's Dion Glover left after sitting out his sophomore year with a
knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the SEC's best senior players _ Auburn's Chris Porter,
Kentucky's Jamaal Magloire, Vanderbilt's Dan Langhi, and LSU's
Jabari Smith _ all returned this season. One exception was Georgia
sophomore Jumaine Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's dominance: Duke's 106-86 win over Virginia on Saturday
was the Blue Devils' 31st consecutive ACC victory, a streak once
considered impossible in the rugged conference. The ability of one
team to dominate the rest does not speak well for the overall
strength of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams are even in our league,'' Wake Forest's Odom
said. ``What concerns me the most is that the other teams in the
league have not kept pace with Duke. It's hard to defend.
Otherwise, they wouldn't be undefeated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the SEC, Tennessee (19-3), Florida (17-4) and Auburn (19-3)
rank high, but no one team has dominated. Auburn lost on the road
to Mississippi. Tennessee lost at home to Vanderbilt and on the
road at Kentucky. Florida had risen to No. 6 in the rankings when
the Gators lost at Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other leagues I've been in, you would always have some
nights off where you knew you would win if you just played hard,''
said Georgia coach Jim Harrick, in his first year in the SEC. ``You
don't have that in this league. You have to be ready night in and
night out or you're going to get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom feeders: The relative strength of a conference is
often gauged by the teams on the bottom. South Carolina (9-13), in
the SEC East cellar, gave undefeated and No. 4 ranked Syracuse all
it wanted before falling in overtime. The Gamecocks also have
beaten Virginia and lost a three-point game to No. 8 Michigan
State.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson, the bottom team in the ACC, has a win over N.C. State
at home, but the Tigers have also lost to Wofford, South Carolina
State and Appalachian State. Wake Forest's overtime loss to
Davidson on Feb. 2 did not help the conference.
</P>
<P>
   How will all this affect selections for the NCAA Tournament?
</P>
<P>
   Despite its relatively low rating, the ACC still thinks it will
get five bids: Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, N.C. State and
Virginia. Only Duke and Maryland are locks. North Carolina (14-9)
has tradition with 25 consecutive NCAA appearances, but the Tar
Heels have to play at N.C. State, Maryland and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State (15-5) hurt its chances Sunday when it blew a
17-point lead and lost at Maryland. Now, the Wolfpack must play
four of their remaining eight on the road, where they are 1-5 this
season. Virginia (15-7), which was pounded on the road at Duke on
Saturday, has to play N.C. State North Carolina, and Maryland down
the stretch. Its RPI of 69 won't help.
</P>
<P>
   SEC coaches think they will get six tournament bids for the
second consecutive year. Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida, Vanderbilt,
Auburn and LSU are all rated 33 or better in the RPI. Those numbers
mean that most of them should get favorable seedings, which
enhances the possiblity multiple teams in the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in his league four years as a head coach and five
years as an assistant, and we've never had this kind of parity,''
Florida coach Billy Donovan said. ``We've got some teams in this
conference that can go a long way in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   And the future looks even better for the SEC _ on the 12 teams'
rosters there are 104 freshmen and sophomores and only 58 juniors
and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   SEC RULES THE ROOST

SO WHO NEEDS VINTAGE CHARTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Bruno Prats, then the owner of Chateau Cos
d'Estournel, in St.-Estephe, declared that there would be no more
bad vintages of wine. At the time I considered his remarks the
height of arrogance, a characteristic not unknown among the
Bordelais.
</P>
<P>
   I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   His was a bit of an overstatement, perhaps, but essentially,
Prats was right on the mark. Great wine may still be elusive, but
rarely now does a year go by that doesn't produce good wine, even
in marginal regions like Bordeaux, where the weather is as risky as
a dot-com stock.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is that in the cellar and the vineyard,
the winemakers of the world have rendered the vintage chart
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, a vintage chart tracks various categories
of wine over a period of years. Most vintage charts use numerical
ratings; some add a code indicating whether the wines are too young
to drink, ready to drink or seriously past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I have produced vintage chart after chart, always
adding enough qualifications and caveats to make the reader wonder
why I bothered in the first place. I am not alone. Each year,
Robert M. Parker Jr. publishes a vintage chart of daunting
thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   This year's has 28 separate wine categories. Even so, he warns:
``This vintage chart should be regarded as a very general overall
rating slanted in favor of what the finest producers were capable
of producing in a particular viticultural region. Such charts are
filled with exceptions to the rule. Astonishingly good wines from
skillful or lucky vintners in years rated mediocre, and thin,
diluted, characterless wines from incompetent or greedy producers
in great years.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage charts assume a high degree of homogeneity: Northern
California, the Central Coast, the South Central Coast. But can a
single rating for Northern California adequately cover the northern
reaches of Mendocino, the furnacelike valley floor of Calistoga and
the fog-shrouded hills of Carneros? And what about the Amador
County vineyards, far to the east?
</P>
<P>
   In Sonoma County, the wines of Dry Creek are different from
those of the Alexander Valley, which are not the same as those from
the Russian River or the Sonoma Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The first vintage charts came from France and were compact cards
with listings for Bordeaux, Burgundy, Beaujolais, the Rhone,
Champagne and the Loire. Today, superior wines are made in Alsace,
the Languedoc, in Roussillon and the Southwest, often when wines
from more traditional regions are less than exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Can any single vintage chart do justice to Italy, where there
are a hundred different wine regions, where remarkable wines might
be made in the foothills of the Alps and in Sicily in the same year
that mediocre or poor wines come from Tuscany and Umbria?
</P>
<P>
   A chart might report conscientiously that, say, 1997 was a good
year in Spain. Where in Spain: Penedes? Rioja? Navarre? Priorat?
Rueda? Ribera del Duero? And what of the newest wine sources _
Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa? Don't
they deserve space on the charts? And even if they got it, what
chart could show their growing diversity?
</P>
<P>
   Both Chile and Argentina are developing new wine regions far to
the south of their traditional vineyards; Australia's Margaret
River region is 2,000 miles from its Hunter Valley; South Africa
makes different wines in Hermanus from what it does in
Stellenbosch.
</P>
<P>
   A vintage chart will advise, say, that the 1998 Bordeaux will
need several years of bottle aging after they arrive here in 2001.
But a consumer finds the shops already filled with 1998s that are,
he is told, ready now. Of course, the chart concerns itself only
with the classified growths, the finest of the Bordeaux wines, and
ignores the hundreds of lesser wines, many of which, these days,
are startlingly close to their better-known siblings in quality.
</P>
<P>
   The vintage chart speaks to wine regions at a time when
winemakers _ and consumers _ are increasingly concerned with
terroir, the uniqueness of small plots of land. Some vintners now
produce five or six separate wines from half a dozen small
contiguous vineyards, while others make two or three different
wines from the same vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   There are highs, like 1945, 1961 and 1982 in Bordeaux and 1994
in the Napa Valley, and lows, like 1991 or 1992 in Bordeaux and
Tuscany, but not one year when some decent Bordeaux wine was not
produced. But it's unlikely that we will ever see vintages like
1963 and 1965, dreadful years in Bordeaux that resulted in dreadful
wine.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be years when nature doesn't cooperate, like
1991 and 1992 in Bordeaux, but even in those years, pleasant,
drinkable if not age-worthy wines were made.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, hardier rootstocks, better grapes, limited yields
and severe grape selection at harvest time have increased quality.
So, too, have new organic methods of pest and disease control and
new planting techniques. In the 1960s, wine was made much as it had
been made in the 1860s. Now, NASA satellites tell growers where to
plant and which efforts have been the most successful.
</P>
<P>
   This is not quite a golden age of wine; in spite of everything
there will always be dull or poorly made wines around. But those
are not problems of the vintage. And competition, which is keener
than ever, makes it difficult for plonk to survive in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage charts are not entirely passe. Wine can be confusing,
and the chart does offer some general information, as Parker, the
critic, suggests. And of course, in the auction rooms, where
collectors haggle over the 1982 Petrus and the 1994 Romanee-Conti,
vintage charts can serve as a handy reference tool. Elsewhere,
though, vintages are increasingly irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't think I'm alone in that point of view. In the past,
letters would begin to come in about a year after the last vintage
chart appeared here. When, they asked, would the next chart appear?
No longer. A lot of people must be deciding for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the final frames of ``Little Caesar,'' Edward G. Robinson
snarls, ``Is this the end of Rico?''
</P>
<P>
   To my way of thinking, that sacred talisman of the wine buff,
the vintage chart, is just as dead as Rico was when the screen went
to black.

 &HT;    MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT COULD SLOW REFORM PUSH, PANEL WARNED
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare
could deflate the pressure to make necessary reforms to the
program, a Senate panel was warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a temptation to have dessert first before we get on
with the main meal,'' Comptroller General David M. Walker told the
Senate Special Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Without major reforms, the Medicare hospital trust fund could be
broke by 2015. Even with the infusion of money from the expected
budget surplus, Medicare costs will crowd out other federal
programs in the coming decades, Walker warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that prescription drugs is going to be
added'' to Medicare, Walker said. ``The question is is it going to
be first,'' he said, ``and if you take that approach does it
relieve pressure'' for comprehensive reform?
</P>
<P>
   Walker's comments came as lawmakers began considering whether
and to what extent to reform the federal health care program for 40
million elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Monday proposed adding a $195 million
prescription drug benefit to Medicare over the next 10 years while
using $300 billion from the federal surplus to extend the trust
fund's life to 2025.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also considered a competing proposal by Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., and Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., to reform Medicare
while adding a prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is not nearly as good as it should be or nearly as
good as it could be,'' said Frist, a heart surgeon. ``It's
inadequate, it's outdated,'' it only covers about 53 percent of the
elderly's health costs, and it is still going broke, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Breaux-Frist bill _ modeled after the Federal Employees
Health Benefit Plan _ would allow Medicare beneficiaries to pick
from a menu of health plans. Premiums would vary from one plan to
another, with the federal government subsidizing most of the cost
of the average plan.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is similar to a proposal that gained a majority vote of
the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare last
year. Breaux chaired the commission, and Frist was a member.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux emphasized that Medicare beneficiaries who want to stay
in the current fee-for-service program would not be forced to go
into a managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the commission proposal a year ago, the Breaux-Frist bill
would offer voluntary prescription drug coverage through federally
subsidized premiums. Low-income beneficiaries would have their
premiums fully subsidized, while those with higher incomes would
pay up to 75 percent of the premium. The amount of the premium has
not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who with Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine,
has introduced a bill that would offer an immediate drug benefit,
suggested there could be a compromise between their bill, the
Breaux-Frist bill, and the Clinton proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-tenth of the United States Senate is pretty close together
on prescription drug coverage,'' Wyden said, referring to the Aging
Committee panel.

   Professor C.K. Prahalad believes a Copernican revolution is
putting the consumer at the active center of the business universe.
That is his vision of the Internet economy, and he isn't by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Why listen to Prahalad? A decade ago, he and a colleague, Gary
Hamel, opened up new pathways in business thinking with a
relatively simple but powerful idea. They said that a business
should think of itself not as boxes on an organization chart but as
a collection of skills, or competences, that cut across internal
boundaries. Break down those boxes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Most critical was that a company truly understand its ``core
competences'' _ the skills and technology unique to it, the
strengths that paid the rent and positioned the company to attack
new markets. These were ``the soul of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   That concept found a permanent place in the business vocabulary.
Today, it is hard to find an enterprise of any sort that has not
put considerable energy into figuring out its core competences,
separating what is fundamental from what is not.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet economy has forced a rethinking of what to look
for and where to look for it, just as the astronomer Copernicus
challenged the orthodoxies of 16th-century European science.
</P>
<P>
   Look outward, not inward, Prahalad urges. See yourself as others
see you. A vital source of strength, maybe the most vital, lies in
the untapped power of your customers to exploit the Internet. The
flood of product information to them, the ease with which they can
sort through it and the potential they have for uniting with other
Internet users all combine to shift the balance of market power
decisively toward the consumer, he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying that consumers are going to drive the firm,''
Prahalad, who teaches at the University of Michigan Business
School, said by telephone last week. Consumers are already doing
that, he said, at Internet companies, which started up without the
baggage of traditional ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, businesses have always tried to figure out their
customers. But the Internet world allows customers to take
initiative, to talk back, assert preferences and flow quickly to
the most responsive sellers. The new task for business is
discovering how to channel that power. To succeed, Prahalad said,
companies will have to figure out how to experience their products
as consumers experience them. They will have to understand what the
customer encounters at every step, from beginning the search for a
product to buying it, using it and finally disposing of it.
</P>
<P>
   The professor explains how this can be done in a Harvard
Business Review article, ``Co-opting Customer Competence,'' which
was written with a University of Michigan colleague, Venkatram
Ramaswamy.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, the product is ``no more than an artifact around
which customers have experiences.'' If so, that puts the customer
firmly in the driver's seat. The company makes the product, but it
cannot dictate the customer's experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet makes it possible to reach customers in new ways,
however, and management can use this tool to offer an engaging
experience. Ideally that experience should offer enough choices to
allow a customer to shape his own path. The goal is to draw on
customers' talents, shape their expectations and encourage
communities to form around the product. A company can absorb the
customers' knowledge of the product and their suggestions for
making it better. The customers become product developers. These
efforts can be mammoth. More than 650,000 Microsoft customers
tested a trial version of Windows 2000, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Prahalad and Ramaswamy suggest a four-part blueprint. Encourage
an active dialogue (as Amazon.com has done with its book
recommendations and reviews). Mobilize customer communities (much
as customers of Cisco Systems commonly solve one another's
problems). Manage customer diversity (for example, by gearing a
product to various skill levels). To the greatest extent possible,
personalize the customer's experience (like learning software that
adapts itself to a child's ability).
</P>
<P>
   With the right sites, companies can do a lot to hold onto
customers. Scholars who track consumers' buying from site to site
have generally found that they do not dart about seeking the lowest
price. People seem to learn a site and settle in.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that tendency points up an apparent paradox: Though
consumers hold the best cards, smart management, with superior
offerings, can draw them into playing those cards its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who believe that consumers have all the power
in the new economy,'' said Eric J. Johnson, a professor of
marketing at the Columbia Business School, ``that because
competition is only a click away, they'll patrol for prices, or
even better, have search robots patrol.'' That does not seem to be
happening. In fact, he found that most customers who bought a book
in a given month went to only one site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules change,'' Johnson said of the Internet economy.
``The results are pretty much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, consumers already collaborate with Internet
companies every time they fill out an Internet form. ``A basic
premise of Web business is getting the customer to do the work in
the form of data entry,'' said Thomas R. Eisenmann, who teaches
e-commerce at the Harvard Business School. An airline customer can
write himself an e-ticket on the Web and then check in with a
machine at the airport, assuring the device that he packed his own
bag.
</P>
<P>
   For Web companies, the customer is already the center of the
universe. At innumerable sites, the customers provide the product.
At iVillage, Professor Eisenmann said, ``They learned pretty
quickly that the reason their audience was coming was to read and
react to what other folks had to say.'' At other sites, the product
is consumers stating their preferences in goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenmann agrees that the Web can powerfully amplify consumer
experiences. The customers' reviews that affect business are
``turbocharged'' on the Web, he said. ``People are in touch with
one another through their computers, on e-mail and so forth, so if
they had a good experience or a bad experience or an exciting
experience, word is going to travel much faster. You tell more
people and you tell them more quickly. It's the same phenomenon,
word of mouth, but it's charged up.''

PBS'S SUPERB `GREEKS' BREATHES LIFE INTO GHOSTS OF AN ANCIENT
EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vernon Dobtcheff, Willy Bowman, Jeffery Dench and Bill Reimbold
will no doubt have other roles that audiences remember fondly. But
they may never do a greater service than reminding us that the
alabaster of antiquity is only in our minds, that the ancient
Greeks were so much more than the bloodless white marble of museum
galleries and coffee-table books.
</P>
<P>
   In a manner of speaking, Dobtcheff et al. are the stars of PBS's
``The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization,'' though they don't utter a
word. Like live mannequins in a department-store window, they stand
rock steady, letting the camera move around in a bit of ingenious
filmmaking that goes Ken Burns one better. Where Burns gives life
to static objects, director Cassian Harrison uses the same
technique to give monumental stature to real people. So Dobtcheff
becomes a ``living portrait'' of Cleisthenes, the first democrat.
Bowman is Themistocles, the wily general who sent the Persians
packing. Dench is Pericles, the cultural visionary who built the
Parthenon. And Reimbold is Socrates, the most famous unappreciated
critic.
</P>
<P>
   These four Athenians of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.
hardly constitute the complete Greek package tour, but in telling
their stories to humanize the Greek saga, Harrison and producer
Anthony Geffen have nimbly vivified ancient history. For Princeton
University professor Josh Ober, an expert who appears in the film,
the effect is significant. ``We always start with this image of
pure, white sculpture, this idealized vision of a perfect world
that is dead and distant,'' Ober said recently. ``For me, part of
the excitement of this series is that it ... starts out not just
with the marble images but with a world in which you begin to
imagine the Greeks as flesh and blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of three one-hour segments that PBS has crammed into a
single 2{-hour special for no good reason, ``The Greeks''
incorporates big-budget technology, such as 3-D camera work and
digital animation, to make the trip back 2,500 years more enjoyable
than your average history class.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and Geffen don't overdo the whiz-bang stuff, creating
what Geffen accurately describes as ``a kind of mosaic using all
sorts of different textures to give ... a feeling of what Greek
life would have been like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greeks'' is the first of several ``Empires'' specials that
also will examine Islam, Napoleon, Rome and Britain. Aided by Liam
Neeson's engaged narration, it's a fine start, making the
achievements of the Greeks _ democracy, science, politics,
philosophy, etc. _ amazingly accessible.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization. Two-and-a-half-hour
``Empires'' documentary about the rise, the demise and the legacy
of the Greek empire. Wednesday night on PBS. Check local listings.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon the temperature soared to 65 degrees in Rapid
City, S.D., as air heated by compression upon descending the
Rockies spread over the Great Plains. Unseasonable warmth will once
again cover a large area from the Front Range of Colorado to the
lower Mississippi Valley Wednesday amid plentiful sunshine. Indeed,
readings will approach 70 degrees as far north as Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the southwest will also direct milder air into the
Northeastern States. After a cold start to the day ample sunshine,
filtered at times by high cirrus clouds, will boost temperatures
well into the 40s. A few snow showers will reach northern New
England and the Adirondacks during the afternoon as a cold front
approaches from southern Canada. Behind the front, cold air pouring
southward across the open waters of Lake Superior will cause snow
showers in Michigan's upper peninsula overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Moist air surrounding a jet stream disturbance will cause
showers along the Carolina shore, especially early Wednesday.
Farther south, morning clouds will yield to afternoon sunshine over
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will accompany a jet stream disturbance crossing central
California Wednesday. Rainfall will be locally prodigious with up
to an inch possible in a few locations. Heavy snow will occur in
the higher elevations of the Sierra above 5,000 feet. As the
Pacific moisture streams eastward, valley showers and mountain snow
will occur along the west-facing slopes of the central Rockies.
Elsewhere, a stripe of snow will cover the northwestern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: End of Bitterness
</P>
<P>
   While the potential for wintry weather will persist for the next
several weeks, the time when the most bitter arctic air masses can
reach the East is coming to end. Climatological records at most
Northeastern cities reveal that all-time minimum temperatures occur
before the middle of February. For example in New York City, the
lowest temperature on record was reached on February 9, 1934, when
the mercury plummeted to minus 15 degrees. Sunlight is gradually
growing stronger in central and northern Canada, interfering with
the process that builds frigid air masses during the long arctic
night.

NEW YORK TO GIVE COLLEGE REMEDIAL COURSES AS EARLY AS
NINTH - GRADE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Showing a new cooperative spirit, the Board of
Education and the City University of New York are teaming up to
expand a program that tries to make sure high school graduates do
not need remedial work when they enter college.
</P>
<P>
   Harold O. Levy, the interim schools chancellor, and Chancellor
Matthew Goldstein of CUNY announced jointly Monday that within
three years, all city high school students would be able to take
CUNY's English and math placement examinations as early as
ninth-grade. Those who fail the test would be able to take remedial
courses taught by CUNY professors or adjunct teachers while still
in high school. Those who pass would be able to have a taste of
college-level courses in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which would expand CUNY's work in 100 city high
schools, is one of the broadest efforts nationally by a public
university to assume a more direct role in high school education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this work with students will ensure that they
will not need remedial assistance when they get to college,'' said
Herman Badillo, CUNY's chairman, who was the primary architect of
the policy to bar students who are not ready for college-level work
from CUNY's senior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,000 students in the 11th- and 12th-grade participate in
the CUNY program, College Now, taking classes before or after
school. With Monday's announcement, CUNY and the Board of Education
plan to expand College Now to all 213 of the city's high schools,
and to include ninth- and 10th-graders, too. They hope to draw a
total of 45,000 students by 2002, at a cost of $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   College Now was started in 1983 by Kingsborough Community
College in Brooklyn and its president, Leon Goldstein, working with
nearby high schools. CUNY expanded it to all 17 of its colleges in
the face of criticism that its effort to accommodate the needs of
so many poorly prepared students had turned the university into a
remedial mill.
</P>
<P>
   Some students who went through the early years of the program _
including several now teaching in the city's public schools _ said
that it helped ease their transition to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very uncertain about attending college,'' said Marlon
Seaton, a math teacher at New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn. ``I
was very intimidated and very afraid.'' But doing well in sociology
and writing _ the two courses he took through College Now _
``helped me build confidence and know that I could do the work,''
Seaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Bonavita, who teaches social studies at Franklin Delano
Roosevelt High School in Brooklyn, said College Now had helped
reassure him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're 16 and you're insecure,'' he recalled, ``but I got an A
and a B in the courses I took, and I didn't worry after that.''
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of New York City's graduating seniors go to
CUNY, making up about 44 percent of CUNY's incoming freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration between the two systems is likely to gain momentum
from the warm relationship between the two chancellors, who met
last year when CUNY was seeking the Regents' approval to move
forward with its new remedial policy. Levy, who resigned as a
regent to become acting schools chancellor, served as a frequent
swing vote for CUNY. A picture of the two men together hangs on
Levy's office wall, near one of Levy and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Levy denied that the CUNY program suggested that the high
schools are not up to par.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't imply that at all,'' he said. ``This is an outreach
program that will make students realize what college is about.''

STYLISTS THINK RODMAN'S HAIR IS TO DYE FOR

<P>
   Red may be the most popular hair color these days, but given the
chance to run their fingers through Dennis Rodman's tresses, local
stylists say they'd go a whole other route for the eccentric player
known as the Worm.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, green and blue come to mind because they are the
Dallas Mavericks' colors. So do white, and, uh, blond. Rodman seems
to like blonds.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Thorne, who owns Vivian's Healthy Hair in suburban
Dallas, plans to be at Reunion Arena on Wednesday night when Rodman
is scheduled to make his debut with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be at the game rooting the Worm on and passing out my
business cards _ the color specialist,'' Thorne said with a big
laugh. ``I'd love to do his hair.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Rodman, however, she understands that
conventional wisdom will have to go the way of the wind. While hair
colors generally change with the seasons, Rodman's change on a
whim. He may even be aware that right now, red, as in Marie Osmond
red, is in.
</P>
<P>
   But for Rodman, Thorne said, ``I'd color him gold and put green
dots or a green `M' for Mavericks in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   For every color one might imagine for him, there is a salon and
stylist who'd pay for a chance to color his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wright, manager of Shelton's Beauty Salon in Fort Worth,
said, ``I think if I were going to pick one for Rodman, it'd be one
side red, one side blue and a big white star in the middle like the
Texas flag.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks signed Rodman last week for the balance of the
season at a prorated salary of $452,941.20, hoping that his rugged
defense and rebounding skills will help the team make a late bid
for the playoffs and that his adventures on and off the court will
put the team back into the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Internet is any indication, Rodman may be more
popular for his hair styles than for his rebounds and relationships
with divas such as Madonna and Carmen Electra.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of color photographs of the basketball
star's hairdos on the Web. In fact, visitors to www.live-ent.com
can vote on 39 colors and designs he's sported.
</P>
<P>
   Members.aol.com even lists Rodman's hair secrets, although it
cannot vouch for their authenticity. The ``secrets'' come with a
warning and disclaimer, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Local hairdressers say that coloring your hair is serious
business and should be done by a professional. But if you insist on
doing it yourself, they suggest using ``a really good moisturizer''
when coloring to keep the hair looking natural and supple; then
after it's colored, use a product that has sunblock as an
ingredient and wear a hat if you're out in the hot sun, or skiing
or swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, 38, apparently has not suffered any fallout from
coloring his hair as often as he does. But is it possible to color
your hair too much? Hairdressers say it depends on how fast your
tresses grow and whether the color is permanent or a rinse.
</P>
<P>
   ``For black people, I would suggest twice a year, but I'm sure
I'll get some debate on that,'' Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright recommends re-coloring only the roots, or new growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every third or fourth week, we might pull the color through to
the end. Otherwise you can do some very serious damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Fennell, whose Fort Worth salon Garbo's is named for actress
Greta Garbo, said that because hair coloring has improved so much
over the years, the frequency of coloring hair is not as important
as it was when she got into the business 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color we use now is so much more gentle to the hair than
what we used 20 years ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And this, she said, may account for Rodman's rainbow of colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably uses a stain,'' Fennell said. ``There's not a lot
of ammonia in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no facts to support the theory, Rodman's
penchant for coloring his hair may be prompting more men to do it.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that you never saw a man getting his hair colored
in a salon, Fennell said, but that's not the case any more.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of men come for color enhancers or to hide
their gray, many also want to get something a little funky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, for the most part, are doing really short and going for
blond, funky little highlights on the top,'' Wright said,
attributing the trend to movies and the music industry. The more
you see it on television, the more commonplace it becomes. In
addition, paying attention to one's appearance has become more
acceptable for guys everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd like to do Rodman's hair, Wright said: ``I don't
see why not. I think it'd be great fun. I think he'd be great
fun.''

can vote on 39 colors and designs he's sported.
</P>
<P>
   Members.aol.com even lists Rodman's hair secrets, although it
cannot vouch for their authenticity. The ``secrets'' come with a
warning and disclaimer, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Local hairdressers say that coloring your hair is serious
business and should be done by a professional. But if you insist on
doing it yourself, they suggest using ``a really good moisturizer''
when coloring to keep the hair looking natural and supple; then
after it's colored, use a product that has sunblock as an
ingredient and wear a hat if you're out in the hot sun, or skiing
or swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, 38, apparently has not suffered any fallout from
coloring his hair as often as he does. But is it possible to color
your hair too much? Hairdressers say it depends on how fast your
tresses grow and whether the color is permanent or a rinse.
</P>
<P>
   ``For black people, I would suggest twice a year, but I'm sure
I'll get some debate on that,'' Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright recommends re-coloring only the roots, or new growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every third or fourth week, we might pull the color through to
the end. Otherwise you can do some very serious damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Fennell, whose Fort Worth salon Garbo's is named for actress
Greta Garbo, said that because hair coloring has improved so much
over the years, the frequency of coloring hair is not as important
as it was when she got into the business 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color we use now is so much more gentle to the hair than
what we used 20 years ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And this, she said, may account for Rodman's rainbow of colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably uses a stain,'' Fennell said. ``There's not a lot
of ammonia in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no facts to support the theory, Rodman's
penchant for coloring his hair may be prompting more men to do it.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that you never saw a man getting his hair colored
in a salon, Fennell said, but that's not the case any more.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of men come for color enhancers or to hide
their gray, many also want to get something a little funky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, for the most part, are doing really short and going for
blond, funky little highlights on the top,'' Wright said,
attributing the trend to movies and the music industry. The more
you see it on television, the more commonplace it becomes. In
addition, paying attention to one's appearance has become more
acceptable for guys everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd like to do Rodman's hair, Wright said: ``I don't
see why not. I think it'd be great fun. I think he'd be great
fun.''

UNDATED: xxx recalls Kosinski. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As for the exhibit's Picasso section, Kosinski started a
multifront assault on Paris' Musee Picasso with numerous visits and
as many personal letters. Kosinski targeted Anne Baldassari at the
Musee Picasso, knowing she had published extensively on
photography's influence on Picasso. Baldassari eventually helped
Kosinski cobble together a master list of Picasso oils and works on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the people in Paris knew me, you can imagine how
inundated with requests the Picasso collection is,'' Kosinski says.
``But if you just persist and speak with eloquence, people will
feel confident about your project.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a major show's organizers travel to the ends of the
earth to guarantee their exhibit will have the choicest works.
Charles Stuckey of the Kimbell recalls the summer of 1987, when he
was a curator at the National Gallery of Art and working on a
definitive Gauguin retrospective. Stuckey, with officials from the
Art Institute of Chicago and Paris' Grand Palais, chartered a plane
to the Tahitian island where Gauguin died. In addition, he tracked
down a prized missing panel relief that wrapped around the door of
Gauguin's home. It would become one of the centerpieces of the
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so eager to get that missing piece, yet we couldn't
come across as scavengers,'' recalls Stuckey. ``So we had to
convince the owner just how advantageous it would be to share this
great art.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest behind-the-scenes maneuver helping a big
show acquire all the right pieces of art is the bartering of one
art piece for another. Though much denied, the manipulative nature
of this process becomes vital lubrication to big-show
orchestration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, it really can boil down to you wanting my Vermeer,
well I want your Picasso and two years later, you send the work
on,'' says Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Museums propagate the notion that this exchange is quite
collegial, proudly pointing to a recent deal in which Washington's
National Gallery of Art wanted to borrow Caravaggio's ``The Taking
of Christ'' from the National Gallery of Ireland. Since Ireland's
gallery is relatively small, it hesitated to lend the Caravaggio,
worrying about disappointing local fans flocking to see the great
Italian work.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Ireland decided to borrow one of our major Gauguins to
reward the audience coming to the museum yet not finding the
Caravaggio,'' says D. Dodge Thompson, chief of exhibitions at the
National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   For the recently completed ``Adriaen de Vries, Imperial
Sculptor'' show at Los Angeles' Getty, the Rijksmuseum in
Amsterdam, one of the exhibit's major lenders, requested access to
the Getty's finest Dutch works for the Rijksmuseum's upcoming ``The
Glory of the Golden Age'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, you can't be a borrower if you are not a
lender and if you try to be, you will get on a blacklist,''
Considine says.
</P>
<P>
   Certain works of art, no matter how vital to a major exhibition,
are taken off the barter table owing to their fragility. The
National Gallery of Art never makes available Leonardo da Vinci's
``Ginevra de Benci,'' as the 1474 work is a panel painting
extremely vulnerable to any shifts in relative humidity.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes it just depends on who is doing the asking. ``When
the Louvre asks to borrow something, it is really difficult to
refuse, because you know you will need their generosity for your
future big shows,'' says Edmund Pillsbury, former director of the
Kimbell Art Museum and current chief executive of Pillsbury and
Peters Fine Art.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing the shipping of artworks to a big exhibition may be a
museum's most nerve-racking part of big-show preparation. For the
de Vries show, the Getty had to coordinate shipments from museums
in England, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria,
Sweden, Denmark and the Czech Republic. And there was much high
anxiety surrounding the shipment of the works. In one instance, a
cargo of de Vries sculptures was bumped from a KLM flight in favor
of a crate of flowers and horses, setting back the Getty's
preparations by a crucial week.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the artworks to flow in, a museum can't remain
idle. The DMA's organizers for ``Degas to Picasso'' assembled the
show's mammoth accompanying catalog, editing its 18 scholarly
contributions and verifying provenance details. Next came erection
of special walls, which received a fresh coat of paint and
silk-screened graphic art. For the de Vries show, the Getty
outfitted the sculptures' pedestals with earthquake-sensitive
mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Helping insulate a big show from the potentially ruinous cost of
replacing or repairing a loaned masterpiece from overseas is
insurance. Dispensing this coverage, perhaps the most vital support
to any ambitious exhibition, is the Federal Council on the Arts and
the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   With a $5 billion fund for all eligible exhibitions, the
national indemnification program offers 90 percent coverage and
entertains around 25 applications from museums annually. The
application is a 25- to 30-page document filled with such details
as how much loaned artwork is involved, what its appraised value
is, and, curiously, the amount of ``foot-candles'' of illumination
focused on the art.
</P>
<P>
   But not even a healthy insurance backstop means that all great
art will be free to travel to the great exhibitions. ``I personally
don't anticipate the really great stuff coming back over and over
again,'' Hoving says. ``There will never be another Vermeer show
like the one in Washington two years ago. Just think if you lose
one of those. It's beyond money to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, even if a major show is perfectly insured and
meticulously planned for, it won't survive a day if no one knows
about it. Fulfilling the final, marketing piece of ``Degas to
Picasso,'' the DMA hired The Powell Group, a Dallas-based marketing
firm that not only helped design radio and television campaigns,
but also provided promotional materials to hotel concierges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake: Large shows are like the theater business,
with the use of sophisticated Madison Avenue techniques, including
audience surveys, to determine exactly how to draw the people in,''
Pillsbury says.
</P>
<P>
   For the DMA's ``Degas to Picasso,'' all its blustery buzz paid
off, judging by the strong advance word in everything from The Wall
Street Journal to The Art Newspaper. Maybe that's because of the
spot-on recognition factor, a fact aided by not naming it ``Von
Stuck to Khnopff,'' as was jokingly first considered. ``Degas to
Picasso'' sounded much more like a blockbuster.

&HT;     NOVELIST DANIELLE STEEL SPEAKS OF SON'S SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Best-selling romance novelist Danielle Steel told a
congressional panel Tuesday that manic depressive children must be
diagnosed and treated to prevent suicides such as that of her son
Nick Traina who took a lethal overdose of morphine two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Steel, a San Francisco mother of nine who has written 77 books,
including ``His Bright Light,'' the story of the life and suicide
of her 19-year-old son, asked Congress to ``open the eyes'' of the
public and of doctors and help erase the stigma of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Steel said it's not ``good enough to diagnose bi-polars in their
twenties, as was the tradition _ they are sick long before that.
They need help long before that. They need medication long before
that. They die long before that.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 to 20 percent of people with bi-polar disorder, also
known as manic depression, commit suicide, according to Susan J.
Blumenthal, assistant Surgeon General for the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services. Blumenthal, who also spoke at the
hearing, said the 1 percent of the population diagnosed with the
mood disorder alternate between a high of racing or grandiose
thoughts, fast-talking or buying sprees and a low in which they may
stay in bed, or can't eat or sleep.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 Americans commit suicide every year, the bulk of
them older white males, according to the federal Centers for
Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   Blinking back tears, Steel told a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee hearing on suicide awareness that her son Nick was
``brilliant, charming, wonderful, loving, talented, funny,
outrageous, tormented, unforgettable,'' and suffered from manic
depression all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Steel said she noticed something was wrong when her son was 2
years old and was ``like a record playing on the wrong speed, way,
way too fast.'' She said she sensed there ``were terrible demons
lurking deep within,'' but doctors and psychiatrists assured her he
was fine.
</P>
<P>
   After Nick's best friend died in a car accident, he began
dabbling in drugs and alternated between being ``jubilant, loving
and funny'' and ``too depressed to move.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 13, Steel said, her son spent time in programs for
emotionally disturbed kids, but doctors blamed his behavior on a
high IQ. He was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. By age
15, he was ``curled in a ball, terrified and sick'' and in mental
hospitals for months, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, Steel said her son was diagnosed bi-polar, put on
lithium medication and became happy again, returning to school to
earn straight As. He launched a music career as a composer and lead
singer of a punk rock band, released nine CDs, toured nationally
and appeared on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Steel said it was when her son decided to stop taking Lithium at
age 18 that he spiraled into depression and attempted suicide three
times before he took a massive overdose of morphine and died at 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he did it because he could not bear to sink to the
depths again, and knew he would one day,'' Steel said. ``It was his
only way out. His final freedom from pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel, who brought five of her eight children with her to
Capitol Hill, said later in an interview that she is ``terribly
shy'' and doesn't usually speak publicly but came forward to honor
her son.
</P>
<P>
   She said the stigma that comes with mental illness is an extra
burden that must be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame it's such a dark secret,'' she said. ``We need to
treat it like diabetes or any other condition.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered this advice to parents: ``If you think your child is
sick, follow it. Trust your heart, get help. It's a fight you
cannot afford to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., who also spoke at the hearing, motioned
toward a quilt on the wall commemorating people who have committed
suicide, including his father, a coal miner who took his life at
age 57.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said there must be a ``massive public awareness'' campaign
to tell people that suicide ``happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said the stigma against mental illness prevents people from
seeking much needed help and said there must be more research to
figure out why people kill themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was held at Reid's request because he wants more
federal money to develop a national anti-suicide strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist and professor of psychiatry
at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who said she suffered from
manic depression and tried to kill herself at age 28, said
physicians need to do more, adding that an American commits suicide
every 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a terrible gap between what we know and what we do
about it and this gap is lethal,'' she said.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The staid Baltimore Museum of Art has undergone
something of a makeover, literally reopening its front door and
exhibiting the work of a local artist in a successful effort to
attract more of this city's diverse population.
</P>
<P>
   Since late January, visitors of all races and backgrounds have
been milling in the halls, drawn to the museum by a show centering
on the Baltimore artist Joyce J. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years the formal entrance through the columns atop the
museum's grand stone steps had been closed, with a side door near
the museum store designated as the main entrance. Since Scott's
show opened, guards have been directing visitors to the original
door of the neo-Classical 1929 building.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which is owned and operated by the city in a leafy
area north of the city center, boasts some well-known works;
Matisse's ``Pink Nude'' resides in its Cone Collection. But it has
traditionally not been much of a destination for many local
residents, especially the poor. The city's artists also kept a
distance, focusing instead on the Maryland Institute College of Art
downtown and the galleries that have popped up in old industrial
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``A degree of resentment had built against the BMA,'' said
Margaret Footner, director of the Fells Point Creative Alliance, an
artists' group. The alliance and the city's Contemporary Museum,
which began as a series of floating shows of international art in
vacant spaces like an abandoned Art Deco bus station, were created
to fill what was perceived as a vacuum. While some felt that the
museum's previous director, Arnold L. Lehman, had made strides in
reaching out to the community, many believed that there was still
much work to be done. Lehman is now the director of the Brooklyn
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Doreen Bolger, the director of the Rhode Island School
of Design's museum in Providence, replaced Lehman in 1998, the
founder of the Contemporary Museum, George Ciscle, sensed an
opportunity. Ciscle, now teaching at the Maryland Institute, said
that with one stroke _ a show by Scott _ the new director could
unite and excite a number of constituencies and repair some rifts.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 51, a 1970 graduate of the institute, is a gregarious
studio and performance artist and a popular member of the local art
scene. Her bead sculptures about race and violence and being fat
prompt viewers to contemplate society's troubles out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who is black, lives in low-income West Baltimore with her
mother, Elizabeth Talford Scott, a former maid who is known for
reviving the quilting arts of the sharecropper era. The
storytelling in fabric that Scott learned from her mother and her
beaded necklaces from the 1970s have morphed into a new form:
intricate quilt and bead sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's work had been shown and reviewed in New York and
elsewhere, but she had had no major shows in her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Ciscle proposed a retrospective jointly organized by the
institute and the museum. ``The time was right,'' said the Creative
Alliance's program director, Megan Hamilton, ``and Joyce was a
charismatic enough figure and a strong enough artist for both
institutions to make a grand gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolger agreed, and the show, which runs through May 21, is a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Taking their first step into the museum, returning visitors know
there has been a big change. Once into the airy entrance gallery,
they see Rodin's ``Thinker.'' The sculpture had been a source of
local pride when it was stationed outdoors on the front steps, but
15 years ago it was temporarily moved into an indoor cubbyhole. The
entrance gallery was better known for parties than for art.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging above the Rodin is Scott's sculpture of a lynching: a
bead man covered with epithets and watermelons and suspended by
chains. ``Art is a force,'' said Scott, whose ``Halley's Comet
3000'' has also crash-landed in a courtyard previously filled with
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with Maryland Institute students and friends,
Scott has installed 100 works, many of them site-specific, in the
museum. Some installations highlight pieces in the permanent
collection that the artist came to love in her childhood visits
with her mother. ``Little Dancer, Age 14,'' a bronze with a cloth
tutu by Degas, is paired with a bead person so that Scott can relay
to children, ``See, they're both dolls!''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which is officially titled ``Kicking It With the
Old Masters'' (``I wanted to say old massahs,'' said the artist,
half joking), is accompanied by performance pieces by Scott, panel
discussions, lectures, tours and a color catalog. It has been a
major undertaking for a small municipal museum.
</P>
<P>
   Bolger said she hoped the show would draw museum officials who
are gathering in Baltimore for a convention. Out-of-town artists
are coming as well.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to see. Halfway down one corridor, a shimmering
glass nude of Scott at eye level stops visitors in their tracks.
People circle it slowly, talking with friends and strangers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``No Mommy Me,'' a black leather nanny holds a pink infant on
her breast as a brown child hides behind her dress.
</P>
<P>
   A family activity center is the final change at the museum.
Among the images is Buckwheat, the grinning wild-haired child from
the ``Our Gang'' films, with a quotation from Scott on the wall.
``I'm a cesspool of stereotypes,'' it says. `` I'm loud, I've got
kinky hair, I'm gap-toothed, I drink, I cuss, I'm black and I'm
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolger said: ``People are not just shuffling past the art in the
galleries. They stop, they talk, they say they need to come back.''

<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ Tommy Sells, the hazel-eyed drifter who has
told investigators that he has killed before in several other
states, was indicted Tuesday in the slashing death of one girl and
a brutal attack on another.
</P>
<P>
   The Val Verde County grand jury indicted Sells, 35, for the
murder of Kaylene Harris, 13, and the attempted murder of Krystal
Surles, 10. Both were attacked on Jan. 1 as they lay in their beds
at the Harris family home.
</P>
<P>
   Surles, whose vocal cords were cut in the knife attack and could
not speak, helped create a composite portrait that the authorities
used to identify Sells.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest, Sells has told investigators that he has
killed before over the past 20 years _ one person in Lexington,
Ky.; one in Tucson, Ariz.; and two in Little Rock, Ark. The police
in Idaho, California, Missouri and Tennessee are working to match
Sells to killings he says he committed there, or to unsolved
murders they believe he committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy continues to cooperate, the reason being, he wants to
clean the slate and get everything behind him,'' Texas Ranger John
Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's cordial, polite and very coherent. He's told us he wants
closure for himself and for the families of the victims he's
killed. Closure was his word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers are taking extreme care with Sells. They are still
smarting from their embarrassing experience more than a decade ago
with another talkative drifter, Henry Lee Lucas, who admitted to
homicides that the authorities later said he could not have
committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy does not appear to be a Lucas. He's not just
inventing stuff,'' said Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas
Department of Public Safety who wrote a book about Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Sells spent nine years in prison for assault and auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers have found the accused killer pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell he's been around, lived on the streets most of
his life, and the drugs have probably taken their toll on him, but
to sit down and talk with him is like talking to anyone,'' said
Sgt. Terry Ward of the Pulaski County, Ark., Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ward, Sells has confessed to committing two murders
around Little Rock in the early 1980s and provided specific and
convincing details. The only problem is, investigators cannot find
any unsolved homicides to match the crimes Sells describes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The records from the early 1980s are not the best in the
world. We're looking around 1980 to 1982. One was a burglary where
he says he shot the homeowner several times; the other was a sexual
assault at a rock quarry where they pushed her into the water,''
Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Sells was born in Oakland, Calif., and later
lived in Utah and St. Louis. At the age of 13 or 14, he left home
to spend the next two decades riding trains, hitchhiking and
driving stolen cars back and forth across the country.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Del Rio two years ago with a carnival, later
married a woman who had two small children, but then left town last
year for five months, returning in the fall to sell used cars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investigators from Arizona, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky
and San Antonio have interviewed Sells at the Val Verde County
Jail.

   ``Mr. Sells claims responsibility for a 1988 homicide here,''
said Sgt. Tom Thompson of the Pima County Sheriff's Office in
Arizona. ``We are in the process of putting the final touches on
that case for it to go to the county attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to link Sells to two recent double homicides in
Missouri and another that occurred in the same time frame in
Tennessee has proved more difficult. The crimes occurred last
spring.

   ``We have not charged him, and we're waiting for some laboratory
work to come back,'' said Bud Cooper, an investigator with the
Missouri Highway Patrol. ``He was able to give us some information
we would not have known, but he wasn't real good on his dates. I
plan on coming back and talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Val Verde County Sheriff's investigator Larry Pope said Sells
reacted slightly Tuesday when he learned that he had been indicted
for an offense that carries the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see a little twinge,'' he said. ``I think his major
concern is that he can't provide for his family here. He's very
attached to them and very protective. He claims they are the only
people who ever treated him decently.''

<P>
   Even as some places in New York are trying to jump-start spring
with soft-shell crabs and shad roe in February, a shellfish with
its own short season is suddenly turning up in fish markets and
restaurants all over town.
</P>
<P>
   This winter bounty, Maine shrimp, is a tiny variety of shellfish
from deep waters that is rarely available fresh and almost never in
the quantities flooding markets this month. These shrimp are so
tender and sweetly flavorful that they can be eaten raw. What makes
them so appealing, beyond their freshness and sweetness, is the
price: as little as $3 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the talk of the town up here,'' Daniel Schick said from
his office in Portland, Maine. ``There have been very heavy
landings.'' Schick is the chairman of the Northern Shrimp Technical
Committee, the division of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission that regulates the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Flanagan, the owner of Emerald Seafood, a wholesaler at the
Fulton Fish Market in New York, concurred. ``The last two seasons
were poor, but this year is very good,'' he said. ``The size is
good, and the quality is excellent. We're getting them still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most shrimp are frozen and then sold thawed. But the Maine
shrimp are so fresh that they are often sold with their heads on.
And now is the time to try them, seafood dealers say. As the season
progresses, the shrimp start to spawn and molt in the Gulf of Maine
and are not as fat, rich and tasty as they are now, at the peak.
Usually the season starts Dec. 1 and runs until the end of May. But
this year, to permit more of the shrimp to lay eggs, and in an
effort to insure good future catches, the committee and the
shrimping industry decided to shorten the season for the first time
since 1979, postponing the opening until Jan. 17 and ending it on
March 15. Even so, Schick estimated that the catch would equal that
of a typical six-month season, about 1,800 metric tons, or nearly 4
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   With shrimp, bigger is generally considered better. But Maine,
or northern, shrimp _ Pandalus borealis and Pandalus jordani _ are
a modest delicacy, with about 40 whole unshelled shrimp in a pound,
as against 15 or so cocktail shrimp from southern waters without
the heads. Northern shrimp are also found off Canada, Greenland,
Iceland, Scandinavia, the Aleutians and Japan. In Maine, their
southernmost habitat, the waters are relatively warm, so the shrimp
tend to grow faster and larger. In Scandinavia, where they are
usually sold peeled and cooked, a pound may comprise as many as 300
shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling uncooked Maine shrimp takes work, because they are so
small and sticky. So the home cook is probably wise to poach or
steam them in the shell, then serve them warm or cold to peel and
eat with a dip. They can also be smoked over tea leaves, which adds
flavor and makes them especially succulent. Once they are cooked,
peeling is fairly easy. Brining for an hour before cooking tends to
firm them up and even enrich the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Peeled raw shrimp can also be ordered from some markets, and can
be tossed in a warm vinaigrette to serve barely cooked over baby
greens, or added raw to a miso soup until they just firm up. They
can also be served in a Chinese-style soup with chicken or seafood
broth, glass noodles and ginger, scallions, pepper and oyster
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants with a cadre of prep cooks to peel the raw shrimp
are more inclined to serve them flash-cooked or even uncooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so fresh and sweet that we have been taking off the
shells and serving them raw, just with a little grated lime rind
and some grains of salt,'' said Eric Ripert, the executive chef at
Le Bernardin. ``As soon as you cook them you lose that flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese call these northern shellfish aba ebi, or sweet
shrimp. At Nobu, they are served as sashimi, without any rice to
compete with their distinctive flavor. Sushihatsu, on the Upper
East Side, keeps them alive in a tank to guarantee freshness for
fussy sushi connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Even chefs who cook Maine shrimp do it fast, so they are not
much beyond raw. At Oceana, Rick Moonen marinates them in olive
oil, garlic and melted butter, then sizzles them briefly in a hot
pan before serving them in a phyllo shell with a tomato
vinaigrette. Daniel Boulud gives them a quick moment in a skillet,
then mixes them with a salad of tropical fruit and crisp vegetables
like fennel.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Georges Vongerichten simply warms them in a beurre blanc or
runs them under the hot flame of a salamander. And at Chicama,
Douglas Rodriguez coats them in a spicy glaze, threads them on thin
skewers and sears them on a grill.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fresh shrimp can be enjoyed for only five more
weeks, Schick said there is every expectation that the next season
will also be a fine one if the weather cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shrimp you are seeing are the class of '96, and it's a
very strong class, the strongest in years,'' he said. ``The shrimp
that have not been caught will be back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   They are the class of '96 because that's when they were born,
Schick said. In their complex life cycle, the shrimp start out as
males, and after a year of growth near the coast they migrate 50 or
60 miles out, where the Gulf of Maine is about 500 feet deep. Then
for two years the creatures _ which are protandric, or progressive,
hermaphrodites _ undergo a natural sex change.
</P>
<P>
   In summer the new females mate with newly arriving males, and by
December they return closer to shore, where the water may be 300
feet deep, to lay their eggs. The larvae hatch in January. In a
good season, the mature females fill the trawlers' traps.
</P>
<P>
   The industry agreed to a shortened season this year to help
protect the fishery, since the ``classes'' of 1997 and 1998 appear
to be much weaker than this year's homecoming queens of 1996, and
because the catch two years from now may not be as good, Schick
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this copious catch, freshness is key. It's best to buy
Maine shrimp the day they will be cooked, and to rinse them well.
If the heads are starting to turn dark or black, the shrimp are not
fresh enough. Perfection, like the Maine shrimp season, is
fleeting.

   WHERE TO BUY
</P>
<P>
   Fresh Maine shrimp are sold in the shell in many fish markets in
Manhattan, some with the heads off to prolong shelf life. Here are
some sources, with the price per pound, although shrimp might not
be available every day and prices can fluctuate:
</P>
<P>
   Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Avenue (79th Street), $5.99 with
heads on; Central Fish, 527 Ninth Avenue (40th Street), $2.99,
heads on; Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 Twelfth
Avenue (132nd Street), $2.99, heads on, or $5.99, heads off; Food
Emporium supermarkets, $9.99, heads off; Pescatore, Grand Central
Market, Grand Central Terminal, $5.99, heads on; Rosedale, 1129
Lexington Avenue (79th Street), $10, heads on; and Wild Edibles,
Grand Central Market, $6.95, heads on.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Edibles will shell raw shrimp at no additional charge, but
they must be ordered at least an hour ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Browne Trading in Portland, Me., (800) 944-7848, sells the
shrimp fresh, in season, for $2.95 a pound in the shell, $8.95 a
pound shelled without heads, plus shipping. It sells the shrimp,
frozen and shelled, all year.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked Maine shrimp from Ducktrap River Fish Farms are sold
without heads in specialty markets. Ducktrap itself, at (800)
828-3825, sells them for $22 a pound, plus shipping.

CONFEDERATE FLAG DEBATE RESURGES IN TEXAS, U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KAREN ROUSE 
And R.A. DYER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ When Deena Harrison Dark plants U. S. flags
at the graves of fallen soldiers, it's considered an act of
patriotic devotion.
</P>
<P>
   But when she and others publicly display the Confederate flag,
it sparks controversy, fueling a revived national debate between
those who view the Rebel battle flag as a symbol of pride, and
those who see it as a symbol of white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The generations-old dispute over the meaning of Confederate
symbols has flared anew in Texas and the nation in the wake of the
latest push to remove the Rebel flag from atop the South Carolina
Statehouse, where it has flown since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the debate has spread to the Texas Historical
Commission, county governments and the offices of state lawmakers
and Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders say the most widely recognized of the
Confederate Army's battle flags is a symbol of slavery and racism.
They want it barred from Texas schools and say that two Confederate
memorial plaques should be removed from the Texas Supreme Court
Building. They have also called for the state to block the creation
of a Confederate monument on the grounds of a courthouse near
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But Confederate heritage groups say the battle flag _ the
familiar blue cross with white stars and white border on a field of
red _ is part of Texas history. While deploring its use by some
white supremacist groups, they say it remains a symbol of the
South's fighting spirit.
</P>
<P>
   One side of the debate is embodied in Dark, 46, a self-described
patriotic American and member of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy who cherishes the first national flag of the
Confederacy, nicknamed the ``Stars and Bars,'' as a symbol of
pride. That flag, the first of three national flags adopted by the
Confederate States of America, bears little resemblance to later
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Dark honors all the flags. ``It's my heritage, my history, my
patriotism for what we fought for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dark's Daughters of the Confederacy group joined several other
Confederate heritage organizations in the Arlington area,
sandwiched between Fort Worth and Dallas recently for their fifth
annual Massing of Confederate Colors, where people in period
costumes carried various Confederate flags.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the debate is reflected by Walter Williams, a
black engineer who grew up in Fort Worth. He considers the sight of
the Confederate battle flag, especially in public places, a
reminder of a painful period when his ancestors were considered
property.
</P>
<P>
   It evokes a feeling of anger that ``somebody would flaunt
something that is associated with so much damage to this country
and particularly my people,'' said Williams, who was troubled when
he saw the Rebel flag flying in Fort Worth's 104th Southwestern
Exposition and Livestock Show and Rodeo parade last month.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 37, said that the flag is to him an image of
oppression and that carrying it in a parade is no different from
Nazis parading down a street with swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has always struck an emotional chord in Texas, and
arises periodically. Just last year, for instance, state Sen. Mike
Jackson, R-LaPorte, sponsored a resolution making April Confederate
History and Heritage Month.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue really began flaring up in Texas and nationwide
after the NAACP urged Americans to boycott South Carolina until it
removes the battle flag from its Capitol. The issue is likely to
get even more attention as journalists gather in South Carolina for
the Feb. 19 GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, a leading GOP presidential contender, has
declined to step into the South Carolina debate _ or even to weigh
in on the meaning of the flag. ``I believe the people of South
Carolina can figure out what to do,'' Bush said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in Texas, Bush has generally left the issue to people
at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bush says local school districts should decide
whether to ban the flag. Many Texas schools still use the Rebel
mascot, and wave the flag at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP wants the state to bar the Grimes County Greys Camp of
the Sons of Confederate Veterans from erecting a Civil War monument
on the lawn of a courthouse in Anderson. Bush has left that issue
to the Texas Historical Commission, but says he does not believe
the monument should be constructed on courthouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP also wants Confederate plaques removed from the Texas
Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said the governor wants the state General Services
Commission to erect some sort of advisory at the Supreme Court
building explaining the presence of the plaques. Although declining
to say whether the governor supports the plaques, an aide explained
that they were placed there because the building was constructed
with money from the Confederate Pension Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historical representations of the six governments that have
governed Texas ... in the past are displayed throughout the Capitol
complex. These symbols and emblems reflect the history and
diversity that make Texas unique,'' one of the governor's aides
wrote.

<P>
   Judd Apatow, a top comedy writer who is executive producer of
NBC's ``Freaks and Geeks,'' said a new show of his, ``Happy
Together,'' about an oddball, was rejected by NBC, which did not
even order a pilot episode. ``You would have thought that coming
off a critically acclaimed show like `Freaks and Geeks' that this
would have been a no-brainer,'' he said. ``We'd at least get to
shoot a pilot. With the quiz shows it just makes you wonder how
much time will be available for writers now. Just look at ABC:
They're not going to need much next year because of
`Millionaire.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like Apatow, Ian Biederman, a writer and producer on Fox's
``Party of Five,'' said he was uneasy about the impact of the
reality shows. ``There's no question that in the short term, job
opportunities will be diminished,'' he said. ``There's a kind of
tongue-in-cheek fatalism about these new shows. In the long run I'm
optimistic that the one-hour drama and good sophisticated
storytelling won't ever go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Broder, one of television's most respected agents, said
bluntly: ``There will be a downturn in the number of writers
employed for the 2000 and 2001 seasons. There will be fewer filmed
entertainment series. It is a trend that will also pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress Mary Tyler Moore, who was also once a formidable
producer, told the talk show host Rosie O'Donnell last week: ``It
scares me, you know, what is going to happen to television
production, wherein you have a property that is creative and
involves actors. It's going to be all game shows from now on, if we
don't watch ourselves very carefully.`
</P>
<P>
   Of course, traditional comedies and dramas are not limited to
network television anymore. HBO, TNT, Showtime, Lifetime and other
cable networks have already stepped into the breach and are
sometimes offering riskier dramas than the networks as well as
successful series like ``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex and the City.''
Accordingly, cable networks may benefit from the networks' hunger
for the game and reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although some writers and agents are plainly nervous about the
network obsession with game shows and reality shows, several top
producers and writers suggest that the success of shows like
``Millionaire'' can be viewed as positive for comedies and dramas.
The impact of the quiz show has rippled across the network,
boosting the ratings of shows that follow it like ``Dharma and
Greg'' and ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair and appropriate for networks to look for ideas that
not only generate huge ratings but also are cost-effective,'' said
Tom Werner, one of television's most successful producers (``The
Cosby Show,'' ``Roseanne'') with his partners, Marcy Carsey and
Caryn Mandebach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware that there's less shelf space for script ideas,
whether half-hour or hour. But that's the reality. We have to work
within that reality. It's a wake-up call for people like us. It
forces us to ask how can we bring the audience in equal numbers to
entertainment programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf, producer of series like ``Law and Order,'' said that
cycles come and go in television and that sitcoms and dramas remain
staples, no matter how limited. ``Everything is cyclical,'' he
said. ``Sixteen years ago comedy was dead, and along came Cosby.
Game shows were dead, and now they're No. 1. But the reality is
that episodic series television has been a mainstay for 50 years,
and will remain so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality will out,'' he said. ``It's been that way for 50
years.''

SUDDEN EXPLOSION OF GAME SHOWS THREATENS THE OLD TV STAPLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Quite suddenly, the television landscape has turned
positively Darwinian for comedies and dramas.
</P>
<P>
   With the No. 1 show in the nation, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' on the ABC network three nights a week, with CBS
planning a five-night-a-week reality show this summer and NBC and
Fox rapidly programming game shows, the far more expensive sitcoms
and dramas that have served as the staple of network television are
struggling to find shelf space and, in some cases, to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disaster: It's going to diminish the level of
employment in Hollywood,'' said Peter Benedek, a partner at the
United Talent Agency, which represents numerous television writers
and directors. ``There are new shows that won't get picked up and
writers and directors who won't get hired on all four networks.
It's simple arithmetic. The game shows and reality shows will
occupy real estate previously rented to fictional entertainment
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Top television executives and even some highly successful
producers are more optimistic, insisting that the new nonfiction
shows are not only extremely lucrative for the networks but are
also drawing huge audiences and lifting the ratings (notably on
ABC) for comedies and dramas. For instance, ``Malcolm in the
Middle'' on Fox is drawing a large audience.
</P>
<P>
   But executives acknowledge that the face of television is
changing and that it is getting harder to keep some sitcoms on the
air because of the intense competition.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, at least three shows were recently canceled: ``Oh Grow
Up,'' about roommates in Brooklyn; David E. Kelley's ``Snoops,''
about high-tech private eyes; and ``It's Like, You Know,'' about
New Yorkers living in Los Angeles. ABC executives acknowledged that
while those shows had slumped in the ratings, their departures were
accelerated because of limited time slots at the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a fair argument to say we didn't have a level of
patience with some of these shows that we might have had in years
past,'' said Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment
Group. ``We had to make some difficult decisions perhaps earlier
than we would have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun is hardly alone among top network executives who
acknowledge that television _ perhaps temporarily, perhaps
fundamentally _ may be facing significant shifts because of the
numerous quiz shows now on the air and shows planned in the next
few months involving real people in bizarre and gimmicky
situations. At the same time, the continuing popularity of news
magazine programs like ``Dateline NBC'' and ``20-20'' on ABC have
also limited the hours for sitcoms and dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question,'' said Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox
Television Entertainment Group. ``There seems to be less of an
appetite for the more traditional genres, hour-scripted dramas and
half-hour comedies. It's simple mathematics. It's going to put
people out of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll always be a need for scripted comedy and scripted
drama,'' he added. ``Nobody's turning their back on these genres.
The bar is just higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost is a central issue in television's new dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is ``Millionaire'' enormously popular _ it has an
average audience of 28.5 million viewers and has single-handedly
revived ABC _ but it is also relatively inexpensive. A typical
episode of ``Millionaire'' costs an estimated $750,000 (unless, of
course, a contestant wins $1 million). By contrast, an hourlong
drama like ``The Practice'' or ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' both on ABC,
costs at least $1.2 million per episode.
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, a quiz show like ``Twenty-One'' costs an estimated
$600,000 for each episode. By contrast, successful hourlong dramas
like ``Providence'' cost $1.5 million. And franchises like
``Frasier'' and ``Friends'' cost over $3 million an episode.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the economic downside of the game shows and reality
programs is that unlike dramas and sitcoms, they cannot be repeated
or sold for syndication.
</P>
<P>
   At CBS a new five-night-a-week hour half-hour reality show,
``Big Brother,'' is to begin this July. The voyeuristic show, based
on a hugely successful Dutch import, centers on a group of people
thrown together into a house and monitored continuously by cameras.
The show costs about $200,000 an episode. By contrast, a half-hour
sitcom like NBC's ``Will and Grace'' or CBS' ``King of Queens''
costs at least $600,000 an episode. In addition to ``Big Brother,''
CBS has scheduled another summer reality show, ``Survivor,'' which
is about 16 people stranded on a jungle island near Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   Les Moonves, president of CBS Television, said both reality
shows, if successful, could glide into the fall schedule and reduce
the number of comedies and dramas. ``If `Survivor' or `Big Brother'
becomes very successful, we will look to get them into our regular
schedule if it's the best economic thing for us to do,'' Moonves
said. ``That could, potentially, take away from traditional
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers are worried that the flood of game and reality shows are
usurping them. Tim O'Donnell, a board member of the Writers Guild
and a sitcom writer (``Clueless,'' ``Growing Pains'') said that
writers who once worried about the numerous news shows were now
depressed about the reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say that the five scariest words for television
writers was, `And now, here's Stone Phillips,''' he said. ``Now
it's been replaced by, `Is that your final answer?' There's no
question that game shows are eating up a lot of valuable real
estate that used to be occupied by half-hour comedies.''

<P>
   THOMAS-KIDS _ MIAMI _ Derrick Thomas will most be remembered in
Kansas City not as a football player but as the founder of the
Third and Long Foundation, an inner-city program that taught kids
how to read. Developing. (Stoda, Palm Beach Post). 21.

   BBN-ROCKER-ADVANCE _ Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker will
have his case heard by arbitrator Shyam Das beginning Wednesday in
New York. Das will uphold commissioner Bud Selig's decision to
suspend Rocker for a month and fine him $20,000, overrule it or
offer a reduced penalty. (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SPRING-BASEBALL _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Emily J. Minor column
on spring training: They plant the ryegrass just before
Thanksgiving and baby it all through the winter. Water it. Mow it.
Maybe even talk to it a little, right when the sun's coming up. By
mid-December, they're mowing, first one way, then the next, until
the whole field is perfectly striped like the broad side of a zebra
_ only softer, like feathers. (Minor, Palm Beach Post).

   GOLF

   GLF-WOODS-BISHER _ AJC columnist Furman Bisher writes about
Tiger Woods. (Bisher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 22.

<P>
   GLF-TRUMP-ZONING _ WEST PALM BEACH _ The self-described master
of the art of the deal is complaining he got a lousy deal from Palm
Beach County. Celebrity developer Donald Trump, who is leasing 214
acres from the county for his lavish Trump International Golf Club,
is upset that the county is renting land more cheaply to another
developer building a public golf course on 101 acres in the old
Hillcrest neighborhood. ``This is very strange and extremely unfair
to Donald Trump, who by all accounts has done an outstanding job
(on his golf course),'' Trump attorney Raymond Royce wrote in a
Feb. 4 letter to County Administrator Bob Weisman. (Banstetter,
Palm Beach Post). 19. BASKETBALLBKN-SEC-ACC _ Has the SEC surpassed
the ACC in basketball? ACC coaches started lobbying early for
multiple slots in NCAA Tournament after getting only three last
year, the lowest since 1979. But the ACC is currently No. 5 in the
RPI after being No. 1 four of the last five years. Duke, N.C.
State, Virginia, and maybe North Carolina will get in. The rest of
the league is average. In the SEC, 10 of 12 teams have above .500
record and the conference has posted some good non-conference wins,
including LSU over Arizona. (Barnhart, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED

   HOCKEY

   HKN-THRASHERS _ With only 11 wins at the All-Star break, the
season hasn't been what the Thrashers had hoped. But the team feels
the young players have got some valuable experience and the
franchise's long-term future is still bright. Atlanta resumes play
on Wednesday at Pittsburgh. (Schultz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 22.
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPICS
</P>
<P>
   OLY-VOLLEYBALL _ A little more than three years ago Mick Haley
thought he was getting a dream job. The pull of the coaching the
U.S. team was enough to pry him away from Texas, where he'd won two
national championships in a sport once dominated by California
schools. He compiled a 522-137-1 record in his 17 years in Austin.
Haley knew the Olympic job would be a rebuilding effort. The 1996
team, coached by Terry Liskevych, had hoped to medal in Atlanta.
But, while other U.S. women's sports from soccer to softball found
gold and legions of new fans, the volleyball team finished a
disappointing seventh. That triggered a slide in other areas. Two
sponsors, Champion and Ricoh, pulled out. Because of
non-performance, the team lost some other funding and needed to cut
back on expenses. Demetria Sance, a former Longhorn, is one of
Haley's star players. Developing. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman). 30. WITH PHOTOS.

   SPRING-BASEBALL _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Emily J. Minor column
on spring training: They plant the ryegrass just before
Thanksgiving and baby it all through the winter. Water it. Mow it.
Maybe even talk to it a little, right when the sun's coming up. By

   GLF-TRUMP-ZONING _ WEST PALM BEACH _ The self-described master
of the art of the deal is complaining he got a lousy deal from Palm
Beach County. Celebrity developer Donald Trump, who is leasing 214
acres from the county for his lavish Trump International Golf Club,
is upset that the county is renting land more cheaply to another
developer building a public golf course on 101 acres in the old
Hillcrest neighborhood. ``This is very strange and extremely unfair
to Donald Trump, who by all accounts has done an outstanding job
(on his golf course),'' Trump attorney Raymond Royce wrote in a
Feb. 4 letter to County Administrator Bob Weisman. (Banstetter,
Palm Beach Post). 19. BASKETBALLBKN-SEC-ACC _ Has the SEC surpassed
the ACC in basketball? ACC coaches started lobbying early for
multiple slots in NCAA Tournament after getting only three last
year, the lowest since 1979. But the ACC is currently No. 5 in the
RPI after being No. 1 four of the last five years. Duke, N.C.
State, Virginia, and maybe North Carolina will get in. The rest of
the league is average. In the SEC, 10 of 12 teams have above .500
record and the conference has posted some good non-conference wins,
including LSU over Arizona. (Barnhart, Atlanta

   HKN-THRASHERS _ With only 11 wins at the All-Star break, the

the young players have got some valuable experience and the

   OLYMPICS
</P>
<P>
   OLY-VOLLEYBALL _ A little more than three years ago Mick Haley
thought he was getting a dream job. The pull of the coaching the
U.S. team was enough to pry him away from Texas, where he'd won two
national championships in a sport once dominated by California
schools. He compiled a 522-137-1 record in his 17 years in Austin.
Haley knew the Olympic job would be a rebuilding effort. The 1996
team, coached by Terry Liskevych, had hoped to medal in Atlanta.
But, while other U.S. women's sports from soccer to softball found
gold and legions of new fans, the volleyball team finished a
disappointing seventh. That triggered a slide in other areas. Two
sponsors, Champion and Ricoh, pulled out. Because of
non-performance, the team lost some other funding and needed to cut
back on expenses. Demetria Sance, a former Longhorn, is one of
Haley's star players. Developing. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman). 30. WITH PHOTOS.

ALL IN A DAY'S WORK: MARRIAGE, ELEPHANTS AND VIDEOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
(Eds: Ricardo Alvarez is concierge at the Towers at The
Waldorf-Astoria, Park Avenue, New York) 
 By RICARDO ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Guests go to a concierge as someone they can trust.
They hope to find a little solace, a friendly face. Guests want me
to make magic happen.
</P>
<P>
   The weirdest request I ever got was from a gentleman from
Caracas, Venezuela, who wanted to give his wife a baby elephant as
an anniversary gift. I called a zoo, and they put me in contact
with an elephant market in Jakarta, Indonesia. It took a lot of
work. After I located the elephant and arranged the purchase, I had
to obtain the necessary medical documents for the animal to be
shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, a Middle Eastern head of state asked me at 8:30
a.m. one Sunday to help obtain a certain video. Problem was, he was
leaving at noon. I asked him if I could ship it to him, but he had
promised someone he would have this movie when he got off the
plane. I started calling around and found the manager of a store
that wasn't open yet. The gentleman did me the favor of meeting my
guest's limousine on its way to the airport. He actually stood on
the corner and held out the movie, and someone in the limo grabbed
it as they passed by.
</P>
<P>
   I've helped a lot of couples get married. Some people have a
dream of getting married in New York, but they're unaware of the
process, like the 24-hour waiting period once the license is
issued. They come by themselves, and I'm often a witness at these
weddings. I become a permanent fixture in their wedding albums.
</P>
<P>
   One weekend I helped a gentleman in a wheelchair who was getting
engaged. He was so nervous! His girlfriend had no idea. I got them
tickets to ``Phantom of the Opera,'' and I made sure the restaurant
was wheelchair-accessible. He wanted one single rose in the room
upon their arrival. I suggested the rose be in the room when they
returned, just like the Phantom let his beloved know he had been
there in the play. I turned the bed down, I placed rose petals on
the bed, and I had champagne waiting. Right before they left,
though, he panicked when he realized he had no tie. I ran down to
Lost and Found, found the perfect tie to match his suit and ironed
it for him.
</P>
<P>
   If you do your job well, the guests leave happy and you gain
self-satisfaction. We're ambassadors to the city. Many guests have
never been here before, and they look upon us as their eyes and
ears, their guide. You become a P.R. person, showing people what
New York City has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the wrong impression about concierges. The
movie ``For Love or Money,'' starring Michael J. Fox, portrayed us
as money-grubbing. Actually, we often try to save guests money. We
go through licensed brokers for theater tickets. I can get
guaranteed tickets, but guests often don't want to pay the premium
prices. I'll tell them they can use their credit card and call the
box office themselves to save money.

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Matt Gogel deserves a fan club, and not
just for the way he has played in his rookie season on the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel, the runner-up at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am,
reported to the interview room and rehashed with humor and grace a
day that no doubt proved quite painful. Jean Van de Velde, all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was two different days, really,'' Gogel said, describing
his 31-40-71 that left him short of his first tour victory. ``It
was as good as I think I've ever played for nine holes of golf. And
then just tough coming home. ... Trying to win a golf tournament
for the first time and battling the emotions, it's tough to win a
golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogel seemed emotionless during his round, managing little more
than a half-wave to the galleries after his five front-side
birdies. He said he didn't realize it was Tiger Woods who
threatened his lead until he walked off the 16th green.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who he thought might be able to end Woods' streak, he
said, ``Where is Tiger? Is he back there?'' And when he spotted
Woods, Gogel announced loudly, ``I AM!''
</P>
<P>
   If that's so, it won't happen at Torrey Pines on Sunday. Gogel
said he's decided to take the rest of the week off now.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   MONEY MATTER: It wasn't quite what Ollie Nutt expected in his
first year as director of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, but he is not
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a field like this, we were thinking it could be (David)
Duval and Tiger, or Sergio (Garcia) and Tiger down the stretch,''
Nutt said after Monday's drama. ``But you can't complain about a
finish like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nutt said he was confident that the gate will come close to the
$1.7 million generated last year, even though the actual body count
clearly declined, no doubt to the detriment of concessions. For the
unscheduled Monday round, fewer than 5,000 fans turned out. Most of
the tournament's tickets are sold in advance of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets aren't yet on sale for next year, but Nutt said it's
safe to plan on the same post-Super Bowl scheduling _ for 2001,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having discussions with the PGA Tour and looking at
weather patterns and so forth,'' he said. ``But those things take
some time. The important thing is that the PGA recognizes the
importance of the event and the uniqueness of the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities, long rounds and rain delays are here to stay, for
now.

&HT;     TIGER MAKES THE PHENOMENAL LOOK EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Remember the last drive of Super Bowl
XXIII, when the San Francisco 49ers huddled on the field during a
TV timeout, needing a touchdown to beat Cincinnati, and the
unflappable Joe Montana looked up into the stands and made this
critical football observation: ``Hey, isn't that John Candy?''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods had a Montana moment just like that at the AT&AMP;T
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am last weekend. He and his caddie, Steve
Williams, were walking down the 18th fairway, and Woods began to
wonder about the landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: 'I wonder how much it costs to put up all that fake
rock,''' Woods said. ``These are the things you think about, just
to relieve some of the tension and not make yourself focus too much
on the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana won that Super Bowl with a touchdown pass to John
Taylor. Woods won the AT&AMP;T on Monday by making a 7-stroke comeback
in eight holes. It was impossible to watch Woods on Monday, to see
all that poise and skill and tenacity, and not try to think of
athletes like him.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson won 11 tournaments in a row in 1945, leaving Woods
still five tourneys behind the PGA record. But Nelson never faced
the kind of obstacles and expectations that Woods does today, in
the age of ESPN, CNN, the Golf Channel and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood alongside the 18th green Monday, watching Matt Gogel
miss a putt that would have forced Woods into a playoff for his
sixth straight title, the 24-year-old superstar was engulfed by
cameras and microphones. In that moment, he couldn't have tried to
inspect the Pebble landscaping. Instead of Joe Montana, he
resembled Doug Flutie trying to see over the line of scrimmage, but
with no room to scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ueberroth, who played in Woods' foursome, said he couldn't
think of a current athlete in Tiger's league. Ueberroth was the
commissioner of baseball and the chief of the 1984 Olympic Games.
In those august jobs, Ueberroth said, he never witnessed a
phenomenon quite like Woods' comeback at Pebble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to think of one, somebody asked me that,'' he
said. ``I started reaching back for the (Kirk) Gibson home run when
I was commissioner, and I started reaching back for the (Bill)
Buckner play, but no, they weren't like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth saw Woods handle the pressure as if there were none at
all. On 18, where he needed a birdie to move ahead of PGA rookie
Matt Gogel, Woods sauntered up the fairway as if he and his buddies
had a case of beer riding on the round, instead of a $720,000 check
and another step toward posterity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the same the whole time, the same,'' Ueberroth said.
``You saw him lining up his (amateur) partner's putt on the last
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   On 14, Ueberroth and Woods both hit into the same sand trap. ``I
was on my third shot, he was on his second,'' Ueberroth said,
careful not to let anyone think he could drive the ball with Tiger.
``I said I'd get out of his way and pick up. But he said, `No, no,
go ahead, hit it.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few times this weekend, Woods came across as a high-strung
star, uttering mild complaints about the comedians who played ahead
of him for the first two rounds. Without mentioning their names, he
said that Tommy Smothers and Ray Romano slowed down play.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, he was the kid whose father banged pots and pans
to train him to play amid any kind of distraction. Nothing could
slow him down.
</P>
<P>
   That's what superstars do. They don't worry about what's ahead
of them, or what's behind them. Woods said he consciously focused
more on the Pro-Am battle that he and former Stanford teammate
Jerry Chang were waging. Joking and talking along the way, they
finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's really interesting when you are coming down the
stretch in a tournament and everything is on the line,'' Woods
said. ``At that moment, you forget what you have done. You forget
how bad you played or how good you played. What really counts is
the moment. It's right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he remembered watching the 1986 Masters, where Jack
Nicklaus won at age 46. ``They said when Jack was interviewed, he
had forgotten all his bad play of the last few years and that all
that mattered was the moment,'' Woods said. ``And it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   From that, can we conclude that he truly is Jack Nicklaus' heir?
Or was his AT&AMP;T performance more like Michael Jordan making the
last steal and taking the last shot of the 1998 NBA season? Maybe
Jordan combined with Pedro Martinez in October, shutting down
Cleveland in emergency duty? Could Tiger be Reggie Jackson, circa
1977?
</P>
<P>
   When he first turned pro, at age 20, Nike put him in a bunch of
commercials, declaring: ``I am Tiger Woods.'' At the time, that was
more a suggestion than a proclamation. Even his Masters win in 1997
was only a hint of who he would become. True, it was the least
subtle hint since Mae West's prime. But it wasn't until last
summer's PGA Championship that Woods started to take on the look of
a legend.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters win had been stunningly simple, a romp. It affirmed
that Woods had magnificent talent. But at the PGA, he had to hold
off an eager puppy named Sergio Garcia, who was ready to chew up
Tiger's golden slippers _ and his green jacket, too.
</P>
<P>
   After the Masters, Tiger pumped his fist and hoisted his father
into the air. After the PGA, he slumped over the 18th hole in
relief, then dropped his head onto his mother's shoulder. He hadn't
dominated this tournament. He had confronted the humbling,
exasperating nature of golf and beaten it.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' talent is special, but not enough to make him another
Nicklaus, Montana, Jordan, another Reg-gie, Reg-gie. The PGA showed
who he really is. Monday's comeback showed it again. He is, just as
promised, Tiger Woods.

HOW DOES A BLOCKBUSTER ART EVENT LIKE THE ONE IN DALLAS COME
TOGETHER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago, it couldn't have made much of a ripple in Dorothy
Kosinski's day planner. Kosinski, the current curator of European
art at the Dallas Museum of Art, had a provocative conversation
about photography's influence on Gauguin's art with a colleague, a
discussion that soon after all but disappeared into the ether of
another busy work day.
</P>
<P>
   But years later, Kosinski used a tidbit from that long-ago
dialogue to build on the concept that a swirl of visual information
_ including photography _ churns an artist's creative juices. In
plumbing this premise, the first molecule of a big exhibition was
born and, years later, Kosinski would bask in the glow of ``Degas
to Picasso: Painters, Sculptors, and the Camera,'' one of the DMA's
most ambitious exhibitions in years.
</P>
<P>
   By any yardstick, the DMA's ``Degas to Picasso'' qualifies as
``big.'' It cost $1 million to mount. It choreographs 14 artists,
from Edgar Degas to Edvard Munch, and packs 400 works of art, from
Rodin's brooding bronzes to Constantin Brancusi's private photos,
into a labyrinth of galleries. And with such gilded contributors as
the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Musee Rodin in
Paris, ``Degas to Picasso'' earns a ``must-see'' cachet.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not alone in its size or scope. Exhibitions that take
on lofty ``blockbuster'' proportions have become a regular entry in
the annual planning ledgers of art museums from the DMA and Los
Angeles' J. Paul Getty Museum to Washington's National Gallery of
Art. In fact, according to Museum Premieres, one of the nation's
leading exhibition databases, the number of major exhibitions has
rocketed by more than 100 percent in the past few years, from 86 in
1996 to 178 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, for better or worse, comes to expect the
blockbusters,'' says Charles Stuckey, senior curator at the Kimbell
Art Museum in Fort Worth. ``And if a museum doesn't have one, the
next question is why?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, cost for one. From the first honey-roasted peanut eaten on
the first art-seeking trip to the final valet-parking attendant on
opening night, major shows can cost upward of $1 million. Other
important blockbuster yardsticks include square footage of exhibit
space, whether the show is fed by several collections, how much of
an audience it attracts, and how extensively it travels. Such
historically successful traveling shows as the ``The Treasures of
Tutankhamen,'' or 1994's ``Impressionist Masterpieces From the
Barnes Collection'' _ each of which attracted between 500,000 and 1
million visitors at some sites _ still act as templates. They are
ambitious in content and seductive to both the cognoscente and the
infrequent museum patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the current DMA show, you can experience a Degas dancer or
an early Picasso, all eliciting an immediate appeal,'' says the
DMA's Kosinski. ``But you can also step back and enjoy an
intellectual environment as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In these bottom-line-driven times, money from a blockbuster's
audience admissions, inducing increased permanent memberships, is a
prime motivator in a museum's arranging as many big shows as
possible. Predictably, any major museum all but guarantees big box
office by simply mounting some variation on the impressionists
(Monet at breakfast, Van Gogh at tea), Picasso, a special
opportunity (art from the Hermitage), or any show advertising
``hidden'' or ``treasures'' or, better still ``hidden treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The glib wisdom among museums is that if you are running a
deficit, put on an impressionist show,'' says Brian Considine,
conservator of decorative arts and sculpture at the J. Paul Getty
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, at any one time throughout the course
of a month, numerous museums are simultaneously starting the
years-in-advance work of assembling a major exhibition. Some
gestation periods are stunningly long. The National Gallery of
Art's ``Master Drawings From the Albertina'' took 19 years to
mount, outlasting the tenures of four Austrian ambassadors to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The DMA's ``Degas to Picasso'' was first pondered five years
ago. The initial preparatory step was a wish list of paintings,
sculpture and photography. Once a list of both artists and great
works is made, then the task of tracking them down begins. A
``fishing letter'' is dispatched to targeted art holders,
presenting the theme of the exhibit and its dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, a museum or private holder tends to react
positively to a museum's request if they feel it will contribute
something to art history,'' Considine says.
</P>
<P>
   The borrowing museum then completes an extensive facilities
report, meticulously outlining the physical qualities (security
procedures, climate control) of its museum. Even at this early
stage, certain obstacles to the birth of a big show loom large. Few
museums will lend pastels, owing to their fragility. And the DMA,
two summers ago, discovered a traffic jam of four European Gauguin
shows when it was seeking key works for its ``Degas to Picasso''
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The frequent-flier mileage rapidly racks up when curators begin
wooing great works from other institutions. The DMA's Kosinski
embarked on art-hunting missions, getting her passport stamped in
London, Paris, Munich, Prague and Oslo. It was in Oslo that
Kosinksi received the kind of windfall cooperation that gave
``Degas to Picasso'' a real boost. The curator of the Edvard Munch
collection was so elated to have Munch in such prestigious company
that he contributed five major Munch oils and 16 studio and family
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Oslo trip was a crucial step, just about hammering this
big show down in one fell swoop,'' recalls Kosinski. (MORE)
nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the exhibit's Picasso section, Kosinski started a
multifront assault on Paris' Musee Picasso with numerous visits and
as many personal letters. Kosinski targeted Anne Baldassari at the
Musee Picasso, knowing she had published extensively on
photography's influence on Picasso. Baldassari eventually helped
Kosinski cobble together a master list of Picasso oils and works on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the people in Paris knew me, you can imagine how
inundated with requests the Picasso collection is,'' Kosinski says.
``But if you just persist and speak with eloquence, people will
feel confident about your project.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a major show's organizers travel to the ends of the
earth to guarantee their exhibit will have the choicest works.
Charles Stuckey of the Kimbell recalls the summer of 1987, when he
was a curator at the National Gallery of Art and working on a
definitive Gauguin retrospective. Stuckey, with officials from the
Art Institute of Chicago and Paris' Grand Palais, chartered a plane
to the Tahitian island where Gauguin died. In addition, he tracked
down a prized missing panel relief that wrapped around the door of
Gauguin's home. It would become one of the centerpieces of the
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so eager to get that missing piece, yet we couldn't
come across as scavengers,'' recalls Stuckey. ``So we had to
convince the owner just how advantageous it would be to share this
great art.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest behind-the-scenes maneuver helping a big
show acquire all the right pieces of art is the bartering of one
art piece for another. Though much denied, the manipulative nature
of this process becomes vital lubrication to big-show
orchestration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, it really can boil down to you wanting my Vermeer,
well I want your Picasso and two years later, you send the work
on,'' says Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Museums propagate the notion that this exchange is quite
collegial, proudly pointing to a recent deal in which Washington's
National Gallery of Art wanted to borrow Caravaggio's ``The Taking
of Christ'' from the National Gallery of Ireland. Since Ireland's
gallery is relatively small, it hesitated to lend the Caravaggio,
worrying about disappointing local fans flocking to see the great
Italian work.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Ireland decided to borrow one of our major Gauguins to
reward the audience coming to the museum yet not finding the
Caravaggio,'' says D. Dodge Thompson, chief of exhibitions at the
National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   For the recently completed ``Adriaen de Vries, Imperial
Sculptor'' show at Los Angeles' Getty, the Rijksmuseum in
Amsterdam, one of the exhibit's major lenders, requested access to
the Getty's finest Dutch works for the Rijksmuseum's upcoming ``The
Glory of the Golden Age'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, you can't be a borrower if you are not a
lender and if you try to be, you will get on a blacklist,''
Considine says.
</P>
<P>
   Certain works of art, no matter how vital to a major exhibition,
are taken off the barter table owing to their fragility. The
National Gallery of Art never makes available Leonardo da Vinci's
``Ginevra de Benci,'' as the 1474 work is a panel painting
extremely vulnerable to any shifts in relative humidity.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes it just depends on who is doing the asking. ``When
the Louvre asks to borrow something, it is really difficult to
refuse, because you know you will need their generosity for your
future big shows,'' says Edmund Pillsbury, former director of the
Kimbell Art Museum and current chief executive of Pillsbury and
Peters Fine Art.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing the shipping of artworks to a big exhibition may be a
museum's most nerve-racking part of big-show preparation. For the
de Vries show, the Getty had to coordinate shipments from museums
in England, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria,
Sweden, Denmark and the Czech Republic. And there was much high
anxiety surrounding the shipment of the works. In one instance, a
cargo of de Vries sculptures was bumped from a KLM flight in favor
of a crate of flowers and horses, setting back the Getty's
preparations by a crucial week.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the artworks to flow in, a museum can't remain
idle. The DMA's organizers for ``Degas to Picasso'' assembled the
show's mammoth accompanying catalog, editing its 18 scholarly
contributions and verifying provenance details. Next came erection
of special walls, which received a fresh coat of paint and
silk-screened graphic art. For the de Vries show, the Getty
outfitted the sculptures' pedestals with earthquake-sensitive
mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Helping insulate a big show from the potentially ruinous cost of
replacing or repairing a loaned masterpiece from overseas is
insurance. Dispensing this coverage, perhaps the most vital support
to any ambitious exhibition, is the Federal Council on the Arts and
the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   With a $5 billion fund for all eligible exhibitions, the
national indemnification program offers 90 percent coverage and
entertains around 25 applications from museums annually. The
application is a 25- to 30-page document filled with such details
as how much loaned artwork is involved, what its appraised value
is, and, curiously, the amount of ``foot-candles'' of illumination
focused on the art.
</P>
<P>
   But not even a healthy insurance backstop means that all great
art will be free to travel to the great exhibitions. ``I personally
don't anticipate the really great stuff coming back over and over
again,'' Hoving says. ``There will never be another Vermeer show
like the one in Washington two years ago. Just think if you lose
one of those. It's beyond money to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, even if a major show is perfectly insured and
meticulously planned for, it won't survive a day if no one knows
about it. Fulfilling the final, marketing piece of ``Degas to
Picasso,'' the DMA hired The Powell Group, a Dallas-based marketing
firm that not only helped design radio and television campaigns,
but also provided promotional materials to hotel concierges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake: Large shows are like the theater business,
with the use of sophisticated Madison Avenue techniques, including
audience surveys, to determine exactly how to draw the people in,''
Pillsbury says.
</P>
<P>
   For the DMA's ``Degas to Picasso,'' all its blustery buzz paid
off, judging by the strong advance word in everything from The Wall
Street Journal to The Art Newspaper. Maybe that's because of the
spot-on recognition factor, a fact aided by not naming it ``Von
Stuck to Khnopff,'' as was jokingly first considered. ``Degas to
Picasso'' sounded much more like a blockbuster.

&HT;     CLASS WARFARE, GOP STYLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent his final budget to Congress
Monday, proposing new federal programs and tax cuts for middle
income and poor families. It was predictably pronounced dead on
arrival by Republicans, who complained that he was taxing and
spending too much.
</P>
<P>
   There were no surprises. Once again, the president was playing a
familiar hand in the game of class warfare, promoting services and
benefits for the little guy, while congressional Republicans
groused about undue tax burdens on upper-income individuals and
wealthy corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are traditionally more skillful at class-conscious
rhetoric than conservative GOP leaders, and Clinton is an
acknowledged master at it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though polls show that massive, across-the-board tax cuts
have lost their public appeal in this era of national prosperity,
the Republicans haven't budged from their basic refrain of
squeezing federal domestic programs in order to reduce taxes that
mostly hit the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that ordinary voters actually like many of those
programs and do not always appreciate their tiny tax breaks that
are supposed to result from the budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new wrinkle, however, in this struggle between
competing political and financial interests this year. It's the
presidential campaign of Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican
conservative who refuses to leave the populist pitch to the
opposite party.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, it seemed that Texas Gov. George W. Bush also meant
to run as a centrist, with a new theme of ``compassionate
conservatism'' and an emphasis on reaching out to non-traditional
GOP voters. But in Iowa his primary rivals forced Bush to pander to
the religious right, leaving a huge hole for McCain to fill in the
philosophical middle, to Bush's left.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approach reflects standard Republican congressional
thinking, featuring a tax break that would give 36 percent of the
benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers although it also
would provide some help for lower-income families. The middle class
is out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with his own $70 million war chest, his opposition to
campaign finance reform and his endorsements from the GOP political
establishment, Bush is on the wrong side of the class warfare
issue.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, McCain has been touting his own budget plan as
doing more to help ``working middle-class Americans'' with a modest
tax cut and greater protection of the Social Security system, the
safety net of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He makes the same appeal to middle-class voters that has often
worked for Democrats, stressing that families who are not doing as
well as others deserve extra governmental support.
</P>
<P>
   He is responding to recent economic studies that indicate the
gap between rich and poor remains substantial even during this long
period of economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have traditionally dismissed this inequality,
responding that government policies have no role to play and that
only market-based forces and individual initiative can make a
difference. Whatever its economic merits, this argument strikes
many voters as selfish and cold-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   During one Republican debate, McCain was accused of engaging in
``class warfare'' by a questioner who made it sound like a nasty
business that only Democrats would indulge in. Republicans
traditionally view efforts to defend the poor and middle class as
``warfare,'' but they see policies that favor the rich as good
financial sense. My, those high marginal tax rates are terrible and
must go.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan administration, supply-side conservatives
commonly argued that the rich deserved proportionately bigger tax
breaks than others because they had brilliantly accumulated the
most capital in the first place, proving their greater merit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's nothing wrong with ``class warfare.'' In this
country we do not automatically assume that wealth is permanent or
even well-deserved. We think it should be earned. We think everyone
should have a chance at a decent slice of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   That's what democracy is all about, income groups elbowing one
another for advantage, bottom versus top, left versus right. People
climb up the ladder; people fall down it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never engaged in class warfare,'' McCain protested and
then proceeded to redefine the issue as the financial gap between
rich and poor rather than the maneuvering of politicians to
capitalize on it. Perhaps not his most candid reply.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains the only Republican presidential candidate to
identify repeatedly with the non-rich, which sets him apart. It
drives Bush supporters nuts. They accuse him of selling out to the
Democratic Party. Phooey. He's merely doing what he should be doing
_ going where the votes are.

ATLANTA SYMPHONY SELECTS BROOKLYN CONDUCTOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wales, Scotland, Germany, Ga., Calif., Ohio, Texas, Ind.,
Minn., Pa., Mass.)  By SUSAN ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robert Spano, who has won high praise as conductor of
the Brooklyn Philharmonic, was named music director of the Atlanta
Symphony on Tuesday, beginning with the 2001-02 season. Donald
Runnicles, music director of the San Francisco Opera, was named
principal guest conductor. But both men will keep their current
affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Spano will conduct the Atlanta orchestra for five
weeks and Runnicles for two weeks. Starting in 2001-02, Spano will
preside for 14 weeks each season, Runnicles for six.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cincinnati Symphony's appointment of Paavo Jarvi just
two weeks ago, Atlanta's announcement fills another slot in the
long list of orchestras shopping for their next music directors,
including New York, Boston and Philadelphia as well as
Indianapolis, Minneapolis and Houston and the St. Paul Chamber
Orchestra
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Wales, where he is in rehearsal with the Welsh
National Opera for a performance of ``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' Spano said
he was thrilled by his appointment. ``I can't wait to get going
with this wonderful orchestra,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would reconcile the conservative tastes of
Atlanta's audiences with the contemporary programming he has
offered in Brooklyn, he said, ``The best solutions are always
site-specific. What we've done in Brooklyn is to respond to the
realities of New York's cultural life. We've developed a certain
identity. Atlanta is a very different city, and we need to find out
what this orchestra should be doing there.''
</P>
<P>
   With a budget of $21 million and an endowment nearing $70
million, the Atlanta Symphony lays claim to being the largest
performing arts organization in the Southeast. It is ranked 13th in
budget size by the American Symphony Orchestra League.
</P>
<P>
   Spano, 38 and a native of Ohio, is considered among the most
important young American conductors, having cut his teeth as
assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1990-93,
his only other permanent post. Since then he has conducted European
ensembles and the major American orchestras and made debuts with
the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Royal Opera. Spano also heads
the conducting fellowship program at Tanglewood Music Center and is
on the faculty of Oberlin Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Runnicles, 44, is a Scotsman who was trained in Germany and has
conducted at most of the major European opera houses. He made his
North American debut in 1988 conducting Berg's ``Lulu'' at the
Metropolitan Opera and has had substantial symphonic experience in
the United States and abroad. He was appointed to the San Francisco
Opera post in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual wrinkle is that Runnicles will be a partner in both
the short- and long-range artistic planning for the Atlanta
orchestra. Traditionally a new music director would make his mark
before bringing in a principal guest conductor, Runnicles said. But
his contract calls for him to conduct a maximum of six weeks per
season and to meet regularly with Spano and the orchestra's
president, Allison Vulgamore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, Robert can pick my brain,'' Runnicles said, speaking
from San Francisco. ``We can bounce ideas off one another.'' As for
new programming, he said, ``We have to move away from the
appetizer-entree-dessert approach to concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulgamore, a former general manager of the New York
Philharmonic, defines herself as the third person in the new
equation. ``I am an artistic partner,'' she said, ``though my real
role is to facilitate the collaborative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Spano will be the fourth music director in the orchestra's
56-year history, succeeding Yoel Levi, who leaves at the end of
this season after 12 years in Atlanta. Its music director emeritus
and conductor laureate, Robert Shaw, died last year.
</P>
<P>
   The new regime follows five very uncomfortable years during
which Levi's supporters, claiming that the 49-year-old conductor
was being forced out, lobbied hard to turn public opinion against
the orchestra's administration and board. The campaign included
picketing concerts and buying huge billboards declaring Levi to be
Atlanta's musical savior. The orchestra also went through a 10-week
strike at the beginning of the 1996-97 season and struggled for a
decade with a deficit that, at this point, has been reduced to
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Recent months have seen comparative calm, however, with the
orchestra naming Levi music director emeritus for five seasons and
the musicians signing a four-year contract effective with the start
of the 2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very early on in the process it became apparent that we wanted
more collaboration among the orchestra, the music director, the
board and management,'' said Jun-Ching Lin, one of five musicians
on the 11-member search committee and the orchestra's assistant
concertmaster. ``It was obvious to us that the days of the music
director simply lording over his domain needed to change. Something
needed to be different.''

`BAD BOY NIETZSCHE!': SURREALISTIC PORTRAIT OF A MAD PHILOSOPHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The little girl is disappointed. This pale, limp man
with the skittish gaze and the spastic skip in his step surely
isn't Friedrich Nietzsche, is he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagined you big and strong, with eyes on fire,'' says the
Child, actually a grown woman in a sailor suit. She looks at the
sad specimen before her, so clearly more schlemiel than
Uebermensch, and has a bright idea: ``Is it possible _ maybe you
aren't the real Mr. Nietzsche?''
</P>
<P>
   The same question is no doubt in the mind of the man of whom it
is asked. For not only is the title character of ``Bad Boy
Nietzsche!,'' the mesmerizing tragicomic fantasia of a play that
opened Tuesday night at St. Marks Church, in the last demented
decade of his life; he is also Nietzsche as envisioned by the great
avant-garde director Richard Foreman, a man for whom the identity
of anything is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while this Nietzsche, played by Gary Wilmes, is beset by the
existential uncertainty that traditionally bedevils Foreman's
characters, an ember of self-awareness, even self-confidence, glows
beneath his bleary exterior.
</P>
<P>
   He may seem close kin to a salted slug, and heaven knows he
isn't always comprehensible. But even lost and frightened in the
shifting wonderland that is Foreman's typical mise en scene,
Nietzsche is allowed a trace of resilient swagger. He is even
allowed the last word.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big deal, since in Foreman's world no one is ever
allowed to have the last word, except possibly the world itself.
(And even then you can't figure out what it's saying.) In this
director's impeccably constructed philosophical vaudeville for his
Ontological-Hysteric Theater, his central characters are usually
the butts of a dark joke of a universe that keeps changing on them,
refusing to vouchsafe any glimpse of real knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   This worldview of Foreman's was made possible, in part, by the
writings of one Friedrich Nietzsche, who, as a character here
observes, ``is a man who sees the darkness, where other people
think there is a light still shining.'' So it feels inevitable that
in a season in which every other new play appears to have been
inspired by a famous life, Foreman would take on the author of
``Beyond Good and Evil.'' The happy surprise comes from seeing
Foreman stretch his imagination to look into a mind that is not his
own.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!'' has all the disorienting
trademarks of a typical Foreman production: the cluttered, cryptic
puzzle of a set, swimming with disconnected letters and talismanic
objects; the frenzied but precise staging; the dreamlike series of
non sequiturs; the sinister music-hall aura given off by an
ensemble of creepy, taunting burlesque figures; the random bell
sounds that go off, like signals on a quiz show informing you that
your time is up.
</P>
<P>
   Also per usual is the presence of a central figure who is
struggling against this hostile, cosmically comic environment and
is given to gnomic utterances. Yet as written by Foreman and
embodied by the wonderful Wilmes, Nietzsche emerges as something
quite different from the usual alter ego as Everyman. And _
startling in a Foreman production _ the performance belongs as much
to the actor as to the director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!'' takes as its starting point the story
that has this philosopher collapsing when he sees a horse being
beaten in Turin in 1889, triggering the nervous breakdown from
which he would never recover. What the play presents, more or less,
is the landscape of Nietzsche's subsequent madness. This includes
walls dense with smeared chalk writing; giant pencils, cigars, legs
and fish; assorted instruments of self-crucifixion; and a couple of
strange outsize machines (one of them quasi-human, one more like a
tank and winningly referred to as ``this ugly thing'').
</P>
<P>
   Characters identified as the Child (Sarah Louise Lilley), the
Cruel Man (Kevin Hurley) and the Beautiful Woman (Juliana Francis)
are on hand to question and ridicule poor Nietzsche: to ponder over
and misinterpret what he says and to point out, with graphic visual
aids, his physical and sexual failings. (``I'm not  &UR; supposed &LR;  to be
muscular,'' groans Nietzsche as Hurley's macho sportsman strikes a
Charles Atlas pose.) And yes, on occasion, stuffed calico horses
are brought out to be flagellated.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other play written by Foreman that I have seen,
``Bad Boy Nietzsche!'' makes consistent if oblique reference to
real-life figures and events. Not that he would be so blatant as to
use music from the Wagnerian operas that Nietzsche alternately
praised and reviled, or from Strauss' ``Thus Spake Zarathustra.''
</P>
<P>
   But Francis' character, who first appears as a bare-breasted
vision in ceremonial headdress, is clearly meant to evoke Lou
Salome, the great (unconsummated) love of Nietzsche's life. There
is even a sweet but clumsy attempt to exonerate his work as a
forerunner of Nazism with a sequence in which the words ``Jews''
and ``jewels'' are confused. Direct quotations from Nietzsche's
poems and letters blend beautifully into Foreman's phantasmagorical
production, a testament to the natural fit between form and subject
here.
</P>
<P>
   The blurred scribblings on the walls of the set, the crumpled
papers that mysteriously keep refilling a black briefcase: these
are poignant physical echoes of the philosopher's own words. One
example: ``The one thing necessary is to keep pen in motion over
the paper.'' Another: ``I write on table, write on wall/with
foolish heart a foolish scrawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilmes, who is becoming one of New York's foremost interpreters
of avant-garde work, delivers such lines with a heartbreaking mix
of arrogance and humility, a sensibility reflected in the bold but
broken poses he strikes. Like most of Foreman's characters he is in
a state of terminal existential pain and perpetual nervous
collapse. Both despite and because of this he is also an
exceptional figure in Foreman's work: a bona fide hero.

A LIFE-SAVING NUDGE FROM OUR FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Feb. 15)

 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat

<P>
   The story of Franci has a maddening too-familiar prelude. She
was young and hearty, with a growing career and a new marriage _
and then she got breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rhyme or reason to this disease. No woman knows if
she's going to be the one out of eight who gets breast cancer, but
no woman's doctor or health insurance knows it either.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday we'll figure out what toxics we're letting invade
women's breasts. But all we know now is that it hits young and old,
artists and ice skaters, unknowns and celebrities. Even the
indomitable Molly Ivins, who can cause presidential candidates to
tremble, announced late last year that she was as vulnerable as any
of us.
</P>
<P>
   As a writer sometimes I think there's nothing new to say about
breast cancer. But then I meet another woman like Franci and
remember that we are each other's best hope.
</P>
<P>
   The experts are only guessing. Until there is a certain cure and
prevention we are our own best advocates and nagging best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Franci was 33-years-old and suddenly feeling very tired but
assumed she was simply stressed out from balancing her advertising
career with marriage, helping to raise a stepson and trying to
conceive a baby.
</P>
<P>
   During a routine checkup a nurse practitioner felt a small lump
in Franci's breast, but the doctor she referred Franci to
pooh-poohed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me I was too young for breast cancer. I asked her
about getting a mammogram anyway and she let me know I was being
ridiculous. Besides, she said, my health insurance would never pay
for it at my age.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later the lump had grown and the nurse practitioner
insisted Franci forego a doctor referral and insurance approval and
get a mammogram on her own. She did and in three days learned it
was breast cancer that had spread into her lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Franci ended up having a mastectomy, a lymphectomy and a stem
cell transplant. She almost died at one point and is certain that
she made the choice to return to life and the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking up steps and I could see that what was on the
other side was simple, loving energy. I wanted to be there but I
chose to come back, and then there was my mom and the doctor
standing at my bed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been five years. So, Franci's is a happy story. ``It feels
so good to feel good,'' she says. Her rich brown hair is long again
and she's back working at a limited and saner schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Franci believes she survived because she made it her mission.
``My will kicked in,'' she says and she began reading every book
and piece of information on the Internet she could find about
cancer and healing.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that various healing methods needed to be part of her
regimen, she interviewed seven doctors to find one willing to let
her incorporate alternative therapies with the standard medical
model of western medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to four rounds of chemo and a stem cell transplant,
Franci added massage, acupuncture, Reiki healing which uses
therapeutic touch, Chinese herbs and special nutrients. She
meditated. She prayed. She exercised. She visualized her body well.
The visiting nurse who came to give her injections to boost her
white blood count sang church hymns with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people find this weird but I believe that we are
not just a body. We have our own power to do a lot of
self-healing.''
</P>
<P>
   She's back to living a normal life. She's still very particular
about what she puts in her body, starting out with a soy shake
every morning and a cup of green tea a day. But she allows herself
wine on occasion and has expanded her vegetarian diet to include
some meat because she thinks she needs the protein.
</P>
<P>
   Because she went into surgical menopause she will never have
babies and this makes her very sad. Sometimes when she is with her
contemporaries, other young women, she feels her loss acutely. ``I
want to fit in, to be young and beautiful and have my breast.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also finds it ``amazing'' that she did survive because
some women she met in doctors' offices and hospitals along the way
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Franci is included in a calendar for the Southwest Community
Health Center in Santa Rosa, Calif., which features photographs of
breast cancer survivors. One's a student. One's a 50-year-old
artist. Three are figure skaters.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar's message is that breast cancer screening saves
lives and early detection is the best protection. Franci, who had
to do much of her own detecting, would also remind us to stay alert
to our bodies and not let anyone tell us we're ridiculous to worry.

COURT WILL HEAR APPEAL OF RULING ON PINOCHET
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet's hopes of being freed from house
arrest and allowed to return home to Chile in the near future
suffered a setback Tuesday when a British court said it would hear
an appeal of Britain's decision that he was not medically fit to
stand trial on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   Six human rights groups and the government of Belgium are
challenging the refusal of Jack Straw, Britain's home secretary, to
make public an examination in January of Pinochet by four British
doctors. The doctors' report was the basis of Straw's finding that
the 84-year-old former dictator was not able to withstand the
rigors of extradition to Spain and trial in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The same challenge was thrown out last week by High Court Judge
Maurice Kay, who ruled that Straw, in insisting on keeping the
medical records confidential, had acted ``lawfully, fairly and
rationally.'' But the court Tuesday granted the request for
judicial review, saying that the complainants had ``an arguable
case.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision significantly changed the status of the case for
Pinochet's opponents. Now, whatever the outcome, there can be an
appeal to Britain's highest court, the Law Lords of the House of
Lords. Aside from requiring the general to remain in Britain
possibly for months more, such an appeal would return the Pinochet
case to the law lords, who on two earlier occasions had ruled
against him.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's action had remained only an application for
permission to seek judicial review and the court had rejected it,
the way would have been cleared for Straw to make a final and
unappealable decision to let Pinochet depart. A Chilean Air Force
plane has been waiting at an air force base in Oxfordshire for the
past week in the expectation that his confinement in England was
coming to an end this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Justice Simon Brown, one of the three judges, appeared to
take note of the protracted legal passage of the case during the
last year and a half, saying one reason the court was taking the
case was to spare another ``unfortunate'' tribunal from having to
deal with the complex case all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been in England since his arrest in October 1998 on
a petition from a Spanish judge that he be extradited to Madrid for
trial on charges of crimes against humanity dating from his
1973-1990 rule of Chile. After losing a series of judicial efforts
to overturn his arrest and contest the Spanish claim, Pinochet saw
his chances for an imminent end to the case improve sharply when
Straw said last month that he was inclined to drop the extradition
proceedings on compassionate grounds of age and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much welcome the fact that the hearing will now go on
to consider the merits of the case,'' said a spokesman for Amnesty
International, one of the rights groups. ``It's particularly
important for us, because clearly we want to put our argument
before the court, which is that it flouts natural justice not to
provide the information in the medical reports, particularly to the
governments seeking natural justice.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They teeter and lean, poking up from overgrown fields
like so many rotting teeth or falling soldiers. The tombstones
stand in village cemeteries throughout the part of Russia that was
known as the Jewish Pale, their intricate carvings depicting images
like fighting lions, blossoming flowers and praying hands over
Sabbath candles. In the late 1930s, surreptitiously but steadily,
David Goberman began sketching these grave markers, then
photographing them.
</P>
<P>
   Goberman, an 88-year-old ethnographer, said he recorded the
headstones not only as an act of preservation, but as one of
rescue. ``I wanted the people to know later about these
tombstones,'' Goberman said through a translator in a telephone
interview from his apartment in St. Petersburg. ``I was an artist,
so first I started drawing them. Then I realized I had to save
them, so I started taking photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 70 of his pictures are on view in an exhibition at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art that continues through April 30. The show,
``Carved Memories: Jewish Tombstones of the Russian Pale,
Photographs by David Goberman,'' is the first appearance in the
West of Goberman's studies of more than 300 years of Jewish
stonecutting.
</P>
<P>
   The Pale of Settlement included the region from Minsk to Warsaw
and from Vilna to the Black Sea, in which Jews from Russia were
forced to live from the late 18th century until the First World
War. Pogroms forced 1.5 million Jews to flee at the turn of the
20th century. Most of the tombstones in the exhibition were carved
in the 18th and 19th centuries and many were destroyed when the
Nazis obliterated nearly all the Jewish cemeteries. The stones were
also threatened by weather and by the antireligious orthodoxy of
the Soviet state. By the 1960s the remaining graveyards had begun
to disappear, their stones used for gravel or factory steps.
</P>
<P>
   Goberman captured them just in time, as with his image of an
1825 tombstone from the Kuty Cemetery in Ukraine that honors
Rachel, daughter of Moshe David, who died at 40. The stone features
an ornate floral design bordered by leaves with a fallen flower in
the center and the Jewish calendar year 5585. ``She had trouble all
of her days and did not have years,'' the Hebrew inscription reads.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cemeteries were in the shtetls of Poland, Ukraine
and Moldova. The tombstones honor rabbis, children, merchants,
scholars, victims of pogroms. They remember women and men, rich and
poor. One from the Kosov cemetery in 1840 portrays a woman's hands
raised over candles. The ruffles at her wrist suggest Sabbath
finery.
</P>
<P>
   Another, erected in the Sambor cemetery in 1897, depicts an open
bookcase containing the Bible and commemorates a chief rabbi. ``He
was old and satisfied in his days,'' the Hebrew inscription reads.
``He was taken and the ark of God was taken _ the angels of death
triumphed over the angels of life. And the light was separated.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold L. Lehman, director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, said,
``When a culture like that vanishes and these are the documents
that are left, they take on an important significance.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to historical artifacts, the tombstones are among
the few works of Jewish art from Russia during that period because
czarist laws forbade Jews from artistic expression beyond
utilitarian necessities like prayer books, marriage certificates
and synagogue decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Sommerfeld Halliwell, who brought the photographs to the
United States with her partner, Kenneth A. Pushkin, said many of
the tombstone cutters later contributed to the carvings on New York
apartment buildings, having fled the pogroms for America.
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell and Pushkin have established the Goberman Archive to
house 1,000 negatives from Goberman's research on tombstones, as
well as other products of his life work. He has published nine
books about folklore, including three on tombstones. His tombstone
photographs have been exhibited only once in the Soviet Union,
during a political thaw from 1966 to 1967 before Israel's Six-Day
War.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzoli has published a collection of more than 150 of the
images in a book to accompany the Brooklyn Museum show. The poet
laureate, Robert Pinsky, provided the book's foreword, which reads
in part, ``The silence of light and the silence of stone defer to
the articulate imagination of the European Jews who designed and
commissioned and carved and tended these stones, markers that now
memorialize more than their original intention: the death of a
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in the book, Goberman writes that the craftsmanship
of the stones offered clues to the lives of the deceased _ ``the
more complicated, labor-intensive works are monuments to people of
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Minsk in 1912 to a traditional Jewish family, Goberman
was 6 at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution. His father, a
musician, died in the Minsk ghetto at the hands of the Nazis during
World War II. Later he served as a helper in the medical corps.
Goberman's documentation of Jewish themes often put him at great
risk with the Soviet authorities. ``This was a period in which
anti-Semitism was very strong,'' he said. To defuse criticism that
he paid too much attention to Jewish art and history, he also
photographed Christian folk art.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the pictures _ in the morning or the evening, when
the light best illuminated the carvings _ it was as if he were on a
clandestine mission. But Goberman said the risk was worth it for
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   The tombstones seem to commemorate a lost tribe, and on many of
them voices cry out in almost audible mourning. ``Hoy on the
destruction!'' reads one tombstone placed in the Uzhgorod cemetery
in 1870. ``It is bitter for us. It is bitter ... The dear and
honest woman, a woman of valor and her husband's crown, Chaya,
daughter of Moshe Yehuda, was gathered to her people at 29 years.''

   NEW YORK _ They teeter and lean, poking up from overgrown fields
like so many rotting teeth or falling soldiers. The tombstones
stand in village cemeteries throughout the part of Russia that was
known as the Jewish Pale, their intricate carvings depicting images
like fighting lions, blossoming flowers and praying hands over
Sabbath candles. In the late 1930s, surreptitiously but steadily,
David Goberman began sketching these grave markers, then
photographing them.
</P>
<P>
   Goberman, an 88-year-old ethnographer, said he recorded the
headstones not only as an act of preservation, but as one of
rescue. ``I wanted the people to know later about these
tombstones,'' Goberman said through a translator in a telephone
interview from his apartment in St. Petersburg. ``I was an artist,
so first I started drawing them. Then I realized I had to save
them, so I started taking photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 70 of his pictures are on view in an exhibition at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art that continues through April 30. The show,
``Carved Memories: Jewish Tombstones of the Russian Pale,
Photographs by David Goberman,'' is the first appearance in the
West of Goberman's studies of more than 300 years of Jewish
stonecutting.
</P>
<P>
   The Pale of Settlement included the region from Minsk to Warsaw
and from Vilna to the Black Sea, in which Jews from Russia were
forced to live from the late 18th century until the First World
War. Pogroms forced 1.5 million Jews to flee at the turn of the
20th century. Most of the tombstones in the exhibition were carved
in the 18th and 19th centuries and many were destroyed when the
Nazis obliterated nearly all the Jewish cemeteries. The stones were
also threatened by weather and by the antireligious orthodoxy of
the Soviet state. By the 1960s the remaining graveyards had begun
to disappear, their stones used for gravel or factory steps.
</P>
<P>
   Goberman captured them just in time, as with his image of an
1825 tombstone from the Kuty Cemetery in Ukraine that honors
Rachel, daughter of Moshe David, who died at 40. The stone features
an ornate floral design bordered by leaves with a fallen flower in
the center and the Jewish calendar year 5585. ``She had trouble all
of her days and did not have years,'' the Hebrew inscription reads.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cemeteries were in the shtetls of Poland, Ukraine
and Moldova. The tombstones honor rabbis, children, merchants,
scholars, victims of pogroms. They remember women and men, rich and
poor. One from the Kosov cemetery in 1840 portrays a woman's hands
raised over candles. The ruffles at her wrist suggest Sabbath
finery.
</P>
<P>
   Another, erected in the Sambor cemetery in 1897, depicts an open
bookcase containing the Bible and commemorates a chief rabbi. ``He
was old and satisfied in his days,'' the Hebrew inscription reads.
``He was taken and the ark of God was taken _ the angels of death
triumphed over the angels of life. And the light was separated.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold L. Lehman, director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, said,
``When a culture like that vanishes and these are the documents
that are left, they take on an important significance.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to historical artifacts, the tombstones are among
the few works of Jewish art from Russia during that period because
czarist laws forbade Jews from artistic expression beyond
utilitarian necessities like prayer books, marriage certificates
and synagogue decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Sommerfeld Halliwell, who brought the photographs to the
United States with her partner, Kenneth A. Pushkin, said many of
the tombstone cutters later contributed to the carvings on New York
apartment buildings, having fled the pogroms for America.
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell and Pushkin have established the Goberman Archive to
house 1,000 negatives from Goberman's research on tombstones, as
well as other products of his life work. He has published nine
books about folklore, including three on tombstones. His tombstone
photographs have been exhibited only once in the Soviet Union,
during a political thaw from 1966 to 1967 before Israel's Six-Day
War.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzoli has published a collection of more than 150 of the
images in a book to accompany the Brooklyn Museum show. The poet
laureate, Robert Pinsky, provided the book's foreword, which reads
in part, ``The silence of light and the silence of stone defer to
the articulate imagination of the European Jews who designed and
commissioned and carved and tended these stones, markers that now
memorialize more than their original intention: the death of a
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in the book, Goberman writes that the craftsmanship
of the stones offered clues to the lives of the deceased _ ``the
more complicated, labor-intensive works are monuments to people of
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Minsk in 1912 to a traditional Jewish family, Goberman
was 6 at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution. His father, a
musician, died in the Minsk ghetto at the hands of the Nazis during
World War II. Later he served as a helper in the medical corps.
Goberman's documentation of Jewish themes often put him at great
risk with the Soviet authorities. ``This was a period in which
anti-Semitism was very strong,'' he said. To defuse criticism that
he paid too much attention to Jewish art and history, he also
photographed Christian folk art.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the pictures _ in the morning or the evening, when
the light best illuminated the carvings _ it was as if he were on a
clandestine mission. But Goberman said the risk was worth it for
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   The tombstones seem to commemorate a lost tribe, and on many of
them voices cry out in almost audible mourning. ``Hoy on the
destruction!'' reads one tombstone placed in the Uzhgorod cemetery
in 1870. ``It is bitter for us. It is bitter ... The dear and
honest woman, a woman of valor and her husband's crown, Chaya,
daughter of Moshe Yehuda, was gathered to her people at 29 years.''

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Ending the decade on a very strong note,
the nation's workers increased their productivity at an annual rate
of 5 percent in the last six months of 1999, the Labor Department
reported Tuesday. With these final numbers, the 1990s entered the
books as the decade that produced the greatest improvement in
productivity since the 1960s. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ATTACK (Jerusalem) _ The conflict in Lebanon continued to
heat up Tuesday as Shiite Muslim guerrillas killed another Israeli
soldier, the sixth in two weeks, and Israelis warplanes retaliated
less than 24 hours after their first bombardment knocked out power
stations and shut down civilian life in much of Lebanon. As Arab
and some European countries condemned Israel for its air strikes,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak lamented that civilian targets had to be
struck and that the regional peace effort was dealt a blow. By
Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-MALUKU (Ambon, Indonesia) _ Maluku, the former Spice
Islands, exploding in Christian-Muslim violence, are Indonesia's
nightmare: Freed from the controlling grip of its former dictator,
the society descends into chaos as religious and communal hatreds
boil to the surface, beyond the reach of the central government or
security forces. By Seth Mydans.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-FAMILY (Miami) _ With a custody hearing for 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez only days away, a profile of the Miami family hoping
to keep him in the United States. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-DOMESTIC-POLICY (Washington) _ John McCain is not a
policy wonk, at least when it comes to domestic concerns. His
assertion on the stump that he is the one ``fully prepared to
lead'' is grounded in his experience in the military and his
expertise in national security affairs. While the Arizona senator
can speak in great detail about unneeded weapons systems or his
theories of rolling back rogue state dictators, he seems less
fluent on the issues that were not his Senate specialties _ like
health care or the environment or education. By Alison Mitchell.
1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   DNA-SEX-CRIMES (New York) _ Just as the use of DNA in criminal
investigations is on the verge of becoming routine, rape survivors
and law enforcement experts are finding that in the realm of sex
crimes, science has outpaced the law. In New York and around the
nation, computer databanks of DNA profiles taken from known
criminals are expanding rapidly, allowing investigators to use tiny
bits of biological evidence collected from crime scenes to check
against growing pools of suspects. By C.J. Chivers. (1500 words).
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   NY-STADIUM (New York) _ The Giuliani administration has signed a
lease to build what will be the most expensive minor league
baseball stadium in the country by far, a $71 million ballpark near
the Staten Island ferry terminal that would be built entirely with
taxpayer money. By Charles V. Bagli.

   NY-ROSE-CENTER-ARCH (New York) _ The new Rose Center for Earth
and Space at the American Museum of Natural History brings us face
to face with something commensurate to our capacity for wonder.
Night and day, astronomers, astrophysicists and weekend stargazers
behold awesome images of the unknown. For New Yorkers who care
about architecture, the wonder won't be limited to the star show.
Even before the building opened, many of us were rubbing our eyes
in disbelief that it exists at all. Designed by the New York firm
Polshek Partnership, the planetarium is an aesthetic apparition as
well as a major civic event. By Herbert Muschamp.

<P>
   BOILER-ROOM-FILM (Undated) _ In the '80s, presented with merger
mania and junk-bond madness, Hollywood produced movies like the
polished ``Wall Street'' and the glossy ``Working Girl,'' films
about the nexus of big money and big morality. Now the current
Money Moment, this dot-com expansion, or bubble, or souffle, or
whatever it turns out to be, has its first opus: ``Boiler Room.''
It's the story of Seth, a young man played by Giovanni Ribisi, who,
in a misguided effort to placate his demanding father, takes a job
as a broker trainee at a hip-deep-in-fraud Long Island securities
firm _ the overheated, testosterone-driven, 100-phone-line, folding
table, boiler room operation of the title. By Jamie Malanowski.

   WONDER-BOYS-FILM (Los Angeles) _ ``They always want you to do
what they've seen you do before,'' says Curtis Hanson, who last
directed (and co-wrote) that extravagant blend of slam-bang police
saga and character study, ``L.A. Confidential.'' In his new film,
``Wonder Boys'' (opening Friday), Hanson has outwitted Hollywood's
powers that be. With the help of his star, Michael Douglas (``the
motor of this movie''), he has taken Michael Chabon's ebullient
novel, set in and around an English department at a Pittsburgh
college, and come up with a different kind of movie. It's a pothead
picaresque, a contemporary screwball comedy-drama with a mellow
emotional tang. Douglas plays the middle-aged creative-writing
teacher Grady Tripp, a once-hot novelist unable to complete his
latest work. By Michael Sragow.
</P>
<P>
   KADOSH-FILM (New York) _ In the bedroom of an ultra-Orthodox
couple in Jerusalem, a man rises, takes three steps, washes his
hands, and recites the morning prayer, thanking God for preserving
his soul all night, and for not having created him a woman.
``Kadosh,'' the new film by the Israeli director Amos Gitai, 49,
which opens on Wednesday in New York, begins with this intimate
view of the rituals Orthodox Jewish men perform each day. Meir, the
husband, goes on to wake his wife, Rivka, with respect and
affection. But his prayer, with its jarring inequity, haunts the
conflicts that follow. By Leslie Camhi.

</P>
<P>
   BACH-PRELUDES (Undated) _ ``The Well-Tempered Clavier'' appeared
in two installments during the first half of the 18th century. The
style and content look back in time, as Bach often did, but there
is something futuristic about how these pieces are used. Musical
progress, like any other kind of progress, goes in circles, and in
the year 2000 we seem to be overtaking the 18th-century world that
the 19th century left in its rear-view mirror. These 48 preludes
and fugues in all the major and minor keys have little to do with
public virtuosos, stages or audiences. Like a lot of Bach's work _
especially the music written, or at least assembled, toward the end
of his life _ the ``Well-Tempered'' makes statements, advances
theories, pulls together bodies of knowledge. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS-HAMPSON-MAHLER (Undated) _ The baritone Thomas Hampson
would never call himself a musicologist. He lacks the academic
training and has too much respect for the field to claim a place in
it. Yet for more than 10 years he has been part of a small team of
scholars doing important research into the songs of Gustav Mahler.
He will present recitals of Mahler's songs on Tuesday and Thursday
evenings at Carnegie Hall with the pianist Wolfram Rieger. By

   JONI-MITCHELL-ALBUM (Undated) _ Few contemporary voices have
aged more shockingly than Joni Mitchell's. The craggy alto on
``Both Sides Now,'' her intermittently magnificent new album of
standards (including two of her best-loved original songs), is so
changed from the sweetly yodeling folk soprano of her earliest
albums that it hardly seems possible the two sounds could have come
from the same body. In refusing to fight or try to camouflage the
ravages of time, Mitchell belongs to an interpretive school that
includes Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra, whose vocal
deterioration brought them greater emotional depth and realism. By
Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-IMAGE (Undated) _ Most big-picture conversations about jazz
these days come down to the same question: how can it become
important again? The answer has to be more than
once-every-five-years phenomena like Cassandra Wilson or Diana
Krall. Jazz needs what rock has had since the '80s, an organized
proliferation of termitelike hipster activity wherever there are
young people playing and listening. There needs to be better music
education. There need to be more clubs booking jazz where people
under 25 feel welcome. And there needs to be a thriving
independent-label record business, one that plots the daily graph
of where jazz musicians are heading. By Ben Ratliff.

<P>
   MILLENNIUM-TIME-SHOWS (London) _ The differences in how the
French and English view time are the subject of millennium
exhibitions in London and Paris. The titles of the shows are
already revelatory. ``The Story of Time,'' which runs through Sept.
24 at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich in east London, is
an almost didactic review of how time has been measured and
interpreted by different cultures through the ages. In contrast,
``Le Temps, Vite,'' or ``Time, Quickly,'' at the Georges Pompidou
Center in Paris through April 17, is more artistic and
philosophical, its very name suggesting that time can be
manipulated. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   HAYDEN-PLANETARIUM (New York) _ The new Hayden Planetarium,
centerpiece of the $210 million Rose Center for Earth and Space at
the museum, which opens on Feb. 19, sets a high standard for a new
era in showmanship that dramatizes new knowledge of the cosmos
through the technology of virtual reality. The Hubble Space
Telescope meets Silicon Valley and Hollywood. By John Noble
Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   CRAFT-ART (New York) _ In ``Defining Craft I: Collecting for the

David Revere McFadden, the chief curator at the American Craft
Musem in Manhattan since 1997, shows us that the term crafts
encompasses more than it did a century ago. The show, which remains
through May 7, is the largest in many years to focus on the

   WASHINGTON _ Senators grappled Tuesday with how to provide
senior citizens with prescription drug coverage as part of their
Medicare benefits in an election year, a time when any major
legislative change is extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in a hearing of a panel on the aging was whether to
simply add prescription drug coverage to Medicare or make it part
of a large overhaul of the whole government program that provides
health insurance for 39 million Americans, most of them elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skeptics predict that Congress won't take on these tough
questions in an election year,'' said Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Aging. ``Beginning
today, we're proving them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley spoke a day after President Clinton proposed spending
$168 billion over 10 years to help pay senior citizens'
prescription drug costs under Medicare. Clinton also proposed
setting up a $35 billion reserve fund for beneficiaries whose
prescription bills skyrocket because of catastrophic illness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Clinton budget would earmark $300 billion for
long-term shoring up of Medicare. The money would come out of the
government's 10-year budget surplus projection of $746 billion. The
infusion would keep Medicare solvent for 10 years beyond the
system's currently predicted collapse in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug coverage under Medicare is popular with
voters, and leaders of both parties have championed it.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress deadlocked last year over a similar administration
prescription proposal and adjourned without acting on it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, senators and health experts called as witnesses
debated the merits of two bipartisan Medicare prescription plans
now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One, by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and John Breaux, D-La., would
include prescription coverage as part of the large Medicare
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a program that's not nearly as good as it should be,
and it's going broke,'' Breaux said. Noting the continued health of
the economy and projected federal budget surpluses, he added: ``We
ought to grasp this opportunity in a unique time to bring about
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Clinton plan, the Breaux-Frist proposal would turn
Medicare into a competitive program. The government system and
independent health-care providers would vie for premium dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is modeled on the Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program, which insures 9 million federal workers. It would offer
Medicare beneficiaries a choice of plans, with a more comprehensive
package of benefits generally requiring higher premium payments.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries at a minimum would be guaranteed the benefits they
now receive under Medicare, as well as limits to out-of-pocket
costs. Prescription drug costs would be covered, with poorer
Medicare beneficiaries receiving government-subsidized discounts on
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Under the second plan by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, the government would cover all or part of
prescription premiums, based on a sliding income scale.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors at the poverty level _ $12,360 annual income for a
single person and $16,590 for a couple _ would pay no premiums for
prescription drug coverage. Better-off seniors would receive a
federal subsidy of 25 percent for their prescription premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors could choose from competing prescription plans. The
proposal says nothing about solving Medicare's long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   David Walker, comptroller general of the United States, who
testified in favor of a comprehensive Medicare overhaul, appeared
dismissive of the Wyden-Snowe plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a temptation to have dessert before we have the main
meal,'' Walker said. Comprehensive reform ``takes courage. It takes
persistence, but it's something we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyden responded that such an overhaul would be politically
difficult and that projections of what it will take to save
Medicare might change radically if the economy plummets. ``We're
not trying to gorge on dessert here,'' he argued.

KEEPING UP WITH THE EXPANDING MEANING OF CRAFT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the beginning of time, craft makers have transformed clay,
sand, fiber, wood, stone and metal into all sorts of ordinary and
wondrous objects _ pots, vases, tapestries and necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   At first they made everything by hand. But over time, they added
machines, and most recently computers, to improve or quicken the
molding, weaving, carving and welding of objects.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, craft objects made by hand or machine have
become popular everywhere. The techniques used to make them are
taught at universities and professional workshops. And the objects
produced are exhibited in museums and galleries and are collected
with a fervor formerly reserved for Rembrandts and Rothkos.
Incresingly, curators, collectors and creators in the crafts world
ask whether these objects are art.
</P>
<P>
   But not David Revere McFadden, the chief curator at the American
Craft Museum in Manhattan since 1997. ``We shouldn't ask the
question, `Are these objects art?''' McFadden said. ``The question
implies that if an object made with craft skills is designated as
art, it will be more meaningful and more worthy aesthetically. And
that's not necessarily true. An incredible piece of glass that
reveals the consummate skill of a glass blower may be more
meaningful to people today than a highly intellectualized
conceptual work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Defining Craft I: Collecting for the New Millennium,'' an
exhibition of 150 objects, nearly half from the museum's collection
and the rest from gifts promised to it, McFadden shows us that the
term crafts encompasses more than it did a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which remains through May 7, is the largest in many
years to focus on the museum's collection and how it might appear
in the near future. ``We're now collecting with a new energy to
bring our collection into the 21st century, and this show does that
with several computer-generated objects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This ambitious survey presents a stunning diversity of objects
that illustrate four approaches explored in the crafts field over
the last half century. The first group is of traditional,
one-of-a-kind functional objects and includes some of the show's
most memorable works from the 1950s and 1960s: Sam Maloof's
commodious slat-back rocking chair; Gertrude and Otto Natzler's
large earthenware bowl, gloriously finished with a lavalike
bluish-green glaze; Anni Albers's subtle tribute to the square in a
gridlike abstract weaving and Wendell Castle's sinuously carved
music stand that resembles a sapling bent by the wind.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast, the technically innovative works in the
second group are functional in form but are rarely used; they never
would have been called crafts 100 years ago. These are the objets
virtu of our time, labor-intensive works that are exuberant
expressions of clay, glass, metal, wood or feathers: Mary Ann
(Toots) Zynsky's rippling bowl made of thousands of glass threads;
Arline M. Fisch's machine-woven copper and silver collar, as
shapely as the starchy ones worn by merchants in Dutch Renaissance
paintings; the photographer and onetime milliner Bill Cunningham's
souffle of feathers that he calls a muff, and Philip C. Moulthrop's
wooden bowl covered with golden mosaics that seem to spin like
planets in a darkened sky.
</P>
<P>
   The objects in the third group combine the same skills and
materials as conventional craft objects, but they are not
functional. In fact, these works are the ones most often referred
to as art. The majority were produced since 1980, but several
pieces from the 1950s and 1960s are among the most arresting: Peter
Voulkos's rough stoneware cross, splashed with reds and blues;
Robert Arneson's irreverent self-portraits in clay and Magdalena
Abakanowitz's inky-violet cocoon, a monumental weaving.
</P>
<P>
   The objects in the fourth category represent the most radically
different additions to the ever-expanding world of crafts, works
usually found in industrial design and fashion shows. Many were
produced as multiples (Gaetano Pesce's colorful polyurethane bowl
that looks as if it was made by a child with Play-Doh) or as
mass-produced furniture (the architect Frank Gehry's Power Play
Armchair, a swirl of bent maple strips).
</P>
<P>
   More than a few were designed and produced on computerized
machines: Junichi Arai's abstract-patterned crushed metallic woven
panels, the length of a sari, and Stanley Lechtzin's resin and gold
brooch that looks like a miniature Stanley Kubrick space pod.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things we are showing are decorative arts _ objects
of use, meaning and beauty,'' McFadden said. ``They celebrate
something that is profoundly human, that there is value in making
things, even pushing the buttons on a computer to produce an
object. We need to surround ourselves with things that give us
visual, tactile and aesthetic satisfaction. Some designs delight us
because they show a respect for the accidental in their creation,
or a rare spontaneity, like the vibrant blown-glass goblets of Dale
Chihuly.''
</P>
<P>
   Spontaneity and other personal expressions are among the
qualities that the museum seeks today in the objects it acquires.
``We're now acquiring objects with a new energy to keep up to the
moment in our collection,'' McFadden said.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition is not meant to be a final resolution of the
question, ``What is craft?'' ``Rather, it's like opening a
dictionary and finding so many more meanings than you ever dreamed
existed for the word craft,'' he said. ``We intend to explore them
all.''

   Back in 1979, when the US Mint was having trouble getting the
public to accept its new Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, humorist Art
Buchwald wrote a column with the facetious suggestion that the
Treasury slip some of them into cereal boxes as a promotional
stunt. Buchwald was 21 years ahead of his time. Lucky Cheerios
buyers now can find one of several thousand of the new,
gold-colored Sacagawea (usually pronounced sah-kah-jah-WAY-ah)
dollar coins buried in their oats.

<P>
   The Cheerios premiums are just one of the ways the Mint is
trying to make sure that the coin honoring the young Shoshone
interpreter for the Lewis and Clark expedition does not fall into
the same currency oblivion as the Anthony dollars. The Mint has
also talked Wal-Mart into stocking all its cash registers with the
new coins.
</P>
<P>
   Steps like this are needed because the history of Americans with
dollar coins is to collect some and give a few to the
grandchildren, but not to circulate them. Circulation would have
been less an issue under a plan favored by dollar-coin backers: the
$1 bill would have been eliminated and many more $2 bills made,
along with coin dollars. Congress, knowing from surveys how
unpopular this idea was, never approved it.
</P>
<P>
   But the new coin seems to be a winner, and it has addressed the
Anthony's main flaw: It was too much like a quarter. The Sacagawea
has a gold color and an edge that's smooth like a nickel's, not
ribbed like a quarter's. The same size as the Anthony, it will fit
into vending machines and be a boon to transit systems and their
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Out in Dalton, where Crane &AMP; Co. makes the paper on which bills
are printed, there is only measured concern about competition from
the coin. ``As long as it is co-circulated,'' says company CEO
Lansing Crane, ``it's just another collector's item.''
</P>
<P>
   But we agree with Mint Director Philip N. Diehl when he says:
``It can easily survive in the market with the dollar bill.''
Americans like to have a choice, he notes, and in this case the
government is giving them the choice of a very handsome coin.

TOKYO GOVERNOR PROPOSES RADICAL PLAN TO TAX BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Shares of Japan's major banks fell Tuesday after the
Tokyo metropolitan government announced a startling plan to impose
a temporary tax on their operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, introduced on Monday by Shintaro Ishihara, Tokyo's
feisty governor, aims to raise 110 billion yen, or roughly $1
billion, from 30 Tokyo-based banking institutions by taxing their
profits before other taxes and before extraordinary gains and
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the largest bank in the
country, dropped 3.4 percent, to 1,375 yen, and other banks were
hit harder. Shares of Sanwa Bank fell 5.04 percent, while Sakura
Bank lost 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara could be using the proposed plan, which is still
sketchy, as a bargaining chip to extract concessions or money from
the central government to shore up the city's finances. He has
often thumbed his nose at convention, refusing to move into the
Governor's Mansion and irritating civil servants with comments that
suggested they had participated in bid rigging.
</P>
<P>
   He has nonetheless taken serious steps to address Tokyo's
looming fiscal crisis, including adopting a plan to cut personnel
costs by nearly $3 billion over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the brazen proposal to tax the banks illustrates the
severity of the straits of Japan's local governments, a great many
of which are teetering on the brink of insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   Tax revenue has fallen sharply as the central government has
tried to jolt the recalcitrant economy with huge public works
projects. Tokyo's corporate tax revenue has plunged to 3.4 billion
yen in the year that will end in March, from 210 billion yen at the
height of the nation's economic boom in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the local governments have taken on mountains of
debt to pay for various projects mandated by the central
government. Under Japanese law, local governments are required to
pay part of the costs of such projects, but they are increasingly
refusing to take part, saying they simply cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ishihara's plan, which will go to the
municipal assembly for approval, came as a shock to the banks and
to financial regulators, inciting howls of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no notice,'' fumed Michio Ochi, the head of the
Financial Reconstruction Commission, which is charged with
overseeing the rehabilitation of Japan's rickety financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Ochi, who described Ishihara as a ``frequent troublemaker,''
said the plan would place too big a burden on institutions that are
already struggling with piles of soured loans, a reduced demand for
new lending and a more vigorously competitive environment. ``I
cannot allow it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released Tuesday by the Bank of Japan, the
balance of outstanding loans dropped 6 percent in January from the
corresponding period last year, the 25th consecutive month that
lending, and thus interest income, has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Katsuyuki Sugita, the chairman of the Japanese Bankers
Association, said it would be ``grossly unfair'' to impose a tax on
a single industry and warned that the implications were dire. ``It
could lead to a lowering of the competitiveness of Japanese
financial institutions at a time when the financial reform is
making substantial progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If New York City announced such a plan, the big banks that make
it their home could simply pick up and move, taking tax dollars
with them.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is somewhat different in Tokyo, however. Thanks to
their close-knit relationship with agencies of the central
government, the banks would find it hard to relocate their
headquarters in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, Japanese banks have written off some $473 billion in
bad loans over the last eight years, a process that has more than
eliminated what meager operating profits they may have had. The
bottom-line losses produced by that practice have excused the banks
from paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo is the first Japanese locality to try to use a special
clause in the local tax laws to tax companies based on their size
rather than their performance. The clause was based on the notion
that all companies benefit from the public services provided by
local governments and thus should have to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara is counting on the sympathy of his constituents, who,
like most Japanese, have no love lost for their banks, which have
long favored corporate clients over individual customers and small
businesses. ``He could have said he was going to tax NEC, Hitachi
or Sony,'' said Robert Zielinski, a banking analyst with Lehman
Brothers in Tokyo. ``But banks are an easy target because Japanese
like Sony TVs and NEC computers, but no one really likes Japanese
banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Zielinski said the market had overreacted. ``When all this is
said and done, if this happens, the banks will just pass it on as
costs to the consumer,'' he said. ``Besides, what's $1 billion a
year when Japanese banks routinely write off $100 billion in a
year?''

COSTLY AIRSTRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Israel's bombing of power stations and Hezbollah bases across
Lebanon may have appeared unavoidable to Prime Minister Ehud Barak
for domestic reasons, but the bombing allows Israel to be depicted
as a state that breaks agreements at the very moment it is engaged
in peace talks with Syria and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to affirm Israel's deterrence capability by
depriving Lebanese civilians of electricity also demonstrates to
Syria and Iran that Barak cannot refrain from retaliating
excessively to deliberate provocations.
</P>
<P>
   The April Understanding of 1996 obliged Israel and the
Iranian-backed, Syrian-supervised Hezbollah militia to avoid firing
on or from civilian areas. In the aftermath of this week's bombing
raids near Beirut, Tripoli, and Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, Israel
contended that Hezbollah's earlier attacks on Israeli soldiers in
southern Lebanon were mounted from civilian sites.
</P>
<P>
   But this justification of Israel's retaliation against civilians
throughout Lebanon was not taken seriously even by members of
Barak's government. Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said Tuesday: ``We
are not ready to play by the rules of the game as they have been
played up to now. The (1996) understandings have restricted us from
responding in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the most naive observer may doubt that Syrian ruler Hafez
Assad gave Hezbollah a green light to provoke Israel as it did. By
falling into Assad's trap, Barak enables the Syrian dictator to
pretend that the occupying power most inimical to Lebanese
independence is Israel and not Syria with its occupation force of
35,000 soldiers and uncounted security agents.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's resort to air power in Lebanon revives distrust of
Israel in the Arab world, rallying support for Assad's maximilist
position in deadlocked peace negotiations. In this way the canny
Assad used Israel's strength against it. The Israeli bombing raid
weakens Barak's strong hand, improves Assad's weak hand, and
punishes the Lebanese for living between the wrong neighbors.

   Wonders Old And New
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago a British television producer, Anthony Geffen,
announced what sounded like an enormously ambitious and
one-of-a-kind project: He said he would use the breakthroughs in
computer and digital technology to recreate the ancient
civilizations of Rome, Greece, Egypt and China, bringing viewers
the experience of walking through the Parthenon or riding a chariot
at the Roman Circus.
</P>
<P>
   Then Geffen disappeared, at least from the immediate world of
television.
</P>
<P>
   But all the while he was working, refining his vision, scaling
it back in some ways and expanding it in others. The first result
will be on display Wednesday night at 8 on PBS, a
two-and-a-half-hour documentary that attempts to use contemporary
technological advances to recreate ancient Greece, down to a ride
on a trireme and a walk through the columns of the Parthenon.
</P>
<P>
   The program, ``The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization,'' is part
of the PBS series ``Empires.'' This is only one part of the
project, however. As Geffen described it, the goal is to ``use the
technology to make a seamless integration of television, computer,
book, videodisc, a whole range of platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the enhancements attached to the program, visitors to the
PBS Web site, www.pbs.org, can experience a three-dimensional
rendering of the Parthenon, an accompanying book by Paul Cartledge,
a Cambridge professor of classics who is one of the on-camera
academics. A digital videodisc will contain ``much more material, a
sort of virtual museum,'' Geffen said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unusual computer aid attached to the film is a
chance to take one's own tour of the Parthenon, by manipulating
from a home computer a camera permanently mounted on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The program itself is, by Geffen's description, an effort to
``bring the techniques of historical storytelling used by Ken Burns
to tell the story of `The Civil War' to pre-archival history.''
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to kinetic camera shots of static subjects, like
ancient Greek columns and friezes from the Acropolis, ``The
Greeks'' dabbles in computer animation, recreating Greek furniture,
writing and eating implements and most ambitiously the inside of an
intact Parthenon, from the first shaft of light from an open door
to a walk through the columns as they might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen said the film cost no more than a typical PBS
documentary, about $650,000 an hour. But beyond its technological
elements, it also includes the use of actors as stand-ins for Greek
figures like Pericles and Socrates (they are literally stand-ins;
they do not speak), an original score and narration read by Liam
Neeson.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, who had worked with Geffen on a documentary about
Jerusalem, said he took on the project because ``the films were of
such high quality.'' Besides, he said, ``it was a chance to learn
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Geffen, who said he recognized that American students rarely
study Greece anymore, said he chose to tell the story through
various Greek personalities as a way of making the story come
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The best way, of course, is by convincing viewers that they can
have some kind of three-dimensional experience of the ancient world
through these new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But Geffen also argued that the technologies need stories like
the one of ancient Greece. ``These big platforms need fabulous
stories like this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And fabulous storytellers can use the new platforms, he said.
``There has never been a more exciting time to be a storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those plans Geffen was hatching four years ago, he still
has many of them. ``The Romans may be down the road,'' he said. But
one idea that has been moved up is one close to Neeson's heart.
``Anthony and I have gone to PBS to talk about preparing a program
about the Celts,'' Neeson said. ``We've already started researching
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Dave
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, executive producer of ``Late Show With David
Letterman,'' announced last week that during its star's continued
convalescence from heart surgery, the show would try to repackage
some reruns of Letterman shows with new interviews. But Burnett
confessed at the time that he had no idea how these shows would
work or be received by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, at least from the evidence of the first edition,
with Julia Roberts chatting with Charles Grodin about her previous
appearances with Letterman, was a surprising success.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said he was ``really pleased with the quality'' of the
show and all but stunned by the audience reaction. The show with
Roberts attracted a 3.9 rating, the best for any ``Late Show'' on a
Monday night in three months. (Each rating point represents just
over one million households.)
</P>
<P>
   The show was especially strong in some big cities like New York
and Los Angeles. In both places it managed to beat the all-original
edition of the ``Tonight'' show.
</P>
<P>
   That did not hold nationally; Jay Leno's all-new ``Tonight''
show on NBC easily beat the ``Late Show'' on CBS. (The new ``Late
Show'' format has one interesting angle. It may be the first
attraction to justify those ``all-new'' promises heard in network
promotions. These shows are indeed only partly new.)
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia Wins
</P>
<P>
   In another testament to the power of nostalgia, the ABC movie
``Mary and Rhoda,'' which brought back Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie
Harper in the roles that made them the biggest comedy stars on
television in the 1970s was a huge hit with viewers on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Critical notices were heavily negative. But the movie drew
enough old fans of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' to stand as ABC's
highest-rated television Monday movie in a year. It attracted over
17 million viewers, the most of any show on Monday night.

&HT;     GOP AND DEMOCRATS MAP EFFORT TO OVERHAUL PRIMARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican and Democratic party leaders told state
election officials Tuesday that the presidential primary calendar
needs to be prolonged in 2004 to offset the disproportionate impact
of the early presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cole, executive director of the Republican party, and Peter
Kadzik, a counsel for the Democratic party, said the outsized
impact of Iowa's precinct caucuses on Jan. 24 and New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1 underscores the need to
enable larger, more representative states to have a more powerful
voice in the selection of party nominees for president.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complain that this year's compressed timetable dampens
voter participation, strengthens the hand of better known, better
financed candidates and short-circuits candidates' efforts to
recover from early setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Republican contenders have already been forced to drop out
due to money problems or poor results at the polls even though the
fourth GOP contest won't be held until Feb. 19 in South Carolina.
The casualties include former Vice President Dan Quayle, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, and former Cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The front-loaded primary schedule adopted by the two parties for
this year will apportion most of each party's convention delegates
by late March. By then, Republicans will have staged primaries or
caucuses in 32 states and the Democrats in 29 states.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, addressing a meeting of the National Association of
Secretaries of State, said the results of the early contests will
``accelerate and enhance'' efforts by the parties and state
election officials to stretch out the presidential primary calendar
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, calling the primary system ``broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There now is some concern that this whole thing is moving too
fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both officials said Iowa and New Hampshire should retain their
cherished spots at the front of the primary calendar to force
candidates to deal face to face with voters in the early contests.
But the officials said the impact of the two small states ought to
be mitigated by prolonging the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders are expected to meet in late February or early
March to design a revised primary calendar. Cole said the GOP
leadership might ask the Republican National Convention this summer
for broad authority to enable party leaders to deal directly with
the Democratic National Committee to make the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cole and Kadzik said proposed revisions in the primary
schedule for 2004 will await the selection of party nominees and
anticipated changes in leadership at each party's respective
Washington headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals being weighed by the parties include one endorsed by
state election officials last year to stage rotating regional
primaries every four years, featuring multi-state contests in the
Northeast, the South, the Midwest and the West. The order would
rotate every four years so that no one region had a lock on being
first.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal calls for a five-tiered system, with less
populous states holding contests first, followed successively by
larger states, with the most populous states such as New York,
California and Texas going last.

NO SIGN OF JOURNALIST WHO RUSSIANS SAY WAS TURNED OVER TO
CHECHENS 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Friends and colleagues of a Russian reporter for the
American-funded Radio Liberty have been making increasingly frantic
appeals for information about him five days after Russia announced
that it had handed him over to Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   They say they are increasingly dissatisfied with the
government's handling of the case and doubtful about whether they
are being told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Andrei Babitsky, was last heard from on Jan. 15,
when he called the Moscow bureau of Radio Liberty to say he was
heading out of Grozny, the Chechen capital, as Russian forces
pounded it into heaps of rubble and twisted metal.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Babitsky, 35, a veteran Russian combat
correspondent who spent much of the war reporting from behind
Chechen lines, was detained by federal forces. On Feb. 3, the
Russian authorities contend, he was exchanged _ allegedly at his
own request _ for Russian soldiers held prisoner by the Chechens.
But no news of him has emerged since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is that for a guy with as much experience as
Andrei, if he could have, he would have reached us by now,'' said
Jeff Trimble, director of broadcasting for Radio Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Looking weary and unshorn, Babitsky appeared last weekend on
Russian television screens in a choppy video said to have been
filmed by Russian security services on a muddy road somewhere in
Chechnya on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   In a closing shot, Babitsky, his back to the camera, is escorted
away, his arm held in a tight grip by a burly man in a black mask,
not the usual attire of Chechnya's field commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, silence. Or at least, silence on Babitsky's part.
Various branches of the Russian government keep issuing bits of
information, insisting that Babitsky is alive and that he is no
longer their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   On the Chechen side, a series of spokesmen, including Aslan
Maskhadov, the Chechen leader, have said that Babitsky is not being
held anywhere in Chechnya and that they know nothing about any
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila, interviewed Monday night on national
television, bit her lip as she described watching the video ``150
times,'' examining it for details about her husband's physical and
mental state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear what is happening to him,'' she said, fighting
back tears, as her interviewer ended the program, on a privately
owned station, with a somber plea to the Russian authorities to
come forward with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said that Babitsky
was ``safe and sound,'' and that his swap had been arranged by
Interior Ministry agents and sanctioned by the prosecutor general's
office.
</P>
<P>
   But Babitsky's colleagues see ominous signs in the handling of
his case. ``Imagine a state that takes its own citizen and delivers
him to the hands of armed men in masks,'' said Savik Shuster, the
Moscow bureau chief of Radio Liberty, interviewed on television.
``What kind of a state is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, a human rights activist who joined Radio Liberty ten
years ago, is well known to reporters who have covered both wars in
Chechnya for his fearless travels through a dangerous region,
sometimes with security provided by Chechen field commanders. To
the Russian military, which has tried to keep strict control over
reporters' access to the fighting in Chechnya, Babitsky was a bete
noire, whose reporting often flew in the face of the official
version of events.
</P>
<P>
   He was reportedly detained by troops loyal to Beslan Gantamirov,
a former mayor of Grozny who leads a pro-Moscow Chechen militia.
Babitsky was subsequently questioned by a local prosecutor's
office, allegedly on charges that he had collaborated with
``illegal bands.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Babitsky lawyers, Genrik Reznik, said Tuesday he was
ready to charge Russian authorities with having violated Babitsky's
rights during his detention. For the first 10 days, no one was even
informed that he had been detained, and even after that, he was
denied the right to telephone his family, or his lawyers, Reznik
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster said Tuesday that another Radio Liberty correspondent,
dispatched to Chechnya to find Babitsky, reported hearing from the
mother of a prisoner held in the same detention cell that Babitsky
was beaten and forced to sing loudly and for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The video has reassured Babitsky's colleagues that he was alive
on Feb. 2 or 3, since he was shown wearing a shirt that had been
delivered to him in a package together with food and other
clothing, through the local prosecutor's office, on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   What puzzled them was his statement, allegedly signed on Jan.
31, in which he offered to be exchanged for Russian soldiers held
by Chechen rebels. If there were a voluntary exchange, they ask,
why was he shown asking the cameraman to turn off the camera
instead of openly proclaiming his role in the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion has been further compounded by conflicting statements
by Russian officials who said Monday that five Russian soldiers had
been exchanged for Babitsky, though earlier they said it was two or
three.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, prosecutors who contend that they released
Babitsky last week from their custody on condition that he return
to Moscow and stay there, have called on him to return for more
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   During the first round of questioning, the local prosecutor may
have considered charging Babitsky with dealing in stolen icons.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Corti, director of Radio Liberty's Russian Service, said
that the Andrei Rublyov museum in Moscow called the radio station
to say that it had been asked to check the value of an icon
allegedly seized from Babitsky. But, Corti said, the icon was
valued at 10 rubles _ 40 cents _ and no such charge has surfaced
again.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   High-level Russian officials say that acting President Vladimir
Putin has monitored the case practically from the beginning,
although he has made no public comments about it.
</P>
<P>
   Reznik, the lawyer, said Tuesday that the case will test
Russia's commitment to press freedom. ``The authorities have been
telling society, we will defend you from terrorism, but on the
condition that you forget about human rights,'' said Reznik.
</P>
<P>
   Top Russian security officials have already stepped up public
warnings about anti-Russian propaganda campaigns, which they say
are funded by a $1.5 billion bank account set up by pro-Chechen
Arabs. They have also made veiled attacks against Radio Liberty,
one of the foreign radio ``voices'' that were jammed by government
interceptors in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Russians were to try to organize, with 100 percent
Russian capital, an information agency there that challenges State
Department or U.S policies,'' said Alexsandr Zdanovich, spokesman
for the Federal Security Service, one of the successor agencies for
the KGB ``This is a very serious moment, and one that cannot be let
go by the security organs.''

BRITISH AUTHORITIES SPECULATE THAT HIJACKERS MAY WANT ASYLUM
</HEADLINE>

   STANSTED, England _ More than 150 passengers spent their third
night aboard a hijacked Afghan airliner Tuesday, held prisoner by
an armed gang who perplexed police by giving no explanation for
their seizure of the plane or making any political demands.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the continuous negotiations might succeed in coaxing
the hijackers to let more passengers off the plane produced only
one release Tuesday, following the eight freed from the Afghan
state-owned Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 on Monday. The man released
was described as a 45-year-old suffering from asthma who had
complained of feeling ill.
</P>
<P>
   He was the 28th passenger to be released at various stops since
the plane was seized minutes after taking off on a domestic flight
from the Afghan capital, Kabul, early Sunday and forced to fly
across Central Asia and Russia to Stansted, where the plane landed
early Monday. A total of 156 people, including 21 children, 17
women, 14 crew members and as many as 10 hijackers were still on
the blue-and-white airliner parked at the end of a remote airstrip
next to a hangar and a perimeter fence at this airport east of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Chief Constable John Broughton expressed the
possibility that the men, all of whom speak English, may have come
to Britain in an attempt to secure asylum. Asked to comment,
Broughton said only, ``In talking around the issues, there are a
lot of things raised.''
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified representative from the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees arrived Tuesday night at the airport. Another
assistant chief constable, Joe Edwards, described the visitor as an
``observer offering background.'' Asked whether her presence came
in response to asylum requests, Edwards said the subject was too
``sensitive'' for him to elaborate on.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office confirmed Tuesday that all six Iraqis who
hijacked a Sudanese Airbus in 1996 in Britain's last hijack drama
are now living in this country as asylum seekers, drawing benefits
and receiving legal aid. They held 197 passengers and crew members
hostage on a flight from Sudan to Jordan that they forced to come
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis were tried, convicted and jailed for terms ranging
from five to nine years, but they were cleared in 1998 after an
appeals court ruled that the trial judge had erred in preventing
the jury from considering their defense that as opponents of Saddam
Hussein they were acting out of ``necessity.'' The men asserted
that they had taken action in a desperate effort to gain asylum in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign citizens convicted of crimes in Britain are usually
deported, but these men escaped that fate under another law that
obliges Britain to consider any asylum claim once criminal
proceedings are completed. Another hijacker, Yassin Membar, gained
asylum after serving two years of a three-year sentence for seizing
an Air Tanzania flight in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers coming
to Britain, with refugee status being granted in about a third of
the cases. An average of 360 applications a month have been made by
Afghans since October.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the speculation that asylum might be the goal of the
current hijackers was the fact that after nearly 40 hours of almost
nonstop discussions, the gunmen still had made no political
demands. ``There have been no specific requests other than for
food, water and medication _ what we would term housekeeping
requirements,'' Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the point, an Essex police spokesman said, ``We are
not being evasive. There have been no specific demands.'' The
police have not corroborated a report from the Pakistan-based
Afghan Islamic Press that the hijackers had taken their action to
free Ismail Khan, 58, an Afghan opposition figure who was jailed in
1997 by the fundamentalist Taliban movement, which rules most of
the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Broughton said the hostages appeared to be well treated, but
added that conditions on the plane, even with the steady resupply
of water, food and air-conditioning and the removal of trash and
sewage, had to be trying. ``Conditions must be very difficult,'' he
said, ``but we are told the atmosphere is calm and that the
negotiations are businesslike.''
</P>
<P>
   Although camouflaged marksmen and commandos have been deployed
around the airport, the emphasis remains on maintaining calm and
keeping the conversation going.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban government urged the British to storm the plane, but
officials here say that will become an option only if the hijackers
threaten the safety of their captives.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators hope to persuade the captors to release increasing
numbers of people from the plane. The Taliban movement Tuesday
confirmed that among the passengers, all of whom are Afghans, are
four members of the government, but it said they were not high
ranking.

SELIG TO ATTEND ROCKER'S HEARING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baseball's commissioner, Bud Selig, and the player he
punished with the stiffest penalty for speech in baseball history
will come face to face Wednesday as the players association tries
to have John Rocker's 73-day suspension overturned or, at the
least, reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Selig and Rocker both plan to be present when Shyam Das,
baseball's impartial arbitrator, begins what is expected to be a
two-day hearing on the grievance the union filed on the relief
pitcher's behalf after Selig suspended him and fined him $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner reacted to Rocker's disparaging remarks in a
magazine article published in December. In the article, the Atlanta
closer, expanding on his feelings about Mets fans, made venomous
comments about many segments of society.
</P>
<P>
   His words drew quick condemnation from many circles, including
his own teammates, Atlanta season ticket holders and companies the
Braves do business with. It is the negative impact on business the
team says it has suffered because of Rocker's remarks that is
expected to be the basis of a major part of management's argument
against the union's grievance.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after Selig's action, Stan Kasten, the
Braves' president, was quick to cite problems the club had already
encountered. ``It has been difficult for us businesswise,'' Kasten
said, ``because all of these people had strong feelings. It's been
difficult for the sales department, the promotions department, the
community relations department.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the problems that he said have arisen for the
Braves, a baseball official said: ``The depth of feeling in the
community is just unbelievable. I think it's way worse than they
thought it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Management lawyers are also expected to argue that Rocker's
remarks have created a security problem for the Braves, putting
their players in possible peril both in Atlanta and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers will also cite cases in other industries where employees
have been penalized for speech. One involved a Baltimore transit
employee who was fired for a speech he made at a Ku Klux Klan
rally.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the union contends that Selig's penalty was
excessive. Previous arbitrators have overturned or reduced
commissioners' suspensions on the grounds they were excessive,
though none involved a player's comments.

CLINTON SENDS HIGH-POWERED SALES FORCE TO PUSH BUDGET ON CAPITOL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials fanned out across
Capitol Hill on Tuesday to sell the merits of the president's
budget plan, but found no takers among the Republican majority in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the Senate Finance
Committee that President Clinton's plan to eliminate the portion of
the national debt held by the public would be the equivalent of a
tax cut by pushing interest rates lower.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's Office of
Management and Budget, said Congress should adopt a restrained
estimate of future budget surpluses, as Clinton has. To construct a
surplus estimate just to allow for the bigger tax cut that
Republicans want, he told the House Budget Committee, would risk a
return to budget deficits and imperil efforts to assure Social
Security's long-term solvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's budget relies on realistic assumptions and
reflects balanced priorities,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials, including Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen, also
appeared before congressional committees to make a case for the
budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that Clinton's budget called for too much
spending and too little in tax cuts and missed an opportunity to
use the surplus to overhaul Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They said they planned to press ahead with a tax and spending
plan of their own, starting with a vote in the House on Thursday on
a tax cut for married couples. The tax reduction, the first in a
series that the Republicans plan to bring up this year, amounts to
$182 billion over 10 years, four times bigger than a similar
administration proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget puts the surplus outside of Social Security at
$746 billion over 10 years. Republicans are developing some
alternatives that would be hundreds of billions of dollars higher.

AFL-CIO GIVES $500,000 TO AID TEAMSTER ' S STRIKE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the AFL-CIO pledged Tuesday to give $500,000
to the Teamsters union to help strengthen its hand in a 16-week-old
strike against the Overnite Transportation Corp., one of the
nation's largest nonunion trucking companies.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, John J. Sweeney, president
of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations, announced the $500,000 grant, while James P. Hoffa,
the Teamsters' president, vowed to step up efforts to put pressure
on Overnite to grant union recognition and sign a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said the Teamsters would increase efforts to persuade
Overnite's customers to use other carriers, begin a broadcast
campaign to rally public support and apply pressure to board
members of the Union Pacific Corp., Overnite's parent compnay. The
union is already urging consumers to boycott one of Overnite's main
customers, Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond, which says it is an innocent party
that should not be dragged into the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   For the union and the labor federation, the strike and the
effort to unionize the company's 8,200 drivers and dock workers
have taken on high stakes, becoming the longest strike in decades
in the Teamsters' freight division, which has long symbolized the
union's might.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has sought to
organize Overnite's workers for five years and has accused the
company of more than 1,000 labor law violations, including firing
workers because they supported unionization.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said, ``Overnite continues to use illegal and immoral
tactics to block its workers' freedom to choose to join a union.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Rosenfeld, Overnite's communications director, insisted that
the company has not violated labor laws. The two sides are
scheduled to resume negotiations Wednesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials said that about 1,800 Overnite workers were
on strike and that the walkout was responsible for Overnite's
reporting a loss in the fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said Overnite's shipments were down about 9 percent
but that the strike was having a minimal effect on daily
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially it's having an effect on the company, without a
doubt,'' he said. But he added, ``The fact that almost 95 percent
of the people who are employed by this company are coming to work
everyday is proof that the people agree this is a good company to
work for.''
</P>
<P>
   The union says it represents 3,600 workers at 37 of Overnite's
166 terminals. But the company says that because of legal
challenges, the union represents only 1,800 workers at 22
terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts said Sweeney's support for the Teamsters' strike
was helping to alleviate tensions between him and Hoffa. Even
though AFL-CIO officials are not supposed to meddle in internal
union elections, Sweeney and the federation's secretary-treasurer,
Richard Trumka, had backed the Teamsters' former president, Ron
Carey, when he ran against Hoffa in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Carey's victory was overturned because aides had illegally
channeled union money into his campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Are movie stars true pet owners?'' asks  &UR; Ian Shoales &LR;  in the
latest issue of the Berkeley Bark. ``Can movie stars handle the
trauma inherent in dog ownership? ... Do they walk their dogs
themselves, or do they hire Latin women in nurse uniforms to do
that for them? ... Perhaps celebrities have their own dog parks,
with imported grass and $50 silk dog-doo bags from Neiman Marcus?''
</P>
<P>
   Shoales refers to  &UR; Bash Dibra &LR; , an expert who bills himself as
dog trainer to the stars, including  &UR; Mariah Carey &LR; ,  &UR; Kim Basinger &LR; ,
 &UR; Matthew Broderick &LR; ,  &UR; Sarah Jessica Parker &LR; ,  &UR; LaToya Jackson &LR;  and
 &UR; Henry Kissinger &LR;  (do the last two discuss biting and barking in the
trainer's waiting room?).
</P>
<P>
   Dibra, who was born in Albania and spent time in a prison camp
there, says he charmed guard dogs to escape. Such experience has
proved handy: ``I educate the owner to think like a dog.'' Dibra
has lived in the United States for 30 years; he charges as much as
$1,000 an hour for his services.
</P>
<P>
   His two books, says his Web site, fill a pressing need:
``Unfortunately, his services are very much in demand by
celebrities, CEOs and heads of state _ and a man can be in only one
place at one time. Up until just lately, those of us who couldn't
afford or manage to schedule private sessions with Dibra have been
lucky enough to have his two books ... to use as reference guides.
Now, mercifully, there is also a videotape.''

   _ Yale scholars' study of bad hair days has met its match. A

nearly 75 percent of women want a good-looking mate. In 1958, a

   &UR; Steve &LR;  and  &UR; Cokie Roberts &LR; , successful journalists married for
33 years, share the secrets of their relationship _ or, in another
light, cash in in another field _ in a new book, ``From This Day
Forward'' (William Morrow; $24). Highly sugary marriage advice from
the duo is included in the latest issue of Town &AMP; Country:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a deal about flowers,'' the couple's first-person
account begins. ``Steve plants them, weeds them and keeps them
watered; Cokie picks them, arranges them and places them around the
house.'' (Analysis: He thinks flower arranging's for sissies; she
doesn't want to get her hands dirty.) ``Every day, find a way to
say, `I love you.' '' (Such as, ``The dryer isn't drying and my
socks are still damp, and I love you anyway.'')
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pair's busy schedules _ Cokie has been criticized
for moonlighting from her TV duties by speechifying to
special-interest groups she covers _ they always try ``to make time
for each other.'' They each ask each other, ``What can I get you?''
They remember to tell each other, ``You look nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve likes to go to baseball games with his buddies; Cokie
likes to attend church, or to lunch with old friends. If Steve is
stopping for a beer with his students after class, Cokie might drop
by a new mother's hospital room or attend a new author's book
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everything can be perfect. ``We often joke that
the success of a marriage can be measured by the number of teeth
marks in your tongue.'' (Translation: ``I deserve a medal for not
telling you what I think of you.'')

THE CELEBRITY DOG DILEMMA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Are movie stars true pet owners?'' asks  &UR; Ian Shoales &LR;  in the
latest issue of the Berkeley Bark. ``Can movie stars handle the
trauma inherent in dog ownership? ... Do they walk their dogs
themselves, or do they hire Latin women in nurse uniforms to do
that for them? ... Perhaps celebrities have their own dog parks,
with imported grass and $50 silk dog-doo bags from Neiman Marcus?''
</P>
<P>
   Shoales refers to  &UR; Bash Dibra &LR; , an expert who bills himself as
dog trainer to the stars, including  &UR; Mariah Carey &LR; ,  &UR; Kim Basinger &LR; ,
 &UR; Matthew Broderick &LR; ,  &UR; Sarah Jessica Parker &LR; ,  &UR; LaToya Jackson &LR;  and
 &UR; Henry Kissinger &LR;  (do the last two discuss biting and barking in the
trainer's waiting room?).
</P>
<P>
   Dibra, who was born in Albania and spent time in a prison camp
there, says he charmed guard dogs to escape. Such experience has
proved handy: ``I educate the owner to think like a dog.'' Dibra
has lived in the United States for 30 years; he charges as much as
$1,000 an hour for his services.
</P>
<P>
   His two books, says his Web site, fill a pressing need:
``Unfortunately, his services are very much in demand by
celebrities, CEOs and heads of state _ and a man can be in only one
place at one time. Up until just lately, those of us who couldn't
afford or manage to schedule private sessions with Dibra have been
lucky enough to have his two books ... to use as reference guides.
Now, mercifully, there is also a videotape.''

   &UR; SCHOLARLY PURSUITS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Yale scholars' study of bad hair days has met its match. A
study at UC Berkeley, reported in Allure magazine, found that
nearly 75 percent of women want a good-looking mate. In 1958, a
study had found, only 33 percent said that was important.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1993 study cited in Fitness magazine found ``that women who
rode on an exercise bike at 70 percent of their maximum heart rate

   &UR; KNOW-IT-ALL MARRIAGE ADVICE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Steve &LR;  and  &UR; Cokie Roberts &LR; , successful journalists married for
33 years, share the secrets of their relationship _ or, in another
light, cash in in another field _ in a new book, ``From This Day
Forward'' (William Morrow; $24). Highly sugary marriage advice from
the duo is included in the latest issue of Town &AMP; Country:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a deal about flowers,'' the couple's first-person
account begins. ``Steve plants them, weeds them and keeps them
watered; Cokie picks them, arranges them and places them around the
house.'' (Analysis: He thinks flower arranging's for sissies; she
doesn't want to get her hands dirty.) ``Every day, find a way to
say, `I love you.' '' (Such as, ``The dryer isn't drying and my
socks are still damp, and I love you anyway.'')
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pair's busy schedules _ Cokie has been criticized
for moonlighting from her TV duties by speechifying to
special-interest groups she covers _ they always try ``to make time
for each other.'' They each ask each other, ``What can I get you?''
They remember to tell each other, ``You look nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve likes to go to baseball games with his buddies; Cokie
likes to attend church, or to lunch with old friends. If Steve is
stopping for a beer with his students after class, Cokie might drop
by a new mother's hospital room or attend a new author's book
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everything can be perfect. ``We often joke that
the success of a marriage can be measured by the number of teeth
marks in your tongue.'' (Translation: ``I deserve a medal for not
telling you what I think of you.'')
</P>

   &UR; FLASH &LR;

MCCAIN VOWS TO FIGHT CRIME AS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Having chosen to forgo its primary, Senator
John S. McCain didn't have to stump for votes in Delaware Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he took advantage of his morning alone in South
Carolina to deliver a speech on his crime policies to students at
the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy. McCain lambasted the
Clinton administration for what he said was its abdication of its
responsibilities in the war on drugs, and he called for a national
program in which veterans would mentor troubled teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime is not a price we pay for freedom,'' McCain said. ``It
is freedom's enemy. And, as president, I will fight that enemy with
every fiber of my being.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to fight a different kind of war Tuesday, with
Texas Governor George W. Bush. The two have been wrangling for
days, via surrogates and in television advertisements, over whose
tax policy is better for the nation, who was more like President
Bill Clinton, and who went negative first.
</P>
<P>
   But that battle was not in evidence at the academy, where a few
hundred brown-uniformed students sat politely for McCain's prepared
speech, which he delivered without opening jokes or closing
questions, which made it a rare occasion for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, McCain pledged to provide police forces with more
resources and personnel. He proposed that most assets seized in
federal arrests be kept in crime- and drug-plagued communities to
aid them with prevention efforts. He urged a strong, uniform
ratings system for all kinds of entertainment be introduced to help
parents keep their children away from violent content. And he said,
as he often has, that computers in public libraries should be
strictly controlled to prevent children from accessing violent or
pornographic Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But he reserved most of his remarks for the war on drugs, from
which, he said, ``the Clinton administration has been AWOL.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bully pulpit is vacant,'' McCain said. ``The Oval office
is merely an echo chamber when it comes to the drug issue. What
does it say to brave American heroes working to protect our kids
from drug pushers when the vice president responds to the question
of whether he inhaled by saying `as deeply as I could?' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain called for a redoubled commitment to Nancy Reagan's
``Just Say No'' campaign, a reassessment of the drug budget to
focus attention on rural areas, where he said the problems of crime
and addiction had been neglected, and he stressed the importance of
treatment programs for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, McCain proposed that part of his war on
drugs be fought by veterans, ``a great and untapped national
resource.'' He proposed that they become part of a national program
to mentor troubled teenagers, and teach them ``discipline, civic
responsibility, integrity and character.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said the nation's drug policy should be bound up
with foreign policy, that the United States should help nations
like Colombia rid themsleves of drug lords ``who mix their criminal
activity with Marxist ideology.'' He said US military assistance
may be necessary in such efforts.

BILL INTRODUCED TO RESTORE BRITISH RULE IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson introduced a
bill in Parliament on Tuesday that could bring the province back
under direct rule from London by Friday unless there is movement on
guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still hope it will prove unnecessary to implement it,''
Mandelson told the House of Commons, ``but that depends on changes,
developments which have not yet taken place, but which would need
to take place speedily and certainly over the next two or three
days.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little optimism that the Irish Republican Army would
agree to start dismantling its arsenal _ the one development that
could prevent the shutdown of the two-month-old power-sharing
government in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm,
said the prospect of a return to direct rule was the greatest
threat yet to the Northern Ireland peace pact and would deepen the
quandary over weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspending the institutions will not resolve the arms issue,''
he said after talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is acting to suspend the fledging government, Mandelson
said, to forestall it's being irretrievably damaged by the
resignation of David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist party,
who is the first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly. In
taking his party into the government with Sinn Fein in November and
dropping the unionist insistence that there be guerrilla
disarmament first, Trimble signed a post-dated resignation letter
that the party could accept if the IRA had not produced any weapons
by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble meets with his party council in Belfast on Saturday, and
the British action is designed to save him from certain removal as
head of the government and the party. His potential successors are
far less committed to sharing power.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, usually a figure of steely determination, said he was so
discouraged by the outlook that he was thinking of abandoning
politics. ``I don't intend to spend the rest of my life trying to
shore up a process that is going to be in perpetual crisis,'' he
told the BBC Tuesday night. He said he felt like ``a messenger who
continually gets shot.''

S.C. DEMOCRATIC CHIEF ASKS BRADLEY TO BOW OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The Bradley campaign was taken aback Tuesday by
a request from the head of South Carolina's Democratic Party for
Bradley to withdraw from the race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The party chairman, Richard A. Harpootlian, asserted in a letter
to Bill Bradley that the former New Jersey senator should step
aside to spare Vice President Al Gore from damage that could cost
Gore the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is time for you to pass the ball to the vice
president, who has the opportunity to make the game-winning
basket,'' Harpootlian said in one of several metaphorical
references to Bradley's Hall of Fame basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   Harpootlian, who says he has not endorsed either candidate,
argued that Gore holds an insurmountable lead. Not so, said
Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, who asserted that Bradley has
been ``picking up steam'' since his four-point loss in New
Hampshire and that Gore is unelectable in the fall because of his
role in the 1996 fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not dropping out,'' he said. ``Voters get to
decide elections, not party chairmen.''
</P>
<P>
   During a speech at Benedict College Tuesday, Bradley accused the
top Republican presidential candidates of opting to ``bottom-fish''
for right-wing votes by failing to repudiate South Carolina's
confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley's foray into the flag debate was aimed in part at
siphoning off Gore's minority support, he seized the moment to
launch one of the most searing attacks yet by either Democratic
contender against the GOP frontrunners.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when leadership, courage, and principle should guide
our leaders on this issue, both George Bush and John McCain have
instead embraced the narrow political expediency of the Republican
party,'' Bradley said in a speech to several hundred students,
staff members, and community leaders. ``It's an expediency that
ignores a hateful and shameful past in an effort to bottom-fish for
votes from the most right-wing element of the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain have not taken a position on South Carolina's
use of the confederate flag as a state emblem, calling the
controversy a state issue. Both Bradley and Gore have called the
flag a racially divisive symbol of slavery and segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flag shows the true colors of the Republicans who want to
be president,'' Bradley told the audience at the historically black
college. ``The weakness and passivity of the Republicans on this
issue is appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before receiving Harpootlian's request to bow out of the
race, Bradley's staff had vowed to step up attacks on Gore. On
Monday, Gore renewed his criticism of Bradley's decision not to
seek reelection to the Senate in 1996. Gore said Bradley chose to
quit rather than fight the Republican majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's camp said Bradley's decision was not linked to the
GOP's control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the vice president has returned to a reckless
disregard for the truth,'' Hauser said. ``It is somewhat alarming
that day after day after day he continues to not be truthful on
matters that relate to the campaign, to his record and our
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauser added, ``That is a point that we will make with more
emphasis in the days ahead.''

 &HT;    Tommy's look bonny: His new fall fad is plaid
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK, N.Y. _ Last fall at Madison Square Garden, Tommy
Hilfiger tapped the band Bush to accompany a flag-waving parade of
country-fried American sportswear. Cowboy boots here, Western
shirts there, British band onstage.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at the historic Roseland Ballroom, Hilfiger opted for
a medley of home-grown music (the Doors, the Cars, Jefferson
Airplane) to herald clothes inspired by a recent trip to the
British Isles, asking the musical question, ``Don't you want some
tartan to love?''
</P>
<P>
   Plaid-lined white leather jackets. Beaded plaid trimmed a black
chiffon gown. Preppy plaid pants and skirts paired up with red
cashmere cardigans and turtlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   There were refrains of Hilfiger's perennial passion for rock 'n'
roll: navy, metallic leather jackets and suede tiger-print pants.
</P>
<P>
   In short, pieces from Hilfiger's ``high-octane Ivy League''
collection could be worn by either Debbie Harry in her Blondie
heyday or the buttoned-down attorney played by Angie Harmon on Law
and Order.
</P>
<P>
   Both celebs sized up the show from the front row, and Harmon
even videotaped the proceedings so she could shop from home.
</P>
<P>
   What tune puts Harry Connick Jr. in the mood for Valentine's
Day?
</P>
<P>
   The crooner says his favorite love song of the moment is With a
Song in My Heart, the Rodgers and Hart standard. ``You know how you
get tired of songs after a while? It's one I rediscovered not too
long ago, and it's still fresh in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black turtleneck and black leather jacket, Connick
attended the Hilfiger show with equally gorgeous wife Jill
Goodacre, ex-Victoria's Secret model.
</P>
<P>
   Many models are walking like Egyptians, with dark, exaggerated
liner that extends from the outer corners of their eyes onto their
temples, Nefertiti-style. The lookers at Luca Luca sported it, as
did Catherine Malandrino's mannequins (courtesy of usually
toned-down Bobbi Brown).
</P>
<P>
   Lena Koro of Nars created a similar raccoon eye at Badgley
Mischka, applying deep burgundy, dark green or midnight blue to the
models' lids (and beyond) before dusting them with glitter.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean Cleopatra's way with kohl is making cosmetic
news, again?
</P>
<P>
   Nah, says Koro. ``There is nothing new. Everything has been done
already, but I think it is a little cooler, a little edgier.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly more flattering than the eyes at DKNY, which were
thickly lined on both upper and lower lids in _ are you ready for
this? _ lime green.

CHINA INTERCEPTS FOREIGN DONATIONS TO FAMILIES OF TIANANMEN
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Minn.)   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Calling such aid a threat to national security, the
police have blocked a messenger from delivering $25,000 in foreign
donations to help the families of people who were killed in the
crackdown on the Tiananmen student democracy movement in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The messenger, Lu Wenhe, a Chinese citizen who has lived in the
United States for 20 years, was detained in Beijing in late
December while on his way to meet a woman whose 17-year-old son was
shot dead by soldiers in 1989. After three days of questioning in
which his passport was confiscated and he was threatened with
prison, Lu disclosed the purpose of his visit.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken under police escort to Shanghai, where he has
relatives, and told that he could leave the country on the unusual
condition that he sign over the donations, which were in an account
in the United States, to an officer of the Shanghai State Security
Bureau, Lu said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Under duress, he wrote checks for the entire amount to the
officer, Chen Jian. But because the police suspected that he might
have the payment stopped after he had left the country, they
pressured his 78-year-old father in Shanghai into agreeing to
guarantee the payment. Lu returned to the United States on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Donors in the United States did block payment on the check. And
now the authorities are pressuring Lu's parents, who were not
politically involved, to come up with the money or risk losing
their apartment and car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extortion,'' Lu said by telephone from Lynchburg, Va.,
where he is an actuary.
</P>
<P>
   Lu said he had been prepared to face questioning over his
delivery of money for Tiananmen Square victims, a politically
sensitive issue here. ``But when they demanded the money, I was
dumbfounded,'' Lu said. ``It's not my money. It's donations, and
for families who badly need support.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu had planned to transfer money from three sources. Ten
thousand dollars had been raised by the Independent Federation of
Chinese Students and Scholars, a group in Washington that was
formed after the crackdown; Lu is an officer of the group. An
additional $5,000 was from the Minnesota Chinese Democracy
Foundation, also a Chinese student group.
</P>
<P>
   The largest share, $10,519, was from a human rights award given
by the Alexander Langer Foundation in Italy to Ding Zilin, a
professor here who is the chief organizer of the family aid program
and the woman whom Lu was going to meet when he was detained.
</P>
<P>
   Ding, who has been a vociferous government government since her
son was killed, is under tight scrutiny. The Langer Foundation had
given her award to a group in New York, Human Rights in China, that
had hoped to forward the money with Lu.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Human Rights in China provided details of Lu's detention, saying
the Chinese authorities had engaged in ``gross abuse of the vaguely
defined concept of state security.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Ding has angered authorities by petitioning legal
agencies here and abroad to hold Chinese leaders accountable for
the killings of hundreds of demonstrators and bystanders that June.
</P>
<P>
   She, along with others, has channeled aid money to victims'
families, many of which have suffered financial difficulties. In
some cases, men who were family breadwinners were killed in 1989,
and in other families, parents lost children who could be assisting
them in old age.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Ding said that last year the group
distributed $20,000 to more than 100 families, with the amounts
varying by need. Losing the $25,000 was a serious setback, she
said, but the group has money it is distributing now.
</P>
<P>
   Ding said officials began harassing the aid operation in 1998,
when the authorities froze money sent from Germany. She said she
believed that the new pressures were ``a kind of revenge'' for her
relentless criticism of officials who oversaw the 1989 crackdown,
including Prime Minister Li Peng, who remains No. 2 in the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lu said security agents had told him that since the donations
had passed through ``hostile'' foreign organizations, by delivering
them he was ``endangering state security'' and could be sentenced
to at least four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've done is totally illegal,'' Ding said. ``They've
invaded my private correspondence and tried to take money sent to
me. This case shows that despite all the fine talk about `rule of
law,' the authorities remain completely unconstrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the money. It's also supposed to be a source of
emotional support for the families. It's a sign that people remain
concerned about their suffering and grief.''

 &HT;    Last bonfire victim transferred
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The last hospitalized victim of the
Aggie bonfire's deadly collapse was transferred Tuesday to a Dallas
hospital, able to speak and smile but still listed in serious
condition from the crushing injuries that nearly killed him.
</P>
<P>
   John Comstock, 19, left College Station Medical Center about 10:
30 a.m. enroute by ambulance to the rehabilitation unit of Zale
Lipshy University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a university attorney said Texas A&AMP;M will hire
consultants who were demanding the school guarantee expenses in
case of future litigation _ a practice generally forbidden by state
law _ by paying for indemnity insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Comstock was the last of the 27 victims pulled from beneath the
pile of collapsed logs. A resident of Richardson, the Texas A&AMP;M
University biotech major had been in the intensive care unit for 83
days.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven A&AMP;M students and one former student were killed in the
Nov. 18 collapse. A cause remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in good spirits. He was glad to be going home,'' said
Joe Buser, the hospital's marketing director who was among the
cadre of medical workers who saw Comstock off. ``He had been asking
when he would be able to go home and I think he was pretty
overwhelmed that his transfer was official.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the hospital said Comstock left on a
gurney with his mother at his side. When asked how he felt,
Comstock replied, ``This has been a long road already. I am looking
forward to getting well and being back at Texas A&AMP;M in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving with him, hospital officials said, were some of the
hundreds of cards and notes that had flooded the hospital since he
was admitted. Among those Comstock had received in recent weeks,
they said, were many from Austin residents _ including graduates of
rival University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This went much deeper than a football rivalry,'' Buser said.
``Our community here has been moved by the expressions of concern
from Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Graham, the hospital's director of pastoral care, recalled
delivering Comstock mail that included prayer notes from Austin
churches, even drawings and get-well cards from Texas school
children. When he was brought by ambulance to the College Station
hospital after the collapse, officials listed his condition as
critical, suffering from an array of life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since, he had undergone a series of surgeries, said
Dr. Joseph Fedorchik, the lead physician treating Comstock.
Infected tissue was removed from his stomach, and part of one leg
was amputated, friends reported.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26 was Comstock's condition upgraded to serious,
hospital officials said, after he no longer needed respiratory
support.
</P>
<P>
   The probe into the cause of the collapse, meanwhile, moved
forward with the signing of a number of contracts with independent
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   There had been questions about whether A&AMP;M could even hire these
consultants based on the demands by the consultants that they be
indemnified in case they were called to testify in future court
cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Genevieve Stubbs, A&AMP;M's senior associate general counsel,
said the consultants can bill the university for indemnity
insurance a part of expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The commission overseeing the investigation said on its Web site
that the ``commission should be prepared to request additional
funds from the university'' because the initial allocation of $1
million will be inadequate. They also said the March 31 deadline is
``aggressive'' and will be difficult to meet.

`ANDRO' DANGERS CITED IN HARVARD STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An over-the-counter supplement called ``andro,'' made popular
when baseball slugger Mark McGwire admitted using it in 1998,
raises testosterone and estrogen above normal levels and could be
dangerous, according to a Harvard study financed by Major League
Baseball and its players union. However, hormone levels receded
after its use was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, is the first to conclude that high doses of
the steroid hormone can elevate testosterone levels. However, the
trial lasted just one week, and did not measure whether the dietary
supplement can do what its producers say it can: increase muscle
size and mass. Nor did the study conclude whether the supplement
has long-term side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is naturally produced in both men and women, and
converts to either testosterone or to an estrogen. Testosterone is
the body's major muscle builder.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, legal and sold over-the-counter, is banned by the
International Olympic Committee, the National Football League and
the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Major League
Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National
Hockey League has no restriction regarding its use.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about andro, which became available in the
United States several years ago even though it was developed in the
1970s by the East Germans to enhance their athletes' Olympic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Z. Leder, an endocrinologist at the
Harvard-affliated Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who led
the study, said men showed increased testosterone levels when andro
was taken for seven days in a single daily 300 milligram dose. On
the Internet, pills available are in doses of 50 to 300 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   The 42 subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups
and received either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg
daily. In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood
increased by an average of 34 percent by the seventh day, though
levels had returned to normal by the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased
hormone levels, Leder noted that long-term increases in
testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects include stunted growth for young people, increased
aggressiveness, and lower levels of ``good'' cholesterol, which
could increase risk of heart disease. Men with elevated estrogen
levels sometimes grow breasts and suffer shrunken testicles, while
women with elevated testosterone can develop masculine traits, such
as deepening of voice and extra hair.
</P>
<P>
   In a eight-week study by Douglas King at Iowa State University
published in JAMA last June, King found that andro caused none of
the expected increases in blood levels of testosterone and no
enhanced strength. However, the 300 mg dosages were given in 100 mg
increments three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Leder said that their study also found that 100 milligrams is
too small a dose to increase testosterone levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to take it,'' said King,
associate professor of health and human performance at Iowa State.
And King warned that because the testosterone levels do not stay
elevated for very long, people may take it several times a day to
keep levels elevated, which could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Major League Baseball does not plan to change its
policy. ``That androstenedione, when taken in higher than suggested
doses, elevates testosterone levels, appears to be a significant
contribution to the science surrounding its use,'' said Baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig. But he and Don Fehr, director of the
players union, said that more research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals has said that he has
since stopped using the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the professional sports leagues are still waiting
for more data, their team doctors have come out against the
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Professional Team Physicians, an organization
comprised of team physicians of the NBA, NHL, MLB, and NFL said in
1998 that it recommended androstenedione be taken off the consumer
market, reclassified as a controlled substance available only by
prescription, and it urged the drug be banned from competitive
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study fortifies our position,'' said Dr. William Straw,
who is the team physician for the San Jose Sharks, a National
Hockey League team, and was the team physician for baseball's San
Francisco Giants for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a medical point of view, the study justifies physicians'
concern that andro is potentially harmful, like any other anabolic
steroid,'' said Straw. ``By its chemical composition, it is an
anabolic steroid.''
</P>
<P>
   Straw criticized drug deregulation laws in 1994 for allowing
such easy access to supplements like andro. ``These things are out
of control,'' said Straw.
</P>
<P>
   John Brennan, spokesman of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, said the federal government is studying if androstenedione
``fits all the elements of a steroid, which is a banned
substance.'' If andro does, then it would probably be reclassified
so that it could not be taken without a doctor's prescription, said
Brennan.

TWO MORE STATES RUSH TO HALT EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN WALLACE-WELLS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of last week's decision by Illinois Governor George
Ryan to suspend all executions in his state, saying they were
arbitrary and unjust, legislators in two other states rushed to
introduce new moratoriums on the death penalty, bringing to five
the number of states now considering similar bills.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's decision sparked a renewed vigor in the nationwide
movement to establish moratoriums and also to abolish the death
penalty outright in several more of the 37 other states whose
statutes still support capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six governors of death-penalty states contacted by The
Boston Globe this week, including New Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen
and Connecticut's John Rowland, pointedly declined to follow Ryan's
lead, vowing to stamp out any new abolition movements in their
states. And activists on both sides of the debate agree that there
are unlikely to be any immediate legislative changes.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the death-penalty, who have watched support for
capital punishment soar in the two decades since it was restored by
the US Supreme Court, say Ryan's move may have substantial
long-term effects. They say it shows that people who had not
opposed the death penalty on moral grounds may be conceding that
the practices by which it is put in place are unjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Ryan's decision confirms the direction we're headed
in this country, not necessarily that people are opposed to the
death penalty but that Americans don't like injustice and
arbitrariness when we're talking about matters of life and death,''
said the Reverand Jeffrey Garris, the Executive Director of
Pennsylvania Abolitionists.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of failing to convince the American public that
the death penalty is morally wrong, Garris and others are putting
more emphasis on the argument that the death penalty is
functionally flawed _ that it condemns innocent men to a penalty
that cannot be overturned, and discriminates against the poor and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative outgrowth of this tactical shift is the
moratorium movement, which seeks to temporarily halt executions
until the process can be improved.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators have introduced new moratorium bills in
Maryland and Oklahoma in the few working days since Ryan's
announcement. Similar bills had already been pending in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Ryan announced the Illinois moratorium last Monday,
following a rash of overturned capital convictions that drew
national attention to his state. Since the death penalty's
reinstatement, more inmates on Illinois' death row have been set
free, their convictions reversed, than have been executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in
Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty
that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one
will meet the fate,'' Ryan said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governors of Oregon and Maryland have given some
support to anti-death penalty initiatives in their states, leading
some to speculate they might be the next to follow Governor Ryan's
lead.
</P>
<P>
   John Kitzhaber, who has already presided over two executions as
Oregon's governor, has publicly declared his support for a
grass-roots referendum initiative that would abolish the death
penalty. And Parris Glendening, in Maryland, has set up a
commission to determine if race plays a role in who receives death
sentences in his state. A state representative from Baltimore has
proposed a bill that would ban the death penalty on the grounds
that minorities are unfairly targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Though the debate's shift has captured the conscience of
Governor Ryan, it does not seem to have made much of a dent in
popular support for capital punishment which, according to opinion
polls, still hovers around 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But death penalty opponents said that, as it becomes more clear
that the justice system can make mistakes, they have seen
conservative religious groups become more active.
</P>
<P>
   Bills in the state legislatures in Kentucky, Indiana, and
Pennsylvania have been sponsored by pro-life Christian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have cases like Illinois, when more death row
convicts are being released than are being executed, the moral
imperative becomes more clear,'' said Diann Rust-Tierney, the
executive director of the ACLU's Death Penalty Project.
</P>
<P>
   That is the logic which changed Gov. Ryan's mind, and which,
activists predict, will change the public's mind as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember that legislation was introduced in
Illinois a year ago and the Governor said the same thing as these
governors are saying now, so things can change pretty quickly,''
said Jane Henderson, spokesman for the Quixote Center, an
anti-death penalty group. ``I think we may see a richochet effect
across the country.''

BANK OF NEW YORK CITED FOR LAXITY IN PREVENTING MONEY LAUNDERING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State and federal regulators formally sanctioned the
Bank of New York for ``deficiencies'' in its anti-money laundering
practices, according to an agreement signed by the bank Tuesday at
a monthly meeting of its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The move, known as an ``enforcement action,'' does not include
monetary penalties against the bank and falls short of a more
serious ``cease and desist'' order that regulators could have
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   While the Federal Reserve and the New York State Banking
Department took the Bank of New York to task for lax auditing and
risk management procedures in businesses involving international
banking, funds transfers and stock listings for foreign companies,
the fact that the regulators' actions were not more serious comes
as something of a relief for the beleaguered bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York is still in the middle of a federal
investigation involving possible money laundering related to more
than $7 billion in funds transmitted from Russia and into the bank
through a network of obscure companies tied to a now-defunct firm,
Benex International.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this agreement we reaffirm our commitment to meet the
highest operating and ethical standards in everything we do,'' said
the Bank of New York's chief executive, Thomas A. Renyi, in a
statement Tuesday. ``We are grateful for the overwhelming support
of our customers and shareholders during this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, analysts said that the enforcement action is an
unusual measure that was taken because of substantial problems with
the way the Bank of New York supervised accounts handling funds
from overseas _ particularly from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a common action and it seems to have involved an
extraordinary joint examination by state and federal regulators,''
said Charles Intriago, editor of Money Laundering Alert, a
newsletter focusing on money laundering issues. ``I think
regulators are signaling that this bank had some serious
vulnerabilities to money laundering.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the funds that moved through the Benex network and into
the Bank of New York were apparently related to customs and tax
avoidance schemes used by Russian importers and exporters, but
federal investigators are also examining whether a portion of the
funds involved more overtly criminal activities such as large-scale
corporate theft, political graft or racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York has not been charged with wrongdoing in
connection with the federal investigation and it has been
cooperating with the investigation since it began in September
1998. Renyi acknowledged in congressional hearings last fall that
his institution failed to properly supervise Benex-related accounts
held by the bank. The Benex accounts were active from early 1996
until last August, when news of the federal investigation was
reported.
</P>
<P>
   By not leveling the most serious charges available to them,
regulators are indicating that the Bank of New York's senior
management may have exhibited gross lapses in judgment but were not
willingly trying to do anything wrong. The regulators' intentions
were reported in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the bank said it will
strengthen anti-money laundering practices and more tightly screen
customers in its international private banking, retail banking,
correspondent banking and funds transfer businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also mandates that within the next month and a
half the bank will submit an enhanced supervision program to
regulators that includes the ``identification and timely, accurate,
and complete reporting of known or suspected criminal activity.''
The agreement also calls for other periodic reports pertaining to
improved auditing and risk management practices.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said Tuesday that the regulatory action has no bearing
on the course of its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Under provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, the main federal
statute pertaining to money laundering, the only agency that can
impose a monetary penalty for money laundering violations is the
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an arm of the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals with direct knowledge of the matter said that
regulators have referred the Bank of New York to the Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network for a monetary penalty. The financial
crimes agency declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next month, the financial crimes agency is expected to
release tighter anti-money laundering rules for nonbank businesses
that specialize in money transmission and the issuance of
traveler's checks. The agency is also working on revised money
laundering guidelines for casinos and securities dealers, and is
discussing money laundering problems with the insurance industry.

ABORIGINAL TV NETWORK A MEETING PLACE FOR MEMBERS OF NATIVE
COMMUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn . )  (dal) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ Like most children growing up across North
America in the 1960s, Jim Compton took cultural clues from the
family television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had six-shooters and a cowboy outfit,'' said Compton, a
member of the Saulteaux tribe in Saskatchewan. ``I identified more
with John Wayne. Not with the Indian that got shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a 20-year career in television, Compton has his hands
on a tool that he hopes will improve the television images that
will wash over the next generation of Canada's indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   In December, from newly completed studios in this city on the
central plains, broadcasting started for the Aboriginal People's
Television Network, APTN. Compton is program director for what he
bills as ``the world's first national aboriginal television
network.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cultural collision between Indian America and European
America grinds into its sixth century, the aboriginal network seeks
to create an electronic home and meeting place for Canada's million
Indians, Eskimos and Metis, or people of mixed race. Aboriginals
constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population. But
native communities are often the most troubled, with high rates of
suicide, unemployment, incarceration and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indians say the intrusion of European-dominated television
programming into native houses contributed to cultural dislocation
and loss of pride. In the 70s, a group of Eskimo elders in the
Eastern Arctic described television as ``an atomic bomb that leaves
buildings intact, but destroys the lives and souls of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, they were getting images that did not reflect
their cultures,'' Compton said of television's demoralizing
effects. ``All of a sudden, native people had to try be like Barbie
and Ken.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, an Indian-centered view of the world is the fare on
APTN, which is now included by law in the basic cable package
received by all Canadian subscribers, nearly 8 million households.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching into the far corners of Canada, the network started
broadcasting in September from studios in Yellowknife, where it
supplanted a decade-old network that served only Inuit communities
in the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inuaraq teaches his son how to survive using the old ways:
driving dogs, building igloos, catching seals in open water and
running down caribou to feed the family,'' says the network program
guide about ``Dog Team,'' an Inuit, or Eskimo, show broadcast in
English, the lingua franca of the large majority of Canada's
indigenous peoples. About one-fourth of the programming is in one
of about 18 aboriginal languages.
</P>
<P>
   For young people, there is also ``Spirit Bay,'' a half-hour
drama told through the eyes of children who live in a village in
the northern wilderness. The program guide summarizes, ``Lives of
trapping cabins and fishing boats, freezing winter storms and quiet
summer afternoons.''
</P>
<P>
   For aboriginal peoples steeped in ancient oral history
traditions, there is ``Storytime,'' English-language segments
filmed at the Yukon International Storytelling Festival. For Inuit
speakers of Inuktitut, there is ``Kippinguijautit,'' described on
the network's Web site, www.aptn.ca, as ``funny and interesting
stories of traditional and contemporary Inuit ways of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching on political issues, the network has broadcast
``Hunters and Bombers,'' a documentary on the fight by Labrador
natives against low-level military flights over their homeland, and
``Unfinished Business,'' a documentary about native struggles to
have the government live up to land treaties.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective, the network has shown films on tribes in
Brazil, Pa- pua New-Guinea and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure a high percentage of Canadian content, the federal
broadcasting authority limits ``foreign'' programming on all
stations. So APTN is allowed only 12 hours of shows considered
foreign out of the weekly broadcast of 120.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Indian world view, Compton said, this rule
electronically reinforces the artificial, European division of
North America, where Blackfoot, Dine, Mohawk, Ojibway and other
tribes straddle the U.S.-Canada border.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a province with a sizable Ojibwe population, Compton
predicted that regulators would rule that a six-part series under
production on the Ojibway of Minnesota was ``foreign.''
</P>
<P>
   The network hopes to generate advertising revenue by telecasting
some programs intended to draw large white crossover audiences.
This year, a weekly aboriginal ``blockbuster'' film program will
begin, with Gary Farmer, a Cayuga from Ontario who acted in the
movie ``Smoke Signals,'' as the host. Popular programs already
shown include a music special by Buffy Ste. Marie, a Cree from
Saskatchewan, and ``Cooking With the Wolfman,'' an aboriginal
cooking presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had 14,000 hits on my Web site, a lot of queries about
recipes,'' said the host, David Wolfman, a member of the Lillooet
tribe of British Columbia. ``People are liking the caribou and
venison recipes. But we also have done vegetarian recipes.''
</P>

 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In March, the network plans to start a regular native-affairs
news program.
</P>
<P>
   Late last fall, when there was a violent confrontation between
Mi'kmaq Indian fishermen and white lobstermen in Atlantic Canada,
an APTN reporter found that he enjoyed special access among
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reception was open arms,'' said Dan David, an aboriginal
who is a veteran television reporter and who has been hired as the
network news director. ``It was, `Come onto our boats, come into
our homes.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the network only weeks old at the time, Compton said, he
was pleased by the instant recognition and acceptance by rural
native communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would only talk to him,'' Compton said, recalling the
warm reception for David by Mi'kmaq fishermen and self-defense
groups. ``They knew he would get their point of view across.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton, who worked for nine years here as a reporter for the
Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the government-controlled network,
added, ``Our people do not trust the mainstream media to be
forthcoming on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The national press has largely given a sympathetic welcome to
the network, which under the terms of its approval by the federal
licensing authority, draws most of its $10 million annual budget
from mandatory cable fees, $1.25 a year for each subscribing
household. Although an Angus Reid poll conducted in 1998 indicated
that two-thirds of Canadians supported the concept of a national
aboriginal network, some caustic press reviews reflect a deep
racial and cultural divide among some Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only white liberals will watch the Aboriginal Peoples
Television Network,'' headlined a column by Kevin Michael Grace in
Western Report, a conservative newsweekly that is widely read here
on the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   After complaining that the network budget was ``picked from the
pockets of cable subscribers,'' Grace predicted that its
programming would be ``endless reairings of ponderous
government-funded documentaries with lots of long lingering shots
of water, trees and rocks and lots of elders condemning the endless
perfidy of the white man.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day the network went on the air, The National Post
greeted it with an editorial denouncing it as ``an electronic
reserve'' maintained by ``an aboriginal TV tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Making cable subscribers to support the network perpetuates
``the stereotypes of Indians as people who must be given a handout
to succeed,'' said the paper, which is edited in Toronto and sells
nationwide. ``It also sends the message that a politically favored
ethnic group can force its way into our living rooms and wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments fall flat in the APTN newsroom in Winnipeg, where
projections indicate that the work force will be 25 percent
aboriginal in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't judge us with racist attitudes,'' said Compton, whose
goal is to rub out the old stereotypes of Indians as sidekicks or
savages.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to a future with a prouder, more self-confident
aboriginal population in Canada, the television executive, who long
ago traded his Roy Rogers outfit for jeans and a braid, summarized
the network's philosophy as, ``Yeah, I can be Indian in this world
_ and make a go of it.''

WORKER PRODUCTIVITY UP 2.9 PERCENT IN '99, US SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The productivity of American workers increased 2.9 percent last
year, the fastest productivity gain since 1992, the US Department
of Labor reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strong performance in 1999 was due to exceptional
productivity gains in the final quarter of the year as businesses
continued to squeeze more output from each worker. In the fourth
quarter, productivity rose at a 5 percent annual rate, matching the
strong performance in the third quarter, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an expansion that would become the longest in US
history, the report showed US businesses were able to keep their
production costs _ and, ultimately, prices _ down. With
productivity high, unit labor costs also fell by 1 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1999, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in technology stocks, looking for new reasons to drive
the Nasdaq index higher, cheered the report. Investors hoped a
smart rise in output may make the Federal Reserve Board less
anxious about inflation, and therefore less likely to raise
interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Fed raised interest rates in an attempt to cool
an economy that is growing at a breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Nasdaq stock index, which is dominated by the
high-flying technology sector, soared 106 points, or 2.45 percent,
closing at a record 4427.50. The broader Dow Jones industrial
average added just 51.81 points, pushing the index to 10,957.60 at
the close.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's rise in worker productivity was the largest since
1992, when productivity rose 4.1 percent as the economy had begun
to recover from the Gulf War recession.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, productivity was boosted by two consecutive quarters of
strong performance as businesses continued to make record
investments in new technology and other equipment, which in turn
helped make their employees more productive.
</P>
<P>
   An increase of 1.7 percent in hours worked last year also
boosted productivity, the Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at a 30-year low, Robert Mellman, senior
economist for J.P. Morgan, a New York investment house, said it was
``rare'' to see such strong gains this late in an economic cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always thought that workers hired late in the cycle
aren't as skilled or productive, so it'd be hard to keep
productivity strong,'' Mellman said. But, he added, ``here we are _
we're getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is sure to refuel a debate among economists over how
long the current expansion can be sustained without igniting
inflation. High productivity, in theory, keeps wages from rising.
Wages are the single biggest component of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Rising productivity is the ``economic equivalent of manna from
heaven,'' said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist for John Hancock
Financial Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Strong productivity gains mean ``better prospects we can
continue growth without pushing up employment costs, and,
ultimately, lessening the chance the Fed will need to slam on the
brakes, which is really what we are worried about,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report provided a counterpoint to two economic
indicators, released in January, that pointed to inflationary
pressures: The employment cost index jumped, and the economy grew
at a scorching 5.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With those reports in mind, the Fed, fearing an uptick in
inflation, raised two key interest rates last week by a quarter
point, boosting the federal funds rate for overnight loans to 5.75
percent and the discount rate to 5.25 percent. The actions were the
central bank's fourth rate increase since June 1999.

SOVEREIGN BANCORP OUTLINES LENDING PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sovereign Bancorp Inc., the Pennsylvania thrift that
will soon enter New England through its acquisition of nearly 300
Fleet and BankBoston branches, Tuesday detailed a $1.3 billion
community lending program aimed at small businesses and
lower-income borrowers in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year plan, Sovereign will devote more than $517
million, or the bulk of its loans, to small businesses and farms in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyomissing, Pa. bank will also allot $380 million for
consumer credit, $295 million for low-income home loans, and $131
million for community development initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Affordable housing tax credits will total $10.7 million, and
community contributions and investments will reach $2.5 million,
the bank said. Sovereign has also included unspecified ``employee
volunteer services activities'' in its plan.
</P>
<P>
   While the figures cover Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode
Island, the bulk of the money will be spent in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign recently presented an outline of its plan to the
Office of Thrift Supervision, the federal regulatory agency
overseeing thrifts, and to local community groups. The OTS must
approve the spending plan, which is being made under the Community
Reinvestment Act, a 1977 federal law that requires banks to lend to
communities from which they take deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very good sum _ we believe we will meet the needs of
the community,'' said John Hamill, who oversees Sovereign's New
England franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups, which in the past have played key roles in
leveraging money out of banks for local lending initiatives, are
taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early too tell, and we need more specifics on the
types of programs they are targeting,'' said Sonia Alleyne,
director of community investments at the Massachusetts Affordable
Housing Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists want Sovereign to sign pacts to channel CRA money
through specific community groups and programs _ a plan Sovereign
said it was considering. Groups channeling CRA money earn fees for
locating customers and providing counseling and assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign acquired around 280 branches with $12 billion in
deposits and $7.5 billion in loans last year, after Fleet bought
BankBoston and the two banks had to sell assets to meet antitrust
requirements. About 180 of the branches, with $8 billion in
deposits and $5 billion in loans, are in Massachusetts. The rest
are in Connecticut and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Technically a thrift, Sovereign is transforming itself into a
mainstream commercial bank. The company, which will have $35
billion in assets, will start operating in New England this summer
as it absorbs its acquisition in stages.

HALE AND DORR TO PAY NEW LAWYERS $155,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hale and Dorr, a leading Boston law firm, notified its
associates Tuesday that it would increase total compensation for
first-year lawyers to a maximum of $155,000 this year. The firm
said the increase would allow it to remain at the top of a highly
competitive legal market.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to associates, Hale and Dorr said it would raise
base pay for first-year attorneys to $125,000 from $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Associates will receive up to $30,000 in bonuses, based on
performance, resulting in a maximum pay package of $155,000.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm, which employs about 400 attorneys and which hired
50 associates last year, represents emerging technology and
Internet firms as well as venture capitalists. Last year, it was
involved in the initial public offerings of Akamai Technologies and
Sycamore Networks in Chelsmford, the two biggest IPOs in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened in New York just two weeks ago and our Reston, Va.,
office opens in 10 days,'' said William F. Lee, managing partner.
``We did 46 IPOs last year alone. So, we were going to have to
cross this bridge eventually. That is why we did what we did. We
are committed to being at the top, no matter what market we are
practicing in.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the executive committee at Foley Hoag &AMP; Eliot has
been reviewing its compensation and is expected to announce its new
pay rates soon, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   These recent pay hikes, now regarded by many in the industry as
part of a full-blown salary war, began several weeks ago when a
number of California firms responded to the loss of legal talent to
Internet firms by increasing base salaries to $125,000 and by
offering $25,000 to $50,000 in bonuses. Several New York firms also
raised pay rates.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's big firms, which only recently had raised base pay
rates to $100,000, began reviewing compensation rates last week
after Testa Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault increased base pay for first-year
associates to $140,000. The company does not offer bonuses. A
second firm, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom, later confirmed
that it, too, had increased its salaries for first-year associates
from $100,000 to $140,000, excluding annual bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the push to increase salaries is being driven
by higher-than-normal turnover rates among legal associates who are
attracted to the higher pay, stock options, and relaxed atmosphere
at Internet start-ups. ``If you look nationally, the turnover rate
is about 25 percent,'' Lee said. ``Boston's rate is lower, and our
rate is lower. Boston firms have been fortunate because the
turnover rate here is in the teens.''

 &HT;    Golf links lease deal bothers Trump
 &HT;    By Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The self-described master of the art of
the deal is complaining he got a lousy deal from Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity developer Donald Trump, who is leasing 214 acres from
the county for his lavish Trump International Golf Club, is upset
that the county is renting land more cheaply to another developer
building a public golf course on 101 acres in the old Hillcrest
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very strange and extremely unfair to Donald Trump, who
by all accounts has done an outstanding job (on his golf course),''
Trump attorney Raymond Royce wrote in a Feb. 4 letter to County
Administrator Bob Weisman.
</P>
<P>
   Trump is now demanding a much cheaper rent for an additional 58
acres he wants to lease for an expansion of his upscale golf
course, which costs $300,000 to join and $9,000 annually to play.
</P>
<P>
   And he's offered to pay ``substantially more'' for the Hillcrest
land than its developer _ Jupiter-based Hillcrest/Frankel Golf
Partners _ and build a public golf course himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a much better deal for the taxpayers,'' Royce
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Frankel, president of Hillcrest/Frankel, did not return
phone calls for this story.
</P>
<P>
   The rent on Trump's $40 million golf course is initially about
$2,000 per acre per year. In 2003, the price begins to rise, and it
will hit about $10,000 per acre per year in 2024.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the county has told Trump it wants about $13,000
per acre per year for the expansion property just north of the
present course, where the developer wants to build another nine
holes.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the Hillcrest lease would be free for the first
four years, then cost about $1,200 per acre a year over its 61-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   Hillcrest was a 363-home neighborhood until airport officials
started buying out the homes 12 years ago. The buyout of the
neighborhood, which is beneath Palm Beach International Airport's
main flight path, was part of an agreement that allowed the airport
to build a new terminal in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners chose Hillcrest/Frankel in 1998 to develop a
public golf course on the neighborhood site.
</P>
<P>
   That lease with Hillcrest/Frankel still needs to be approved by
county commissioners. It will go before them later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said the reason for the big disparity is simple: The
Trump property is worth more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of distinctions between these properties,'' he
said Monday. The county has designated the Hillcrest land strictly
for recreational use, while the Trump property ``is potentially
light industrial, which is a lot more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Royce doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just doesn't make any sense to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he wrote in his letter to Weisman that the Hillcrest
land is more valuable than Trump's because it ``is in a very
convenient location and has great visibility along I-95.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dealmaker gave the county two offers:
</P>
<P>
   He is willing to pay $3,500 per acre per year for the 58-acre
expansion. That's $9,500 less per acre than the county is asking _
or $551,000 less annually.
</P>
<P>
   Trump also offered to take over the Hillcrest property for
$2,000 per acre per year. That rent would be $800 more per acre
than Hillcrest/Frankel would pay under its lease _ or a total of
$80,800 more annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trump could build an excellent public course on that
property,'' Royce said.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Trump has shown an interest in the
Hillcrest property. After county commissioners awarded the bid to
Hillcrest/Frankel _ the only bidder _ Trump asked them to reopen
the competition so he could submit a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners rejected that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said he hasn't discussed Trump's gripes, or his latest
proposals, with commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to respond to it right now,'' he said. ``A lot
of things are still up in the air.''

LYCOS MOVES TO BEEF UP WEB SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. is buying one Bay State company and investing in
another in its latest effort to beef up the services on its network
of Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   For an undisclosed sum, Lycos will purchase up to 9.5 percent of
Trellix Corp. of Waltham, Mass., a maker of software for building
Web sites. Lycos and Trellix will share software technologies to
create a new system that will enable Internet users to easily
design and publish Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos also said it will pay $45 million in stock to acquire
Valent Software Corp. of Woburn, Mass., which makes a software
platform used to build ``membership communities'' on Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Trellix's Web-design software is designed to enable new Internet
users to make attractive Web sites quickly. It's sold in retail
stores and is included in the WordPerfect office software suite
sold by Corel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lycos's own Tripod Web-site hosting service
provides a version of Trellix's Web site design software to its
users. The product, called Trellix Web, is a program that must be
downloaded and installed on the user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, though, Tripod will introduce a new feature called
Trellix Web Services. This system won't require a software
download. Instead, a Tripod user will be able to design and publish
a Web site from any Internet-connected Web browser. The software
will also become available on Angelfire, another Web-site hosting
firm owned by Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Tripod already offers a Web-based site design system. But
Trellix's president, Don Bulens, said that sites built with the
Tripod system couldn't match the quality of Trellix-built sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Page visits to Trellix sites on Tripod are three times the
visits to other sites across their networks,'' Bulens said.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity and high quality of the Trellix design tools will
attract more repeat users to Lycos Web sites, said Lycos's
executive vice president, Ron Sege.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some 10 million users on our Tripod and Angelfire
community sites, and one of the reasons they come to us is because
we make it so easy for them to build Web pages,'' Sege said. ``This
relationship with Trellix will make it even easier.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Trellix will license Lycos technologies
that make it easier to publish finished Web sites to the Internet.
Trellix will market the combined technologies to other Web-site
hosting companies that want to offer simple publishing tools.
</P>
<P>
   The company that Lycos is acquiring, Valent, already runs the
LycosClubs feature on the Lycos Web site. It lets people create
clubs for others with similar interests; club members can hold live
chats and exchange messages and pictures. Lycos members operate
about 62,000 clubs on the system.
</P>
<P>
   Sege said the Valent acquisition will enable his company to
integrate the club-building technology throughouth the rest of the
Lycos Network, which includes such sites as Wired, Angelfire, and
Quote.com. By creating clubs with thousands of loyal members, Lycos
hopes to give people one more reason to pay regular visits to its
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, based in Waltham, Mass., saw its stock rise 5/16 to 72
1/16 on the Nasdaq stock exchange Tuesday.

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYER SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR ELBOWING
OPPONENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An 18-year-old former South San Antonio High School basketball
star has been sentenced to five years in prison for throwing a
vicious elbow to the face of an opponent during a game last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Limon, South San Antonio High's former starting center who
graduated last spring, was sentenced Monday for the Jan. 15, 1999,
incident in which he threw an elbow that smashed the nose of an
opposing player.
</P>
<P>
   The blow caused East Central San Antonio High guard/forward
Brent Holmes to suffer a concussion and a compound fracture to his
nose that required emergency-room surgery to correct. And it led to
the aggravated assault and serious bodily injury conviction and
prison sentence for Limon.
</P>
<P>
   Limon's mother and his lawyer called the sentence an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney and a veteran school district athletic director
said they believe it is the first time that a Texas high school
athlete had been sent to prison for conduct during a game.
</P>
<P>
   But Bexar County's (San Antonio) lead prosecutor and Holmes'
parents argued that the punishment given Limon fit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just a foul in a basketball game, it was a
deliberate act,'' said Assistant District Attorney Mary Green of
Bexar County. ``That fellow got clobbered. He didn't have the ball.
The ball wasn't coming to him. ... It was analogous to being
attacked on the street. It looks like the judge threw the book at
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer James Rodriguez, said the sentence looks more
like overkill in response to an unfortunate event that occurred in
the course of a high-spirited sporting event. Rodriguez said that
referees didn't call a foul on his client.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said that the game between the cross-town basketball
rivals was unfolding as an aggressive, physical contest and elbows
were thrown by players on both sides. Limon, the lawyer said, let
his emotions get the best of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client took it upon himself to get this kid out of his way,
so he elbowed him,'' Rodriguez said. ``It was the wrong thing to do
and he later apologized. But the judge decided he should go to
(prison). Strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Limon's mother, Olivia Ramey, said they thought
the matter had been laid to rest after Limon apologized in public
and was suspended from the team for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Dwayne and Rene Holmes said they thought the attack on their
son deserved a harsher penalty. They reported the matter to police,
and said they feared that Brent, now a freshman at Texas A&AMP;M at
Kingsville, might have suffered permanent injuries and perhaps
could have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Little League coach, and in athletics the first thing
you learn is sportsmanship.'' said Dwayne Holmes. ``I could have
accepted it (Limon's apology) if he had gone right over after Brent
was hit and said, `hey, sorry. Are you OK?' But he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at that game. They wouldn't even let me down on the
court. I was saying, `hey, that's my kid down there.' Brent got
decked and they didn't even call a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was captured on video, which was aired on San
Antonio TV news broadcasts and became the topic of controversy in
the Alamo City, both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said state District Judge Mark Luitjen, who sentenced
Limon, saw the tape during court proceedings and was aware that
Limon had been sentenced to four years probation in March 1999 for
his part in attempted burglaries committed the previous December.
</P>
<P>
   Luitjen, a Bexar County prosecutor before he became judge, did
not return calls to the Star-Telegram on Tuesday. Limon was in
Bexar County Jail pending transfer to the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said his client's involvement in the attempted
burglary should not have been a factor in the assault case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not like he committed an offense after being placed on
probation so they had to revoke him,'' Rodriguez said. ``In fact,
he had done everything they asked him to do. I am overwhelmed by
the logic here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been practicing law here for 8 1/2 years. I've never seen
anything like this. This is my worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said if athletes who get into fights during games are
subject to prosecution, coaches and players could become fearful of
employing the aggression necessary to win. Green dismissed that
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge difference between taking an elbow when you're
going for a rebound under the net and getting assaulted completely
across the court,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I.C. Little, athletic director for the Arlington, Texas, school
district, said he could not recall ever hearing about a high school
athlete being sent to prison for on-the-field conduct. But the San
Antonio incident will likely affect the way high school coaches and
athletes approach games in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard or read anything about the case down there,
but I'm sure it will,'' Little said. ``It seems like once one of
those things starts, it's like a snowball effect.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rene Holmes said athletes such as her son, who also played
wide receiver on East Central's football team and ran the hurdles
in track, deserve to play without fear of attack by their
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been an athlete all of his life,'' Rene Holmes said. ``He
was having the best game of the season the night he got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holmes family still owes $7,000 in medical expenses
resulting from the injury, which has prevented Brent Holmes from
participating in college sports, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Ramey said Limon also was a dedicated athlete who had
hoped to continue his career in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is my son's life. He breathes basketball,'' she
said. ``He was planning to go to college but he wanted to wait for
this to be settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramey said she hopes to appeal her son's prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to happen,'' she said, referring to the
prospect of her son in state prison. ``This is not right. I am
going to fight it every step of the way, all the way.''

McCAIN CALLS BUSH `UNTRUSTWORTHY' 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ John McCain called George W. Bush
``untrustworthy'' Tuesday as he continued their name-calling brawl
and called Bush's attempt to say he'd abandoned veterans as
``beyond the pale.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would not tolerate the effort by Bush surrogates
portraying him as weak on important veterans issues and responded
with a new campaign ad that says Bush ``twists the truth like
(President) Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing is untrustworthy when someone says that I
have abandoned veterans,'' the Arizona senator told reporters at a
town hall meeting in North Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sad, isn't it,'' Bush said in Hockessin, Del. ``The true
nature of John McCain evidently is coming out. It's pretty sad to
hear he's running that kind of (negative) ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor added: ``The people of my state know I've
brought honor and dignity to the office. I'm going to fight for
what I believe is right. I'm not going to let my record get
distorted.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to statements made on stage at a Bush rally
last week by former military officers and an activist on POW-MIA
issues who denounced McCain while they offered their endorsement to
the governor. One accused McCain of not being committed enough in
the fight by veterans to win benefits for various illnesses,
including the so-called Gulf War syndrome, and another charged that
the former Navy pilot had turned his back on fellow prisoners of
war after he was released from his own 5 1/2-year imprisonment in
North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Even though one of Bush's own foreign policy advisers,
arms-control expert Richard Armitage, said the attack on McCain's
veterans record was a mistake, Bush refused to take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. (J. Thomas) Burch can speak for himself. I didn't write
Mr. Burch's script. He's obviously upset with Sen. McCain and he's
got a right to express his opinion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Burch is chairman of the National Vietnam &AMP; Gulf War Veterans
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way a campaign ought to be conducted,'' McCain
said. ``I have said that (Bush's) service in the National Guard was
honorable. For him to stand there while that person says that I
have abandoned veterans, that's not appropriate, and it's
untrustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush are vying for the huge veteran vote in this
state, where an estimated 400,000 retired military personnel now
make their homes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain expressed outrage Tuesday at an apparent push-poll by the
Bush campaign and called on Bush to take the ``high road'' in their
contest for GOP delegates in the state's Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would not pull down his own ads that slam McCain's
attack ads on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a good battle. We're having one in this state, and I'm
gonna win,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's criticism of the Bush tactics came as he continued his
campaign across the state after a brief swing west over the weekend
to California, Arizona and Michigan. The latter two states hold
their Republican primaries Feb. 22, three days after South
Carolina's. The huge delegate prize of California holds its primary
with a dozen other states March 7.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in North Augusta, the senator faced about
1,000 people who grilled him with some of the toughest questions
yet in his campaign. Most in the crowd appeared to be McCain
supporters, but on issues such as gay rights and abortion, he found
many who disagreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain disagreed with one Bible-quoting South Carolinian, who
called homosexuality ``a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe it is a sin. It's a lifestyle I don't agree
with, but I don't believe it is a sin,'' said McCain, who also
reiterated his support for the Clinton administration's ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was greeted by several ``boos.''
</P>
<P>
   In a response to another question on abortion, McCain drew some
applause when he emphasized his 17-year anti-abortion voting record
in the Senate, and added that he believes the historic Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion ``ought to be reversed.'' He said he
also supports a ban on partial birth abortions and laws requiring
parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the audience disagreed with his support of fetal
tissue research associated with Parkinsons and other debilitating
diseases, even though he says the tissue samples should not come
from abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a real problem with him on gays in the military and
fetal tissue research,'' said Davey Evans, a saddlemaker and
transplanted Texan who now calls Trenton, S.C., home.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he has problems with Bush trying to build on his
family name and allowing people connected with him to attack
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with him letting folks say some of these things,
and I don't agree with him getting his mommy up there to say, `Hey,
support my boy.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain delivered a major speech on drug and crime policy in
Columbia in which he called for ``renewed commitment'' in fighting
the problems of violence and drug trafficking. But it did not
contain any major new proposals, other than a call for a new
program that would match up veterans with young, recovering drug
addicts and troubled teen-agers to help them lead ``more productive
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain criticized the Clinton administration for being absent
from the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bully pulpit is vacant,'' he told police cadets here.
``The Oval Office is merely an echo chamber when it comes to the
drug issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president must be a commander in chief in the war on
drugs and it must be fought on three fronts with unambiguous
purpose _ vanquish demand, slash supply, and widen access to
addiction treatment,'' McCain added, promising to create ``an
international drug strategy and a foreign policy that supports
it.''

REMINISCENCES OF MONDALE IN S.C. GOP CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In a Republican campaign that bears an eerie
resemblance to the 1984 struggle for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Governor George W. Bush's newly-aggressive style echos
the approach Walter F. Mondale used after he, too, was staggered by
defeat in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   After retreating to Austin to retool his operation following a
shellacking in New Hampshire by Arizona Sen. John McCain, Bush
returned to the stage this week with a different theme _ ``a
reformer with results'' _ and a fresh determination to depict his
surging rival as a ``Washington Democrat'' who accepts money from
special interests while calling for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, after being swamped by Gary Hart in New
Hampshire, Mondale set his campaign back on course by branding
Hart's ``new ideas'' as little more than hollow rhetoric. Drawing
on a punchline from a popular television commercial, Mondale
demanded, ``Where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Mondale recalled his defeat in New
Hampshire as shocking but also ``liberating in a way.'' He erred in
the early stages of his campaign, he said, by not confronting the
other Democratic candidates because he wanted to maintain party
unity. ``Then I realized I was in the fight of my life. It changed
how I campaigned, how I spoke. I got rid of all my precaution and I
think my speeches got better.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first stops this week, Bush has appeared more assertive
and quicker to be critical of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain continues to attract enthusiastic, overflow crowds
similar to those that flocked spontaneously to Hart in the days
after the upstart Democrat surprised Mondale in New Hampshire 16
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By beating well-financed favorites, both McCain and Hart became
overnight celebrities, drawing support from independents and
moderates outside their own parties. (They share something else:
friendship. Hart served as an usher in McCain's 1980 wedding.)
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers are well aware of the precedent set by Hart,
who briefly threatened to seize his party's nomination before
fizzling. ``Hart wasn't prepared for success,'' said John Weaver,
McCain's political director. ``Hart failed to file for delegates in
a lot of states. We are filed everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's political calendar also ``works better for us,''
Weaver said. Because most of the primaries are compressed into the
next five weeks, the nomination can be claimed before the
excitement of McCain's charge wears off, he said. ``Had this
calendar been in place in 1984, Hart would have won the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Hart phenomenon burst out of New Hampshire, his staff
described the sensation as ``riding the wave.'' One of his
advisors, Patrick Caddell, said, ``All of a sudden the stars from
the sky are falling.'' Another aide, Sue Casey, predicted that Hart
would no longer need an organization on the ground and could
subsist ``on paid and free media.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Hart campaign proved to be a short-lived meteor. He was
thrown into a duel with Mondale in three Southern states two weeks
after New Hampshire. Though Hart captured Florida, he won
relatively few delegates. Mondale won primaries in Georgia and
Alabama on the same day and slowed Hart's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The former vice president, who had the support of most
Democratic Party leaders, organized labor and many blacks who
defected from Jesse Jackson's campaign, eventually ground down Hart
in a series of primaries in the industrial states.
</P>
<P>
   Hart damaged himself in Illinois when he plunged into an
internecine party feud in Chicago. So far, McCain has been stepping
gingerly around the Confederate battle flag controversy that is
riveting South Carolina, the scene of the next major Republican
primary Feb. 19, though news accounts this week have linked some of
McCain's major supporters here to the effort to keep the flag
flying atop the state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is backed by much of the Republican Party leadership in
South Carolina and elsewhere across the country, but he faces a
spirited challenge from McCain here. Polls in the state, which gave
Bush a 20-point advantage less than two weeks ago, now indicate
that the two candidates are in a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   Mondale says defeat in New Hampshire is more than a ``bump in
the road'' -- the expression Bush used after his loss last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrust that comes out of New Hampshire has to be
experienced to be understood,'' Mondale said, recalling his own
devastation. ``It was a hurricane, a tornado, a tsunami. Everything
was upside down the next morning. The places where I had been 30
points ahead, I was 10 points down. In places where Hart had never
been, he was ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Mondale held a 35-point lead over Hart in Florida in
the days prior to the New Hampshire primary. ``We had a 40-point
turnaround,'' said Steve Engelberg, who managed the Mondale
campaign in Florida that year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is now the beneficiary of reversed political fortunes.
Just as Mondale once led the Democratic field by more than 40
points in a nationwide survey in 1984, Bush has seen his national
lead over McCain suddenly fall from more than 50 points to 22
points in the newest USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll.

ANTIABORTION GROUP TO ENDORSE BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Hoping to slow Arizona Senator John McCain's
momentum before the GOP primary here, the National Right to Life
Committee and its South Carolina affiliate Wednesday will endorse
Texas Governor George W. Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   The move is unusual; the nation's most powerful antiabortion
group has never endorsed a candidate in the midst of a primary
contest, and this support for Bush comes as he is being challenged
in the Feb. 19 primary by two rivals _ Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes
_ who have made opposition to abortion central to their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be self-evident that this has come down to a race
between Governor Bush and Senator McCain in South Carolina,'' said
Holly Gatling, executive director of the political action committee
of South Carolina Citizens for Life. ``And unborn babies can't live
with a president who says abortion is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Columbia Wednesday, Gatling says she
will formally make the Bush endorsement and unveil a new radio ad
that attacks what the National Right to Life Committee and its
state affiliate say is McCain's inconsistent record on the issue.
The ads follow two others that were aired here in January by the
Right to Life groups that urged voters to oppose McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain supporters in the state say their candidate has had a
stellar antiabortion voting record throughout his career in
Congress. The Bush endorsement, they contend, is being directed by
National Right to Life Committee lobbyists in Washington who fear
the senator's pledge to overhaul the campaign-finance system and
limit special-interest contributions will jeopardize their
political influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what is behind this: It's the emergence of McCain
and campaign-finance reform, and the prolife lobby is very
scared,'' said Cyndi Mosteller, who is an adviser to the senator on
family issues and president of the Charleston chapter of Citizens
for Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to disagree with McCain, disagree with him
forthrightly on that issue but don't paint him as something he is
not, which is something less than prolife.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in South Carolina Tuesday, also traced the
Right to Life endorsement of Bush to his campaign finance bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national prolife committee obviously sees me as a threat.
. . despite my 17-year prolife voting record,'' he said. ``I'm a
threat to (them), and I'm a threat to the establishment in
Washington because I'll break the iron triangle of big money,
lobbyists, and legislation, and they're scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee in Washington, acknowledged that his group ``has
made no secret'' of disliking many provisions of McCain's
campaign-finance legislation. But he says it's ``nonsense'' to
suggest that is the reason the antiabortion activists are
aggressively working against the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last year-and-a-half, McCain has positioned himself
with those on the left who see abortion as a `necessary evil,' and
that is a position we very much disagree with, and think it is
something the prolife movement would be foolish to ignore,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, McCain told the editorial board of the San
Francisco Examiner that he would not support the repeal of Roe v.
Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion,
because in the short term ``it would force X number of women in
America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations.'' McCain
insists he made a mistake, mistating his long-held anti-Roe
position.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both Bush and McCain have been less ideological on the
abortion issue than other candidates who are in, or were in, the
GOP field. Both Bush and McCain would make abortion exceptions for
victims of rape and incest, and when the life of the mother is
endangered. Forbes, Keyes, and onetime candidate Gary Bauer allowed
for no such exceptions, and Bauer unsuccessfully pressed Bush to
pledge that he would pick a running mate, and Supreme Court judges,
who opposed abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mosteller said she believes the Bush endorsement was engineered
by officials of the National Right to Life Committee at a meeting
of the South Carolina affiliate on Saturday. ``It was basically
forced on them,'' Mosteller said, ``and I know some Keyes and
Forbes people who aren't happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Griffith, a board member of South Carolina Citizens for
Life, resigned Monday because of the Bush endorsement, saying he
thought the board was coerced by the parent organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of integrity, I cannot lend my support to the use
of coercion to effect an endorsement decision,'' Griffith said in
his resignation letter.

&HT;        BIG DIG COSTS SPARK CONCERNS IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 - Massachusetts lawmakers on Tuesday voiced
concerns about a sudden $1.4 billion jump in costs to the Big Dig
project to officials in charge of the project, and a congressional
aide to Sen. John McCain, said the GOP presidential candidate is
also worried about costs going higher.
</P>
<P>
   Although occupied with a tightening race with Texas Gov. George
Bush, McCain, who chairs the senate committee overseeing
transportation issues, ``has been and continues to be concerned
about Big Dig costs, and will monitor costs and their abuse
closely,'' said Mark Buse, Staff Director of the Senate Commerce
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig officials announced last week that the project's price
tag would likely jump $1.4 billion, to $12.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, McCain tacked an amendment on to an
uncontroversial transportation bill that could have cost the Big
Dig project $150 million. The amendment would have barred one of
the project's funding mechanisms: a self-insurance policy in which
dollars for highway projects dollars are invested in corporate
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Mass. Senators Edward Kennedy and John Kerry lobbied to remove
the provision, but there is no reason why McCain couldn't introduce
it again, aides said, possibly bringing the Big Dig project into a
campaign debate over government spending.
</P>
<P>
   In private meetings with Massachusetts Turnpike Chairman James
J. Kerasiotes Tuesday, Massachusetts lawmakers told they were
concerned about the idea of jacking up toll fares on the
Massachusetts Turnpike to pay for the cost overruns, as well as the
impact on other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   The higher costs of the artery project are to be covered by
sooner-than -expected increases in tolls on the Massachusetts
Turnpike. A toll increase scheduled for 2002 will now be made in
2001, which will provide $60 million to the state, officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James McGovern, D-Worcester, held a private meeting with
Kerasiotes and Big Dig project director Patrick J. Moynihan, and
said he raised several concerns, including the toll hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterated my view that everyone needs to put politics aside
and figure out the best way to finish the project and complete the
statewide road and bridge program,'' McGovern said after the
meeting. ``What we need to do is find a real figure of the overrun,
and we need to get together - with state and federal legislators --
and work out a solution here that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern declined to say he had any specific ideas to how to
cover costs at this point but he said he asked Kerasiotes whether
the toll increase would be enough to cover the new price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Mass. Gov. Paul Cellucci has maintained the project cost
overruns won't cost the state more money, and won't affect his plan
for a $1.1 billion tax cut plan later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They better not [dip into state funds],'' McGovern warned.
``This project has taken away from important projects across the
state. I expressed my concern about that today.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern withheld from criticizing Big Dig authorities for how
forthcoming they have been. ``One of things I said at the meeting
was that I think it's important for everybody to be candid and
forthright,'' McGovern said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Newton, who did not meet with the
officials, said a tax cut plan is not a good idea with the
ballooning costs. ``Either it was unavoidable or they made some
mistakes, but to cut government revenues seems irresponsible at
this point,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Capuano, D-Cambridge, who also held private
meetings with the officials, said he withheld from criticizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expressed my concerns on several issues but I know they have
a job to do,'' said Capuano following his meeting. ``They were
looking for generic understanding. It doesn't benefit me to kick
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Capuano said he voiced concerns about higher toll rates to
Kerasiotes, but said the cost overruns were understandable. ``I'm
not shocked; that's part of the process when you build stuff,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kerasiotes told him Big Dig officials had yet to finish
the financing approach to covering the $1.4 billion overrun and the
two did not discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   But Capuano said a clear plan is needed. ``Like any government
agency, when you want to do something, you better know where the
money's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he expected Republican lawmakers to criticize the
Big Dig, Capuano said: ``I would imagine it would be discussed in
the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts state lawmakers were chagrined by the news of the
cost overruns, and questioned whether the state would have to use
its funds to pay for overruns.

 &HT;    Death threat fuels fight over Rebel flag
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ A rambling handwritten death threat against
state Sen. Darrell Jackson, a Confederate flag opponent, spurred
emotional pleas in the Senate Tuesday for compromise over the flag.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's State Law Enforcement Division is investigating
the three-page letter, agency spokesman Hugh Munn said.
</P>
<P>
   Littered by crude racist terms, the letter is ``one of the
nastiest things I've ever seen in my life,'' Jackson, 43, said in
an interview. ``From the tone of it, it is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer says he is dying of a terminal illness and that ``he
plans to take me with him,'' Jackson said. ``I do not know what
else to do but take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senate President Pro-Temp John Drummond cited the letter
during a Senate speech as a shocking example of rising rancor over
the flag that is bringing out extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Flag supporter Glenn McConnell (R-Charleston) said he has
received letters accusing him of being ``a racist, skinhead and
Nazi.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the letter to confess his racist upbringing in rural
South Carolina, 80-year-old Drummond (D-Ninety Six) said he was
embarrassed now by the segregation that pervaded the textile
community where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   He said racism was prevalent in 1962, when the state legislature
voted to raise the Confederate flag atop the Statehouse as part of
a Civil War centennial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not living in 1962,'' Drummond told the hushed Senate.
``We are living in the year 2000. We are one people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the last state to fly the flag atop its capitol, South
Carolina has emerged as a battleground that has engulfed
presidential candidates campaigning for the state's Feb. 19
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at historically black Benedict College in Columbia
Tuesday, Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley accused
Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain of ``pandering for
votes'' by saying the flag's fate is up to South Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
   No Democratic presidential primary is scheduled in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley detoured to the state, hoping to use national
publicity over the flag to distinguish himself from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flag shows the true colors of Republicans who want to be
president,'' said Bradley, who, like his Democratic rival Al Gore,
believes the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a group headed by three state senators, David Thomas
(R-Greenville), Ralph Anderson (D-Greenville) and Jim Bryan
(D-Laurens), unveiled a proposal to move the flag to a ``heritage
park'' on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The senators introduced legislation calling for the creation of
a racially diverse commission to design and construct the park,
sketching the three-decade history of black and white South
Carolinians starting in the late 1840s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Confederacy is history; we need to treat it as history,''
said Bryan, describing the proposal as a legislative starting point
to resolve the flag fight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings by several senators that the fight threatens
serious damage to South Carolina's reputation, old battle lines
re-emerged Tuesday in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents view it as an offensive reminder of slavery, but a
state senator warned that the portrayal of Southern ancestors as
racists is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart tells me we are not going to work it out spitting on
our forefathers and ancestors,'' said Sen. Verne Smith
(D-Greenville).
</P>
<P>
   Flag supporters view the South Carolina fight as a pivotal stand
against efforts to abolish symbols of the Confederacy. Legislative
efforts are under way to remove the Confederate emblem from the
Georgia and Mississippi state flags.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the NAACP tourism boycott of South Carolina, flag
opponents have gained recently in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is the focus on whether the flag should be moved from
atop the capitol dome, but where it should be relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most ardent supporters, McConnell said he'd be willing
to remove the flag from atop the Statehouse, but only if it were
relocated to the Confederate soldiers' monuments on the Statehouse
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a serious impasse,'' said Jackson, who like numerous
civil rights leaders believes the monument at Main and Gervais
streets is too prominent a location for the flag.

PBS'S SUPERB `GREEKS' BREATHES LIFE INTO GHOSTS OF AN ANCIENT
EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vernon Dobtcheff, Willy Bowman, Jeffery Dench and Bill Reimbold
will no doubt have other roles that audiences remember fondly. But
they may never do a greater service than reminding us that the
alabaster of antiquity is only in our minds, that the ancient
Greeks were so much more than the bloodless white marble of museum
galleries and coffee-table books.
</P>
<P>
   In a manner of speaking, Dobtcheff et al. are the stars of PBS's
``The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization,'' though they don't utter a
word. Like live mannequins in a department-store window, they stand
rock steady, letting the camera move around in a bit of ingenious
filmmaking that goes Ken Burns one better. Where Burns gives life
to static objects, director Cassian Harrison uses the same
technique to give monumental stature to real people. So Dobtcheff
becomes a ``living portrait'' of Cleisthenes, the first democrat.
Bowman is Themistocles, the wily general who sent the Persians
packing. Dench is Pericles, the cultural visionary who built the
Parthenon. And Reimbold is Socrates, the most famous unappreciated
critic.
</P>
<P>
   These four Athenians of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.
hardly constitute the complete Greek package tour, but in telling
their stories to humanize the Greek saga, Harrison and producer
Anthony Geffen have nimbly vivified ancient history. For Princeton
University professor Josh Ober, an expert who appears in the film,
the effect is significant. ``We always start with this image of
pure, white sculpture, this idealized vision of a perfect world
that is dead and distant,'' Ober said recently. ``For me, part of
the excitement of this series is that it ... starts out not just
with the marble images but with a world in which you begin to
imagine the Greeks as flesh and blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of three one-hour segments that PBS has crammed into a
single 2{-hour special for no good reason, ``The Greeks''
incorporates big-budget technology, such as 3-D camera work and
digital animation, to make the trip back 2,500 years more enjoyable
than your average history class.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and Geffen don't overdo the whiz-bang stuff, creating
what Geffen accurately describes as ``a kind of mosaic using all
sorts of different textures to give ... a feeling of what Greek
life would have been like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greeks'' is the first of several ``Empires'' specials that
also will examine Islam, Napoleon, Rome and Britain. Aided by Liam
Neeson's engaged narration, it's a fine start, making the
achievements of the Greeks _ democracy, science, politics,
philosophy, etc. _ amazingly accessible.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization. Two-and-a-half-hour
``Empires'' documentary about the rise, the demise and the legacy
of the Greek empire. Wednesday night on PBS. Check local listings.

 &HT;    An employee's foresight prepared Wolf Camera for digital age
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About eight years ago, when the Internet was little
more than a hangout for academics, hobbyists and nerds,
Atlanta-based Wolf Camera was already getting the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Long before other camera stores and processing plants gave the
Net or digital images a thought, a young district manager at Wolf _
a self-professed gadget freak named Cliff Whitney _ began to put
together some seemingly unrelated facts:
</P>
<P>
   (1) The Net and computer networking in general were becoming
realistic ways to move large amounts of data seamlessly across the
country, and (2) scanners that turned photographs into large hunks
of electronic data were becoming sophisticated enough to produce
commercial quality images.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney believed photos would be transported routinely some day
by computer networks. That would be important to privately held
Wolf Camera, which by then had grown from nine retail camera and
photo processing stores started in 1974 to a far-flung chain of 300
stores across the nation (there are 700 stores now in 30 states).
</P>
<P>
   Whitney had the fantastic notion that consumers would someday
take film to Wolf for processing and then be able to select the
shots to be printed from images on the Web. Whitney also believed
the distribution system would let Wolf move scanned images
internally, shifting processing work from a retail store to a
master lab cheaper and faster than by conventional transportation.
</P>
<P>
   So, Whitney took his idea to Chuck Wolf, founder and chief
executive of the camera and film processing chain, and _ instead of
a wide-eyed stare, _ Wolf told Whitney to ``take the next couple of
years and find out'' if the idea had merit.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on that meeting Wolf acknowledges that it seemed
like a far out notion:
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time I was hesitant,'' he said. ``In fact, I didn't
know what the heck he was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf trusted Whitney more than the idea and gave the
go-ahead. ``Now, at the year 2000, I'm excited that we made the
investment way before its time.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment has paid off for Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is no longer a district manager at Wolf. He's
president and chief operating officer of Wolf Xpress, the unit
responsible for all of Wolf's operations on the Internet and the
company's direct-to-consumer businesses. The reason it paid off for
Whitney is that the idea is now paying off for Wolf Camera.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney's success story isn't just a case of having an accurate
vision for the future. It also involved a lucky set of changes that
even Whitney didn't anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the importance to Wolf of working with electronic images
and moving them over the network, the last few years have brought
phenomenal growth in digital photography _ pictures made with
cameras that don't use film but memory chips to record images.
</P>
<P>
   And Whitney's early work positioned Wolf as a pioneer in the
huge marketplace of e-commerce, a niche that didn't exist when he
began his study.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be scared to death, or you can find a way to exploit
the changes,'' said Wayne Freedman, senior vice president of
marketing for Wolf Camera. ``The past is full of stories of doom.
When video cameras came out, the experts were wondering why anyone
would need a still camera. But not only did still cameras survive,
they prospered.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera's strategy is to acknowledge the growth of the new
technologies but to weave that growth into its established
business.
</P>
<P>
   So now Wolf routinely translates film into digital images and
ships them along its own network to a master processing lab in
Hapeville. Even some images that eventually will wind up as
conventional photographic prints are transmitted this way and _
during the process _ computerized editing programs let the lab
workers correct color faster and better. The resulting prints are
bright and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf also is one of the major participants in a new service
furnished by Ameria Online called ``You've Got Pictures,'' echoing
that online service's famous ``You've Got Mail.'' Customers take
the undeveloped film to one of several film processors (including
Wolf) and _ when the film is ready _ AOL announces loudly on the
customer's computer, ``You've Got Pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, the customer can select from the digital
images of the the photos displayed on his screen and order prints
to be picked up at the retailer. But the customer also can store up
to 50 pictures online. That way, family members and friends can log
on to AOL or _ for people who aren't AOL members, use the Web to
connect at pictures.aol.com _ and see the photos immediately.
</P>
<P>
   While the conventional prints are still picked up at the
retailer's location, or delivered by mail, the ability to view and
share the photos immediately sets this service apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL will do for online photography what it did for e-mail,''
said Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes that services such as ``You've Got Pictures''
are just the beginning for Wolf. Although unwilling to talk in
specifics about ongoing future projects, he said plans are under
way to make that sort of picture viewing possible at other outlets
such as ``restaurants, coffeehouses and places where people
gather'' using special kiosks or viewing terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be having coffee with you in a restaurant and be able
to punch up family pictures to show you right at the table,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While technology offers promise for Wolf, one new technology
seems, at first glance, to threaten conventional photo processors.
The growth of digital photography means that ordinary people are
able to take a picture, no film or developing required, and display
them immediately on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Once the picture has been taken, it can be transmitted as an
electronic image at no cost or printed out on increasingly
sophisticated ink jet printers. And all that can be done without
help from Wolf or any other photo processor.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitney thinks that the growth of digital photography is
good for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have about every gadget known to man, but I am not going to
sit at home and print my pictures out,'' he said. ``Technology is
supposed to save time.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman agrees with Whitney and points to the growing
popularity of commercial car washes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get all the material I need for a really professional
car wash at the store,'' he said. ``And I may even be able to do a
better job. But that hasn't killed the car wash business.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Freedman added, based on current technology ``a real
photograph has a 100-year life span if made on photographic paper,
but the life span of ink jet prints can literally be measured, in
some case, in months.''
</P>
<P>
   The prints that Wolf makes from film and from digital images are
done on photographic paper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of seeing the growth as harmful, Wolf Camera has
fine-tuned its strategy to take advantage of the trend. For
instance, all its retail stores now sell added services that are
likely to attract any photographer, including those who use digital
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that strikes me is the way they have
repositioned their business ... it's not just developing, but using
the pictures,'' said Pat Fitzpatrick, principal at Kurt Salmon and
Associates in Atlanta. ``Walk in the stores and you'll see other
examples ... calendars, photos on mouse pads, and (services that
offer) ease of photo manipulation. They can remove someone from the
family photo for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, digital photography _ while it's growing fast _ still
isn't a dominant force in the photo processing business. Industry
figures show that in 1999 there were about 3 billion digital images
taken, compared to 20 billion rolls of film (each roll offering 24
to 36 exposures). Whitney said that the industry expects the
percentages to shift by 2004. But, even then, projections are for
27 billion rolls of film and 9 billion digital exposures.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's plan, is to court the electronic side of the business,
but not to lose sight of its primary business which _ despite all
the changes _ is still taking a roll of film and turning it into
photographic memories for the family album.

 &HT;    Extra protein, calcium fuel the fuss over `plus' milk
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary, you're not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hillary Rodham Clinton moved to New York, she's had
occasion to do some of her own grocery shopping _ and she admits to
being a bit befuddled by all the choices on the dairy aisle,
especially skim milk ``plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the British press claims this shows how out of touch the
first lady-turned-senate candidate is with mainstream Americans.
But truth is, a lot of grocery-cart pushers in these parts don't
know what the ``plus'' stands for either.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they've been selling skim milk pumped up with extra
protein and calcium in California for several years. But locally,
``plus'' has only been widely available for about a year. And who
could notice it among all the products like 70 percent lactose-free
2 percent milk or fat-free half-and-half (do we even want to know
how they've pulled that one off)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Several processors offer `plus' milk now. I bought it for the
first time during the ice storm, when the grocery was out of my
regular milk,'' said Cheryl Hayn, manager of communications and
nutrition for the Southeast Dairy Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hayn said the milk is whiter and has a creamier texture _ an
attempt to satisfy those who find skim milk bluish and watery. But
it's still fat free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a fast-growing product,'' said Carlton Bates,
spokesman for Parmalat New Atlanta Dairies. Its Farmland Dairies
brand has offered ``plus'' milk in Atlanta for a couple of months;
Parmalat brand will hit the shelves in a couple of more months.
</P>
<P>
   Wait till Hillary sees all the new choices on the cereal aisle.

SOUTH AFRICA TO EXPAND PRIVATIZATION TO ATTRACT INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Eager for more foreign investment,
South Africa is promising to expand privatization in coming months
to its biggest state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   This effort, which had focused on restructuring and selling
smaller assets owned by the government, will now be aimed at
electric, transportation, telecommunications and military hardware
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the companies _ Eskom, Transnet, Telkom South
Africa and Denel, respectively _ are valued between $16 billion and
$20 billion and employ roughly three-quarters of the people working
for state enterprises. Many of their operations lose money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government can't continue to bear the cost,'' said
Katharine Butt of Business Map, an economic research firm. ``It's
putting a strain on the country, and it's not encouraging to
foreign investors to see how those parastatals are being run as an
example of how South Africa is being run.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to make the country attractive to those investors,
President Thabo Mbeki said in his state of the union message last
weekend that a team of blue-chip international financiers would
serve as advisers to the government. The newly created
International Investment Council will include the financier George
Soros; the chairman of Mitsubishi, Minoru Makihara, and
DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Juergen E. Schrempp. The advisers will
guide the government as it works to speed privatization.
</P>
<P>
   After some difficult years, South Africa's economy has been
drawing encouraging reviews in the last few months from investors
and analysts who welcome the declining inflation rate and improved
fiscal discipline. With an accelerated privatization effort,
economic policy-makers hope to build on that success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cornerstone of the policy path they've embarked
upon,'' said professor Ben Smit, director of the Bureau for
Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch. ``If you want
to see sustained growth, growth beyond that 3 or 3.5 percent
ceiling, privatization is going to be important.''
</P>
<P>
   The planning for the country's post-apartheid economy had
envisioned an important role for privatization. But progress has
been far slower than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Sivi Gounden, director-general of the country's public
enterprises department, said in an interview: ``Having reviewed our
efforts on restructuring and privatization over the past four
years, we felt that any acceleration needed to target the big four
enterprises. If you look at the services those enterprises provide,
the number of people they employ and the capital they require, it's
clear why.''
</P>
<P>
   The reach of these companies extends beyond South Africa into
much of the southern part of the continent, and the effects of
their restructuring will ripple across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Telkom is likely to be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
by next year, and Eskom, or one of its eventual spinoffs, may be
listed as well. Already, Telkom and South African Airways, a
Transnet subsidiary, have sold minority stakes to foreign
investors. And by the end of March, the government will firm up its
blueprint for drawing capital to the big state companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues it is grappling with are the considerable debt
carried by some state enterprises, burdensome regulations and the
prospect of large-scale layoffs in a country with severe
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere are these issues more pronounced than at
Transnet, the vast web of government-run transportation operations,
which is more than $4 billion in debt. To attract investors, some
of that debt will almost certainly have to be assumed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Spoornet, Transnet's money-losing rail subsidiary, is one reason
the debt has increased. Last week, the government announced plans
to sell one of Spoornet's more attractive lines. But as in many
parts of this privatization process, it will probably take changes
in regulations to convince potential investors that the rail line
can be profitable. Current rules favor road transport of freight.
</P>
<P>
   Union reaction to the privatization plans is a politically
sensitive matter. Last week, the Congress of South African Trade
Unions organized demonstrations to draw attention to the loss of
jobs in the South African economy, a problem to which Spoornet
could soon be contributing.
</P>
<P>
   The Spoornet restructuring plan has proposed laying off as many
as 27,000 workers to make the rail company profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in our mind that there is a need for
restructuring,'' said Mukoni Ratshitanga, the trade union congress
spokesman. ``But whether that restructuring should mean
privatization, or bringing in an equity partner, or revamping the
institution, are things that need to be analyzed case by case. You
can't just make a blanket commitment.''

 &HT;        A Story of Steel   By Laura J. Winter   c. 2000 States News
<TEXT>
Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (Feb. 8) - Best-selling novelist Danielle
Steel put her pen aside Tuesday to tell a senate committee that
early intervention could have saved her manic-depressive son from
suicide.
<P>
   ``I turned to doctors and psychiatrists throughout his early
childhood and was always told he was fine,'' Steel said. ``I felt
in my heart that that was not true, although I wanted it to be
true. I sensed there were terrible demons lurking deep within.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel's son, Nick Traina, was 19 when he committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Capitol Hill was tabulating the political pros and
cons of the president's 2001 budget proposal, the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education listened to Steel, Surgeon General David Satcher and
others testify to suicide's human costs.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher reported that every 17 minutes someone in the United
States takes their own life. Suicide is the third leading cause of
death among 10- to 24-year-olds. Satcher added that for every two
homicides there are three suicides.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general told the subcommittee chairman Sen. Arlen
Specter R-Pa. that his administration was preparing to launch a
national strategy addressing suicide by the end of this year. While
Satcher emphasized the need to de-stigmatize mental illness, one
theme was common among all of the witnesses - early detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer good enough to diagnose bi-polars
(manic-depressive) in their 20's as was the tradition. They are
sick long before that. They need help long before that. They die
long before that,'' Steel said.
</P>
<P>
   Steel, an author whose steamy romance novels have remained on
the ``The New York Times'' bestseller list for more than 390
consecutive weeks, wrote one piece of non-fiction about her son's
struggle to stay alive - ``His Bright Light.'' Steel said because
most doctors felt his high I.Q. was the root of his emotional
troubles, he went undiagnosed and untreated until he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read his journals after his death, I discovered that
from age 11 on he had written about killing himself every single
day,'' Steel said. ``It took another 8 years to accomplish it.''

REP. KENNEDY SEES CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST SURGE THROUGH INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Taking advantage of a hot stock market and a
little-used section of the campaign finance law, US Representative
Joseph P. Kennedy's invested his campaign funds on Wall Street last
year, earning nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy now has $2.3 million in his campaign account, up from
the $1.4 million he had when he left office in January 1999. In the
process he never made a solicitation or threw a fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, his former colleagues in the Massachusets
delegation aggressively twisted arms, hit up special interests, and
hardly came close to matching Kennedy's investment income.
</P>
<P>
   For example, US Representative Joseph Moakley led the delegation
in fundraising, taking in $714,589 in contributions. Representative
Martin Meehan, whose $1.5 million account is the largest among the
Bay State congressman, raised $692,063 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' said a leading state Democrat. ``Here all
the incumbents are out there busting their humps aggressively
raising money and Joe raises more and doesn't raise a finger.''
</P>
<P>
   The money goes to his campaign account and is not available for
personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's money put his funds in Investor's Bank &AMP; Trust Company
of Boston, a blind trust, which collected over $31,000 in fees
during the last six months of 1999. Kennedy paid $236,144 in bills,
including a $75,000 bill to the Internal Revenue Service and a
$25,000 payments to the Massachusetts tax department.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of campaign funds comes also as Kennedy, who served
in the House for six terms after his election in 1986 from the 8th
District, is taking a hiatus from political life.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old Kennedy has returned to Citizens Energy
Corporation, the non-profit firm he created in 1979 to provide low
priced heating oil to the elderly and poor. The firm also has other
ventures, including several for-profit spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the former congressman said he had no comment
about his political funds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the nearly $1 million increase in his account is sure to
fuel speculation that he is plotting a return to public life.
Political insiders in Massachusets are deeply divided on whether
Kennedy will run for governor in 2002. Some are convinced he will,
but others say he has given clear signals he has no intentions of
jumping into the race. Others say he may want to wait to take over
the US Senate seat his uncle, Edward M. Kennedy, now holds.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, although a strong favorite among Democrats, suddenly
withdrew from the 1998 gubernatorial race and then six months later
stunned the political world when he announced he would not seek
reelection to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy would face a legal problem in using his huge campaign
account if he decided to seek the governorship. In a quiet move
pulled off in the late afternoon before Thanksgiving in 1998, the
House and Senate, in cooperation with Governor Paul Cellucci,
passed a bill _ without debate _ that would bar the use of federal
funds to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, engineered by Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham, who is planning a gubernatorial campaign, was seen as a
way to undercut the threat of someone like Kennedy or Meehan from
running for governor. Birmingham argued that the new law was
designed to match Congress's ban on the use of state campaign funds
from federal campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy could easily circumvent the law by donating the
funds to the Democratic state party for use in 2002 as part of its
so-called coordinated campaign for the state-wide ticket. The money
could be used for polling, advertising and other general support
once Kennedy won the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's successful investments proved far more succesful _ and
far more easier gained _ than the aggressive fundraising his former
colleagues did during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's strategy is unusual but not unique. But investing
campaign funds is risky. Some have lost money such as
Representative Tom Campbell, a Republican from California who is
now running for a US Senate seat. His campaign account shrank after
some bad investments.

COMMENTARY: THE JAPAN SYNDROME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Japan's Kansai International Airport was being planned,
there was considerable uncertainty over how much the artificial
island on which it sits would sink. The officials in charge chose
to accept the lowest, most favorable estimate; as it turned out,
the reality has been worse than even the most pessimistic estimate,
and despite expensive emergency measures _ and continual assurances
from those officials that everything is under control _ the island
is still sinking.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad metaphor for the story of Japanese economic
policy in recent years. Japan's government keeps on insisting that
its economic strategy has put the nation on the road to sustained
recovery, brushing aside both the doubts of outside economists and
the growing evidence that the strategy is not, in fact, working.
For most of the past year this unwarranted confidence has been
supported by a strange consensus on the part of investment
analysts, who somehow became committed as a group to the view that
Japan's economy is on the mend.
</P>
<P>
   And so it came as a shock last Sunday when a senior official
admitted that the Japanese economy has almost certainly been
shrinking for the last two quarters, which means that by the usual
definition it has slipped back into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has the dubious distinction of being the first major
nation since the 1930s to experience a ``liquidity trap,'' in which
even cutting the interest rate all the way to zero doesn't induce
enough business investment to restore full employment. The result
is an economy that has been depressed since the early '90s, and
that in 1998 seemed to be on the verge of a catastrophic
deflationary spiral.
</P>
<P>
   The government's answer has been to prop up demand with deficit
spending; over the past few years Japan has been frantically
building bridges to nowhere and roads it doesn't need. In the short
run this policy works: in the first half of 1999, powered by a
burst of public works spending, the Japanese economy grew fairly
rapidly. But deficit spending on such a scale cannot go on much
longer. Japan's government is already deeply in debt (about twice
as deep, relative to national income, as the United States was
before our own budget turned around). For the policy to do more
than buy a little time, the recovery must become
``self-sustaining'': consumers and businesses have to start
spending enough to allow the government to return to fiscal
responsibility without provoking a new recession.
</P>
<P>
   Carping critics (like me) warned that there was no good reason
to think this would happen. Sure enough, it hasn't; as the big
public works projects of early 1999 have wound down, so has the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   What can Japan do? One answer is ``reform'': Deregulation and a
breakup of the cozy collusion that still characterizes much
Japanese business could open up new investment opportunities. But
this is at best a long-term answer; in the short run, by making
workers feel insecure, it could actually make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   The other answer is ``roll the printing presses.'' Although the
Bank of Japan has already reduced the short-term interest rate to
zero, Western economists have pointed out that there are other
things it can and should do: Buy longer-term bonds, announce a
positive target for inflation to encourage businesses to borrow.
Indeed, textbook economics tells us that to adhere to conventional
monetary rules in the face of a liquidity trap is not prudent; it
is irresponsible. (Full disclosure: I personally have been the most
visible and vociferous advocate of inflation targeting).
</P>
<P>
   But the current government has actually slowed the pace of
reform, and the Bank of Japan _ which only recently acquired
Federal Reserve-style autonomy _ has adamantly refused to do
anything unconventional. (When I was in Japan in December, I
witnessed an argument between former BOJ officials and current
officials of the Ministry of Finance. The former declared that it
would be wrong to do anything risky; the latter reminded them, to
no avail, that the current policy of running up huge debts to
finance public works is already very risky.)
</P>
<P>
   Will the bad news make them reconsider? Don't count on it: Since
Sunday's awkward admission, Japanese officials have been out in
force, insisting as usual that they have everything under control.

A DECLARATION ... OF LOVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fact: Sally Hemings was a beautiful light-skinned slave of mixed
race at Thomas Jefferson's landmark Virginia plantation,
Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Hemings as a teen-ager accompanied Jefferson's younger
daughter, Mary, to France in 1787 to serve as her lady's maid while
the widowed Jefferson was ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Hemings, unmarried, bore six children over the next
several years, all of whom looked white and at least some of whom
were tall, red-haired and freckled.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Thomas Jefferson, who was tall, red-haired and freckled,
traveled frequently but according to his journals was at Monticello
when each of Sally's children was conceived, with the exception of
her first, Tom Hemings, who was conceived while she and Jefferson
were in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: In 1998, DNA results from descendants of Eston Hemings,
Sally's youngest, showed he was the son of Thomas Jefferson, and
the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, the research institution
that maintains Monticello, last month conceded it is at least
possible Jefferson fathered the others as well.
</P>
<P>
   This information on its own might occupy a half-hour on PBS or
flesh out a ``Biography'' hour on A&AMP;E, but it wouldn't sustain a
four-hour miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   So with CBS' blessing, writer Tina Andrews connected the dots
and filled in the dramatic blanks to create ``Sally Hemings: An
American Scandal,'' a romantic tale of forbidden love, 19th-century
politics and the protection of a national hero's image and legacy.
It airs 9 p.m. Sunday and Feb. 16 and stars Sam Neill and Carmen
Ejogo.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's a two-night sweeps-period special that may be enjoyed
or criticized for its soap-opera story elements and the
romance-novel look of its publicity photos.
</P>
<P>
   But at its core is a 200-year-old debate centered on conflicting
``truths'' about this very underdocumented aspect of Jefferson's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the American public's curiosity about our third
president and the revered author of the Declaration of
Independence, there are hundreds of living descendants of Sally
Hemings who seek public validation of what they have known with
certainty for years: that they are Jefferson's kin as well,
according to oral histories and family records kept in their
Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them want the privileges afforded the members of the
Monticello Association _ the descendants of Jefferson's white
daughters, Martha and Mary _ be it burial on the grounds of
Monticello or the right to politely refuse that honor. Others would
be happy just to hear the Hemings story as they know it told by the
guides who lead thousands of tourists through the plantation each
year.
</P>
<P>
   As she read and wrote in her Los Angeles office, Andrews had
pictures all over her walls of Hemings descendants going back to
the grandchildren of Thomas and Sally.
</P>
<P>
   With the miniseries completed, Andrews waited with anticipation
last month for the announcement of a new development in the
Jefferson-Hemings story. On Jan. 26, the Jefferson foundation
released its own study concurring with the Eston Hemings DNA
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was how happy I am for the family, because all
they have wanted is simple recognition and acknowledgment for 213
years,'' Andrews said. ``That's all. Just the acknowledgement that
they exist because those two people had a relationship, no matter
how that relationship is characterized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It produced children who had children who had children who had
children, and now they can in many ways hold their heads up knowing
their oral history has, in fact, proven true. The one thing I'm now
hoping is that the sons and daughters of Jefferson and Hemings can
hold hands with the sons and daughters of the Jefferson descendants
and realize that they are all one family.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the chances of a group hug are slim to none. The
descendants of Sally's children _ Thomas (Hemings) Woodson, Madison
Hemings and Eston Hemings _ would welcome it, but there are only a
few from the Jefferson side that seem ready to take that step.
</P>
<P>
   Among those is Marla Randolph Stevens, a 48-year-old lobbyist in
Indianapolis whose family stems from Martha Randolph, Jefferson's
older daughter with wife Martha. She not only accepts her Hemings
kinship, she accepts the idea that there were blood ties between
the two branches before Sally was born.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hemings oral history, Sally's father was John
Wayles, a plantation owner who was the father of Jefferson's
beloved wife. That would make Sally and Mrs. Jefferson
half-sisters, hence Jefferson's remark to Sally in the movie that
she bears a striking resemblance to his late wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways we're just quibbling about how many ways we're
half- cousins,'' Stevens said. ``We're already all family, and we
need to behave like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the name-calling is not helpful, and it divides
people,'' she said. ``And I want to try to help the people who are
willing to listen see that it started out with love and it needs to
end that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that it was love is another point of contention. The
miniseries portrays the relationship as warm, passionate and
steadfast until Jefferson's death in 1826.
</P>
<P>
   There is little direct evidence of a love affair, such as
journal entries or love letters, but Andrews found her premise in
circumstantial proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, it was 38 years,'' she said. ``She got 38 years older.
If it was only sex, he'd have moved on to another woman on the
plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes that Jefferson, widowed at age 38, would
have remarried before he ran for president as political advisers
suggested if his relationship with Sally were just a ``slave
romp.'' She also notes Jefferson neither admitted nor denied the
relationship when newspaper accounts by gossip monger James T.
Callender _ the Matt Drudge of his day _ were printed in 1802.
</P>
<P>
   Neill, a New Zealander, said he knew about Jefferson's role in
history but knew nothing of his private life before this project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most compelling evidence to me that this was not simply a
master- slave relationship, that this was based on at least some
mutual respect and affection, is that after he died and she was
freed and she lived quite a ways from Monticello, she walked up
that hill every week and tended his grave,'' Neill said. ``You
don't do that for someone whose memory you don't hold dear. She
would never have gone back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is just in hindsight that we build monuments to
people and they become sort of less human somehow,'' Neill added.
``I find (the relationship) entirely plausible and understandable
somehow. He was a widower for many years. You can't just sort of
read Ovid for the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Jefferson foundation, keeper of his memory as well
as his estate, is not yet willing to concede that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was love or lust, rape or romance, no one knows _
and it's unlikely that anyone will ever know,'' foundation
president Dan Jordan said last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first step was to prepare and release the report,'' Jordan
said in a phone interview this week. ``Now we are looking at how it
might change our interpretation of the issue at Monticello.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes to revise the Hemings account ``sooner rather
than later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious to get on with it, but we want to get it right,
and that takes a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hemings descendants feel certain they already know the
truth. Some 800 of them gathered last weekend in Columbus, Ohio,
for a screening of the miniseries. Julia Jefferson Westerinen, who
traces her roots to Eston Hemings (he changed his name to E.H.
Jefferson), described it as ``wall-to-wall relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens says the Jefferson-Hemings affair cannot do serious harm
to her ancestor's memory. ``It doesn't unwrite the Declaration of
Independence, it doesn't blow up the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a little girl, I always loved the fact that he never could
really get the (Monticello) dome right,'' she said. ``I always
loved that there was this tangible proof that he wasn't perfect,
because being a descendant of his carries a heavy load. It made him
more like a grandpa and less like an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hemings story ``doesn't make him NOT an icon,'' she added.
``It just creates a better balance, an accessible balance.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Thrashers prepare for final exams
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pittsburgh _ The team is in last place, the general manager is
bouncing from Stockholm to Helsinki, and the immediate future is
bleak. And, yes, there is a thread among the three.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' next significant highlight might not be tonight
against the Pittsburgh Penguins or Friday against San Jose or at
any point during their final 30 games of their first season. The
next highlight might be June 24 _ at the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win, and the coaches are trying to win games every
night,'' Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said earlier this
week before leaving on a European scouting trip. ``We would never
put ourselves in a position of saying, `We're going to lose this
game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But certainly it looks like we're going to get one of the top
five picks in the draft,'' Waddell said. ``We're not going to make
the playoffs. If you're not going to make the playoffs, you might
as well finish down toward the bottom and get another top-end
player who you're going to have for 10 or 12 years, like Patrik
Stefan.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11-35-6, the Thrashers have the NHL's worst record. They have
five games remaining against teams that aren't currently in a
playoff race _ two against the New York Islanders, one each against
Chicago, Montreal and Calgary. As a result, 25 games will be
against more talented teams.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Curt Fraser went into the season thinking that the
Thrashers' win total would be in the ``high 20s.'' He was hoping
for 29, one more than Nashville won in its first season. But most
of those ``potential'' 20-goal scorers Waddell referred to after
the expansion draft have turned into fourth-line checkers. Some
veteran defensemen didn't pan out, and goaltender Damian Rhodes has
spent more time in the trainer's room with a sprained ankle than on
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said he spent the All-Star break ``trying to figure out
some way we can sneak into the playoffs through the backdoor.''

TEXAS REPUBLICANS CALL CLINTON'S BORDER PROPOSAL INADEQUATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PHILIP CAUTHON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's proposal to hire another 430
border patrol agents next year drew fire Tuesday from two Texas
Republicans for not going far enough to protect the nation's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 2001 budget proposal, released Monday, would add the
agents for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 1996,
Congress approved legislation authorizing the administration to
hire 1,000 new agents each year until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our border is a sieve,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a
Texas Republican who helped push the 1,000-agent mandate through
Congress. ``The administration has not followed Congress' intent on
hiring 1,000 agents and I will fight for a thousand as I have for
the last three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio and a critic of the INS, called
the president's proposal inadequate and accused him of ignoring
growing threats from terrorists and drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration ... lacks the will to provide the agents
for border security that we need,'' said Allen Kay, spokesman for
Smith. ``The contrast between Congress' bipartisan mandate on
border patrol and the administration's flailing around on this
issue is stark.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has also urged Clinton to heighten
border enforcement. Bush, who is running for the White House, led a
coalition of border-state governors in asking the president to
comply with Congress' 1,000-agent mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government needs to do a better job enforcing the
border,'' said Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   During budget negotiations last year, Clinton fended off demands
by Congress to hire more agents.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure mounted on the administration to beef up border
security in the wake of two high-profile criminal cases involving
illegal immigrants. In June, suspected murderer Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez was released by immigration authorities and killed
four people soon after, according to authorities. More recently,
immigration officials arrested Ahmed Ressam in Washington state
after he crossed the Canadian border in a car loaded with
bomb-making equipment. Authorities said that arrest was made
largely by chance.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said hiring the 1,000 agents mandated
by Congress is unrealistic because of tight labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said that the 2001 INS budget had
to balance strengthening border enforcement with ``efforts to
recruit and retain the best agents in a tight labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardona said that because retaining agents was a ``big problem''
last year, the INS is asking for $69 million for promotions and pay
increases. This is part of the $4.8 billion Clinton asked Congress
to set aside for INS in 2001. If approved, it would amount to a
budget increase of just over 11 percent. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; While there is bipartisan agreement to upgrade salaries,
Congress wants the agency to focus on increasing the number of
immigration agents along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said the administration lacks commitment to improving
service for legitimate immigrants. At Smith's prodding, the INS
reduced its average processing time for applications from 28 months
to 6 months. But Smith said that 6 months is still too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of immigrants waiting for green cards and other
benefits has approached 3 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the new budget would create an account to
complement funds obtained by application fees. INS officials
anticipate the fund _ the first of its kind _ will supply around
$127 million, in part through a new premium-service fee for
business applications.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona said that money would ``go a long way'' in improving INS
service.

AETNA AND CIGNA REPORT GAINS IN OPERATING INCOME, BUT SHARES DROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc., the nation's biggest health insurer, said Tuesday
its operating income rose 20 percent in the fourth quarter. But
Wall Street analysts said the underlying numbers were
disappointing, reflecting deterioration in Aetna's core health
business and losses overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna Corp., the No. 3 managed health care insurer, said
operating income rose 31 percent to $296 million, or $1.66 a share,
in the quarter, far exceeding the $1.38 expected by analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, Aetna shares
plummeted $9.75, or 17 percent, to $46. Most managed care stocks
also dropped. Cigna declined $1.50 to $74.75.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Huber, chairman and chief executive of Aetna,
stressed the positive: a greater than anticipated 3.1 percent
increase to 15.9 million members of the Aetna U.S. Healthcare
health maintenance organizations, not counting 5.1 million
customers of the recently acquired Prudential Healthcare unit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Prudential unit ``met our expectations.'' Projected
annual losses at Prudential declined $50 million in the quarter to
$150 million, the company said. Aetna said the Prudential loss
would fall $100 million further late this year and disappear in
early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts were concerned about medical costs, led by
prescription drugs and hospital stays, which appeared to be
overrunning rate increases. They saw the cost increases as a
warning of continuing uncertainty about Aetna's ability to turn
Prudential around. Losses at Prudential have been softened by fees
and other payments to Aetna that will end on Jan. 1., 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear on Wall Street is that Prudential will hurt them in
10 months'' when those payments end, said Todd Richter, a health
care analyst at Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said rising medical costs absorbed 83.1 percent of
revenues at the Aetna U.S. Healthcare HMOs in the quarter, up from
82.6 percent in the same period the year before. When Prudential
HMOs were added, the combined cost ratio rose to 84.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Costs at Medicare HMOs rose even faster, to 95.3 percent
compared with 92.6 in the 1998 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The increases included ``higher-than-anticipated medical costs''
in the preceding quarter, which surfaced in the final quarter,
Aetna said. Lori M. Price, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said
Aetna had been ``underestimating its medical costs for the past few
quarters.'' She added, ``Part of what we're seeing is a catchup
from past underestimates.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hoehn, an analyst at Ing Barings, said that raised an
issue that has plagued a number of health insurance mergers: ``the
degree of integration of information systems'' of the merging
companies and ``the ability to process medical claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Goodman at Merrill Lynch added that the ``most important
increase was in hospital costs,'' especially for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said premiums were
raised 10 percent in January, a month when most big employers renew
contracts. But analysts said the increase was only 6 percent or 7
percent after employers trimmed their coverage to hold down their
own costs. The underlying costs of medical care, meanwhile, are
also rising by 6 percent to 7 percent, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said profits from operations were $173 million, or $1.18 a
share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $144.4 million, or 91
cents a share. Earnings included $33 million from the sale of
securities owned by a Brazilian affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings in Brazil were weak, Huber acknowledged, reflecting a
recession there and price controls, which Aetna said were
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   The Aetna U.S. Healthcare operating earnings, before Y2K costs,
were $127.1 million, up from $112.9 million in the 1998 quarter.
Earnings from overseas units that sell health and life insurance
and retirement products were $52.7 million, including the $33
million one-time gain in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna said its HMO earnings rose 31 percent to $118 million in
the quarter. Non-HMO health insurance gained 10 percent to $113
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly an excellent quarter,'' said Abramowitz at
Bernstein. Wendell Potter, a spokesman for Cigna, noted that share
repurchases had added to the $1.66 earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman at Merrill Lynch said the fourth quarter earnings were
also swelled by a Cigna practice of deliberately underestimating
income in the earlier quarters.

 &HT;    New era for the ASO
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robert Spano _ the 38-year-old music director of the
Brooklyn Philharmonic and one of the brightest stars in the new
generation of American conductors _ has been named music director
of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual collaborative partnership, Spano will share
responsibilities with San Francisco Opera music director Donald
Runnicles, who has been named ASO principal guest conductor. Both
have signed four-year contracts, and both plan to continue their
current engagements in New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments, approved by the ASO board Tuesday, end a
two-year search to replace conductor Yoel Levi, who departs this
summer after a rocky, 12-year tenure. They also signal a new era
for the orchestra, which has had just three conductors in its 56
years and whose $23 million budget makes it the Southeast's largest
cultural organization.
</P>
<P>
   Though Spano and Runnicles have met only once _ at a hastily
arranged Hartsfield International Airport interlude in December _
they are charged with sharing ideas in a culture that has long been
the domain of autocratic, baton-wielding maestros. They will
program concerts together. Both will play visible roles in
education and community-outreach efforts. And since both are
seasoned pianists, they are certain to appear onstage in chamber
music concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, says ASO President Allison Vulgamore, ``They really
dig each other.'' She says she will serve as ``facilitator'' for
the two artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time in which so many fine orchestras are actively
searching for musical leadership, to be able to get someone of
Spano's stature, experience and vision is a real coup,'' said Joe
Bankoff, the King &AMP; Spalding attorney and ASO board member who led
the search.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Spano _ an urbane, intensely wired chain-smoker who is
often compared to the young Leonard Bernstein _ has been mentioned
as a candidate for music director positions from New York and
Boston to Atlanta and Houston. A protege of Boston Symphony
Orchestra music director Seiji Ozawa and director of the BSO's
conducting program at Tanglewood, he is known for cutting-edge
programs that appeal to even the most jaded, black-clad New
Yorkers. His celebrity status was signaled by recent appearances on
``Late Night With David Letterman'' and ``CBS Sunday Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling from Cardiff, Wales, where he is conducting a Welsh
National Opera production of ``Cosi fan tutte,'' Spano said: ``The
orchestra is so terrific. It's just great making music with them,
and the thought of doing more of that is really tantalizing.'' He
said he is especially interested in partnering with arts
institutions such as the High Museum of Art and the Alliance
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor, who plans to buy a home in Atlanta, comes to town
Sunday and Monday to greet ASO staff, musicians, volunteers and
press. He will visit an elementary school, a Rotary Club and the
Georgia Council of the Arts, where he'll meet Gov. Roy Barnes.
He'll be back for ASO concerts May 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world and in Atlanta, colleagues praised his
appointment. More than one observer pointed out that Robert Spano
has the same initials as a previous ASO conductor, the late Robert
Shaw. Others say he has the kind of magnetism needed to build a new
Symphony Hall, a goal that looms large on the ASO agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Japan, where he was vacationing, Ozawa said: ``I
believe in him so much. I am very, very happy. I congratulate the
ASO for choosing him. That will be very positive for your city's
future.'' Calling Spano a man with ``a very big heart,'' he said,
``for me, there is no ego when he works. That, I think, is a good
sign for a future conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Seattle Symphony music director Gerard Schwarz: ``Of the
younger generation of conductors, internationally, he is clearly
among the stars. Hopefully, he'll take that great orchestra in that
phenomenal community and run with it. There are few orchestras in
the country that have the potential of what's happening in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very encouraging suggestion about the way the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra might be heading,'' said Tim Page, the former
classical music critic of The Washington Post who is now the
artistic adviser to the St. Louis Symphony. ``He is definitely one
of the most exciting, adventurous and solid of the younger
generation of American conductors. I'm delighted with the
appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, Spano will open the 2000-2001 ASO season with
soprano Sylvia McNair in a program of opera arias and American
classics. He'll return for four additional weeks, to be announced
later. Runnicles, who is 45 and a two-time Grammy nominee, will
appear with the ASO for two weeks next season. The duo's first full
year will be the 2001-2002 season, during which Spano will conduct
14 weeks of concerts and Runnicles six. By comparison, Levi held an
18-week contract.
</P>
<P>
   Runnicles said he found in the ASO ``all the qualities that turn
me on.'' He also praised Atlanta audiences. ``It's a terrific
public,'' he said from San Francisco. ``I think together we have to
get to know that public and get out into the community and see what
the community wants to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Spano, whose Brooklyn contract also runs through the year 2004,
is a sushi addict who is said to enjoy an occasional post-concert
martini. He smiles when he is conducting, and when he becomes
engaged in conversation, his nose wrinkles with childlike, almost
impish, excitement. He is an ambassador for classical music in the
way that Wynton Marsalis is for jazz or Michael Feinstein is for
the American songbook. He says he doesn't have an e-mail address,
but with so much collaboration in the works, he intends to get one
immediately. He is a serious composer. He's single.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fun to sit down and eat with,'' says Alvin Singleton, the
Emory University music professor who was on the search committee.
``He's a real person. He tells jokes you understand. He's also very
serious. He reads a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Fuller, an ASO board member who served on the search
committees that picked both Spano and Levi, said of the music
director designate: ``Oh, he's just very easy to talk to. He's an
absolutely wonderful communicator. He's a listener and he's a very
quick study and he gets right to the point _ my kind of person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other conductor who has been on
`Letterman' twice in the last year,'' said Gregg Gustafson,
executive director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic. ``He's gotten the
attention of a media that rarely pays attention to anything in our
world, and it certainly raises our profile.''
</P>
<P>
   By recruiting a critics' darling with a knack for creative
contemporary programming, the ASO is positioning itself for greater
recognition and record sales. Spano is one of the most sought-after
conductors in the world, yet he has made no symphonic recordings.
``I think Robert is going to be very hot with that young
(professional) market,'' Vulgamore said. ``We've done something
very big here by stealing him. ''
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Brooklyn Philharmonic in 1996, Spano has
weathered turbulent financial times. With a budget of about $2
million, the orchestra does just five concerts per season. In 1998,
after an unstable period during which it was managed by the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, the orchestra severed that relationship.
Its 3,000-member subscriber base had dwindled to about 400. By this
season, it was up to 900. And yet such lean conditions are said to
fuel Spano's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in those times of change, it releases a certain kind
of energy that feeds Robert and that he thrives on,'' said
Gustafson. ``So I think he will feel right at home in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few years at the ASO haven't exactly been a tea party.
Levi's time was marked, at first, by enormous popularity. But after
a musicians' strike in 1996, the board extended his contract for
two years and asked him to leave afterward. Subsequently, his
partisans tried to storm the board. With the new team, Vulgamore
emerges with more power and an eye on the institution's artistic,
as well as fiscal, well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say that such a structure might be wise. ``If an
organization is focused on ideas and problem-solving and strategy
rather than a cult of personality,'' Gustafson said, ``that's a
healthy thing in American society.''

 &HT;    Callaway additions inaugurate a new era
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Feb. 10.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN _ At first glance, Callaway Gardens' newest
additions _ a different entrance and a welcome center _ are
attractive structures for helping visitors better enjoy the Pine
Mountain, Ga., park and resort.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at the $14 million entry route and Virginia
Hand Callaway Discovery Center, set to open Feb. 21, reveals a new
direction for the gardens. They are a major step toward accessing
Callaway's 8,000 acres of undeveloped woodlands so visitors can
explore the area's native plants and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Discovery Center will be a great place to orient our
guests as to what we have to offer and serve as a perfect launch
site for an array of new opportunities in the lower valley,'' said
George Fischer, Callaway's president.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are part of Callaway's long-range intent to operate
much like a national park.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens, founded in 1952 by Callaway and her husband, Cason,
feature a leading botanical center and championship golf resort.
The 2,500-acre attraction is known for its azalea collection,
butterfly center and vegetable garden, where PBS' ``Victory
Garden'' series had been taped.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Callaway launched a 40-acre Azalea Bowl, a
collection of both exotic and native plants, and in its newest
phase, it will move its entrance from U.S. 27 to the intersection
of Ga. 18 and 354 and open nearly two miles of entry roads.
``People have been coming through the old entrance for 48 years, so
there will be an adjustment period. But the new one is such a
beautiful drive,'' said Rachel Crumbley, Callaway public relations
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will get to experience more of the gardens along the
road encircling Mountain Creek Lake, which now requires most to
drive from point to point. The new route will take them past
meadows, vineyards and woodlands directly to the heart of the
garden _ the new Discovery Center.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, which opens on what would have been Virginia
Callaway's 100th birthday, visitors will park their cars and tour a
35,000-square-foot facility that includes a 100-seat orientation
theater, exhibits on the history and geography of the gardens,
classroom space, auditorium, cafe and gift shop. A
3,000-square-foot museum area will house an exhibit of the gardens'
Athos Menaboni collection of bird paintings.
</P>
<P>
   From the center, visitors will set out for attractions either by
foot, bike, tram or water taxi across the lake. One benefit of the
new hub is its proximity to the lower valley, which has been
off-limits to visitors. Plans call for making that area accessible
and offering activities there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camping, horseback riding and viewing indigenous Southeastern
flora and fauna are just a few of the possibilities being explored
for this area,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this spring Callaway plans to open a wildflower
trail, which will be an affiliate of the National Wildflower
Research Center in Austin, Texas. The center was founded by former
first lady Lady Bird Johnson, a member of Callaway's board of
visitors, who plans to attend the dedication, Crumbley said.

 &HT;    Ladylike looks romance runways
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion's new wave of femininity _ embroidery and
beading, vivid colors, fringe and delicate fabrics of spring
apparel hitting stores now _ continues with the fall/winter 2000
styles now previewing on the runways. The ladylike look digs in
even deeper for fall, with form-fitting silhouettes, romantic
colors (wine, cognac, rose, olive oil), luxuriant materials (shiny,
metallic or lacquered) and dressier separates emerging as trends.
</P>
<P>
   Heel heights are going up. Skirt lengths are coming down. Pants
are tightening, and the range of hair, makeup and accessories is
growing for a really put-together look.
</P>
<P>
   These pictures from New York's runway shows this week
demonstrate how ``dolled up'' style-conscious women will want to
look. Fortunately, designers are devising such an array of apparel,
finding clothes that stress the woman in you shouldn't be hard to
find.

 &HT;    Love affair with fur still going strong
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The anti-fur protest movement isn't dead yet. It just
looks feeble.
</P>
<P>
   There's far too much evidence _ at the fall/winter 2000 runway
shows and on the streets of Manhattan _that fur is still a cuddly
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far during Fashion Week, fur's flying high. Mink, fox and
sable _ either as trim on garments or as full-blown outerwear
pieces _ are showing up so frequently that they're starting to
bore. And there are so many furs during freezing conditions that
fur coats don't distinguish celebs from commoners anymore. Some fur
industry analysts report sales increases of up to 25 percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Proof positive that groups like PETA (People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals) are waging a losing battle came Tuesday
during Oscar de la Renta's runway show. Midway through, two women
leapt from their seats and waved banners that read ``Fur Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience was slightly taken aback, but de la Renta's models
took the protest in stride. A photographer swooped in to tackle
them to the floor and they were soon led away. The show went on.
Attendees including Vogue's Anna Wintour and Andre Leon Talley, and
Ivana Trump, some of fur's greatest advocates, were wrapped in fur.
</P>
<P>
   To punctuate their pro-fur stance, many in the crowd applauded
anything that even looked like fur throughout the rest of the show.
Admired as they may be for the sincerity of their convictions,
anti-fur activists are still getting the cold shoulder.

 &HT;    Thomas had connection with kids
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Read a story to a child tonight, and think of Derrick
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the nine-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Kansas City
Chiefs who was paralayzed in an automobile accident last month,
died Tuesday morning after suffering a cardio-respiratory arrest at
Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   His voice is silenced, and the inner-city children of Kansas
City _ from Lucille Buford Library at 31st and Prospect to Smith
Hale and Northeast and Liberty and Paul Robeson and Central middle
schools _ must wonder if anyone will ever speak as clearly to them
as Thomas once did.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Brown wonders, too.
</P>
<P>
   She's president of the ``Third and Long Foundation'' literacy
program Thomas founded in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick just had that touch about him with the kids,'' Brown
said Tuesday afternoon only hours after hearing of Thomas' death.
``There was a connection. He was a safe haven for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown wasn't there at the start when Thomas came up with the
idea of going to a library on Saturdays when the Chiefs were
playing at home. She was working for a local company interested in
donating to Thomas' foundation, and went to the quarterback-sack
specialist who wore No. 58 with an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'You're the Sack Man,' `` Brown said. ``What if we
give $580 for every sack you get?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she has another goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to keep the foundation going in Derrick's name,''
she said. ``This was his baby.''
</P>
<P>
   That baby, like the 9-13 year-olds who benefitted from the
reading program at its introductory level, grew.
</P>
<P>
   The Derrick Thomas Ambassador Program features children who have
participated in the reading club for two or more years promoting
literacy throughout the community. There is a tutorial program and
a luncheon series featuring Kansas City celebrities as guests with
Third and Long children as speakers. There is a Storytellers
Program training 14-16 year olds to read to children at Kansas City
child-care facilities.
</P>

   There are the scholarships _ 30 of them so far worth $48,000,
according to Brown _ for kids from the program in pursuit of a
college eduction.

``There was money for that, too.''

   It is stamped on Mary Roberson's soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``When many of the kids came into the program, they were very
shy,'' said Roberson, manager of the Lucille Buford branch of the
Kansas City Public Libraries system. ``Derrick brought more
children into the library. They brought out the best in him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is etched on Sandra Jones' mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He centered on children with low scores in reading programs,''
said Jones, who helped coordinate the in-school projects. ``They
would work together to select books to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Literacy wasn't the whole of Thomas' social effort. He was
involved in across-the-board charity work _ HIV awareness, mental
retardation, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, food drives _ but is
now dead at the age of 33.
</P>
<P>
   In his name, read a book to a child tonight.

GORE SAYS HE'S ON COMMON GROUND WITH MCCAIN ON HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ Al Gore Tuesday said his ideas for improving
the nation's health care system are closer to Republican John
McCain's than Bill Bradley's, his challenger for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain and I have in common putting money from the surplus
into Medicare and keeping it from being drawn down when the
babyboomers retire,'' Gore told reporters aboard Air Force Two.
``McCain recognizes, as I do, that you should put money in the
program. Bradley's assertion is that it is not needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments about McCain, which as ususal came at the expense
of Bradley, are his most extensive since both men won the New
Hampshire primary. Gore made the remarks as flew from New York to
Florida, a state with the one of the nation's largest populations
of older residents and where he is counting on drawing his sharpest
distinctions yet with Bradley on health care.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told more than 700 senior citizens at Century Village, a
retirement community in Pembroke Pines, that the former New Jersey
senator has a health care plan that would eat up the budget surplus
and leave nothing for shoring up Medicare, which he said would
become insolvent in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most all the experts in both political parties have said,
`let's put money in now.' That's a key difference between Senator
Bradley and myself,'' Gore said,
</P>
<P>
   He also knocked Bradley for proposing to replace Medicid with an
``inadequate'' private insurance system. In sum, he said, Bradley's
health care plan ``does not get to universal health insurance, does
not shore up the finances of Medicare, but does eliminate Medicaid
in favor of an inadequate substitute.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, then added, ``I think that's shortsighted and I think it's
especially important in a state like Florida where Medicare is even
more important than in the average state because of the population
of seniors in Florida who depend upon Medicare very heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore found a particularly receptive audience for his argument,
drawing wild cheers from the seniors by promising to add a
prescription drug benefit to Medicare. That promise resonated with
Bonnie Steinhart, a 72-year-old resident of Century Village who
also lives part-time in Connecticut. She said she had just paid $69
for seven antibotic pills that she could neither afford nor do
without. Gore, she said, has her vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seniors,'' said Jerry Engelberg, 80. ``Anyone who's
talking to us about Medicare and prescription drugs, whether he's
going to accomplish what he thinks he's going to accomplish or not,
I'm going to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that over the next 25 years, the number of seniors in
Florida is expected to more than double _ from 2.6 million people
over 65 to 5.4 million. He says his health plan would devote $300
billion of the federal budget surplus to shore up the Medicare
Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments to repoters, Gore said Bradley has said that the
Medicare insolvency problem may be resolved because of changing
lifestyles, people living longer, eating better and exercising
more, adding sacracstically, ``maybe all streams run downhill.''

BRINGING THE UNIVERSE INSIDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As visually stunning as the new planetarium at the
American Museum of Natural History is _ a huge sphere in a glass
box _ the architecture of the universe is more wondrous still.
</P>
<P>
   Each year astronomers bring down from their heights more views
of the awesome cosmic edifice stretching in all directions out to
the beginning of time. Its dimensions are beyond mundane measure,
its structure shaped mostly by unknown matter.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale of wonders, the universe is definitely a 10.
</P>
<P>
   In one way or another, myth and theory, astrology and astronomy,
every culture from deepest antiquity on seems to have struggled to
make sense of the universe. It is as if human beings have long
intuited what astronomers have just learned in the last generation
or so: we come from stars. We are made of chemical elements forged
in stars and scattered through space. We are recycled stardust with
the gift of consciousness and boundless curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a century, planetariums have been places where those
who are not astronomers go to experience something of their cosmic
roots. There the observable universe is brought indoors, reduced to
a more comprehensible size.
</P>
<P>
   If a map is Earth spread out on a table, a planetarium show is
the universe projected in lights on the ceiling of a darkened dome.
</P>
<P>
   The new Hayden Planetarium, centerpiece of the $210 million Rose
Center for Earth and Space at the museum, which opens on Feb. 19,
sets a high standard for a new era in showmanship that dramatizes
new knowledge of the cosmos through the technology of virtual
reality. The Hubble Space Telescope meets Silicon Valley and
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are awash in beautiful astronomical data and awash in
scientific discovery,'' said Dr. Neil de Grasse Tyson, the Hayden's
director. ``This has presented an even greater challenge to
planetariums to find clever ways to package discovery for public
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden officials boast of having the most modern star and planet
projector in existence, a custom-built Zeiss Mark IX. Their
supercomputer for generating three-dimensional galactic maps is
described as one of the largest ever dedicated to creating visual
simulations, equivalent to those used by NASA and many military
research laboratories. A tie with the space agency promises access
to the latest images and information for updating space shows.
</P>
<P>
   The first show combines actual space photography, the latest in
cinematic special effects and a display of cosmic vistas churned
out in supercomputer simulations based on cosmology's newest
theoretical models. The experience is mind-expanding theater.
</P>
<P>
   Sit back, look up and take a grand tour of the solar system,
flying by Mars and Jupiter and under the splendid rings of Saturn.
Travel through star fields of the Milky Way, our home galaxy, and
the billowing clouds of gas and dust where new stars are born.
</P>
<P>
   Feel the rumble of flight to more distant galaxies, out where
the immensity of space swallows up the solar system and even the
Milky Way. After covering billions of light-years in 30 Earth
minutes, take a shortcut home in a dizzying free fall through a
black hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, not even astronomers, has ever been able to experience
the universe in this way or on such a vast range of scale,'' said
Dr. James S. Sweitzer, the Hayden's director of special projects.
</P>
<P>
   Other planetariums are also busily improving the way they bring
the stars and planets indoors. A year ago, sitting in the upgraded
Adler Planetarium in Chicago, the country's oldest, I had a pilot's
view of a flight over the red plains and through the wide canyons
of Mars, a computerized perspective based on spacecraft photography
of the real thing. A new show there invites visitors to imagine
themselves as first settlers in a Mars colony.
</P>
<P>
   The revitalization of planetariums is coming none too soon,
perhaps in time to maintain or even add to their enormous
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   When he is not engaging visitors with astro-facts _ ``If the Sun
were a black hole, it would be no larger than a child's marble'' _
Tyson likes to see their surprise when he talks about planetarium
attendance. ``More people visit local planetariums in the United
States,'' he says, ``than attend all major professional sports
events combined.''
</P>
<P>
   The first modern planetarium, designed by Walther Bauersfeld of
the Carl Zeiss Optical Co. of Germany, opened in 1924 at the
Deutsches Museum in Munich. It was the decade of Edwin P. Hubble's
transforming discoveries that the Milky Way is not the entire
universe but one of a multitude of galaxies and also that this
universe of galaxies is expanding. The bigger the universe grew in
our perception and in fact, the greater the interest in trying to
domesticate it with dynamic light shows.
</P>
<P>
   In its original meaning, a planetarium was the instrument for
projecting on the interior of a fixed dome the positions and
motions of the Sun, Moon, stars and planets. The name now also
refers to the building housing the instrument and serving as a
center of public education about all things cosmic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are more than 100 major planetariums in cities
around the world, with more than 1,000 smaller ones at schools and
colleges. Yet all of them have been hard pressed to keep their
shows and exhibits up to date with the new discoveries about black
holes, quasars, dark matter and planets beyond the solar system, or
with audience expectations raised by action movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Western culture, the urge to model the heavens on some human
scale goes back at least to the sixth century B.C., when Greeks
came to believe in a spherical world and heaven. This inspired the
craft of making celestial globes on which artists drew the night
sky, particularly the constellations. The best preserved of these
globes dates from about 300 B.C. and was later placed on the
shoulders of Atlas in a marble statue known as the Farnese Atlas in
the National Museum of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   It took the genius of Archimedes in 250 B.C. to create a
celestial globe with a water-powered mechanism for reproducing the
motions of the Sun, Moon and five known planets. This was the first
model to be called a planetarium. Although it has not been
preserved, the apparatus was apparently set inside a hollow globe
and one revolution, as Cicero wrote, controlled ``several movements
utterly unlike in slowness and speed'' and thus could reproduce
orbits and solar and lunar eclipses.
</P>
<P>
   While these globes and early instruments of astronomical
measurement were mainly intended for instruction and contemplation,
Dr. Owen Gingerich, a historian of science at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, suspects they also
gave people a certain feeling of control over the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, he said, the nobility collected these
devices as a way of ``saying this is how the universe works and I
have it in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Applying their growing skills in the 18th century A.D.,
clockmakers made complex gear-driven mechanisms for reproducing the
motions of the solar system. These tabletop devices became known as
orreries, after the Earl of Cork and Orrery, for whom the first one
was built, and once were a popular fixture in the libraries of the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the first walk-in globes as early as the
17th century anticipated the modern planetarium and probably
inspired Voltaire's description in his 1768 novel, ``The Princess
of Babylon,'' of a large room 300 feet in diameter in the middle of
a garden. The room's sky-blue dome, he wrote, was filled with
golden stars that ``reproduced all the constellations and planets
in their correct positions; and this dome revolved like the
heavens, driven by a mechanism as silent and invisible as that
which directs the real celestial motions.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10 people could crowd into the hollow Gottorp Globe,
a 17th-century creation Voltaire probably had in mind. As the
operator turned a handle, the entire globe rotated, causing the
stars and constellations painted on the interior and illuminated by
oil lamps to appear to follow their diurnal courses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last of the walk-in globe-planetariums was built
early in the 20th century in Chicago. The Atwood Celestial Globe,
15 feet in diameter, seated 17 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   But these hollow globes were soon obsolete, as the Zeiss company
introduced modern electro-optical technology to planetarium
showmanship, and it has now come through with improvements to
transport spectators away from the old geocentric views of the
universe. The new projectors and computer simulations have at last
enabled planetariums to fully adopt in their shows the Copernicus
and Galileo perspective, which long ago removed Earth from the
center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Hayden's new space show, indeed, audiences may
feel thoroughly humbled to see Earth put in its place as a small
planet around an ordinary star in an ordinary galaxy, one of
perhaps 100 billion galaxies. Or they may feel a swelling of pride
to think _ as the earlier nobility did with the celestial globes
and orreries in their libraries _ that human beings have the power
to take the measure of the universe in all its vastness and summon
it indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, for his part, knows the inspirational power of a sky
show, even one at the old Hayden Planetarium, vintage 1935. In a
memoir, ``The Sky Is Not the Limit,'' just published by Doubleday,
Tyson, who also lectures in astrophysics at Princeton, tells of his
first visit to the Hayden as a nine-year-old boy from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the night,'' he writes. ``The night the universe
poured down from the sky and flowed into my body. I had been
called. The study of the cosmos would be my career, and no force on
Earth would stop me.''

increasing funding for education, even reforming campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   We wonder if the pollsters preface their carefully crafted
questions with the fact that the average wage-earner will work
until May 11 this year just to pay federal, state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Polling results are key to the president's voluminous budget
proposal for 2001, which he unveiled this week. It is the last
Clinton budget, calling for outlays five and 10 years down the road
that the next president will be under no compulsion to honor. So
the document is more a statement of lame-duck politics than guiding
budgetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is worrisome on several fronts: First, it
serves as an election-year wish list for Democratic hopefuls, chock
full of billion-dollar giveaways aimed at assuring ballot box
victories.
</P>
<P>
   But the document is also troublesome because it formally
proposes to abandon spending limits imposed in 1997, signaling to
Congress and to the public that happy days of spendthrift
government are here again.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, the federal government will offer a tax
inducement for people (55-to-64-year-olds) to participate in a
government program (a Medicare insurance plan). Giveaway programs
are not uncommon; paying people to take advantage of one is, as far
as we know, a first.
</P>
<P>
   Also under Clinton's budget, the Earned Income Tax Credit could
grow even more to refund taxes to people who did not pay them. And
Clinton will propose that government generously reward families who
care for their relatives (though families have done so, sans
reward, for years). ``It's all things for all people,'' noted U.S.
Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   The president will portray his budget as fiscally responsible,
aimed at paying off the public debt in 13 years. But the spending
comes now. The debt-reduction occurs long after Clinton leaves
office, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   It is a document that says there is no rational limit to
government, no reasonable bounds to its reach that politicians
should respect. If wage-earners feel differently, if they don't
want to work till July instead of mid-May just to pay taxes, they
should let their voices be heard.

PICKING UP THE PIECES AFTER AN FBI STING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By GEANNE ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony P. Hodgson thought he had the right stuff to make it in
the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson, a Houston-based engineer turned entrepreneur, had two
start-up companies, TerraSpace Inc. and TerraSpace Technology Inc.,
that provided high-technology engineering and management services
to businesses and the government. He had space industry contacts
and plenty of projects. And when a man calling himself John
Clifford arrived in 1992 with promises of venture capital, Hodgson
said, his fledgling businesses were on the way to success.
</P>
<P>
   Then everything came crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford was not the wealthy investor he pretended to be.
Instead, he was an FBI agent, alias and all, on a secret mission to
uncover kickback schemes and other business crimes in the aerospace
industry. The white-collar criminal investigation, code-named
Operation Lightning Strike, rocked the space industry in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson was not a focus of the investigation, nor was he ever
charged with any crime. But he contends that the operation
destroyed his businesses, and, along with two former partners, Dale
A. Brown and R. Scott Satterwhite, he sued FBI agents and companies
that aided in the sting.
</P>
<P>
   Though the partners have failed in their legal efforts to be
compensated for their claimed losses, the case has resulted in a
court opinion that may increase the chances that innocent third
parties injured in sting operations can collect for damages against
law enforcement agents.
</P>
<P>
   In what is apparently the first major court opinion on the
issue, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
ruled last fall that law enforcement officers can be held liable if
with deliberate indifference they harm ``an innocent nontarget.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Bromwich, former inspector general in the Justice
Department and now a partner with the law firm of Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver &AMP; Jacobson, called the ruling ``a wake-up call for
law enforcement agencies to better control and supervise their
undercover operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is particularly relevant for investigations of
white-collar, or business, crimes. In contrast to drug stings, for
example, white-collar criminal investigations often require that
agents function within a general business environment, so they
routinely come into contact with innocent people and companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To appear legitimate in a particular community, you have to
assume the mantle of normalcy regarding business custom,'' said
Tron Brekke, a former deputy assistant director at the FBI who for
many years sat on a federal committee that considered proposals for
undercover operations. ``You have to engage in contracts. You have
to do other things to show that you're a legitimate entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson was among many members of the aerospace industry caught
up in the costly 20-month sting operation that ultimately led to
accusations of a cover-up and entrapment as well as an
investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Professional
Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The sting brought a smattering of guilty pleas to crimes
including bribery, kickbacks and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said that an internal
investigation of Operation Lightning Strike had so far found no
indication of any violation of Justice Department guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the department, Myron Marlin, said Justice
Department and FBI officials who review and approve undercover
operations had been told of the 5th Circuit opinion ``so they can
consider it when reviewing the impact that any future undercover
operation may have on third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   While Justice and FBI officials declined to discuss details of
the case of Hodgson and his former partners, they argued in their
appellate brief that even if the plaintiffs' allegations were true,
the dismissal by a U.S. District Court in Houston was proper.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rendition in the brief, the three men were
contacted not as ``a target'' of Operation Lightning Strike, but to
help FBI agents ``meet potential subjects for investigation.'' (Law
enforcement experts say that FBI sting operations always cast a
wide net rather than initially pursue specific targets.)
</P>
<P>
   The brief also says that the special agent posing as Clifford
``claimed to be wealthy and hoping to market cutting-edge
electronics to NASA and the aerospace industry'' and ``promised to
lend venture capital'' to the plaintiffs' companies.
</P>
<P>
   To convince the business partners that Clifford and other
undercover agents were legitimate, the FBI enlisted the help of
companies including Dun &AMP; Bradstreet and NationsBank (now merged
into the Bank of America). The companies verified financial
information given to the aerospace partners by FBI agents in
support of their cover, the brief states.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Hodgson said that he and his partners
bought Clifford's story ``hook, line and sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   James H. Francis, the FBI agent who posed as Clifford and who
has since left the bureau, said that while many of the facts in the
rendition in the Justice Department brief were correct, ``the 10
percent that are not correct are in who met who first and some of
the things that are vitally important'' in a sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hodgson, Satterwhite and their two companies were never
charged with any crime, Brown eventually was.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime into the collaboration, Clifford offered Brown a job as
a supervisor of a planned island resort. Brown, the government's
brief says, ``was to enjoy a very large salary as well as fringe
benefits including a personal plane'' and ``apparently in
anticipation of this opportunity, Brown dissolved his business
relationships'' with his partners.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-paying job, the brief says, ``was not to be. John
Clifford had a task for Dale Brown.'' The brief then describes how,
after a vague instruction from Clifford to an associate of Brown,
Brown ended up in the Hobby Airport Hilton Hotel in Houston passing
``a sealed envelope containing entertainment funds'' to an Army
procurement officer. The FBI was secretly taping the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was indicted on one count of offering a $500 bribe to a
public official. He made, and lost, an entrapment argument. The
case ended in a mistrial after a jury deadlocked, with the U.S.
attorney's office declining to retry it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown blames the sting operation for a heart problem and stroke
he later suffered, and said the undercover investigation harmed him
physically, emotionally and financially.
</P>
<P>
   He and his former partners contend that the investigation cost
them valuable time working on what they later learned were bogus
project proposals, diverted their attention from potentially viable
projects, split up their partnership, hurt their credibility in the
aerospace industry and destroyed their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They lost on their claims against the companies that helped the
FBI. Companies routinely assist in criminal investigations,
sometimes by backing up FBI covers. The 5th Circuit panel
recognized the value of this assistance and said the companies were
protected against liability in part because they were acting at the
direction of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   So as not to impede their ability to do their jobs, law
enforcement officers are also protected against liability, under a
legal doctrine called qualified immunity. But, the panel said, this
immunity will no longer protect agents in sting operations who hurt
innocent third parties ``with deliberate indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, unintended victims harmed by undercover operations
have had a hard time getting compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that sting operations could go awry was highlighted by
Operation Abscam, the investigation of political corruption two
decades ago that led to an outcry over entrapment and that prompted
an investigation of FBI undercover techniques.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional report on FBI undercover operations in 1984
found that ``significant financial losses to innocent third parties
are all too often the legacy of undercover operations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the injured individuals lack the awareness or resources to
bring suit,'' the report stated, ``or the Department of Justice
succeeds in its policy of stonewalling in such cases, the losses
are left on the shoulders of innocent victims of
government-sponsored misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Abscam also was partly responsible for the guidelines, issued by
the attorney general, that require extensive review and approval of
undercover operations. Topping the list of considerations is the
risk of injury or financial loss to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Lightning Strike, said Brekke _ the former FBI
official and now senior program manager at a high-tech research
company _ was a Group 1 Investigation, the most significant and
sensitive type of investigation and thus the category receiving the
most rigorous review.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts expressed concern about the 5th Circuit
opinion, saying there was a danger in imposing liability on law
enforcement agents. ``They may play it so safe that they don't do
their jobs as vigorously and effectively as they should,'' said
Peter H. Schuck, a professor at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Bergman, co-chair of the Amicus Committee of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a professor at
the University of New Mexico Law School, welcomed the warning to
undercover agents. ``Sometimes they go too far and innocent people
can get hurt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that despite the new legal opening, winning a suit
against agents would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit panel stated that the facts presented suggested
deliberate indifference toward Hodgson. But it affirmed the
dismissal of Hodgson's claims, stating that the FBI agents were
entitled to _ and had not received _ notice that they could be held
liable. (His former partners' claims were rejected on a
technicality.)
</P>
<P>
   Such notice to law enforcement officers was not warranted, some
legal experts said. The facts presented in the court's opinion
amounted to ``a violation of something so clearly wrong that it
should have been deemed known to all,'' said Stephen A. Saltzburg,
a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice
Department's criminal division and now a professor at George
Washington University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson, meanwhile, who still hopes for a legal victory, saying,
``We're going all the way up to the Supreme Court,'' is still
struck by what he sees as a tremendous waste.
</P>
<P>
   While his cost estimates were higher than what others have
acknowledged, there was no disputing his disappointment. ``We
didn't have millions of dollars to market our company, and they
spent millions of dollars to set us up _ to create situations that
looked like there was something illegal going on,'' he said. ``And
PS, after two years and millions of dollars, they were unsuccessful
in doing that.''

DUELLING ADS MARK GOP EFFORT IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ If Governor George W. Bush lost the battle
for New Hampshire on the ground, he appeared ready Tuesday to win
the South Carolina primary at least in part on the airwaves,
releasing two new ads in what is becoming an increasingly bitter
contest.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, titled ``Reformer with Results'' and ``Promised,'' were
matched by a new ad from Senator John McCain, who, like Bush,
featured the no-negative-campaigning handshake the two men made on
Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain ad appeared to be the more forceful of the two,
questioning Bush's sincerity and asking: ``Do we really want
another politician in the White House America can't trust?'
</P>
<P>
   But the advertisements from both campaigns served as evidence
that the leadup to the Feb. 19 primary here will be every bit as
adversarial as the two campaigns have promised.
</P>
<P>
   Empower America's William Bennett, who is neutral, said Tuesday
that McCain should stop his ad against Bush, adding that comparing
Bush to President Bill Clinton crosses the line.
</P>
<P>
   In response, McCain spokesman Todd Harris said, ``While Senator
McCain certainly respects Mr. Bennett, as long as the Bush campaign
continues to attack Senator McCain and distort his record, we will
keep that ad on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, still chanting his new mantra, ``Reformer with Results,''
took McCain on repeatedly Tuesday at public events both here and in
Delaware, reminding supporters that the Arizona senator has been a
Capitol Hill fixture for years.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to McCain several times as ``chairman,'' an allusion
to his position on the Senate Commerce Committee, Bush repeatedly
accused McCain of using the post to solicit campaign funds. And
more than a dozen times, Bush repeated what may be a new slogan in
his campaign, saying McCain ``does one thing and says another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman McCain voted not once, not twice, but five times to
support publicly financed congressional campaigns,'' Bush said at a
news conference here. ``This is a man who does one thing and says
another. And during this campaign in South Carolina, I'm going to
remind people of that. I'm going to battle for the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's battle Tuesday included an ad highlighting McCain's
promise not to run a negative campaign, which the Bush campaign
said he broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, isn't it?'' Bush said. ``The true nature of John
McCain evidently is coming out. I'm sad he's using that kind of ad.
The people of my state know I brought honor and dignity to the
office. I'm going to fight for what I believe is right, and I'm not
going to let my record get distorted.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, wrote to Karl
Rove, Bush's senior adviser, saying, ``Our campaign will not sit on
our hands and allow our candidate to be personally attacked. We
will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter calls on Rove to pull his ad and the name-calling by
Bush and his surrogates. Davis asked Rove to end ``these personal
and misleading attacks'' and then the McCain campaign will take
down its ads.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll of Michigan voters conducted by the Detroit Free
Press, to be published Wednesday, shows McCain and Bush even in a
major industrial state where the Texas governor had been far ahead.
The Free Press poll of 300 likely primary voters showed McCain with
45 percent support to Bush's 43 percent. The Michigan Republican
primary comes three days after South Carolina's Feb. 19 date. Polls
in South Carolina now show the contest dead even there as well.

GOVERNMENT REPORT PROPELS MARKETS UP

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad advance Tuesday after a
government report indicated that the economy could continue to
expand without an appreciable increase in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were particularly strong, and the Nasdaq
composite index rose to its third consecutive record. But the Dow
Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index,
which so far this year have been struggling, registered solid
gains. And the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks
rose to a new record.
</P>
<P>
   One billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
At 1.94 billion shares, the Nasdaq stock market had its
second-busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
   All these gains were set in motion by the Labor Department,
which early Tuesday issued a report showing that worker
productivity rose faster than expected in the fourth quarter while
labor costs fell for a second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calculus is pretty straightforward,'' said Jeffrey
Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. ``As
productivity accelerates, the need for the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates becomes less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by stocks like Microsoft, Immunex and Qualcomm, the Nasdaq
composite index jumped 105.77, a gain of 2.5 percent, to 4,427.77.
It was the seventh straight gain for the index, and the first time
it has closed above 4,400.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dow gained 51.81, an increase of 0.5 percent, to
10,957.60. Interest-rate-sensitive financial stocks like J.P.
Morgan and retailers like Wal-Mart Stores helped to pull the Dow
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Big gains in technology names like Yahoo and EMC pushed the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 17.51, or 1.2 percent, to 1441.75.
And the Russell 2000 small cap index, which like the Nasdaq is
moving on strength in technology and biotechnology stocks, closed
at 537.49, a gain of 5.10, or 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of people who are seeing technology as the
instrument for growth,'' said Steve Witt, a managing director at
Firsthand Funds in San Jose, Calif., a mutual fund that invests
exclusively in technology issues. ``As long as technology is
perceived that way, I don't think this is going to stop. The
majority of these companies have reported phenomenal earnings
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems became the latest technology company to issue a
strong earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   After the close, the biggest maker of Internet equipment
reported earnings that were better than consensus estimates. The
company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, which has risen sharply in the last week, was up 5/8, to
125 13/16 during regular trading. But the stock jumped following
the announcement, and traded as high as 130 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, another technology belwether, had a good day. The
stock gained 3 5/16, to 109 15/16. And IBM, another Dow component,
climbed 4 7/8, to 119.
</P>
<P>
   Among retailing stocks, Wal-Mart rose 3 11/16 to 59 1/6 after an
analyst at Lehman Brothers raised his priced target on the shares
to 100.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers also rose. Home Depot was up 1 7/8, to 61 3/8,
and Costco Wholesale advanced 1 13/16, to 53 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some big insurance companies, financial
service stocks did well.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan gained 1 15/16 to 119 1/2. American Express was up
9/16 to 163. Citigroup rose 1 3/16 to 55 3/4. And Merrill Lynch
closed at 97 1/16, up 3 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a bad day for the beleaguered tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations in a lawsuit that the companies conspired to fix
cigarette prices sent the stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris fell 1 3/16, to 19 5/16, an all-time low. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco declined 5/16, to 18 1/4. And British American
Tobacco, a holding company for Brown &AMP; Williamson, fell 3/4, to 8
1/2.

   Money talks, but it's not speech
</P>
<P>
   By Jac Wilder VerSteeg
</P>
<P>
   Political campaigns during America's first few decades were open
to few. Women, blacks and Indians couldn't vote. White males
weren't a shoo-in, either. All 13 original states gave voting
rights only to those who owned sufficient real or personal
property.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution consistently has been amended to broaden voting
rights, including granting suffrage to all races (15th Amendment),
to women (19th) and to citizens at age 18 (26th).
</P>
<P>
   Though the Constitution's language has expanded the franchise,
in practice, turnout has declined. Money is a major reason. Voters
have concluded that big contributors and spenders will prevail, and
expensive campaigns saturating the media with negative ads have
further discouraged voters.
</P>
<P>
   The system's beneficiaries _ incumbents and special interests _
have blocked reforms that would purge tainted money from political
campaigns. Their defense has been that money is speech. Any limit
on contributions or expenditures, they say, would abridge the First
Amendment. Anti-reformers won a half-victory in 1976, when the
Supreme Court ruled, in Buckley vs. Valeo, that political
expenditures are protected speech that lawmakers cannot curtail.
But lawmakers can limit contributions, the court said. Their
reasoning: The act of giving is a form of speech, but lawmakers can
set limits to keep the act of giving from becoming the act of
bribing.
</P>
<P>
   Since those naive days, Congress and state legislatures have
trampled the flimsy legal barriers to unlimited contributions. Soft
money, bundled money and other contributions pour through
loopholes. The court's permission to spend endlessly has turned
into a frantic mandate to take endlessly, and bribery has become
institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   But not yet enshrined in the Constitution. Special interests
hoped to complete their victory this year when the Supreme Court
decided a case known as Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC.
In that case, the political action committee sued Missouri Attorney
General Jay Nixon to overturn caps on campaign contributions. The
goal: for the court to declare that contributions, like
expenditures, are protected speech and cannot be limited.
</P>
<P>
   But the court, in a 6-3 decision that included Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, upheld the old distinction. Justice David
Souter, in the majority opinion, bluntly repeated Buckley's
rationale for limiting contributions. He said there is ample
evidence ``that the dangers of large, corrupt contributions and the
suspicion that large contributions are corrupt are neither novel
nor implausible,'' and noted that the same principles that allow
lawmakers to limit contributions ``underlie bribery and
anti-gratuity statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Souter's description of money's corrupting influence is
devastating, but the harshest words, ironically, come from Justice
Anthony Kennedy's dissent, in which he notes that soft-money
loopholes have ``forced a substantial amount of political speech
underground as contributors and candidates devise ever more
elaborate methods of avoiding contribution limits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens' concurring opinion pinpoints the
problem and points toward the solution. ``I make one simple
point,'' Justice Stevens writes. ``Money is property; it is not
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains that ``speech has the power to inspire volunteers to
perform a multitude of tasks on a campaign trail, on a
battleground, or even on a football field. Money, meanwhile, has
the power to pay hired laborers to perform the same tasks. It does
not follow, however, that the First Amendment provides the same
measure of protection to the use of money to accomplish such goals
as it provides to the use of ideas to achieve the same results.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer, in a separate concurring opinion, agrees
that the court was wrong in 1976 to rule that money is speech. He
writes that a limit on contributions ``permits all supporters to
contribute the same amount of money, in an attempt to make the
process fairer and more democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in Justice Breyer's comments is the notion that
political activity can become unbalanced to the detriment of
democracy _ even if that activity is speech. He notes that ``the
Constitution often permits restrictions on the speech of some in
order to prevent a few from drowning out the many. In Congress, for
example, where constitutionally protected debate ... is limited to
provide every member an equal opportunity to express his or her
views. Or in elections, where the Constitution tolerates numerous
restrictions on ballot access, limiting the political rights of
some so as to make effective the political rights of the entire
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon vs. Shrink case underscores that, all along, Congress
has had the power to clean up the increasingly corrupt system of
contributions. The ruling ought to put pressure on Republican
leaders, primarily in the Senate, who have blocked reforms in the
McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan measures that would limit or ban
soft money and PAC contributions.
</P>
<P>
   To be thorough, Congress also should look at the bundling
techniques George W. Bush has used to get around individual limits.
The New York Times reports that an organization known as the
Pioneers _ a collection of rainmakers handed down to his son by
President Bush _ coordinated the effort that has raised more than
$67 million, much of it coming from oil companies and real estate
interests. This is not the ``grass-roots'' support the Bush
campaign claims. It is, rather, yet another doorway special
interests exploit. If he is nominated, George W. Bush could raise
$250 million in soft money, more than twice the amount Bob Dole
raised in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reforming contributions would be a major step forward. But
Justices Stevens and Breyer lay a logical foundation to do more by
reversing Buckley and allowing limits on campaign expenditures.
Even Justice Kennedy hints he might accept some well-crafted
restrictions on expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stevens points out that the Constitution allows more
restrictions on the use of property than it does on free speech. He
says property rights might prevent restrictions on campaign
expenditures _ can lawmakers keep a wealthy candidate such as Steve
Forbes from using his property (money, publishing facilities) to
campaign for president? That's not settled, but the answer is more
likely to be ``yes'' than if the core issue were pure speech.
Justice Breyer's notion that a democratic political system requires
at least rough equality in its use also nudges the argument toward
limits on spending.
</P>
<P>
   In Nixon vs. Shrink, the justices have crept closer to
acknowledging the political reality that money plays an
overwhelming role in elections. Sen. John McCain's New Hampshire
primary victory, in which voters picked the country's most
prominent campaign-finance reformer over the country's most
lavishly financed candidate, shows that disgust with
special-interest money is growing. But it does not negate recent
political experience, which is that the candidate with the most
money usually wins.
</P>
<P>
   As money's influence has grown, only those with money can
influence the political system. To repeat Justice Stevens' insight:
``Money is property; it is not speech.'' The system we have today,
in its corrupt way, is a return to the restrictive democracy
Americans have tried to amend out of our Constitution. Money is
property, and as long as money rules elections, only the
property-rich will have a meaningful vote.

 &HT;    Sporting goods firms at last leaving e-commerce sidelines
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The sporting goods industry finally could be catching
the Internet wave.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of slow growth and watching other industries
embrace e-commerce, companies are launching Web sites to sell more
sports apparel, equipment and other services.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 15-year history, the Super Show, the
industry's largest annual trade show, will showcase online products
and services when it opens Thursday at the Georgia World Congress
Center and Georgia Dome. The show runs through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors such as Redtagbiz.com, GetFit.com and 2themart.com
will be among the largest e-business attractions at the show, and
they are among the industry's newest entrants. One of the most
eye-catching booths belongs to Redtagbiz.com, which sells
wholesalers' overstocks and discontinued goods at lower prices to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce component represents a mere fraction of the
estimated 3,000 sporting goods manufacturers coming to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big push now, but the sporting goods industry is
behind as far as having e-commerce sites up,'' said Marnie O'Toole,
events manager for 2themart.com, a new Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   2themart.com, which launched its Web site in November, dragged
its refurbished 1952 Silver Streak Clipper camper cross country to
make its point that it wants to sell everything from watches to
sports apparel. The Irving, Calif.-based company unveiled its
Internet site at Comdex, the largest U.S. computer trade show. This
is the company's second trade show.
</P>
<P>
   GetFit.com, which debuted Monday, is offering free fitness
cybertraining and interactive personal training for users to custom
design their fitness programs. The company is based in Redwood
Shores, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sports e-tailers face the same challenges in trying to grow
their business as bricks and mortar companies. Consumers have
busier lifestyles that are cutting into the time they have to
exercise and play recreational sports. They also don't need to
replace their athletic shoes and other goods as often if they're
sitting in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sales potential that surfing the Web has for
e-tailers, spending time online is one of the main activities
keeping people from biking, hiking, running and other sporting
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest hurdles we need to overcome is the
computer,'' said Mike May, a Super Show spokesman with the Sporting
Goods Manufacturers Association, which puts on the Super Show.
``It's one reason why sales are flat right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporting goods grew to be a $46.5 billion industry at the
wholesale level in 1999, from $21.7 billion in 1986. But some
companies, such as Reebok and Nike, have experienced a downward
trend in their overall sales, as high-priced athletic shoes and
apparel have fallen out of favor with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall online sales are estimated to reach $143 billion by 2003
from $20.2 billion in 1999. Sporting goods equipment sales,
however, make up only 3 percent of that growth.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the industry to the Net could be the boost it needs. The
key is getting more people interested in fitness and sports, such
as those online personal trainers that GetFit.com has, so that
they'll need to buy equipment and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the future of fitness,'' said GetFit spokeswoman Lisa
Gordon. After all, she reminded, ``a computer can't exercise for
you.'

CONFLICT IN SOUTHERN LEBANON CONTINUES TO HEAT UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-ARABS, ISRAEL-LEBANON) 
(sw) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The conflict in Lebanon continued to heat up on
Tuesday as Shiite Muslim guerrillas killed another Israeli soldier,
the sixth in two weeks, and Israeli warplanes retaliated less than
24 hours after their first bombardment shut down civilian life in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As Arab and some European countries condemned Israel for its air
strikes, Prime Minister Ehud Barak lamented that civilian targets
had to be struck and that the Middle East peace effort was dealt a
blow. But he staunchly defended his decision to order a harsh
reprisal for what he called the guerrillas' systematic violations
of the rules of engagement in the low-level war zone of southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to strike at civilians,'' said Barak, wearing
a black bomber jacket as he visited the northern Israeli border
town of Qiryat Shemona. ``Our goal is not to close the door in the
face of the possibility of continuing in the peace process.
However, the primary responsibility of a government is to protect
its citizens, its army and those who work with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said on Tuesday that they would ignore the
four-year-old agreement governing the conflict, which prohibits
involving civilians in the violence, until the Iranian-backed
guerrillas began to abide by the rules themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas
increasingly based their command posts in Lebanese villages, using
them to launch deadly rockets at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Lebanon called for the international committee that
monitors the conflict to convene and urged that all sides refrain
from attacks on civilians. That thinking seemed to prevail, at
least in the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's second bombing, late on Tuesday, targeted guerrilla
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   And by Tuesday evening, no Katyusha rockets had crossed the
border to land on Qiryat Shemona or other northern Israeli towns.
That surprised many Israelis who expected the typical pattern of
cross-border retaliation for Israeli shelling. They wondered aloud
if the guerrillas were being belatedly restrained by Syria or by
the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Damascus accused Israel of deliberately torpedoing the
Israeli-Syrian peace effort, which the Syrians froze last month.
Advisers to Barak said the negotiations could not resume until
Syria held back Hezbollah, but Barak continued to express optimism
that the process could be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Israel, many residents who are tired of the cycle of
violence chose to flee southward rather than wait for a rocket to
fall. Schools, factories and stores were closed, and Barak declared
a state of emergency in the region. On army orders, tens of
thousands of others crammed into all too familiar air raid
shelters, where the anxiety was as thick as the boredom was
enervating.
</P>
<P>
   By late evening, after the death of the sixth soldier was made
public in Israel, radio reports hinted that the bombing might be
renewed. They said Barak, who is also the defense minister, was
conferring by phone with his security Cabinet to determine his next
move.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, where Israeli bombs destroyed the transformers that
provide electricity to Beirut, Tripoli and Baalbek, many Lebanese
were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   They had just finished repairing the damage caused by the last
large Israeli air strike, a more deadly one that hit some of the
same power stations last June. They said they felt that they were
knocked off their feet again.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army officials said the last bombardment, which was
ordered by the outgoing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had
served to deter the guerrillas for months. That bombing caused an
estimated eight deaths and scores of wounded, compared with reports
of 18 wounded on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Verbal messages alone do not achieve the aim'' said Maj. Gen.
Giora Eiland, the army's head of operations. ``Thus we had to
act.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 13 Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon.
Army officials had begun to declare victory over the guerrillas
until the fighting intensified in the last month. They say the
guerrillas, facing Barak's pledge to withdraw Israeli troops by
July, are pushing for an impressive 11th-hour showing in the
chronic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that part of the increasing Hezbollah activity is
not just that they want to create obstacles for peace,'' said Haim
Ramon, a Cabinet minister. ``They also believe that there's a
chance we will withdraw early and they are trying to show they had
a victory over Israeli forces. We told the Lebanese government that
this will not happen until July.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the political spectrum, many Israelis grimly supported
the bombing, still stunned by the gory television images of wounded
soldiers that were broadcast live on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we agreed to accept blows and remain silent, we would be
accompanied by this throughout the course of the negotiations,''
said Dan Meridor, a Center Party legislator.
</P>
<P>
   But others expressed disgust at the pattern repeating itself in
Lebanon, and some urged Barak to withdraw troops immediately rather
than wait until July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel has to begin leaving now,'' David Grossman, a leading
novelist and essayist, wrote in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
``Evacuate the outposts, bring the soldiers home and redeploy at
the border. Go. Learn to live with the insult, swallow the empty
pride, stop feeding the fire of our pitiful arrogance still left in
us with more and more of our young soldiers dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidants of Barak said on Tuesday that he was bound by his
pledge to pull the troops out of southern Lebanon by July. While he
prefers to do so in the context of an agreement with Syria, which
could presumably guarantee that the fighting would not move into
northern Israel, associates said he would do so unilaterally if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Tuesday how long the present fighting would continue,
Barak said: ``I'm not a prophet. I'm just the prime minister of
Israel.''

 &HT;    EarthLink outlines business startegies for analysts
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Garry Betty and Michael McQuary have simple goals for
EarthLink. They simply want it to be the number one Internet
service provider in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with analysts in here at the Palace Hotel this week,
they outlined an ambitious plan to attract new subscribers,
increase their broadband reach, attract small business customers
and add content and e-commerce to their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   CEO Betty and President McQuary talked about the strategy for
the new company that taps into some of the Internet's fastest
growing market segments.
</P>
<P>
   First on the list is spreading the word about Midtown-based
EarthLink. ``We are going to carpet bomb you with disks,'' McQuary
said. ``If you each don't get three or four in the next few months,
I'll be shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sadler, an analyst with FAC/Equities says ripping a page
from number one ISP America Online's playbook is a great idea.
``The carpet bombing of disks is going to lead them into some good
spots. The TV and the outdoor advertising campaigns are doing well,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty says the company's strategy for growing it's customer base
is to target the ``switcher'' market, or current Internet users who
aren't happy with the service they currently have, whether it's
AOL, AT&AMP;T or even MSN.
</P>
<P>
   Betty and McQuary each said the way to get Net users to switch
to EarthLink is to continue doing what both companies have always
been known for: providing quality service and support. ``We want to
be top of mind when a customer is dissatisfied with AOL,'' Betty
says. To make that happen, the company is spending nearly 44 per
cent of its revenues on its marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink says it wants to grab as many AOL customers as it can
to bring its membership up to 4.5 million by the end of the year.
However, the company doesn't want just any user. ``They want to
pick and choose the best customers,'' Sadler says. ``Are they going
to get 20 million users? Well, maybe one day. But now, they want
the best customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The best customers fit EarthLink's profile of 40-something men
with high incomes and a couple of kids. EarthLink customers spend
three times as much on Amazon.com as other Amazon customers.
</P>
<P>
   With these statistics in mind, EarthLink said it planned to
expand its Web site to make it more useful for members and help
increase revenue. One million EarthLink members have EarthLink as
their start page; 700,000 use it every week and 400,000 use it
every day. The company says it would like to make the Web site even
more ``sticky'' with content areas, such as the recently launched
finance area and e-commerce partners who will spend their online
dollars with EarthLink and its partners.
</P>
<P>
   The move to add rich content with partners such as Amazon,
e-Trade and Blue Mountain Arts is part of a plan to hold the
attention of the company's large and growing user base. McQuary
says he wants to move users away from the notion that the ISP start
page is just a place to click away from once you're online. ``We
think we are in a very good position to change the habits of our
users,'' McQuary says. ``It's a big part of our future, something
we think we can leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Brooks, an analyst with Jupiter Communications is less
sure EarthLink can deliver on all its goals. ``Looking at the
strategy, they are talking about doing the right things. But the
question is whether they can execute on all these points. They've
been aware of these areas at one time but have failed to execute.''
Brooks says it will probably be some time before EarthLink's
content areas generate significant revenues.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that EarthLink's version 5.0 software which features
a ``sidecar'' that delivers content from it's partners to users in
an area outside the browser might be a great selling point for both
users and potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the company had estimated it would have 5 million
subsribers by the end of the year, but has revised that figure to
4.5 million. The main reason for the slightly lowered expectations
is that 40 percent of the customers who cancel their EarthLink
subscriptions are leaving to get broadband access from a cable or
telecommunications provider in cities where EarthLink was unable to
offer the service. ``It's an indication that the market is ready,''
Betty says of the broadband market, which hadn't been exepcted to
reach a critical mass until at least 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``DSL-wise, they are suffering with the same problem everyone
else has,'' Sadler says. ``They have to rely on partners that are
building the physical assets, such as the Baby Bells. You are
trying to get a sleeping elephant off the ground with a pea
shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while EarthLink cools its heals waiting for DSL technology
to be available to more homes across the country and for the cable
companies to open their wires to competition, Sadler still believes
EarthLink will succeed in the high-speed arena. ``They have the
best management in this business. They can pull off the numbers
they want,'' he says, ``no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is less enthusiastic, but says the combined high-speed
partnerships each company brings _ for a total of eight partners
including both cable and telecommunications companies_ makes the
new company greater than the sum of its previous parts. ``I think
some of the bigger synergies are the partners they bring to the new
company,'' Brooks says. ``They each bring partnerships that double
the size of providers delploying DSL,'' Brooks says. ``The big part
is going to be DSL for EarthLink. In the past they were just
victims of timing.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink is facing tough competition in the ISP market from
free ISPs and from computer makers offering rebates if users sign
up with a particular ISP.
</P>
<P>
   As more computer users turn to the Web, they'll want more from
an ISP than just a connection. They'll want all the things Betty
plans to give them: high speed access, content, and help to put
their small businesses online. But none of the growth will come at
the expense of the service the company has built its reputation on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are successful,'' he says. ``It all begins and
ends with service.''

NO SIGN OF JOURNALIST WHO RUSSIANS SAY WAS TURNED OVER TO
CHECHENS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds.: This story, held earlier, is now released for
publication.)  (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Friends and colleagues of a Russian reporter for the
American-funded Radio Liberty have been making increasingly frantic
appeals for information about him five days after Russia announced
that it had handed him over to Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   They say they are increasingly dissatisfied with the
government's handling of the case and doubtful about whether they
are being told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Andrei Babitsky, was last heard from on Jan. 15,
when he called the Moscow bureau of Radio Liberty to say he was
heading out of Grozny, the Chechen capital, as Russian forces
pounded it into heaps of rubble and twisted metal.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Babitsky, 35, a veteran Russian combat
correspondent who spent much of the war reporting from behind
Chechen lines, was detained by federal forces. On Feb. 3, the
Russian authorities contend, he was exchanged _ allegedly at his
own request _ for Russian soldiers held prisoner by the Chechens.
But no news of him has emerged since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is that for a guy with as much experience as
Andrei, if he could have, he would have reached us by now,'' said
Jeff Trimble, director of broadcasting for Radio Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Looking weary and unshorn, Babitsky appeared last weekend on
Russian television screens in a choppy video said to have been
filmed by Russian security services on a muddy road somewhere in
Chechnya on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   In a closing shot, Babitsky, his back to the camera, is escorted
away, his arm held in a tight grip by a burly man in a black mask,
not the usual attire of Chechnya's field commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, silence. Or at least, silence on Babitsky's part.
Various branches of the Russian government keep issuing bits of
information, insisting that Babitsky is alive and that he is no
longer their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   On the Chechen side, a series of spokesmen, including Aslan
Maskhadov, the Chechen leader, have said that Babitsky is not being
held anywhere in Chechnya and that they know nothing about any
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila, interviewed Monday night on national
television, bit her lip as she described watching the video ``150
times,'' examining it for details about her husband's physical and
mental state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear what is happening to him,'' she said, fighting
back tears, as her interviewer ended the program, on a privately
owned station, with a somber plea to the Russian authorities to
come forward with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said that Babitsky
was ``safe and sound,'' and that his swap had been arranged by
Interior Ministry agents and sanctioned by the prosecutor general's
office.
</P>
<P>
   But Babitsky's colleagues see ominous signs in the handling of
his case. ``Imagine a state that takes its own citizen and delivers
him to the hands of armed men in masks,'' said Savik Shuster, the
Moscow bureau chief of Radio Liberty, interviewed on television.
``What kind of a state is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, a human rights activist who joined Radio Liberty ten
years ago, is well known to reporters who have covered both wars in
Chechnya for his fearless travels through a dangerous region,
sometimes with security provided by Chechen field commanders. To
the Russian military, which has tried to keep strict control over
reporters' access to the fighting in Chechnya, Babitsky was a bete
noire, whose reporting often flew in the face of the official
version of events.
</P>
<P>
   He was reportedly detained by troops loyal to Beslan Gantamirov,
a former mayor of Grozny who leads a pro-Moscow Chechen militia.
Babitsky was subsequently questioned by a local prosecutor's
office, allegedly on charges that he had collaborated with
``illegal bands.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Babitsky lawyers, Genrik Reznik, said Tuesday he was
ready to charge Russian authorities with having violated Babitsky's
rights during his detention. For the first 10 days, no one was even
informed that he had been detained, and even after that, he was
denied the right to telephone his family, or his lawyers, Reznik
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster said Tuesday that another Radio Liberty correspondent,
dispatched to Chechnya to find Babitsky, reported hearing from the
mother of a prisoner held in the same detention cell that Babitsky
was beaten and forced to sing loudly and for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The video has reassured Babitsky's colleagues that he was alive
on Feb. 2 or 3, since he was shown wearing a shirt that had been
delivered to him in a package together with food and other
clothing, through the local prosecutor's office, on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   What puzzled them was his statement, allegedly signed on Jan.
31, in which he offered to be exchanged for Russian soldiers held
by Chechen rebels. If there were a voluntary exchange, they ask,
why was he shown asking the cameraman to turn off the camera
instead of openly proclaiming his role in the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion has been further compounded by conflicting statements
by Russian officials who said Monday that five Russian soldiers had
been exchanged for Babitsky, though earlier they said it was two or
three.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, prosecutors who contend that they released
Babitsky last week from their custody on condition that he return
to Moscow and stay there, have called on him to return for more
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   During the first round of questioning, the local prosecutor may
have considered charging Babitsky with dealing in stolen icons.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Corti, director of Radio Liberty's Russian Service, said
that the Andrei Rublyov museum in Moscow called the radio station
to say that it had been asked to check the value of an icon
allegedly seized from Babitsky. But, Corti said, the icon was
valued at 10 rubles _ 40 cents _ and no such charge has surfaced
again.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   High-level Russian officials say that acting President Vladimir
Putin has monitored the case practically from the beginning,
although he has made no public comments about it.
</P>
<P>
   Reznik, the lawyer, said Tuesday that the case will test
Russia's commitment to press freedom. ``The authorities have been
telling society, we will defend you from terrorism, but on the
condition that you forget about human rights,'' said Reznik.
</P>
<P>
   Top Russian security officials have already stepped up public
warnings about anti-Russian propaganda campaigns, which they say
are funded by a $1.5 billion bank account set up by pro-Chechen
Arabs. They have also made veiled attacks against Radio Liberty,
one of the foreign radio ``voices'' that were jammed by government
interceptors in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Russians were to try to organize, with 100 percent
Russian capital, an information agency there that challenges State
Department or U.S policies,'' said Alexsandr Zdanovich, spokesman
for the Federal Security Service, one of the successor agencies for
the KGB ``This is a very serious moment, and one that cannot be let
go by the security organs.''

 &HT;    Judge orders Coca-Cola discrimination suit to settle in
mediation
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge has ordered Coca-Cola and the
plaintiffs in a racial discrimination suit to try to settle the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In an order made public Tuesday, Judge Richard Story told both
sides ``to attempt in good faith to settle this case by
participating in non-binding, confidential mediation.'' In
mediation, a neutral third party attempts to bring both sides
together in talks aimed at reaching a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they are pleased with the court's order in the
case, in which eight current and former employees allege Coca-Cola
has discriminated against African-Americans in pay, promotions and
performance evaluations. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action
status to represent more than 2,000 black salaried employees in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has strongly denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said most class-action cases are settled prior to
trial. And some said a settlement in this case could be a wise move
for the company because the suit has called into question its
long-held reputation for supporting black organizations and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the court's order,'' said Jack Stahl,
president-designate of Coca-Cola and co-chair of its Diversity
Advisory Council. ``This process may take some time, and its
outcome is uncertain. Our hope, however, is that we may be able to
resolve this lawsuit in a way that is reasonable and fair to all
concerned _ the plaintiffs, the prospective class members, the
company and its employees and shareowners.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri said the order comes at an
important time for prospective class members who face as Coke cuts
3,300 employees in the United States. That's because the judge
ruled last week that the company can require laid-off workers to
sign release forms giving up their right to be plaintiffs or
prospective class members if they want to receive enhanced
severance benefits. They can, however, still get those benefits if
they are witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that class members facing the important
decision of whether to stay in the case or accept the enhanced
severance benefits will be aware of the existence of the attempts
to settle the case through mediation,'' Mehri said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has announced that it is eliminating 6,000 jobs worldwide,
including 2,500 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While settlement talks are taking place in confidence, the
highly contentious litigation will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the length and outcome of the mediation are uncertain,
the litigation ... shall proceed as previously ordered
simultaneously with the mediation,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the judge has not yet decided on whether to certify this
case as a class action, and since that decision is at least several
months away, this key issue will undoubtedly come up in settlement
talks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, will the company agree to compensate the proposed
class of employees, and if so, by how much?
</P>
<P>
   Another important issue is the company's employment practices.
The plaintiffs have repeatedly said they want to make them fairer,
while the company has steadfastly defended them as being equitable.
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement is reached in mediation, the judge would still
have to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   At least one civil rights leader hoped for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the settlement talks are a good move,'' said Rev.
Joseph Wheeler, president of the Clayton County branch of the
NAACP. ``I'm sure the employees at Coke would welcome that news.
... I think it's in the best interest of the company to settle.''

<P>
   AMBON, Indonesia _ The most frightening sound is the wild
banging of stones on metal light poles, a ringing crescendo of
panic that begins nobody-knows-where and spreads in moments around
this violent, broken seaside town.
</P>
<P>
   It is an early warning system that there is trouble again in
Ambon _ or that once again someone has gone mad with fear,
terrified by the wind in the palm trees or by the barking of dogs
or simply by the silence of the empty streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening but also it's crazy,'' said Umelto Labetubun,
25, an architecture student. ``Everyone grabs rocks and starts
banging, even old men. Everyone is running from their houses
looking for a safer place. You call your friend on the other side
of town and he's hearing it too.''
</P>
<P>
   In their separate neighborhoods, segregated by fear, Muslims and
Christians hear the sound and run for their swords and spears and
guns and homemade bombs. By the end of the day, somebody will
surely be dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 months, as many as 2,000 people have been killed
in what has become an unstoppable surge of religious warfare here
in the islands of Maluku Province, the lovely archipelago once
known as the Spice Islands.
</P>
<P>
   This is Indonesia's nightmare: Freed from the controlling grip
of its former dictator, society descends into chaos as religious
and social hatreds boil to the surface, beyond the reach of the
central government or security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that the violence in places like Ambon will spread.
Already there are copycat clashes in the resort island of Lombok,
attacks on churches in Yogyakarta and rallies in the capital,
Jakarta, where tens of thousands of people, enraged by exaggerated
accounts, shout their readiness to die in a Muslim holy war.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, chaos is a political tool, and most outbreaks of
violence seem to have been either set off or fueled by
provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Most people interviewed here in Ambon are convinced that someone
_ political schemers, disaffected soldiers, religious extremists,
corrupt business interests, perhaps all of these _ has provoked
their war and is determined to keep it alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political game, to create a conflict in a small
area,'' said a Roman Catholic social worker, the Rev. Jack
Manuputty. ``Both of us, Muslims and Christians, are in a trap. The
question is who set the trap for us.'' Whenever the violence dies
down, he said, there always seems to be a new incident, a new
provocation, and more mosques and churches and villages are burned.
</P>
<P>
   As if in a confessional, the general heading a regional command
near here, Maj. Gen. Agus Wirahadikusumah, told reporters in
January: ``All the violence happening in our country is part of a
political game being played by our political elite in the central
government. And whether we realize it or not, we have been forced
to become provocateurs to destroy our national unity.''
</P>
<P>
   The future course of the country may be decided by a struggle
between the new democratizing impulse of President Abdurrahman
Wahid and the forces of chaos that seek an advantage in provoking
the religious, social and separatist tensions that have now risen
dangerously to the surface across Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years under Suharto, the former president, sheer force
was used to repress these differences in a vast nation of 13,000
islands that is still roiled by primitive hatreds. Society lost its
ability to confront and resolve its differences in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Suharto, we went too long without a fire,'' said one
Christian resident of Ambon. ``If there had been even a little
flame we could have put it out and learned from the experience. We
don't know how to solve problems now.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Indonesian nightmare, the small city of Ambon, once home
to 350,000 people, has torn itself apart, with Muslims and
Christians retreating into guarded enclaves served by separate
hospitals, schools, banks, markets, harbors and government
services.
</P>
<P>
   Separating the enclaves are burned-out no-man's-lands patrolled
by soldiers and sometimes also infested by snipers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Muslim crosses to the Christian area and they know he is
a Moslem they will kill him,'' said Renaldo Gultom, a Muslim who
distributes food to refugees. ``It's the same for Christians
crossing. That's why we are all frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   People who return to Ambon from trips divide themselves by
religion at the airport and head for their different enclaves. They
take separate speedboats across the choppy bay into town, avoiding
the airport road that passes dangerously through both Muslim and
Christian villages.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters for the rival newspapers, once close colleagues, now
meet only occasionally at events like the recent visit of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see them, we tell them, `Hey, why don't you get some
correct information?''' said Grace Pelupessy, a 24-year-old
reporter for the Christian newspaper Siwalima.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said, she once had plenty of Muslim friends. ``I don't
talk to them any more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of Suharto's legacy can be seen in the abuses of a
brutal, corrupt and poorly trained military that has operated for
decades in powerful local feifs. Many local commanders reported
directly to the president, only loosely answering to the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in defense of their power and economic interests, and
perhaps in the service of destructive political forces in Jakarta,
they are seen by people here as a cause rather than a solution of
the violence. As in the carnage in East Timor last year, some
soldiers appear to have taken sides. Firefights have been reported
between soldiers who support the Muslims and elements of the police
who support the Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The new military commander here, an outsider to the region,
conceded in January that some of his men had been involved in raids
on Christian villages. But he said nothing about taking any action
against them.
</P>
<P>
   If Ambon is a template for possible chaos in Indonesia, the
actions of the central government are not encouraging. Both Wahid
and Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri have recently visited
Ambon. They pleaded for peace, then left to attend to other
matters. Their visits seem to have had no effect on the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters offer a curious defense:
helplessness. The problems in Ambon, they say, are too complex and
deep-rooted to be addressed in the short term in any effective way.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The complex roots of Ambon's warfare _ like the roots of many of
Indonesia's conflicts _ go back to pre-colonial times, more than
400 years ago, when the Dutch, the British and the Portuguese
competed for the region's rich trade in nutmeg and cloves.
</P>
<P>
   They brought Christianity where Arab traders earlier brought
Islam. The Spice Islands became the most Christian of Indonesia's
regions, about equally divided between the faiths. In the 1950s, a
separatist war brought some of the first fighting to a newly
independent Indonesian nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, an influx of Muslim traders began to tip the
balance of the religious communities here, bringing new frictions
that were easy to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The violence that has spread through the islands during the past
year, driving 100,000 or more people from their homes, had a
strangely specific origin: a traffic dispute on Jan. 19, 1999, in
which a Muslim minibus driver argued with a Christian passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly within moments, according to one witness, a Dutch
linguist, columns of smoke rose from at least three widely
separated places as people began to burn buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these fires and smoke started at the same time, so it was
clearly orchestrated,'' said the linguist, Albert C. Remijsen.
``Right away there were rumors everywhere, like the water supply of
Ambon is poisoned. Now a year has passed and the logic of fighting
is accepted by everyone: men guarding at night, people making
weapons, everybody being determined to stick it out. Religion is
not just religion here. It is a thing of social identity. The
Christians do not want to give in and the Muslims do not want to
give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambon today is hostage to rumors and false reports, with
separate Christian and Muslim newspapers offering different
versions of events. Unverified and exaggerated accounts are
repeated in the national press, fueling passions around this nation
of 210 million, where nearly 90 percent of the people are Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Few people here have any understanding of healthy political or
social competition. For some of them, democracy means chaos and
killing. ``You have to be careful in Ambon because there is so much
democracy here,'' said Ali Bintubaso, a Muslim construction worker.
``People say they want justice for everything. It is all the
problem of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ambon, both sides insist that they fight only in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about well-documented Christian attacks on Muslim
villages, Ambon's most prominent Protestant leader, the Rev. Sammy
P. Titaley, said: ``Nah, that's just people reacting. People are
very, very angry and so they burn Muslim houses.''
</P>
<P>
   When a government official asked him what could be done to end
the violence, he said, ``I told him, `Better you ask the
Muslims.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the fighting were to stop today, the hatreds and
brutality that have taken root over the past year may take
generations to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has become hard,'' said Labetubun, the architecture
student. ``Even girls don't play with dolls any more; they play
with guns. In the future, when we have disputes, we will solve them
with guns. All of us in Ambon have experience now in defending
ourselves in a hard way. Even me, I am sorry to say, I can tell you
now, that's the sound of an M-16, that's the sound of an AK-47.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, aid groups tried to foster peace by paying for a
television commercial that showed two boys, a Christian named
Robert and a Muslim named Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are the grownups doing this?'' the boys ask each other.
``Why can't we be friends again.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of taking to heart the intended message, fighters on
both sides have now adopted the names as symbols of hatred. Muslims
now arm themselves against the Roberts and Christians go hunting
for Hassans to kill.
</P>
<P>
   In a city flooded with hate, the Rev. Agus Ulahayanan, a leading
Roman Catholic priest, said he now struggles with the most
difficult of questions: ``Is God still there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have become hopeless and they don't want to listen to
any kind of preaching any more,'' he said. ``What does it mean to
tell them to love their enemies when people are trying to kill them
and burn down their homes? They say, `Ahh, all of that is just
lies.' Even my own sister demonstrates against me. They say, `Lies!
It is not relevant!' My sister says the same thing. After her house
was burned down she joined a demonstration in front of my church.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a dim hotel lobby, with the 10 p.m. curfew
approaching, Agus spoke of the despair that seems to have driven so
many people into religious warfare, beyond the reach of any real
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can stop them any more,'' he said. ``A boy goes and
burns down a house and he comes to me and says proudly, `I burned
down a house.' And already for him the burden is lifted from the
frustration and depression. There is nothing left for me to say to
him.''

ANDRO STUDY FINDS INCREASE IN TESTOSTERONE
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The over-the-counter diet supplement androstenedione
has been found to increase the male hormone testosterone, but
scientists still do not know if it helped Mark McGwire hit 70 home
runs in 1998. They plan to try to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a study of the supplement, commonly known as andro,
that was commissioned by Major League Baseball and the Players
Association appear in Wednesday's edition of the Journal of the
American Medical Association. The study was led by Dr. Joel
Finkelstein and Dr. Benjamin Leder of Harvard University and
Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the men in the study who were given
300 milligrams of andro a day for seven days experienced an
increase in their testosterone levels. The increase, the authors
wrote, ``suggests that it could have androgenic or anabolic
effects,'' adding, ``High doses of testosterone increase muscle
size and strength in healthy men.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, the article said, found ``no significant
adverse effects of androstenedione'' in the short-term study but
added that long-term use ``could be hazardous, particularly in
women or children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No subjects,'' the authors wrote, ``reported adverse effects.
There were no changes in liver function tests.''
</P>
<P>
   The supplement, which can be purchased in health food stores,
stirred a controversy during the 1998 baseball season when an
Associated Press reporter noticed a bottle in McGwire's locker.
McGwire acknowledged taking andro, a substance that is banned by
the International Olympic Committee, the NFL and the NCAA but not
by baseball, the NBA or the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   When asked then and in subsequent months about baseball's stance
on andro, Commissioner Bud Selig said he would await the outcome of
the study.
</P>
<P>
   A news release issued by Major League Baseball and the Players
Association Tuesday took note of the findings but also said the
research ``did not establish that the levels of testosterone were
sufficient to produce enhanced performance.'' Finkelstein and
Leder, the release said, have applied for additional grants to
continue their research, which baseball supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of future study,'' the release said, ``will be to
determine whether the elevated levels of testosterone'' produce
enhanced performance. No such study has previously been undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, in a statement, said baseball is ``concerned about the
effects of androstenedione use,'' adding that baseball supports
additional research. Donald Fehr, head of the Players Association,
echoed Selig's comments. There was no indication that baseball
would alter its position on the legality of the use of the
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of baseball's stance in not banning the supplement
suggested that officials didn't want to tarnish McGwire's feat of
breaking the home run record, which captivated the entire country
in 1998. Some people felt that andro aided McGwire, but no one has
established that its use can help a batter hit home runs. McGwire
certainly has never needed extra strength because in his career he
has been one of the game's strongest hitters.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if andro, as has been suggested by some
doctors and users, helps a player avoid injuries or return from
injuries more quickly, it conceivably could have helped McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The big first baseman endured several injury-shortened seasons
in the mid-90s, but in the past three seasons, he has played 156,
155 and 153 games. In his previous 10 seasons, he never had a
string of three successive seasons with 150 or more games played.
McGwire volunteered the information last season that he had stopped
using andro.
</P>
<P>
   The study reported in Wednesday's AMA Journal involved 42
``healthy'' men ages 20 to 40. Those in the group taking 300
milligrams a day were reported to have experienced the greatest
changes in their testosterone levels.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the levels returned to normal by the next
day. But the authors wrote, ``Because many users probably take much
higher and more frequent dosages of androstenedione, it is likely

in testosterone levels compared with those observed in the present
study.''
</P>
<P>
   One segment of the study group took 100 milligrams of andro a
day and did not experience changes in testosterone level, and the
men's muscle size and strength did not change, the study found.''

TOKYO GOVERNOR PROPOSES RADICAL PLAN TO TAX BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to make 2nd graf more accurate and to insert new 14th graf
with quote from Ishihara, bgng Tuesday night,...)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Shares of Japan's major banks fell Tuesday after the
Tokyo metropolitan government announced a startling plan to impose
a temporary tax on their operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, introduced on Monday by Shintaro Ishihara, Tokyo's
feisty governor, aims to raise 110 billion yen, or roughly $1
billion, from 30 Tokyo-based banking institutions by taxing their
profits before extraordinary gains and losses and depreciation
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the largest bank in the
country, dropped 3.4 percent, to 1,375 yen, and other banks were
hit harder. Shares of Sanwa Bank fell 5.04 percent, while Sakura
Bank lost 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara could be using the proposed plan, which is still
sketchy, as a bargaining chip to extract concessions or money from
the central government to shore up the city's finances. He has
often thumbed his nose at convention, refusing to move into the
Governor's Mansion and irritating civil servants with comments that
suggested they had participated in bid rigging.
</P>
<P>
   He has nonetheless taken serious steps to address Tokyo's
looming fiscal crisis, including adopting a plan to cut personnel
costs by nearly $3 billion over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the brazen proposal to tax the banks illustrates the
severity of the straits of Japan's local governments, a great many
of which are teetering on the brink of insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   Tax revenue has fallen sharply as the central government has
tried to jolt the recalcitrant economy with huge public works
projects. Tokyo's corporate tax revenue has plunged to 3.4 billion
yen in the year that will end in March, from 210 billion yen at the
height of the nation's economic boom in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the local governments have taken on mountains of
debt to pay for various projects mandated by the central
government. Under Japanese law, local governments are required to
pay part of the costs of such projects, but they are increasingly
refusing to take part, saying they simply cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ishihara's plan, which will go to the
municipal assembly for approval, came as a shock to the banks and
to financial regulators, inciting howls of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no notice,'' fumed Michio Ochi, the head of the
Financial Reconstruction Commission, which is charged with
overseeing the rehabilitation of Japan's rickety financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Ochi, who described Ishihara as a ``frequent troublemaker,''
said the plan would place too big a burden on institutions that are
already struggling with piles of soured loans, a reduced demand for
new lending and a more vigorously competitive environment. ``I
cannot allow it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released Tuesday by the Bank of Japan, the
balance of outstanding loans dropped 6 percent in January from the
corresponding period last year, the 25th consecutive month that
lending, and thus interest income, has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Katsuyuki Sugita, the chairman of the Japanese Bankers
Association, said it would be ``grossly unfair'' to impose a tax on
a single industry and warned that the implications were dire. ``It
could lead to a lowering of the competitiveness of Japanese
financial institutions at a time when the financial reform is
making substantial progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Ishihara told reporters that he had singled banks
out because they were the only sector to receive benefits from the
central government. The central government has injected 7.7
trillion yen into the banks to shore them up. ``It is absurd that
banks never pay taxes and yet they receive benefits from the
government,'' Ishihara said.
</P>
<P>
   If New York City announced such a plan, the big banks that make
it their home could simply pick up and move, taking tax dollars
with them.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is somewhat different in Tokyo, however. Thanks to
their close-knit relationship with agencies of the central
government, the banks would find it hard to relocate their
headquarters in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, Japanese banks have written off some $473 billion in
bad loans over the last eight years, a process that has more than
eliminated what meager operating profits they may have had. The
bottom-line losses produced by that practice have excused the banks
from paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo is the first Japanese locality to try to use a special
clause in the local tax laws to tax companies based on their size
rather than their performance. The clause was based on the notion
that all companies benefit from the public services provided by
local governments and thus should have to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara is counting on the sympathy of his constituents, who,
like most Japanese, have no love lost for their banks, which have
long favored corporate clients over individual customers and small
businesses. ``He could have said he was going to tax NEC, Hitachi
or Sony,'' said Robert Zielinski, a banking analyst with Lehman
Brothers in Tokyo. ``But banks are an easy target because Japanese
like Sony TVs and NEC computers, but no one really likes Japanese
banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Zielinski said the market had overreacted. ``When all this is
said and done, if this happens, the banks will just pass it on as
costs to the consumer,'' he said. ``Besides, what's $1 billion a
year when Japanese banks routinely write off $100 billion in a
year?''

COURT WILL HEAR APPEAL OF RULING ON PINOCHET
</HEADLINE>
  (DELETES ``compassionate'' from penultimate graf.) 
 (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet's hopes of being freed from house
arrest and allowed to return home to Chile in the near future
suffered a setback Tuesday when a British court said it would hear
an appeal of Britain's decision that he was not medically fit to
stand trial on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   Six human rights groups and the government of Belgium are
challenging the refusal of Jack Straw, Britain's home secretary, to
make public an examination in January of Pinochet by four British
doctors. The doctors' report was the basis of Straw's finding that
the 84-year-old former dictator was not able to withstand the
rigors of extradition to Spain and trial in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The same challenge was thrown out last week by High Court Judge
Maurice Kay, who ruled that Straw, in insisting on keeping the
medical records confidential, had acted ``lawfully, fairly and
rationally.'' But the court Tuesday granted the request for
judicial review, saying that the complainants had ``an arguable
case.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision significantly changed the status of the case for
Pinochet's opponents. Now, whatever the outcome, there can be an
appeal to Britain's highest court, the Law Lords of the House of
Lords. Aside from requiring the general to remain in Britain
possibly for months more, such an appeal would return the Pinochet
case to the law lords, who on two earlier occasions had ruled
against him.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's action had remained only an application for
permission to seek judicial review and the court had rejected it,
the way would have been cleared for Straw to make a final and
unappealable decision to let Pinochet depart. A Chilean Air Force
plane has been waiting at an air force base in Oxfordshire for the
past week in the expectation that his confinement in England was
coming to an end this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Justice Simon Brown, one of the three judges, appeared to
take note of the protracted legal passage of the case during the
last year and a half, saying one reason the court was taking the
case was to spare another ``unfortunate'' tribunal from having to
deal with the complex case all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been in England since his arrest in October 1998 on
a petition from a Spanish judge that he be extradited to Madrid for
trial on charges of crimes against humanity dating from his
1973-1990 rule of Chile. After losing a series of judicial efforts
to overturn his arrest and contest the Spanish claim, Pinochet saw
his chances for an imminent end to the case improve sharply when
Straw said last month that he was inclined to drop the extradition
proceedings on grounds of age and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much welcome the fact that the hearing will now go on
to consider the merits of the case,'' said a spokesman for Amnesty
International, one of the rights groups. ``It's particularly
important for us, because clearly we want to put our argument
before the court, which is that it flouts natural justice not to
provide the information in the medical reports, particularly to the
governments seeking natural justice.''

 &HT;    Attacks fly in battle for South Carolina
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ It wasn't supposed to be like this. Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain shook hands on
national TV in January, sealing a pact that neither would resort to
negative campaigning against his Republican presidential rival.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, the attacks are flying both ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's newest commercial, unveiled Tuesday, attacks
McCain as a Washington insider who has, in the latest mantra of
Bush and his campaign handlers, ``said one thing and done another''
_ chiefly on McCain's centerpiece issue of campaign funding reform.
``John McCain promised a clean campaign, then attacked Governor
Bush with misleading ads. McCain says he's the only candidate who
can beat Gore on campaign finance, but news investigations reveal
McCain solicits money from lobbyists with interests before his
committee and pressures agencies on behalf of contributors.'' It's
the latest sign of how tense this once-gentlemanly race has become
since McCain pulled a stunning 19-point victory over Bush in New
Hampshire Feb. 1. Each accuses the other of breaking the handshake
deal first and says he's only responding to the other's negative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did it get to this point?
</P>
<P>
   _McCain ran a spot implying that Bush's tax plan spends every
penny of an anticipated budget surplus and sets aside no money for
Social Security. Not so, Bush said, so ...
</P>
<P>
   _Bush ran an ad last week accusing McCain of distorting the
facts on his tax plan. ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush isn't
true and McCain knows it,'' the announcer intoned. McCain said that
commercial was filled with half truths, so ...
</P>
<P>
   _McCain on Monday released a commercial accusing Bush of
negative campaigning and ends with the line: ``Do we really want
another politician in the White House America can't trust?''
</P>
<P>
   _On Tuesday, both released new ads. McCain's complains about an
earlier Bush spot and suggests the Texas governor is ``getting
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His ad twists the truth like Clinton. We're all pretty tired
of that,'' McCain says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, isn't it?'' Bush said Tuesday. ``The true nature of
John McCain evidently is coming out. I'm sad he's running that kind
of ad ... I'm not going to let my record be distorted. ... I've got
a good record. That's what I'm going to talk about in the state of
South Carolina and everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered a cease-fire Monday, and his campaign chairman
followed it up Tuesday with a letter to Bush's chief strategist.
``Let's all be nice guys and pull your ads, we'll pull our ads and
we'll all be nice guys again,'' McCain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not biting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for people to see the true John
McCain,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``Let's let the ad run. That's an old
Washington, D.C. game. It's a game of switch and bait. It's a game
of say one thing and do another. If he really believes in the ad,
let his stay up.''
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no end. In fact, escalation appears likely.
Bush is contemplating ads that hit McCain for his role in the
Keating Five case, when he and four other senators were accused of
improperly intervening with federal banking regulators on behalf of
a wealthy developer, as well as ads on taxes and public financing
of elections, said an adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain says he won't hold back. ``We won't just
respond, we will respond doubly,'' he said.

 &HT;    With spring training on the horizon, now would be a good time to
check your sick days

   JUPITER, Fla. _ They plant the ryegrass just before Thanksgiving
and baby it all through the winter. Water it. Mow it. Maybe even
talk to it a little, right when the sun's coming up.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-December, they're mowing, first one way, then the next,
until the whole field is perfectly striped like the broad side of a
zebra _ only softer, like feathers.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Budweiser man starts hanging out in the boss
man's office. The Bud man loves this new St. Louis Cardinals crowd.
They're crazy about Anheuser-Busch! And by the first of February,
the folks at the gift shop have unpacked about a million and one XL
Mark McGwire jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   You and I might have just set a tender foot into February. We
might still be wearing our cotton turtlenecks and thinking about
buying our Valentine's cards. But just around the corner is spring,
wonderful spring, Florida spring, which of course means one thing.
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and catchers start reporting Feb. 17, which means
steamy weather is just around the corner. Baseball's funny like
that. One day it's October, and the Yankees are playing. Again. The
next thing you know it's Halloween, and you've eaten all the candy.
Then it's Thanksgiving and Hanukkah and New Year's, and then here
come the Montreal Expos and the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, our spring magic comes at the expense of people such
as Brian Barnes and Jorge Toro and Cindy Unger and Rob Rabenecker
and the others on staff at Jupiter's Roger Dean stadium. You and I
might be all relaxed and happy. We might be hankering for a cold
beer and a stadium dog. But they're working 50, sometimes 60 hours
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, director of operations, is in charge of all the stuff
that makes things tick.
</P>
<P>
   Like the parking passes. And the season tickets. Some people
actually forget to pay! Barnes hires the 50 or 60 ushers, mostly
retirees, who will work the season, getting people safely to their
seats. He's got to make sure the souvenir stands are in order and
that the extra security's on the payroll. He meets with the sales
staff and files weekly reports to both the Cardinals' and Expos'
home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hit January, I'm working up to 70 hours,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means is that Barnes and his stadium cronies don't
have much time to hobnob with the stars, although they do meet one
occasionally. ``I might get to pass a player and say, `Hi.' But
they don't know me from Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 7,200 seats at the Jupiter complex, and Jorge Toro is
the man they call when one of them's wobbly. He is also the man
they call for a broken lock, a cracked window, a persnickety soda
machine or an overflowing toilet. He's so busy with his babbling
two-way radio during spring games, he never knows who's on first.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Unger's been tending to the fields for months now. She's
planted the rye seed, watched it spring up amid the Bermuda. She's
planted the impatiens and forced the bougainvillea to bloom. She's
raked the clay, watered it, watched it dry. She's got the infield
berms just right and the pitcher's mound the perfect height. She's
got home plate packed like McGwire likes it. ``He has bad feet,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's work. Back-breaking work. But she loves it. ``There's no
time to sit around.''
</P>
<P>
   Like you and I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people work every bit as hard as the players,'' says
stadium general manager Rob Rabenecker.
</P>
<P>
   The first game is March 3, less than a month away, which means
it's not too early to start planting The Seed.
</P>
<P>
   The Flu Seed.
</P>
<P>
   Start with your kid.
</P>
<P>
   She must have picked it up at school. Boy, she was sick.
</P>
<P>
   Then your wife.
</P>
<P>
   The poor thing. She had it off and on for a whole week!
</P>
<P>
   Give the whole act a rest for about three days and then, toward
the end of the month, turn it back on.
</P>
<P>
   You have a headache. You have the chills.
</P>
<P>
   You also have great seats behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   But it's February, almost March, practically April, and the
baseball gods are up there, smiling, absolving all our little white
lies. In fact, when you get to the stadium, and you spot your boss
at the beer booth, just smile and wave and give him the thumbs up.
He understands that mum's the word for the whole glorious month of
March.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as the use of DNA in criminal investigations is
on the verge of becoming routine, rape survivors and law
enforcement experts are finding that in the realm of sex crimes,
science has outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   Through mandatory sampling of prisoners and other known
criminals, states are rapidly expanding their computer databases of
DNA profiles, which allow investigators to compare tiny bits of
biological evidence from crime scenes against pools of potential
suspects. These checks are increasingly simple, nearly infallible
and offer fresh hope for breakthroughs, especially in the huge
backlog of rape investigations that have gone cold.
</P>
<P>
   But a race against time is under way. Most states have a statute
of limitations for rape prosecutions, meaning that cold cases may
soon be solved but not prosecuted, even though the rapists are
known by name and the evidence against them may seem overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, rape cases expire after five years. Police records
show that time is running out on hundreds of open cases in New York
City, just as there is hope of bringing the rapists to justice.
Rape survivors, who have waited years for DNA profiling to reach
its current potential, say the news is dispiriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe my case will be closed when it's five years
old,'' said a 30-year-old West Village artist who was raped at
gunpoint in August 1995. ``I think it should always be open, even
after I die, until they find this person.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rape survivor, a Manhattan student who was raped in 1998
and whose case is unsolved, said that a statute that does not
account for the power of DNA databasing is ``a disgusting
oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how there can be a timetable on this
crime,'' she said. ``Rape has completely changed my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Statutes of limitations have their origins in common law. They
are rooted in principles of fairness, which hold that as time
passes, a person accused of a crime has a greater difficulty
presenting an effective courtroom defense. How many people, after
all, can account for their precise whereabouts during a given hour
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal here was to give a defendant a fair chance,'' said
Stephen Gillers, a vice dean and professor at New York University
School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   But, Gillers said, DNA profiling has become so accurate in
matching suspects to crimes that the historic rationale for
statutes of limitations is now being strained. ``I think the
existence of DNA evidence, with its virtual near-lock in
establishing guilt or innocence, justifies looking at this again,''
he said. ``It is an interesting question, and it has hardly been
raised.''
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures are only just beginning to review their
statutes of limitations in light of the DNA databases. In New York,
discussion of the issue has started, law enforcement experts said,
but no bill has been drafted. Three other states _ Florida, Nevada
and New Jersey _ recently abolished the limits in cases of sexual
assault. The changes are not retroactive; old cases still expire,
but future cases will benefit from the DNA databases.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the gap between science and the law reaches back
to 1983, when Dr. Kary Mullis, a chemist for the Cetus Corp.,
invented a technique known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR,
which allows for strands of DNA from a cell's nucleus to be
replicated millions of times.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, which earned Dr. Mullis a Nobel Prize, is now
performed by lab technicians using machines that can amplify DNA
from crime-scene samples _ semen, blood, saliva or skin _ that are
smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. The amplified
batches are then examined at 13 to 15 points along each strand,
yielding a distinct genetic profile of the individual who was the
source of the sample.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, as law enforcement agencies recognized the
value of this technique, states started passing laws requiring
convicted felons and prison inmates to submit to DNA sampling. The
intention has been to merge their profiles into databases, creating
pools of information on potential suspects against which evidence
can be quickly compared.
</P>
<P>
   New York passed a DNA sampling law last summer and expects to
enter 30,000 samples into its database each year. New York City
began testing all new rape evidence last year, and has nearly 1,400
profiles in its database. The effort has produced results: last
month, for example, the city database linked Jonathan Williams, a
man held at Rikers Island on a murder charge, to the 1998 rape of a
Harlem teen-ager. The police say Williams had not previously been a
suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As the databases grow, criminologists predict, more cold cases
will be solved. And of all cold crimes, they say, rape is among the
easiest to use DNA evidence advantageously. This is because
emergency-room nurses have long been swabbing semen and saliva from
victims of sexual assaults, and police departments have been
storing the samples.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of evidence in New York City alone is staggering.
Inside a suite of walk-in freezers in a Queens warehouse are long
rows of meticulously stacked cardboard boxes, one box each for
16,000 women raped in the city since 1988. These boxes, known as
rape kits, contain small parcels of evidence that rapists left
behind: saliva and semen, bits of skin removed from under the
women's fingernails, and in a few cases, drops of an attacker's
blood.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the city plans to send 12,000 of these kits _ all
those less than five years old _ to a private laboratory for DNA
profiling, and then to enter the results in the expanding databases
to seek matches to cases that have thwarted New York detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that we are going to get some hits,''
said Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who ordered the kits to be
tested.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect of New York's statute of limitations on this
effort is already apparent. The freezers contain evidence for
thousands of cases that have expired and hundreds of others that
will expire soon. Among the cases expiring in the next few weeks,
police records show, are those of a 39-year-old woman who was raped
at knife-point on the steps of an Ozone Park school, a 15-year-old
girl who was raped by five men who abducted her as she walked to
her aunt's house in Greenpoint, and a 25-year-old woman who was
raped on Staten Island by a man who offered her a late-night car
ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no legal or moral reason to have a statue
of limitations for these cases,'' Safir said. ``What this says to
victims is, `The government doesn't care about you.''' He said he
has started talking to state officials to press for legislation
abolishing the statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Susan S. Howley, public policy director of the National Center
for Victims of Crime, said the three states that have abolished the
time limits _ Florida, Nevada and New Jersey _ did so in part
because of advances in DNA analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is known that so many sex offenders are recidivists, and
that more and more cases are going to solved because of DNA,''
Howley said. ``It seemed a shame to have solid cases in which the
statute has run.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the police and prosecutors say they have
options to prevent old cases from expiring. For example, in
Wisconsin, a district attorney has drafted an indictment against a
``John Doe'' suspect _ a serial rapist _ who left DNA at three
crime scenes years ago but whose identity remains unknown. In
theory, the indictment provides a means to keep the cases alive
until the rapist's DNA profile enters the databases. John Doe
indictments have not been tried in New York, law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists and rape survivors expect proposals for longer
statutes of limitations to gain momentum. ``In terms of legislative
initiatives surrounding DNA, I think this is where the next attack
is going to be,'' said Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky, assistant provost
of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ``It seems to me that
there is no valid reason that we should not prosecute when the
evidence is intact, the complainant is alive and still complaining,
and the rapist's identity can be known. It really does call for a
change in legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fairstein, chief of the Manhattan district attorney's sex
crimes unit and an advocate of more extensive testing and use of
DNA, said such a discussion was inevitable. ``Science has
revolutionized the investigation and prosecution of this kind of
case,'' she said. ``But the law hasn't entirely caught up with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is so new that the New York Civil Liberties Union has
yet to take a position, said Norman Siegel, the group's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you extend a statute of limitation for a lengthy
time,'' Siegel said, ``you run the risk of impairing the fairness
of the judicial proceeding, because of the fact that evidence
disappears and memories fade. On the other hand, rape is a serious
crime, and we will examine this issue when a legislative bill
surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   One rape survivor, a Manhattan medical student who was attacked
11 years ago and whose case has not been solved, said she is eager
for the discussion to reach the Legislature, and willing to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone really think that there should be a set period of
time for investigating, and then we throw our hands up in the air
and say, `It's over?''' she asked. ``Rape is one of the most
heinous crimes there is. It's never over.''

NIKE FEELS PAIN AS ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR LOSES ITS APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans just are not sneaker mad like they used to be, and no
amount of priming and pumping the advertising spigot by Nike Inc.
can make it otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest shoe manufacturer warned Tuesday that it
would miss earnings forecasts this year and next. The company
blamed a sharp reduction in retail square footage devoted to
athletic footwear in the United States as well as unfavorable
currency exchange rates with Europe for the disappointment. But
industry analysts conceded that those issues were symptoms of a
larger problem: namely, static demand for the products the company
has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that is going on tells you that it is a mature
industry and it went beyond itself in terms of supplying demand,''
said Margaret Mager, an apparel and footwear analyst with Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., said that earnings for
the fiscal year ending May 31 would be slightly less than the $2.08
a share expected by analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. The company also said that next year's earnings would
grow by less than the 20 percent analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pummeled the stock, causing it to plunge $8.25, or 18
percent, to $37. Of the 19 analysts who track the stock and who
report their recommendations to First Call, nine had strong buy
recommendations on the stock before Tuesday and three more had
rated the stock a buy.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's problems with shoe stores have been real. In the last
several weeks alone, two of the nation's largest athletic shoe
chains, Venator Group Inc., owner of the Foot Locker and Lady Foot
Locker chains, and Just For Feet Inc., have closed what could
amount to hundreds of stores. Altogether, retail space for athletic
footwear dropped 15 percent last year and is expected to continue
to shrink, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still an abundance of retail space out there for
athletic footwear,'' said Jim Severyn, vice president for athletic
leisure at Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the brand is a victim of its own early
successes and optimism that it could repeat them. For much of the
1980s and 1990s Nike was on fire. The company benefited as athletic
shoes became a hot fashion statement that could be worn with jeans
and suits alike. Then the company expanded as it took market share
away from other brands.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's stunning success lulled itself and vendors into thinking
that the growth could continue to soar, even as the total market
was cooling. Between 1995 and 1999 athletic shoe sales in the
United States grew from $6.8 billion to $7.1 billion, or less than
1 percent, according to Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has been more mature for longer than the
industry itself recognized and that's what is causing the problems
now,'' Mager of Goldman, Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Nike has not been alone in suffering from American consumers'
new love affair with alternative footwear like rugged boots and
lug-soled shoes. Reebok and Adidas have also had rough going. But
Nike, which accounts for some 45 percent of the domestic athletic
shoe market, and which gets 61 percent of its revenue from athletic
shoes, cannot help but be affected by consumers' relative
indifference to owning another pair of sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   The company finally got a wake-up call when the Asian financial
crises combined with slowing domestic sales. Nike's total sales
dropped from $9.6 billion in fiscal 1998 to $8.8 billion in fiscal
1999. This year the company has posted solid earnings growth, but
that uptick has not protected it from the market's wrath because
total sales for fiscal 2000, ending on May 31, are expected to be
about $9.1 billion, or well below the 1998s level.
</P>
<P>
   Even analysts who had rated the stock a buy because they
believed it was undervalued wonder where the company is going now.
``Very few of Nike's problems are self-inflicted,'' said Faye
Landes, an analyst with Thomas Weizel Partners, ``but the
underlying demand for athletic footwear is not changing and it is
time to look beyond shoes. They need to think way out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Silverstein, a footwear and apparel analyst with Bank of
America Securities, agreed. The stock was pummeled so hard Tuesday
because at a meeting with analysts, management offered ``no peg or
strategy for new growth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That could be bad news for America's favorite value investor,
Warren E. Buffett. According to data made public by Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway investment company, which has special permission
to delay public reporting of certain stock purchases and sales, the
company loaded up on Nike's stock in early 1998, when the stock
price averaged $43. Berkshire Hathaway owned 7.79 million shares at
the time of the report.

 &HT;    CWoods' run extended by valor, class
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stand by, San Diego, you're in for a treat; or La Jolla, where
the Buick Invitational really plays. Tiger Woods is coming to town.
I know, you saw him last year, when he won the thing. Just another
day at the office. All he had to beat was Billy Ray Brown, who had
his best day.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiger Woods you're going to see this time is a player at the
top of the game. Sure, he won the Masters three years ago, and the
PGA Championship last year, but at Pebble Beach, he took aim on his
first U.S. Open. He won the AT&AMP;T, which we old-timers still insist
on calling The Crosby, but that was just a tuneup for next June.
This is where the Open will be played this year.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won from behind before. He has won in front. He has
won every way a man can win, but never before has he been more
impressive than in this one. It was more than just tying Ben Hogan
at six in a row. It was the focus, the determination, the class.
Your every-day tournament professional looks at the leader board,
realizes that he's seven strokes off the lead with half a round
left to play, and he starts taking aim on second place.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods took aim on the back nine at Pebble Beach. He did
what he does so many times when he wins. He intimidates. He puts up
a score, and the rest of the field goes into remission. He had no
idea that he might win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought I'd put up the best score I could and see how
the guys on the course might react,'' he said. Get their attention,
in other words.
</P>
<P>
   While the player he was chasing was a rookie, Matt Gogel is no
kid. He's 29. Woods is 24. But it wasn't as if Woods was chasing a
pack of donkeys. Two others ahead of him were Vijay Singh and Mark
Brooks, both former PGA champions. Down to the wire, though, it was
Matt Gogel, a refugee from the Nike and Asian Tours.
</P>
<P>
   The plumb amazing thing is that Woods carefully plotted what he
had to do and did it. ``I knew I had to play the last four holes
four-under.'' When he eagled the par-4 15 from the fairway, the
surge was on. When Gogel three-putted the 18th from 10 feet, it was
over. They have had some finishes at weathery Pebble Beach, like
Tom Watson chipping in on 17 to beat Jack Nicklaus, and Hale Irwin
coming in off the beach, but there has never been another like
Woods' finish.
</P>
<P>
   You know the irony of it? Atlanta missed it. While this was
going on, the local CBS affiliate was showing something called
``Family Feud,'' with a host as broad as a fat stock champion.
Several other channels around the country also fell from grace.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan won his six-tournament stretch _ of the 10 he won that
year _ in two and a half months in 1948, including two classics,
the U.S. Open at Riviera and the Western Open. Usually, you could
figure 10 to l5 players of that age with a chance to win week to
week. Hogan had to fight off Byron Nelson, Sam Snead, Lloyd
Mangrum, Porky Oliver, Jack Burke, Jimmy Demaret, Frank Stranahan
and Johnny, the first Palmer, to name a few. In this century, there
are 40 to 50 who might win, and in 1999 some longshots who did were
Rich Beem, Mike Weir, Tom Pernice, and Carlos Franco and Notah
Begay III, Woods' Stanford teammate, who won twice. The tour has
become a mad scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the touch you had to like. After it was done and he had
survived his crash, Matt Gogel, the 29-year-old ``kid,'' was
visited in the interview room and consoled by Tiger Woods, the
24-year-old ``veteran.'' A fine American example, away from spousal
abuse, bar brawls, drugs and the dark side of the games we play.

CROSSOVER DEMOCRATS COULD CREATE AN UPSET IN MICHIGAN'S GOP
PRIMARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Gov. John Engler of Michigan has long touted his
state's Republican primary on Feb. 22 as a fire wall for Gov.
George W. Bush against any setbacks in other states, particularly
the South Carolina primary three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush did well here, and virtually the
entire Republican establishment has endorsed his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Michigan is asbestos'' Engler boasted last month.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sen. John McCain said on Monday that he still had ``a
long, long way to go'' in the state, there is growing evidence that
he is not behind by much and may even have pulled slightly ahead.
The latest poll shows the race to be so close that it will hinge on
how many Democrats and independents vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is crossover like there was in 1996, McCain can edge
Bush _ if there isn't crossover, Bush wins,'' said Edward V.
Sarpolus, a pollster for EPIC/MRA, the Lansing firm that conducted
the survey late last week for the Detroit Free Press and WXYZ, a
local television station.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accounted for 16 percent of the voters in the
Republican primary in 1996, while independents made up another 17
percent, surveys of voters showed.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the state's Democrats and independents are in
metropolitan Detroit, and the Republican primary in 1996 was held
on the same day, and used the same ballots, as a vote in the
Detroit area on whether bonds should be used to pay for a new
baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium issue, combined with the candidacy of Pat Buchanan,
increased the interest of Democrats and independents in the
Republican race, although voter turnout was still just 11 percent.
There are no big initiatives on this year's ballot, but a few small
towns are conducting referendums.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had led McCain at the end of November by 70 percent to 5
percent, and at the end of December by 52 percent to 25 percent.
The latest poll results show that McCain is doing better among
Republicans, Democrats and independents than Buchanan did when he
captured 34 percent of the vote in the 1996 primary, Sarpolus said.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the latest poll, to be published in the Free
Press on Wednesday, showed Bush leading McCain by 52 percent to 37
percent among Republicans. Bush trailed 43 percent to 45 percent if
a third of the voters in the Republican primary are Democrats and
independents, a statistical dead heat because the margin of error
is 5.7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday night, Engler said he thought
voter surveys had overestimated the number of crossover voters in
1996, and that there would be fewer this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is openly pursuing Democratic and independent voters
here. He campaigned on Monday in Flint and Saginaw, two cities in
east-central Michigan where support for Ross Perot was strong in
1992, as well as in Warren, a blue-collar Democratic suburb of
Detroit. By contrast, Bush campaigned last Friday in Grand Rapids,
a Republican bastion in western Michigan, as well as in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party will hold a separate caucus in Michigan on
March 11.

CLINTON BANS USE OF GENETIC DATA IN FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting what he hopes will be a precedent for
employers nationwide, President Clinton issued an order Tuesday
that prohibits federal agencies from using genetic information in
any decision to hire, promote or dismiss workers.
</P>
<P>
   The order will protect 2.8 million federal employees. White
House officials said they knew of no other employer who had adopted
such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the human genome and a person's genetic makeup
can transform medical care, making it easier to detect, treat and
prevent disease, Clinton said. But, he added, the misuse of genetic
tests can also violate personal privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies in scientific journals suggest that many people
have been asked questions about genetic diseases on job
applications, and some workers report that they have been denied
jobs or dismissed from jobs because of genetic conditions in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not allow advances in genetics to become the basis of
discrimination against any individual or any group,'' Clinton told
the American Association for the Advancement of Science. ``By
signing this executive order, my goal is to set an example and pose
a challenge for every employer in America, because I believe no
employer should ever review your genetic records along with your
resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said Clinton's
order, setting policy for the nation's largest employer, ``sends a
powerful message to the private sector about how they'll need to
deal with the advances'' in human genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have developed hundreds of genetic tests that can
help identify people with an increased risk of developing breast
cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, cystic fibrosis,
Alzheimer's and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they had no evidence of widespread
abuse, but were trying to anticipate problems that would arise as
the technology improves and the number of tests increases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a federal appeals court found that a government
laboratory in California, the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, had for years conducted genetic tests on employees
without their permission, and it said the practice might have
violated the workers' privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had urged Clinton to adopt the privacy protections
because of evidence that many people were reluctant to take
advantage of genetic tests, or to participate in genetic research,
because they feared that the results might be used against them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Congress should pass legislation to prevent private
employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of
genetic tests. Such legislation has been introduced by Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, and Rep. Louise M. Slaughter,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also bar insurance companies from using
``predictive genetic information'' to deny coverage or to set rates
for insurance policies. Group health plans serving 50 or more
employees are already forbidden to discriminate on the basis of
genetic data, but the safeguards do not apply to people buying
insurance as individuals or in small groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said he had not
studied the Daschle-Slaughter bill. ``But,'' he said, ``we have a
tight schedule for this year, and I don't now have that on the
schedule for consideration during this year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   White House officials distinguished between genetic information,
which may indicate a predisposition to an illness or disease, and
the actual medical condition or disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It may sometimes be appropriate for employers to consider
current illnesses that impair workers' ability to perform the
essential functions of a job, the officials said, but it is not
proper to consider a person's predisposition to develop such
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy R. Uhlmann of the University of Michigan, who is president
of the National Society of Genetic Counselors, hailed the
president's action, saying: ``All of us are predisposed to some
type of illness, but most of us don't know what it is yet. The more
protections we have in place, the better it will be for all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But E. Neil Trautwein, director of employment policy at the
National Association of Manufacturers, said: ``We have not seen any
signs that additional laws or regulations are needed to prevent
employment discrimination on the basis of genetic information.
Existing laws are sufficient. Employers are doing everything they
can to get workers into the workplace. We are not about to start
barring the door, especially in an area like this, which is fraught
with the potential for litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's order says federal agencies may not dismiss,
refuse to hire or discriminate against workers because of genetic
tests conducted on them or their relatives. Likewise, it says,
federal agencies may not discriminate against workers because they
request or receive genetic counseling or tests.
</P>
<P>
   The order has several limited exceptions. For example, a federal
agency could periodically test employees, with their consent, to
see if they had suffered chromosomal damage or genetic alterations
because of exposure to radiation or toxic substances in the
workplace.

 &HT;    Attacks fly in battle for South Carolina
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ It wasn't supposed to be like this. Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain shook hands on
national TV in January, sealing a pact that neither would resort to
negative campaigning against his Republican presidential rival.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, the attacks are flying both ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's newest commercial, unveiled Tuesday, attacks
McCain as a Washington insider who has, in the latest mantra of
Bush and his campaign handlers, ``said one thing and done another''
_ chiefly on McCain's centerpiece issue of campaign funding reform.
``John McCain promised a clean campaign, then attacked Governor
Bush with misleading ads. McCain says he's the only candidate who
can beat Gore on campaign finance, but news investigations reveal
McCain solicits money from lobbyists with interests before his
committee and pressures agencies on behalf of contributors.'' It's
the latest sign of how tense this once-gentlemanly race has become
since McCain pulled a stunning 19-point victory over Bush in New
Hampshire Feb. 1. Each accuses the other of breaking the handshake
deal first and says he's only responding to the other's negative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did it get to this point?
</P>
<P>
   _McCain ran a spot implying that Bush's tax plan spends every
penny of an anticipated budget surplus and sets aside no money for
Social Security. Not so, Bush said, so ...
</P>
<P>
   _Bush ran an ad last week accusing McCain of distorting the
facts on his tax plan. ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush isn't
true and McCain knows it,'' the announcer intoned. McCain said that
commercial was filled with half truths, so ...
</P>
<P>
   _McCain on Monday released a commercial accusing Bush of
negative campaigning and ends with the line: ``Do we really want
another politician in the White House America can't trust?''
</P>
<P>
   _On Tuesday, both released new ads. McCain's complains about an
earlier Bush spot and suggests the Texas governor is ``getting
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His ad twists the truth like Clinton. We're all pretty tired
of that,'' McCain says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, isn't it?'' Bush said Tuesday. ``The true nature of
John McCain evidently is coming out. I'm sad he's running that kind
of ad ... I'm not going to let my record be distorted. ... I've got
a good record. That's what I'm going to talk about in the state of
South Carolina and everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered a cease-fire Monday, and his campaign chairman
followed it up Tuesday with a letter to Bush's chief strategist.
``Let's all be nice guys and pull your ads, we'll pull our ads and
we'll all be nice guys again,'' McCain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not biting.

   ``I think it's important for people to see the true John
McCain,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``Let's let the ad run. That's an old
Washington, D.C. game. It's a game of switch and bait. It's a game
of say one thing and do another. If he really believes in the ad,
let his stay up.''
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no end. In fact, escalation appears likely.
Bush is contemplating ads that hit McCain for his role in the
Keating Five case, when he and four other senators were accused of
improperly intervening with federal banking regulators on behalf of
a wealthy developer, as well as ads on taxes and public financing
of elections, said an adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain says he won't hold back. ``We won't just
respond, we will respond doubly,'' he said.

FRESH IDEAS FROM THE JAZZ UNDERGROUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most big-picture conversations about jazz these days come down
to the same question: how can it become important again? The answer
has to be more than once-every-five-years phenomena like Cassandra
Wilson or Diana Krall.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz needs what rock has had since the '80s, an organized
proliferation of termitelike hipster activity wherever there are
young people playing and listening. There needs to be better music
education. There need to be more clubs booking jazz where people
under 25 feel welcome. And there needs to be a thriving
independent-label record business, one that plots the daily graph
of where jazz musicians are heading.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the major labels continue to release jazz, some of it
with the superior quality of 1999 records like John Lewis'
``Evolution'' and Lee Konitz's ``Another Shade of Blue.'' And until
as recently as a year ago, it seemed that while the entrepreneurs
of avant-jazz had figured out how to brand and sell this art to its
own crowd _ via labels like Aum Fidelity, CIMP and Eremite _ that
knowledge still hadn't spread beyond the well-mapped island of
avant-gardism toward the less outwardly transgressive, more
traditionally musical area of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting situation, as a cynical critic wrote me recently,
was that it became hard for an outsider to tell what was going on
in jazz ``between the boring old guys and the boring young
screechers.''
</P>
<P>
   What hadn't been learned? That a small label can start making a
profit after selling a few thousand copies, or fewer, of a CD; that
a third of a jazz musician's CD sales can be made off the bandstand
before and after concerts; that companies can sell CDs from their
Web site directly to the consumer; that jazz records might not make
much money in the first eight weeks of availabilty but can be slow,
steady sellers if the band performs enough.
</P>
<P>
   This story has a happy ending. In the last year, along with more
big-label constriction _ Time Warner's intended swallowing of
Capitol _ there has been a staggering, surprising load of fresh and
encouraging independent-label releases addressing this invisible
middle-ground of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz is moving in a direction that nobody can quite name at the
moment, somewhere between the usual posts of free and formal,
experimental and traditional, harmony and rhythm, and these albums
are the documents of that search.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh Sound, from Barcelona, Spain, has been busily recording
much of the young jazz scene in New York: band leaders like Ethan
Iverson, Reid Anderson, Diego Urcola, Bill McHenry and Chris
Lightcap have all put out first-rate records on the label within
the last six months. The New York-based Palmetto, getting to its
feet over the last three years, has hit its stride with Ben
Allison's ``Third Eye'' as well as a forthcoming record from Andrew
Hill, one of the master figures in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   And many independent labels, including Koch, Arabesque and
Igmod, are feeding off the fruit of the Jazz Composers Collective,
which itself has become an imprimatur of indie credibility _ a
musician-run organization whose band leaders, including Allison and
Hill, are all putting high intelligence into their craft.
</P>
<P>
   More encouraging news: Thrill Jockey, a rock label from Chicago,
now has the octet 8 Bold Souls and No Alternative, a rock label
from Minneapolis, has the quirky, unorthodox jazz band Happy Apple.
Compass, a bluegrass and acoustic-music label in Nashville run by
musicians, released two excellent mainstream jazz records last
year, by the trumpeter Rod McGaha and the saxophonist Jeff Coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Omni Tone, started in 1999, has produced sharp records by
as-yet-untried artists like the trumpeter Ron Horton and the group
Equal Interest. Half Note records, run out of the Blue Note club in
New York, has started a voluminous series of CDs recorded live at
the club _ a practice that eliminates studio costs.
</P>
<P>
   Jazzateria has just given forth Marc Cary's ``Trillium,'' an
album that sounds casual but presents a persuasive thesis on the
state of the modern jazz piano trio. Basin Street, a small company
in New Orleans, has sold nearly 12,000 copies of a record by the
jazz and Cuban-music group Los Hombres Calientes, and the band
hasn't even played in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Through no fault of the labels, it's not as easy as it should be
to find these albums in stores. Major chains will take one or two
copies from an independent label, unless the label is prepared to
buy costly shelf space within a listening station.
</P>
<P>
   And the online stores like CDNow and Music Boulevard, which
claim to have every in-print title for sale, may take weeks to fill
an order for some of these records, if they can do it at all. (An
easier solution: buy these discs from the labels' Web sites.)
</P>
<P>
   But independent labels effectively serve the main purpose of
making jazz records: documentation, rather than a profit made in
the first two months. (Musicians need something to mark their
growth, and they also need something to sell.) And at best,
independent jazz labels might attain the kind of cultural power
that such labels have had in rock for the last two decades, and
result in a welcome diversity in radio and jazz-festival
programming.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an obvious poetic resonance to all this activity:
it's a return to form, to the 1940s and 1950s, when jazz was at its
healthiest. It was defined then by independent labels like
Prestige, Blue Note, Riverside, Commodore and Savoy, which pumped
out an endless river of the music as it happened. Wouldn't it be
nice to leave a legacy like that again?

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Former Rockets guard Clyde Drexler came down firmly on the side of
Scottie Pippen on Tuesday when asked in a radio interview about
Pippen's criticism of Rockets forward Charles Barkley.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drexler was critical of Barkley's training habits and
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those guys I respect a lot, but Charles I can
understand Scottie's point,'' Drexler, in his second season as head
coach at the University of Houston, said on Jim Rome's nationally
syndicated radio show. ``Because if you are a professional, and you
strive to be the best, and you have a lot of self-discipline, and
you go to bed early and take care of your body and get in shape
with a personal trainer, you expect your teammates to do the same.
And Charles isn't going to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles has been a good player for many, many years. You can't
argue what he has been able to do. But if you are a competitor,
you've got to look at effort on the court. And that effort not only
has to mean 10 rebounds; you have to play defense, too. Charles is
not the greatest defensive player in the world. And sometimes it
looks like he is not trying. But he always turns out a good effort
and somehow remains competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a guy like Scottie and myself, we can't accept that
lackadaisical attitude, because we give everything we have out
there every single night. So it is tough to take it from another
teammate who looks like he isn't trying very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he had no response to Drexler's verbal swipe.
Barkley attended UH's loss to Alabama-Birmingham last week to
congratulate Drexler on having his Rockets number retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say about Clyde,'' Barkley said. ``I
don't have an opinion one way or another. I wish him the best at
the University of Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler described Barkley as hypocritical for not working harder
on his conditioning and doubted Barkley could come back to play
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is called hypocrisy,'' Drexler said. ``And that is not the
first time that he has been accused of that. I just called a spade
a spade. I was on that team. And what Scottie says is the same
thing that I saw and was a part of, and that kind of helped in my
decision to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the court, I love both guys. On the court, Charles is not
the kind of guy I'd like to play with, because he never works hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know Charles rehab for Charles is not rehab like
everyone else. He is going to find an easy way to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler was also highly critical of his players at UH, saying
his team had Division III talent.

A BUMPY PATH FOR ELIAN'S FLORIDA FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For more then two months the Florida family of Elian
Gonzalez has been a staple of the nightly news. There's Elian, the
6-year-old refugee, swinging a baseball bat in front of the little
stucco house in a working-class neighborhood of Little Havana.
There he is kicking a soccer ball with his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez and hugging Marisleysis, his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   But not surprisingly, a closer look provides a far more complex
portrait of an immigrant family suddenly caught up in an
international spectacle of a dispute over the custody of Elian, who
survived a crossing from Cuba in which his mother and 10 other
people drowned. It is a striving, hard-working, close-knit family
that neighbors say is unassuming, helpful and easy to get along
with.
</P>
<P>
   The little, two-bedroom, one-bath home of Lazaro Gonzalez, 49,
his wife, Angela, and their daughter, Marisleysis, 21, is the
gathering place for an extended family that itself is divided over
Elian's future. And it is the focal point of a public relations
struggle between Miami's Cuban-Americans and the government of
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But this extended family is also one that has run afoul of the
law in ways that could affect their bid to gain permanent custody
of Elian, whose father in Cuba wants him returned, experts in
custody law say.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, an automobile mechanic who moved here from the
Marina neighborhood in Cardenas, Cuba, 15 years ago, has four
convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol during the
1990s, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and
Motor Vehicles. His license was revoked or suspended for a total of
three years. He completed an alcohol treatment course after his
most recent conviction, in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's brother Delfin Gonzalez, 63, a fisherman who usually
lives in Marathon in the Florida Keys but who is a staunch
supporter of Lazaro's custody claim and has been staying here with
the family, has four convictions for driving under the influence
over the last decade, most recently in May 1997. Two of the cases
involved accidents with property damage or personal injury. Delfin
Gonzalez had his license revoked for a total of two years.
</P>
<P>
   Two other relatives who have been periodic visitors at the home
have also had run-ins with the law, the weekly New Times newspaper
here first reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cid, 32, one of Lazaro and Delfin's nephews, a son of their
sister here, Georgina Cid, began a 13-year sentence at the Glades
Correctional Institution last month for grand theft, forgery and
violating probation, according to the Miami-Dade Department of
Corrections. His twin brother, Luis Cid, goes on trial Feb. 18 in
the robbery of a tourist last September in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Legal problems for many poor families are common in Miami's
immigrant community, lawyers say, and those of the Gonzalezes are
characteristic of many. But they say that the driving convictions,
especially, create problems for Lazaro Gonzalez's claims for
custody and lend the government a new argument in defending its
decision last month to return the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does have an impact on the fitness of these adults to
raise this child, unquestionably,'' said Bernard Perlmutter, a
professor and expert in family law at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Guggenheim, a professor of law at New York University and
a specialist in child and family law, said, ``Increasingly in
recent years, courts have been interested in any and all
information that bears upon parental fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child might be in the car and subject to an accident
caused by drunk driving,'' Guggenheim said, ``or the parent could
end up injured, dead or in prison because of drunk driving.''
</P>
<P>
   No close Gonzalez relatives in Miami could be reached for
comment. Armando Gutierrez, a prominent Cuban-American political
consultant here and the relatives' publicist and spokesman, said he
had not heard of the driving records until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The driving convictions, said Spencer Eig, the relatives' lead
lawyer, are less troubling than comments by one of Elian's
grandmothers, who told Cuban television that she bit Elian's tongue
when she visited him here last month to goad him to talk and
inspected his penis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro and Angela Gonzalez live in a neighborhood of fortresses
and locks. Chain-link fencing cuts across the front of most yards,
with padlocked gates across the front walks and the driveways. Many
houses have wrought-iron gates to protect the front door, and
wrought-iron grills on the windows.
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees most households are reaping benefits of the
nation's prosperity, so they have more than ever to protect. The
most prosperous have small, well-tended patches of grass and nests
of bougainvilea, cactus and palms. They have central air
conditioning, red ceramic tiles on their roofs, replacing asphalt
tiles, and tall, spiked iron fences instead of chain link.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez home, a 48-year-old gray-white stucco house, is
more modest than most. Except for Elian's many outdoor toys, all
donated, nothing is new. Assessed for tax purposes at $67,298, it
has two bedrooms and a bath. Marisleysis shares her bedroom with
Elian. Real estate agents said the rent would be somewhere between
$500 and $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Only Lazaro, Angela, Elian and and Marisleysis are living their
now, although Delfin often visits. William, their 27-year-old son,
moved out about three years ago, after marrying the granddaughter
of Guillermina Ferrer, the Gonzalez's next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the clan, Manuel Gonzalez, who is a brother of
Lazaro, is not welcome in the house because he has supported
Elian's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Gonzalez rises before dawn each day to work in a factory
sewing clothes and devotes the rest of her day to domestic activity
inside the home. Lazaro Gonzalez works irregularly. Now and then he
comes out to tinker with a red 1988 Thunderbird, registered in his
wife's name, that was bought four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis works as a loan officer at the main branch of Ocean
Bank here, along with a cousin, Georgina Cid Cruz. Georgina is the
sister of the Cid twins.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer has lived next door for as long as the Gonzalezes have
been there. She said she watches William and her granddaughter
Jacqueline's 6-month-old son while the parents work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela is a very quiet woman,'' Ferrer said. ``Even before all
this started, you never even heard her talk. You never even knew
when she was around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of anyone in that family getting into any
kind of trouble or anything,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Castillo, across the street, said, ``They're always there
to help you. That family gets along fine and is very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that for entertainment, the Gonzalezes tend to
stay home with relatives, rather than go out.
</P>
<P>
   Across this neighborhood, and across Little Havana, there are
few signs of the epic war of words and lawsuits that have stirred
Congress, the Clinton administration, Cuba and the Cuban-American
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The media vans and the demonstrators, largely anti-Castro
immigrants from outside the neighborhood, have the Gonzalezes to
themselves. Just one household near Elian's, a block away, has
taken any note of there fight still raging in court. ``Back To No
Future,'' a sign on the door reads.
</P>
<P>
   But the case for holding Elian has taken another sharp turn. It
is harder to argue for holding him in America, Perlmutter of the
University of Miami said, in view of family's troubles with the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The family here is attempting to argue that it can offer Elian a
better life than his father can, while the real issue is whether
the father, Juan Miguel, is fit to raise his son, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the disclosure of the drunk driving convictions, Perlmutter
said, the Miami family's case is harder to make. Except for
innuendo and unsubstantiated rumor, he said, no one has challenged
the father's fitness to raise a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should win hands down,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The efficiency of American workers surged in the last six months
of 1999, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. With these final
numbers, the 1990s entered the books as the decade that produced
the greatest improvement in productivity since the golden 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity, an arcane statistic, nevertheless explains _ more
than any other single statistic _ how the American economy can grow
as strongly as it has the last four years without generating more
inflation. Workers, in effect, are producing considerably more
without having to be paid more, and that takes the pressure off
corporate America to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of data keeps alive the expectation that the economy
will keep growing strongly with low inflation and that means the
Federal Reserve will not have to end the expansion,'' said Kermit
L. Schoenholtz, chief economist at Salomon Smith Barney, the Wall
Street unit of the Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the improvement came in the last four years, when
computers became much faster and the Internet expanded rapidly,
suggesting to some economists that the new technologies played a
role in lifting labor productivity. Others insist that technology
has made only a small contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices, perhaps reassured that the expansion has more
running room, rose smartly. The Nasdaq market, where most of the
Internet companies are listed, jumped 137.02 points, to 4,210.98,
another record. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.24, to
11,013.44. Interest rates also eased off in bond market trading,
one interpretation being that the Federal Reserve _ while still
committed to one or two more small rate increases similar to the
quarter-point increase last week _ won't raise interest rates
enough to so discourage spending that the expansion is brought to
an end. At nearly nine years, it is the longest in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity rises when a worker produces more goods or services
in an hour on the job than he did the prior year. A telephone
operator who handled 100 toll calls in 1998, for example, handled
103 in 1999. This extra revenue can then be used to raise profits
or the wage paid to the operator, or both profits and wages. In any
of these cases, customer tolls do not have to rise to cover the
extra outlay.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the early 1970s, the productivity growth rate fell
sharply, averaging no more than 1.5 percent a year until 1995, a
sea change from the 1960s when the average growth rage was a
spectacular 2.9 percent a year. Productivity no longer made
possible the improvement in wages, and living standards, that had
benefited so many Americans in the 1960s. And to compensate,
millions of people worked longer hours or at more than one job to
keep from falling behind.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in late 1995, productivity surged. The growth rate
jumped to 2.6 percent annually, on average, pulling up the
performance for the entire decade to 2 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest numbers, announced on Tuesday, reinforced this
improvement. Productivity in the fourth-quarter rose at an
unusually strong annual rate of 5 percent, the Labor Department
said. An earlier third-quarter estimate was revised up to 5 percent
from 4.9 percent, and thanks to the last six months, the growth
rate for all four-quarters of the last year of the century averaged
2.9 percent, the highest of any single year in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that the productivity drought that has afflicted
the United States since the early 1970s is now over? Has a ``New
Economy'' arisen, one in which faster computers, the Internet and
the new high-speed communications network have resulted in a
permanent improvement in labor productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists argue that this is the case. But others note
that the rise in productivity coincided with a jump in economic
growth as a run-of-the-mill economic expansion suddenly turned into
a boom in late 1995. While technology plays a role, they say, the
booming economy is the main cause of the rising productivity growth
rate, which will taper off once the economy inevitably slows or
falls into recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to know how much is due to strong economic
growth and how much to the new technologies until the current
business cycle runs its full length,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief
economist at Merrill Lynch, who gives most of the credit to
technology. ``We are seeing things in this cycle that are
unprecedented. Productivity is accelerating late in the expansion,
when it should be easing off. That is because of the new
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that productivity surges when economic growth
surges, whether that strong growth comes early or late in an
expansion. During the 1980s, for example, the strongest growth came
early in the expansion, the usual pattern, and the productivity
growth rate, in response, rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent
from 1982 through 1986 _ virtually the same performance as the late
1990s _ only to taper off as the economy grew more slowly in the
last years of the '80s expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Productivity is very sensitive to growth,'' said Robert
Gordon, a Northwestern University economist. ``When the economy is
growing above normal, the output of a worker also jumps. That is
because companies, faced with a growing demand for their products
and services, find ways to squeeze more output from their
employees. And when the economy slows, the same workers find
themselves producing less.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Manufacturing has been an enormous contributor to the latest
surge in productivity, rising at an annual rate of 10.7 percent in
the fourth quarter, and 6.4 percent for all of 1999, the best
performance since 1971. Nearly half the latest improvement came in
the manufacture of computers and other electronic gear.
</P>
<P>
   Citing this bias, Gordon argues that the productivity in
manufacturing is narrowly focused, while Steinberg sees in the same
data a much broader improvement. That is partly a result of new
technology, he said, and partly a result of a strong rise in
capital investment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final outcome of this debate, the productivity
report on Tuesday had buried in it more evidence that labor costs
are rising rather mildly, even if the productivity growth rate
might justify bigger raises. Unit labor costs in the fourth quarter
fell by 1 percent, which means that the cost of producing a
particular piece of merchandise fell.
</P>
<P>
   That is a result of three factors. The total output of goods and
services rose faster than the total hours needed to produce them,
the Labor Department said, and compensation costs _ wages, bonuses,
benefits and stock options _ rose at an annual rate of 4 percent,
down from 4.7 percent in the third quarter and 4.8 percent in the
second quarter.

SOMETHING'S LOST AND SOMETHING'S GAINED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few contemporary voices have aged more shockingly than Joni
Mitchell's. The craggy alto on ``Both Sides Now,'' her
intermittently magnificent new album of standards (including two of
her best-loved original songs), is so changed from the sweetly
yodeling folk soprano of her earliest albums that it hardly seems
possible the two sounds could have come from the same body.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to fight or try to camouflage the ravages of time,
Mitchell belongs to an interpretive school that includes Billie
Holiday and Frank Sinatra, whose vocal deterioration brought them
greater emotional depth and realism. Studying a chronology of their
records is like following a road map of their lives that takes you
deep into the mountains over increasingly rugged terrain. The
bumpier the road gets, the longer the view.
</P>
<P>
   In the opposite school are supremely polished technicians like
Mel Torme and Sarah Vaughan, whose voices remained distinctively
beautiful (even as they darkened with age) until the ends of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Mitchell, who is 56 and has smoked heavily for
decades, you can hear the toll of all those cigarettes in her
shortened breath, husky timbre and inability to make fluent vocal
leaps. At the same time, that very huskiness lends her torch
singing the battered authenticity we expect of middle-aged jazz
singers with their years of after-hours living and accompanying
vices.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has been struggling for that authenticity since the
mid-1970s, but it wasn't until her guest appearances on Herbie
Hancock's 1998 album, ``Gershwin's World,'' singing ``The Man I
Love'' and ``Summertime,'' that she finally sounded like a
weather-beaten jazz chanteuse. To approach the rarefied place
inhabited by Abbey Lincoln and Nina Simone, Mitchell virtually had
to lose her voice.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Both Sides Now'' (Warner Brothers 2-47620), Mitchell
follows her '70s folk-pop peers, Linda Ronstadt and Carly Simon,
into the realm of formally orchestrated pop arranged in the style
of late-1950s Holiday and Sinatra albums. And in making the
gesture, Mitchell, the most influential female folk-rocker of all
time, has recertified the continuity of pre-rock and rock
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   That continuity has more to do with attitude than with musical
style. For as much as rock-era singers rebelled against pre-rock
forms, many (especially those who came out of folk music) retained
an enduring faith in the earlier generation's romantic mythology.
With true love the unquestioned ideal, pop sentiment swung between
the poles of happily-ever-after and heartbreak, ecstasy and
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's original folk-rock songs upheld that mythology while
analyzing it with an unprecedented personal candor and deep
skepticism. It remained for another generation of punk rockers and
hip-hoppers to topple that mythology and subvert romantic
dreaminess with rawer, more realistic views of sex as brutally
funny, harshly combative game-playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Sides Now,'' which Warner Brothers has just released in a
special Valentine's Day package ($49.98; it will come out as a
regular CD on March 21), was recorded in England with a 70-piece
orchestra arranged and conducted by Vince Mendoza. The
orchestrations on 7 of its 12 cuts have the richness of full-scale
Hollywood film scores, embellished with jazz solos that feature
Wayne Shorter (on saxophones) and Mark Isham (trumpet) along with a
discreet dusting of jazz rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The album's most obvious precedent is Holiday's classic ``Lady
in Satin,'' recorded in 1958, not long before the singer's death,
with Ray Ellis conducting an orchestra augmented by top-flight jazz
soloists. ``Lady in Satin'' is as starkly tragic a pop album as has
ever been made.
</P>
<P>
   On it, Holiday's cracked, parched old-woman's timbre (she was
only 42 but sounds 70-something) adds an extra layer of pathos to
self-lacerating ballads like ``I'm a Fool to Want You,'' ``You
Don't Know What Love Is'' and ``You've Changed.'' Yet for all the
physical damage on display, Holiday's stealthy jazz phrasing
remained intact along with her ominous aura of masochistic
enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Sides Now,'' unlike ``Lady in Satin,'' has its lighter
moments. But on the whole it aspires to the same level of emotional
gravity, especially in Mitchell's devastating versions of ``You've
Changed'' and ``You're My Thrill'' (which Holiday recorded in 1949
with a similar arrangement).
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's interpretations of both songs are as deep and somber
as Lady Day's. Her Holiday-like phrasing, smoke-charred timbre and
anguished intensity take you to the core of songs describing states
of emotional torture: facing the imminent departure of a lover who
has lost interest (``You've Changed''), and helpless erotic
obsession (``You're My Thrill'').
</P>
<P>
   Equally powerful is a version of ``At Last,'' sung as a pained
cry of relief, in which eerie piano triplets almost beyond earshot
echo Etta James' version of the song while the blossoming
orchestrations recall Nat (King) Cole's.
</P>
<P>
   These darker moments are much more convincing than the album's
sunnier ones, in which Mitchell's attempts to swing breezily fall
short. Her performance on a brass-heavy Sinatra-influenced version
of ``I Wish I Were in Love Again,'' in particular, lacks the
visceral punch that might make this playful celebration of a
rough-and-tumble relationship seem like fun.
</P>
<P>
   The album's boldest and most problematic moments are its
symphonically weighted versions of two Mitchell originals, ``A Case
of You'' (originally a fragile folk-pop lament sung against a
quivering dulcimer) and her most famous song, ``Both Sides Now.''
Here, both are intoned as dramatic monologues amid churning,
hovering strings. But since neither song goes anywhere
harmonically, the music just sits heavily as the singer muses out
loud.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``A Case You'' sinks under that orchestral weight, ``Both
Sides Now'' somehow stays afloat. With her brooding oracular
delivery, Mitchell forcibly twists this singsongy tune with its
frilly images (``rows and flows of angel hair'') into a humbling
life lesson on the elusiveness of personal wisdom (``It's life's
illusions I recall/ I really don't know life at all''). Like a
determined swimmer fighting a flood tide, Mitchell prevails and
carries her most famous song safely to higher ground.

 &HT;    A Place To Remember

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Two silver-haired women in wheelchairs sit in the
park and watch brightly-colored birds chirp and fly from one end of
a cage to the other.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an unusual scene, but for these women, there are
unusual circumstances. They have advanced Alzheimer's disease and
require constant care, so the birds and the park have been brought
indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The park setting, which also includes a street lamp, garden and
park benches, is an oasis on the fourth floor of the St. Elizabeth
Center in downtown Waco. It is part of the ``Crossroads'' floor,
designed to provide its 52 residents with advanced Alzheimer's
disease an active, familiar environment while helping to stimulate
pleasant personal memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are individuals that have a keen past memory ...
whereas, they really don't know where they are,'' said Joe Long,
co-manager of Crossroads and manager of social work services for
Christus The Regis/St. Elizabeth Centers. ``The goal is to increase
the quality of life and help them maintain their self-respect and
dignity. To keep them humanized.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossroads is on the cutting edge of Alzheimer's care, part of a
nationwide shift from a medical to a social model for patients.
Doug Wuenschel, president and chief executive officer of Christus
The Regis/St. Elizabeth Centers, got the idea for Crossroads from a
national convention 1 1/2 years ago, and staff members visited
nursing facilities in Abilene and Pittsburgh that had already
developed the idea. St. Elizabeth started incorporating aspects of
Crossroads six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The floor itself is divided into sections depicting different
aspects of life for the residents. A restaurant is decorated with
an antique radio, a washboard and old poster advertisements. Future
plans include an ice cream parlor, general store, barber shop, gym,
chapel and theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Crossroads program only accepts patients in stage three, or
advanced Alzheimer's. Patients stay in semiprivate or private rooms
starting at a rate of $88 a day, and they usually live there for
the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the physical layout of the program, its daily activities
provide patients with a sense of normalcy, something that can
become rare for people with Alzheimer's. Each day a beautician
fixes residents' hair. Staff members lead exercise classes, cooking
sessions, worship services, sing-a-longs and makeup and nail
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is introducing choices for the residents, allowing
them freedom to participate in whatever they're capable of,''
Wuenschel said.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom isn't a word usually associated with Alzheimer's
Disease.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Alzheimer's Association, 19 percent of
Americans ages 75 to 84 have Alzheimer's, a progressive,
degenerative disease of the brain and the most common form of
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of people with Alzheimer's live at home.
Patients can live from 8 to 20 years with Alzheimer's, and the
average cost of caring for a patient throughout the disease is
$174,000.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, little was known about the disease, which was
named for a German psychiatrist who discovered it in 1906. But in
the last year, scientists have made several key discoveries about
how the disease destroys the brain. They suspect Alzheimer's
develops when normal proteins and enzymes form plaques, which
displace and kill off brain cells by triggering inflammation and
damaging the cells' interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its nickname, ``Old Timer's Disease,'' Alzheimer's
patients suffer from much more than forgetfulness. They may have
difficulty thinking logically, and they may lose control of their
bowels or bladders. They may see or hear things that aren't there,
yet not be able to recognize friends and loved ones. Family members
are often left confused about whether to institutionalize someone
with Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment facilities have traditionally used ``reality
orientation'' techniques to try to correct confused patients'
thinking. But new programs like Crossroads emphasize
``validation,'' being more accepting of the person's own version of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality orientation is not a part of it, because very often,
introducing reality to an individual that can't learn and progress
can be stressful,'' Wuenschel said.
</P>
<P>
   That stress is something 89-year-old Rosamond Farmer recognizes
when she can't remember where she is or what she is supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize my body's wearing out,'' she said as she scooted her
walker slowly across the restaurant area of the Crossroads floor.
``My knees are out.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, who has advanced Alzheimer's, has lived on this floor
for five months. She likes to talk about her life. But like most
Alzheimer's patients, she has trouble remembering the everyday
things and often relies on the St. Elizabeth staff to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the name of this place here?'' she asked Long on a
recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Elizabeth's,'' he answered, patting her on the back.
``What do you think of it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good place. Do you think I should spend the
night here?'' she asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Ms. Farmer, you have a room down the hall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patience is critical for Alzheimer's caregivers, Long said,
because those who have the disease can become frustrated so easily.
</P>
<P>
   The staff on the Crossroads floor underwent special training to
better learn ways to show empathy, compassion and patience.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes staff members have to show patience more at the end of
the day. Many people with Alzheimer's, including Farmer, experience
a phenomenon called ``sun-downer'' in which they become irritated
and feel trapped at night.
</P>
<P>
   When Farmer feels like she wants to leave, she layers clothes on
her walker, puts on a hat and begs to go home.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, staff members gently direct her back to her
room and try to convince her that she is loved at her new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a matter of walking up to a person and patting
them on the shoulder, complimenting them, thinking of something in
history,'' Long said. ``We know they're upset and they're
frustrated. Alzheimer's is a mean disease.''

   ``The Well-Tempered Clavier'' appeared in two installments
during the first half of the 18th century. The style and content
look back in time, as Bach often did, but there is something
futuristic about how these pieces are used.
</P>
<P>
   Musical progress, like any other kind of progress, goes in
circles, and in the year 2000 we seem to be overtaking the
18th-century world that the 19th century left in its rear-view
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   These 48 preludes and fugues in all the major and minor keys
have little to do with public virtuosos, stages or audiences. Like
a lot of Bach's work _ especially the music written, or at least
assembled, toward the end of his life _ the ``Well-Tempered'' makes
statements, advances theories, pulls together bodies of knowledge.
Furthermore, its lessons are learned, and its messages received, at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The B minor Mass works neither in the Roman Catholic nor in the
Lutheran church. It returns to previous centuries of Mass writing
and says, ``This is how you do it best.'' ``The Art of Fugue'' is,
well, the art of fugue. ``The Well-Tempered Clavier'' makes a case
for the composer's favored tuning system, by which one can sit at a
keyboard properly arranged and negotiate all the major and minor
keys without once having to stand up and retune.
</P>
<P>
   (Old-fashioned, if purer, tuning made distant keys like D flat
major or E flat minor sound weirdly out of kilter.) The
well-tempered method is the father, or at least the favorite uncle,
of the equal-temperament compromise generally adopted today.
</P>
<P>
   Bach's sermon on tuning preaches to the converted; it is the
substance of the pieces that engages us now. They operate poorly on
a grand scale, and one really has to pay attention to what they
say. ``The Well-Tempered Clavier'' is for private consumption, and
the fact that concert programs reject these pieces should cause us
no shame.
</P>
<P>
   The public event has been driving the music business for a long
time, but Chopin and his contemporaries made a lot of their money
on sheet music, which amateurs bought and took home to play.
Nowadays, publishers grant performance rights or rent out parts to
orchestras. Lost in this public shuffle are genres like Schubert's
music for piano-four hands or Bach's ``Well-Tempered Clavier.''
</P>
<P>
   Repertory like this is meant to be heard by the people who are
playing it. Schubert's great F minor Fantasy is, when properly
done, a communion between two pianists. A well-managed recording
can halfway convey that spirit; performance on a raised stage
before hundreds of ticket buyers sounds somehow thick and remote.
</P>
<P>
   The Bach preludes and fugues are, to use Schumann's famous
description, the keyboard player's ``daily bread.'' We practice but
rarely perform them. Wrapping one's ears and fingers around these
pieces amounts to both an undergraduate and a postgraduate
education: what to make prominent, what to render as background,
how to make the weight of the finger respond to the command of the
ear.
</P>
<P>
   Composers try to learn from the fugues but end up marveling
helplessly at Bach's ingenious ways of simplifying complex
junctures of contrapuntal voices. (Bach fugues are unsuited to the
elementary counterpoint class; too many ``rules'' are broken.)
Stravinsky religiously began his daily stint of composing with the
playing of an item from the ``48.''
</P>
<P>
   Music looks down the road right now and is beginning to spot
Bach's world in its headlights. It's up ahead. We have become more
passive drivers, to be sure, but we are taking music back home with
us in the old way, domesticating an art that has spent the last two
centuries clamoring for public attention.
</P>
<P>
   The concert business worries about its future, and with reason.
There is just as much music out there as there ever was, and
probably a lot more, but thanks to electricity, it is more likely
to be in our parlors than in Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The mystique of the live audience as inspirer of great
performances may still be absolutely genuine, but most people know
the Beethoven sonatas or Messiaen's ``Turangalila'' from recordings
heard at home. More often than not, visits to the concert hall
reinforce impressions already made before we got there.
</P>
<P>
   Our brand of Hausmusik is, granted, more about reception than
projection: lots of listening, little doing. Pianists have the
satisfaction of making the sounds they are listening to, although
you can argue that the physical work involved distracts the ear as
much as it involves it.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that audiophiles do a little virtuoso dial-twiddling
of their own, but it is not the same thing. We are also going to
have more creative control at home. Recording engineers now have
little boxes that can make a small room sound big, and a cathedral
sound like Merkin Concert Hall, and versions of these have already
begun to come our way.
</P>
<P>
   No one can dispute that people in the age of recordings have the
world at their fingertips. Bach, with no switches to flip, learned
about Vivaldi by laboriously copying his music by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Researching a recent article produced ``Well-Tempered Clavier''
recordings of amazing variety: Edwin Fischer being Brahmsian on the
piano, Gustav Leonhardt dignified at the harpsichord, Andras Schiff
pianistically peaceful and content, Glenn Gould absolutely goofy in
his antimatter style, Wanda Landowska highly dramatic on her big
Pleyel harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   Music like this discourages uniform standards. As long as we are
reasonably responsive to the things Bach tells us in the score, we
can be Romantic, Baroque or space-age on whatever instrument we
want. It's our business. It's private.

THE ULTRA-ORTHODOX AND THEIR WOMEN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Leslie Camhi's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
movie ``The Cup.''  
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the bedroom of an ultra-Orthodox couple in Jerusalem, a man
rises, takes three steps, washes his hands, and recites the morning
prayer, thanking God for preserving his soul all night, and for not
having created him a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kadosh,'' the new film by the Israeli director Amos Gitai,
which opens on Wednesday at the Film Forum, begins with this
intimate view of the rituals Orthodox Jewish men perform each day.
Meir, the husband, goes on to wake his wife, Rivka, with respect
and affection. But his prayer, with its jarring inequity, haunts
the conflicts that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, ``Kadosh'' was the first Israeli film in 25 years
to screen in competition at the Cannes International Film Festival,
bringing Gitai, who is 49, a rare degree of international acclaim.
Its title means ``sacred'' in Hebrew; it is the last in a trilogy
of films he has devoted to Israel's three main cities.
</P>
<P>
   Previous films focused on Tel Aviv and Haifa; ``Kadosh'' is
meant as a portrait of Jerusalem. Yet to render that city's deep
divisions, it looks at discord within a single quarter _ Mea
Shearim, Jerusalem's most insular neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox Jews who live there scrupulously maintain the
dress, language and faith of Eastern European Jewish communities
lost to the Holocaust. Yiddish is the common tongue of the
black-garbed men and soberly clad women who hurry along Mea
Shearim's narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   Signs warn outsiders to abide by the quarter's rules of modesty:
women's knees and shoulders must be covered, and the use of cameras
is forbidden. The most extreme among the diverse (and feuding)
sects reject the secular Israeli state as a bastion of infidels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an initial respect for any group of people trying to
resist the homogenization of culture,'' Gitai said by telephone
from the Golan Heights, where (with an uncanny instinct for the
flashpoints of his culture) he was shooting his next feature. ``I
like Mea Shearim's resistance to tourism. The people there have
chosen to live their lives as a monument to a culture that was
destroyed. I don't necessarily agree with their rules. But in a
world where everything is geared to the smooth operation of
production and consumption, I have sympathy for enclaves.''
</P>
<P>
   The director grew up far from the ultra-Orthodox universe, in a
family steeped in radical politics and avant-garde culture. His
maternal grandparents came to Palestine in 1905 and helped found
the early kibbutz and trade-union movements.
</P>
<P>
   His Polish-born father, an architect, arrived in the 1930s, via
Berlin and the Bauhaus. Gitai studied architecture before turning
to filmmaking after the trauma of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, because,
he said, he wanted ``to touch a nerve in people.''
</P>
<P>
   In that, he succeeded. ``House'' (1980), one of his earliest
documentaries, dug through the history of an Israeli home in
Jerusalem to find its previous Palestinian owners. Produced for
state television, the film has been broadcast only abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Field Diary'' (1982), a lyrical journal that roved across the
occupied territories and southern Lebanon, remains controversial in
Israel for its critical stance toward the Begin government's
military policies. After that film, Gitai could find no backing for
his work at home, so in 1982 he moved to Paris, where he stayed for
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   There, with the support of European producers, he made his first
fiction films, including ``Esther'' (1986), a lush retelling of the
Biblical story of Esther, with contemporary political resonance;
and ``Berlin-Jerusalem'' (1989), a film loosely based on the
friendship between Mania Shohat, a Zionist pioneer, and Elsa
Lasker-Schuler, a German Expressionist poet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kadosh,'' which focuses intently on the lives of two sisters,
recalls these vivid portrayals of strong female characters. Rivka,
the elder sister, has been married for 10 years to Meir; they love
each other, but because they are childless, Meir is encouraged to
divorce her and remarry.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Malka cannot marry Yaakov, whom she loves, because
he has been repudiated by the community since joining the army;
responding to pressure, she marries a fanatical scholar. The
sisters' worlds become increasingly narrow, hemmed in by rabbinical
proscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider that the great contradiction of not just
ultra-Orthodox Judaism, but the Jewish religion in general, is the
position of women as mere vehicles of reproduction for the
community,'' Gitai said. ``All her other capacities are reduced to
facilitate that purpose. That's why I wanted to draw the destinies
of two women.''
</P>
<P>
   Gitai spent two years preparing ``Kadosh,'' visiting Mea
Shearim's yeshivas and synagogues, hearing the echoes of Kafka in
Talmudic dialogues, engaging in intellectual disputes and soaking
up the atmosphere of a life whose smallest gestures, from drinking
water to putting on a garment, are imbued with divine significance.
</P>
<P>
   Eliette Abecassis, a writer steeped in Jewish religious
tradition, wrote the script with him. A Sephardic Orthodox rabbi,
who plays the part of the community's cantor in the film, also
acted as an unofficial consultant. The film's few street scenes
were shot early in the morning, to avoid offense. Interiors were
recreated in a Tel Aviv studio.
</P>
<P>
   Meital Barda, who plays Malka, is the only cast member who grew
up in a strictly observant household, though she later gave up
religious practice. Her parents are modern Orthodox, and relatively
liberal in outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultra-Orthodox have lost something,'' the 21-year-old
actress said by telephone from Tel Aviv. ``You can see it in the
film in the character of my husband. He's so fanatically obsessed
with religion, the synagogue and prayers. He forgets about loving
himself, loving God and loving me.''
</P>
<P>
   Few (if any) among Mea Shearim's residents will judge firsthand
Gitai's portrayal of their community. Television is banned there,
and films are shunned as unchaste immersions in the values of
secular culture. Still, they know what they think of it. Rabbi
Henri Kahn, who directs the French-language, ultra-Orthodox
newspaper Kountrass from his office in the quarter, strenuously
objects to what he has heard are the film's numerous inaccuracies
regarding his community's practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people direct their own lives,'' he said. ``No rabbi will
tell you whom to marry. As for women, this film looks at the
fringes of our society. Ninety-eight percent of our women are
perfectly happy with their roles as wives and mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the remaining 2 percent?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he answered, ``there are problems everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the authoritarian rabbi in ``Kadosh'' may reflect a
growing anxiety among secular Israelis about the weight of religion
in their society. Twenty-two percent of all seats in the Israeli
parliament are now occupied by religious parties. And the power of
the Orthodox rabbinate, which regulates aspects of daily life from
funerals to restaurant licenses, makes many Israelis wonder if a
secular culture truly exists.
</P>
<P>
   Irma Klein, an Israeli film scholar, finds in ``Kadosh'' an echo
of women's position in Israeli society at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freud said that you can look at extreme forms of behavior as a
way of talking about normal society,'' Klein said. ``Well, this
film speaks about a woman's desire that is independent of her
procreative faculties. And that has no place. It takes the Orthodox
community to be an extreme model of something that reverberates in
daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gitai might agree, for his characters inhabit a nebulous region
drawn in equal measure from the worlds of Orthodoxy and an artist's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked one of my actors which ultra-Orthodox sect I was
depicting,'' the director said. ``They all have distinct customs of
dress and ritual. `Is it the Litaim?' they asked me, meaning those
from Lithuania? `No, it's the Gitaim,' he said.''

ON DOMESTIC ISSUES, MCCAIN IS NO POLICY WONK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was telling to hear John McCain proclaim his
impatience with President Clinton's last State of the Union
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``A two-hour marathon,'' McCain said dismissively, promising
reporters that should he be elected president he would keep the
ritual address to Congress to a crisp 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you should do is give a vision for America,'' he
said, ``not give a laundry list that looks like a Chinese menu with
one from column A and one from column B.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he likes that,'' he said, ``because he's a policy
wonk.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain by contrast is not a policy wonk, at least when it comes
to domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   While the Arizona senator can speak in great detail about
unneeded weapons systems or his theories of containing rogue state
dictators, he seems less fluent on the issues that were not his
Senate specialties _ like health care or the environment or
education.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago McCain sometimes used the words Medicare
and Medicaid interchangeably, mixing up the federal health
insurance programs for the elderly and for the poor. He has since
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   And it is instructive that his pledge to audiences that he would
never be guided by opinion polls but would always act ``on
principle'' applies only to national security matters. On domestic
affairs, McCain says it would be helpful to use polls to find out
what Americans want.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite McCain's reliably conservative voting record in
his 17 years in Congress and his image as a reformer, his ideas on
domestic matters sometimes seem far from fixed or fully developed.
Although he has declared war on pork barrel spending and continues
to call for an overhaul of the system of unlimited donations to
political parties, he has yet to explain how his vision of
conservative reform would translate into a comprehensive domestic
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, McCain seems caught between his desire to help
people solve big problems and his natural instinct as a
conservative Republican to find small-government solutions.
Occasionally when voters ask him about difficult social problems,
he pledges to gather ``the best minds in America'' to work toward
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   At other moments, McCain almost plays down the importance of
domestic matters when he says he is ``fully prepared to lead''
because of his experience in the military and his expertise in
national security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in McCain's command of foreign policy and
domestic policy shows on his free-wheeling campaign bus, where
reporters can question him all day long.
</P>
<P>
   He assesses world leaders and European defense capabilities with
gusto. But he was far less animated last month when reporters
pressed him at great length on whether he would stick to his vow
against Internet taxation if recession ever loomed or if so much
commerce moved to the Internet that states started seeing a decline
in sales tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a permanent ban on Internet taxation,'' McCain
finally said, when questions continued even after he said that
Internet commerce was expanding the economy, not cutting into other
sales. ``I cannot elaborate.'' He repeated that statement several
times in order to cut off the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   On another day he became impatient when quizzed closely over
when he views an issue as a state matter and when he sees it as a
federal concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting into the rarified atmosphere here of the
academic Talmudian aspects of the role of the federal government,''
he said as reporters pressed him on federalism. ``I like to deal on
the level of the problems today.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he considers the lack of universal health care
coverage a pressing social problem, he shies away from a big
government solution, instead proposing tax-free savings accounts to
help some people buy insurance and saying that general tax cuts
would also help people buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every American should have access to health
insurance,'' he says. ``I can't force every American to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, this has mattered little in an insurgent campaign run on
a blend of character, biography and reform. ``What's driven the
McCain candidacy thus far is his story, his personality, not his
issue positions,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster
unaffiliated with any presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, voters virtually never point to any specific issue when
asked why they like him. Katie Koenen, 18, who waited until 3 a.m.
for McCain to arrive for a rally in South Carolina after he had won
the New Hampshire primary, proclaimed him ``more upfront'' than
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Avery, a retired bookkeeper who went to one of McCain's
New Hampshire town hall meetings, said simply, ``I think he's
truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences even seem appreciative when McCain admits he has some
learning to do. ``I don't claim to you to be an expert on this
issue,'' he told a group of young people demanding a solution to
global warming at one of his town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will all catch up to him is an open question. Bush
is beginning to point to his record as a governor to draw
distinctions with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand before you as a governor who led my state to
managed-care reform,'' Bush said Tuesday in Delaware. ``Some people
in Washington say we can't get anything done because of all the
lobbyists and special interests,'' he said, in a reference to
McCain. ``That's somebody who doesn't understand how to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the governor like Ralph Reed also note that McCain
has never unveiled a comprehensive education plan the way Bush has.
McCain had an education speech scheduled before the New Hampshire
primary but canceled it rather than shift the focus in New
Hampshire away from the tax cutting and Social Security debate.
</P>
<P>
   He advocates a test of school vouchers paid for by closing
corporate subsidies. And he speaks generally of giving merit pay to
teachers based on student performance. McCain has put forward plans
for Social Security, tax cuts, health care and the environment, but
even as he has done so, he has been hazy on the fine points of his
own proposals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain become the Republican nominee, he will face
Democrats who are already researching his voting record in order to
paint him as a Gingrich-style Republican out of step with
mainstream values.
</P>
<P>
   He embraced the Contract With America and voted with his party
on the budget and tax cut proposals of 1995 that would have made
$270 billion in savings in Medicare while granting $245 billion in
tax cuts. Democrats are also poised to run against his
anti-abortion votes and his votes against an assault weapons ban
and against the Brady bill's five-day waiting period for gun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for now McCain has managed to transcend ideology and appeal
to voters across a broad spectrum in part because his battle
against special interests does not fall neatly along the right-left
divide. Conservatives and liberals alike can warm to his promises
to ``give the government back to the people of the United States,
take it out of the hands of the special interests and the big money
and give it back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the polarizing social issue of abortion, McCain
constantly points to his 17-year record of anti-abortion votes in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He tells audiences, ``Everyone _ pro-life or pro-choice _ has
the same goal, which is to eliminate abortion.'' He also says that
he would not use abortion as a litmus test in picking Supreme Court
nominees, but would look instead for judges who are strict
interpreters of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters last month, ``I don't think that anybody in my
personal opinion, who can say they adhere to the Constitution,
would have rendered the Roe vs. Wade decision.'' But he also said
he would consider judges as nominees not on one decision but on
their ``overall philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted for example that he continued to admire Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia even though he had dissented from a recent
decision upholding limits on campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   What adds to the enigma of McCain is that he sometimes seems to
be embarking on a new intellectual journey along the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   After years of voting for Republican tax cuts, McCain broke with
his party's supply-siders in this campaign and advocated that the
federal surplus be used for modest tax cuts and for shoring up
Social Security. He likes to point out that virtually no one at his
town hall meetings asks for a tax cut. And in New Hampshire at
least, the primary results suggest he had a better grasp of public
sentiment than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   When listener after listener in New Hampshire spoke of elderly
friends and relatives who could not afford prescription drugs, he
instructed his aides to draw up a federal-state block grant program
to help the older people pay for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is minuscule compared with Clinton's call to expand
Medicare to prescription drug coverage, but it does represent a
call by a self-proclaimed conservative for a new federal program.
</P>
<P>
   McCain likes to say that his many town hall meetings and
inquisitive audiences have helped him. ``I am a better candidate,''
he said one night, summing up the results of his 114 town hall
meetings in New Hampshire.

 &HT;    The sounds of silence
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Many of the activities both children and
adults enjoy involve loud noise: listening to music, attending
fireworks displays and riding motorcycles or motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavors that involve loud sounds can damage structures in the
ear, resulting in hearing loss that range from slight to severe.
Sometimes the loss seems temporary. But if the ear has been
damaged, permanent and irreversible hearing loss may become
apparent years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ears are sensitive and fragile. They're not as resilient
as some people think,'' said David Mize, a clinical audiologist
with Carolina Audiology Associates. ``Noise that is loud enough or
heard long enough will damage your hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common causes of noise-related hearing damage are loud
music from car stereos or live concerts, firecrackers, firearms,
farm equipment and factory conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, loud noise causes temporary hearing loss, but repeated
exposure causes the loss to become permanent. Noise can damage your
hearing if you have to shout to be heard, if it causes pain in your
ears or if it makes your ears ring.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the mistaken idea they've become used to loud
noise. In fact, some have already damaged their hearing but don't
know it yet. Others mistakenly think that youth is a protection
from hearing loss. But loud noises affect children and adults the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Hendrix, an ear, nose and throat specialist with
Carolina Otolaryngology Consultants, remembers being subjected to
loud and potentially damaging noise levels while growing up on a
farm in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sit right next to my dad while he hammered nails, used
power tools, shot firearms and operated tractors,'' Hendrix said.
``My dad didn't even think about the damaging effects the noise had
on his own ears, let alone mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound is measured in decibels (dB). The scale runs from the
faintest sound the human ear can detect, labeled zero dB, to the
roar of a rocket launch at more than 175 dB.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to more than 85 decibels for an extended period of time
may be dangerous to your hearing. Most live concerts measure more
than 100 dB. Extremely loud noises, like gun shots, measure much
higher and can cause immediate damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a patient enter my office after he used a handgun to
shoot at a snake in his driveway,'' Hendrix said. ``He suffered
permanent hearing damage after firing just one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   People damage their hearing without even knowing it. The loss is
subtle at first. Oftentimes it starts with a ringing sound in the
ear. You might even have trouble understanding what people say;
they may seem to be mumbling.

 &HT;    The sounds of silence
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Many of the activities both children and
adults enjoy involve loud noise: listening to music, attending
fireworks displays and riding motorcycles or motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavors that involve loud sounds can damage structures in the
ear, resulting in hearing loss that range from slight to severe.
Sometimes the loss seems temporary. But if the ear has been
damaged, permanent and irreversible hearing loss may become
apparent years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ears are sensitive and fragile. They're not as resilient
as some people think,'' said David Mize, a clinical audiologist
with Carolina Audiology Associates. ``Noise that is loud enough or
heard long enough will damage your hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common causes of noise-related hearing damage are loud
music from car stereos or live concerts, firecrackers, firearms,
farm equipment and factory conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At first, loud noise causes temporary hearing loss, but repeated
exposure causes the loss to become permanent. Noise can damage your
hearing if you have to shout to be heard, if it causes pain in your
ears or if it makes your ears ring.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the mistaken idea they've become used to loud
noise. In fact, some have already damaged their hearing but don't
know it yet. Others mistakenly think that youth is a protection
from hearing loss. But loud noises affect children and adults the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Hendrix, an ear, nose and throat specialist with
Carolina Otolaryngology Consultants, remembers being subjected to
loud and potentially damaging noise levels while growing up on a
farm in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sit right next to my dad while he hammered nails, used
power tools, shot firearms and operated tractors,'' Hendrix said.
``My dad didn't even think about the damaging effects the noise had
on his own ears, let alone mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound is measured in decibels (dB). The scale runs from the
faintest sound the human ear can detect, labeled zero dB, to the
roar of a rocket launch at more than 175 dB.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to more than 85 decibels for an extended period of time
may be dangerous to your hearing. Most live concerts measure more
than 100 dB. Extremely loud noises, like gun shots, measure much
higher and can cause immediate damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a patient enter my office after he used a handgun to
shoot at a snake in his driveway,'' Hendrix said. ``He suffered
permanent hearing damage after firing just one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   People damage their hearing without even knowing it. The loss is
subtle at first. Oftentimes it starts with a ringing sound in the
ear. You might even have trouble understanding what people say;
they may seem to be mumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most times, they'll have no trouble hearing in a quiet area,''
Mize said. ``But when they're in a crowded room with lots of people
carrying on different conversations, the ability to decipher what
someone is saying isn't so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some ways to prevent noise-related hearing loss. Avoid
noisy places. Turn down the volume on the stereo headphones. Wear
hearing protection to a rock concert and when mowing the lawn,
riding a motorcycle or target shooting.

TENSIONS MOUNT ALONG ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak declared a military state
of emergency along Israel's northern border Tuesday night, as its
confrontation with Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon seemed
poised to escalate dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas, responding to predawn Israeli airstrikes
on civilian and guerrilla targets, Tuesday launched a rocket attack
along the border that killed another Israeli soldier, the sixth in
a week. A soldier in the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army also was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials said 15 civilians were wounded in the Israeli
raids. The rocket strikes at power substations knocked out
electricity in half of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations peacekeeping officials voiced concern amid the
intensifying cycle of violence that an agreement by both sides not
to target civilians is in danger of ``unraveling altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Israelis living near the Lebanese border
huddled in bomb shelters or fled south Tuesday, fearing Hezbollah
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli army spokesman confirmed that a soldier was killed in
Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' inside Lebanon when
Hezbollah, or ``Party of God,'' guerrillas fired rockets at the
Israeli military outpost at Dabshe.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, the Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah
has dramatically improved its capability to inflict casualties on
Israeli forces in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli military analysts say Hezbollah, by steadily
wearing down the legendary resolve of Israel's military, may be on
the verge of driving Israel's troops from the nine-mile wide strip
of land that Israel occupied to protect its northern towns from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And with the war escalating more than it has in at least eight
months, civilians are once again caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Barak traveled to an underground shelter in the northern
town of Kiryat Shemona. Pledging to ``do whatever it takes to
defend our citizens,'' he also reaffirmed his vow to withdraw
Israeli troops from Lebanon by July, a campaign promise that helped
to elect him last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the predawn darkness Tuesday, orange flames and clouds of
black smoke rose over Beirut, the Associated Press reported, as
fighter planes roared low over the city for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Large areas of the country were plunged into darkness after the
Jamhour substaion outside Beirut saw 11 of its 12 transformers
smashed in the Israeli bombing raids. Damage caused by a similar
Israeli airstrike on Jamhour last June took four months and an
estimated tens of millions of dollars to fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are civilian targets, absolutely,'' said Timur Goksel, a
spokesman for the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon, which
is assigned in southern Lebanon to monitor the combatants and seeks
to prevent the fighting from including civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli bombardment ``is seen here as an unjustified attack
against a civilian target for domestic political reasons,'' Goksel
said, referring to public pressure on Barak from hardliners to
respond to the killing of Israeli soldiers and from the peace camp
to live up to his promise to withdraw the troops.
</P>
<P>
   Israel crossed a threshold in its response, Goksel said, by
hitting civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement that has governed hostilities for the past four
years stipulates that neither side target civilians. It is known as
the ``Grapes of Wrath'' agreement, which takes its name from the
Israeli offensive in Lebanon in 1996 during which an attack on a UN
compound in the southern Lebanon village of Qana killed 103
civilians, mostly women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very worried about the unravelling altogether of the
Grapes of Wrath agreement,'' Goksel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak, who also carries the portfolio of minister of
defense, said Hezbollah had systematically violated the agreement
by firing on Israeli troops from inside villages. Barak said
Hezbollah had gambled that Israel would not respond to avoid
hurting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our operation yesterday intended to signal to the Lebanese
government and Hezbollah and even the Syrians that Israel is not
willing to accept unilateral violations'' of the Grapes of Wrath
agreement, Barak told reporters in Kiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our intention to hurt civilians or to close the door
on the opportunity to continue the peace process,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For now, peace talks between Israel and Syria are on hold after
they were renewed in early January with a sense of optimism and
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The talks broke down last month over a Syrian demand that Israel
promise up front that it would return all of the Golan Heights,
territory it captured from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it will not resume the talks unless Syria, which
has 35,000 troops in Lebanon, restrains Hezbollah fighters.
</P>
<P>
   So the Syrian-Israeli peace track and the fighting in Lebanon
form an intricate web of diplomacy. Israeli Cabinet members have in
recent days raised the possiblity of a unilateral withdrawal from
Lebanon, a bold move that would isolate Syria and weaken its
position in peace talks. But some analysts say the move would not
guarantee peace, since Syria could try to step up hostilities along
the border until Israel relinquishes the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   A sense that Israel is at the beginning of the end of its
18-year involvement in Lebanon permeates the Israeli press.
Pressure seems to be mounting as never before for Barak to find a
way out.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more fervent calls was by Israeli author and leftist,
David Grossman, who wrote in Maariv Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the entire process by heart. For a day and a half we
feel, `Hah, we've shown them,' and our famous deterrent abilities
will have proven themsleves again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of acknowledging the original sin of sinking into the
Lebanese mud,'' Grossman wrote, ``it is easier for us to convert
the frustration and humiliation into one great fist and pound 'em
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other choice,'' he concludes. ``We have to get
out.''

   NETHERLANDS: NEW CHIEF FOR WORLD COURT
</P>
<P>
   The International Court of Justice in The Hague elected a new
president and vice president for three-year terms. The head of the
panel, known as the World Court, will be Judge Gilbert Guillaume of
France. The new vice president is Judge Shi Jiuyong of China. The
court, with 15 members, is part of the United Nations system and
hears cases between countries.

   SPAIN: BASQUE CONVICT EXTRADITED
</P>
<P>
   France extradited Francisco Mugica Garmendia, 46, whom officials
considered the chief of the Basque separatist group ETA when he was
arrested in 1992, just months before the Barcelona Summer Olympics,
which the rebels threatened, but failed, to disrupt. He has served
seven years for terrorist activities and faces 23 counts in Spain,
including many for murder. Since 1996 France has sent to Spain 36
convicted or suspected Basque rebels.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: ANTI-IMMIGRANT VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested 11 people as protests continued against
North African immigrants in the booming southern agricultural town
of El Ejido, where several thousand immigrants work in greenhouses
and food processing plants. The Moroccan government condemned what
it termed ``racist acts.'' The riots started after a Moroccan, 20,
was arrested for the stabbing death of a Spanish woman, the third
killing of a Spaniard in two weeks in which immigrants were blamed.

   SWITZERLAND: BANKING CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   Stung by accusations of obstructing Holocaust victims trying to
reclaim their deposits, Swiss banks are revising rules on how such
money can be retrieved. Banks are now responsible for finding
customers who have not actively used their accounts, according to
the Swiss Bankers Association. Starting in June, banks will no
longer be able to declare accounts dormant and transfer assets, a
practice that led to charges that banks hoarded Nazi-era accounts.

which has asked the West's help in recovering stolen funds. So far,
no significant amount has been recovered.

   Hoping to make the country more attractive to foreign investors,
President Thabo Mbeki announced that a team of international
financiers will serve as advisers to his government. The
International Investment Council will include the financier George
Soros; Minoru Makihara, the chairman of Mitsubishi, and Juergen
Schrempp, the chairman of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH AFRICA: THINNING OUT PRISONS
</P>
<P>
   The head of the country's overcrowded prison system said
thousands of prisoners would be fitted with electronic tracking
tags and released beginning next year. South Africa's 231 prisons,
which have a combined capacity of 99,000 inmates, house more than
150,000, and the strain on the system has contributed to a high
rate of escapes.

TIME, AND TIME AGAIN, AS SCIENCE AND AS ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British and French have famously different
perceptions of time: the British view French tardiness as a serious
character flaw, the French mock British punctuality as simple lack
of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But this is just the anecdotal side of things. Time also
reflects deeper cultural differences between the two. Or so it
would appear from the way in which London and Paris have each
addressed large millennium exhibitions dedicated to the subject of
time.
</P>
<P>
   The titles of the shows are already revelatory. ``The Story of
Time,'' which runs through Sept. 24 at the National Maritime Museum
in Greenwich in east London, is an almost didactic review of how
time has been measured and interpreted by different cultures
through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, ``Le Temps, Vite,'' or ``Time, Quickly,'' at the
Georges Pompidou Center in Paris through April 17, is more artistic
and philosophical, its very name suggesting that time can be
manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, neither city can claim great originality in holding
such a show at this, well, time, but each has a good pretext. The
Maritime Museum, which stands below the Royal Observatory, wants to
remind us that Greenwich is ``the home of world time'' (and has
been since Greenwich Mean Time was accepted worldwide in 1884).
</P>
<P>
   The Pompidou Center sees the occasion as a splashy way to
announce its return to business on Jan. 1, after being closed for
27 months for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the two exhibitions competed for loans of some
objects (with Greenwich often winning because it began planning its
show first), they are in fact complementary, thanks to their
different cultural approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The British show, accompanied by a scholarly catalog, ``The
Story of Time'' (published by Merrel Holberton), which is also
available in the United States, sets out to explain, ``This is
time.'' The French show, more concerned with perceived rather than
real time, dwells on the question, ``What is time?''
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, where the exhibition is being held in the Maritime
Museum's 17th-century Queen's House, some 500 objects have been
divided into five sections: ``The Creation of Time''; ``The
Mechanics of Time''; ``In the Eye of the Beholder''; ``Against the
Clock'' and ``Until the End of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the show also tries hard not to be Eurocentric,
with manuscripts and objects from pre-Hispanic America, India,
China, Africa and the Middle East displayed amid European paintings
and clocks of all kinds (the catalog includes eight essays on
different cultures and time).
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly relevant in the opening section, since the
creation of time is inseparable from the way various civilizations
and religions believed that the world _ and therefore time _ began.
Thus, along with a 15th-century French illuminated manuscript
showing God holding a dividing compass, there is a 10th-century
B.C. Babylonian ``creation tablet,'' an Aztec hieroglyph, a Navajo
sand painting, an Indian painting of ``Vishnu as the Supreme
Creator and Destroyer of the Universe'' and Australian aboriginal
and Maori works of art about the creation.
</P>
<P>
   While ancient cultures felt reassured by their respective myths
of creation, they nonetheless seemed eager to measure time as a way
of controlling it. The cycles of day and night placed the Sun, Moon
and stars at the center of the earliest attempts to regulate time,
which in turn led to the idea of a calendar, itself a sophisticated
notion since it embraced the contradiction that time is both
irreversible and repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, even before the Roman Empire imposed its Julian calendar
on Europe in 45 B.C., there were competing versions from Mexico to
China (an Aztec rattlesnake in the show has 13 rattles,
representing the 13 months of a 260-day calendar).
</P>
<P>
   Measurement of shorter periods of time began with sundials,
sandglasses and water clocks. Interestingly, though, after the
collapse of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, there is no
record of mechanical timekeeping in Europe until the 10th century,
when monasteries began finding ways to determine their hours of
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Nocturnals, for telling the time using the stars, and quadrants
preceded the invention of the first weight-driven clock in the late
13th century. And within a century the bells of church clock towers
around Europe had begun sounding the hour.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes an impressive selection of ornate clocks
and pocket watches that by the late 17th century were part of every
prosperous European household. But it also shows how different
painters have portrayed time, from Poussin's ``Phaethon Asking for
the Chariot of Apollo'' and Canaletto's ``View of Piazza di San
Giacometto'' showing the church's 24-hour clock, to George Elgar
Hick's ``General Post Office: One Minute to Six'' and Jasper
Johns's ``Four Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Eye of the Beholder'' section, artists' works depict
different versions of Father Time and dwell on the cruelty of the
aging process. Dutch 17th-century vanitas paintings focus on the
transience of life, but Pompeo Batoni's ``Time Ordering Old Age to
Destroy Beauty,'' with an old woman reaching out to touch the
unblemished face of a young woman, is more disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Titian's ``Allegory to Prudence,'' in turn, shows a young man, a
mature man and an old man in a painting designed to demonstrate, in
the words of one medieval scholar, that prudence entails conserving
the past, knowing the present and foreseeing the future.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Against the Clock'' turns toward how time is experienced, be
it through rites and rituals or simply the human body clock. This
section includes Edvard Munch's painting ``Puberty'' and a
selection of photographs by a married couple, taken on Christmas
Day from 1900 to 1945, showing both their aging and the ups and
downs of their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Music, too, is a measure of time, illustrated here most
literally with Beethoven's metronome. Finally, with ``Until the End
of Time,'' the exhibit looks at the human fear of death and desire
for immortality. And at this point, of course, time becomes beyond
measurement.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pompidou Center's exhibition, there is inevitably some
overlap with Greenwich, with a third-century B.C. Chinese
clepsydra, or water clock, opening the show and other cultures
variously represented by a Mayan stela, an Aztec codex and an
ancient Egyptian papyrus text. But the Pompidou Center is by
definition a forum for contemporary art, as well as one that prides
itself on being multidisciplinary. So ``Le Temps, Vite'' also
presents photography, video art, movies, music and interactive
computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   This show is divided into 12 sections and is designed as a
happening as much as an exhibition, with the first section, ``Time,
the Sky,'' in near darkness and each successive section becoming
brighter, until the final room, ``The Future of Time,'' almost
blinds the departing visitor. At the same time, every 15 minutes
the entire exhibition is swept by one of 20 different sound waves
conceived by the German composer Heiner Goebbels. Why not? Light
and sound are also measures of time.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Time, the Sky,'' which includes Luciano Fabro's marble
sculpture ``The Moon'' and Nam June Paik's 12-screen video ``Moon
Is the Oldest TV,'' the exhibition turns reflective with ``Time,
I.'' Along with self-portraits by Andy Warhol, Christian Boltanski,
Bruce Nauman and Robert Mapplethorpe, it shows Nauman's neon
installation ``One Hundred Live and Die'' and a series of
17th-century vanitas paintings by Cornelius Norbertus Gijsbrechts
(who also has a show, ``Painted Illusions,'' at the National
Gallery in London through May 1). This is followed by sections
portraying time through language and calendars.
</P>
<P>
   The section called ``Measuring Time'' displays timepieces
through the ages, but the most striking works are Rebecca Horn's
kinetic ``Pendulum With Black Bath'' and Dennis Oppenheim's
``Attempt to Raise Hell,'' in which a bronze bell regularly strikes
the metal head of a sitting mannequin. This is followed by
``Working Time'' and ``Free Time,'' the latter including Edward
Kienholz's amusing installation ``The Beanery,'' an old-style bar
peopled by clients whose heads are clocks. A video of John Cage's
silent ``4'33'''' goes further to suggest ``freed'' time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memories'' opens with Christian Marclay's ``Moebius Loop,'' an

   In ``Real Time,'' Laurie Anderson's ``Dal Vivo'' re-enacts

   Perhaps this piece as much as any captures the difference
between the Greenwich and Pompidou shows: Greenwich is more
literal, Pompidou is more metaphorical; Greenwich seeks to inform,
Pompidou sets out to disturb. Still, for all that, the French and
British seem to be more in sync now than in the past.

<P>
   In 1582, France began adopting the Gregorian calendar, which
lopped 11 days off the Julian calendar. And in 1752, the British
followed suit. But for 170 years, they routinely went to war with
each other at the same time but on different dates. At least today,
there is only one hour's difference between London and Paris.

 &HT;    Bradley gives Bush 'F' for Bob Jones campus visit
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Inside the crowded chapel of historically black
Benedict College, applause erupted Tuesday when Democratic
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley took a shot at Bob Jones
University.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred miles to the northwest in Greenville, the fundamental
Christian college hosted a campaign stop last week by Republican
contender George W. Bush. The private school is planning for
appearances next week by two other Republican candidates, Steve
Forbes and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   A school official said Republican John McCain has not yet
arranged a campaign stop there, sparing the Arizona senator from
the criticism that Bradley heaped on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''By simply going there,'' Bradley said, ''he is sending the
message that we all know, the message that the new conservatism
isn't a whole lot different than the old conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans running for office from the state legislature to
the White House flock to Bob Jones University. Ronald Reagan was
the first GOP candidate to appear there, visiting the campus in
1980, the year of the first South Carolina GOP primary. Many others
have followed, despite criticisms like Bradley's, which echo the
federal government's widely publicized attack on the school's ban
on interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service eliminated the school's federal tax
exempt status in 1984 because it refused to abandon its dating
policy, which the government considered discriminatory, said
Jonathan Pait, the college's community relations coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a day after his lopsided defeat by John McCain in New
Hampshire's primary, Bush met a friendlier crowd at the Bob Jones
campus, as his South Carolina campaign has focused on conservative
themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our point of view, this is a place where there are a lot
of South Carolina conservative voters,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a bastion of Republicanism,'' state Sen. David Thomas
(R-Greenville) said. ''It is where you go to get votes.'' Even
critics, such as Benedict College professor Marjorie Hammock,
concede that Bob Jones' supporters ''can organize their butts
off.''
</P>
<P>
   With several thousand Bob Jones graduates living in South
Carolina and many active in local churches, Hammock said, ''their
impact is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's president, Bob Jones III, has called for the
Confederate flag to be removed from the Statehouse dome, a stance
that the Republican presidential candidates have refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives disagreed with Jones on the flag. But the
president, like his father and grandfather, who started the college
in 1927, has a reputation for taking stands he believes based on
biblical principles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bible speaks against giving unnecessary offense,'' Jones
said last fall. ''If the flag where it is is an offense to some,
their feelings should be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campus of yellow-brick buildings, strict policy requires
female students to wear skirts that fall below their knees. Male
students must wear neckties until after daily 11 a.m. chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University enrolled its first black student in 1971.
Pait said the school doesn't keep tabs on minority enrollment, but
that the number of blacks is relatively small among the 5,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit last week unleashed more criticism, by Pait's last
count more than 300 e-mails, including one saying, ''I hope
somebody uses you rednecks as target practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the critics assumed that Bob Jones University does not
allow black people to enroll, Pait said. Others criticized the
school's ban on interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''People make the assumption that because we have this policy
that we are racist,'' Pait said. ''God makes us different. We can
love one another. We recognize that God made people with
distinctions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benedict College junior Shirrod Washington said he believes
the policy is hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can they call themselves Christians?'' Washington said.
''The Bible speaks about loving thy neighbor as thyself. God does
not look at color; he looks at the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammock said the policy conveys ''a subtle message of a dominant
race'' that recalls slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ''For George Bush to make that trip,'' Hammock said, ''it sends
a very clear signal, or it ought to, to the entire community,
particularly the African-American community.''

ARAB OFFICIALS CONCERNED BY FLARE-UP IN LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Arab officials expressed alarm Tuesday that the
violence in Lebanon is spilling out of what had been accepted as
routine sparring between Israel and the militia backed by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, just back from a
brief visit to Syria, said that Israel's late-night bombing of
three power plants and other targets east and north of Beirut was
illegal and ``very dangerous'' for peace prospects. Egypt has been
trying to shore up the talks between Israel and Palestinians and
between Israel and Syria; both sets of talks are in suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Israeli strikes Monday, most Arab diplomats had
treated with relative indulgence the two weeks of limited fighting
within Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Moussa was quoted as saying that the situation in the
region was ``uncomfortable.'' But after Israel's attack a few hours
later, he criticized Israel forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilians in Lebanon are no different from civilians in
Israel,'' he said in Cairo. ``Israel can't talk about protection
for its citizens and civilian facilities without understanding that
Lebanese civilians have similar rights to protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in Lebanon has claimed the lives of five Israeli
soldiers in the past two weeks and a sixth soldier Tuesday. More
than a dozen Lebanese were wounded as a result of the Israeli
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the secretary-general of the Arab League in
Cairo, also reacted strongly, calling the Israeli attack ``a
criminal act that has exceeded all limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting is deepening at a vulnerable moment in the peace
process, which appeared to be gaining steam over the past few
months, but then sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four years of inaction, Syria and Israel resumed
negotiations late last year on ending their half-century state of
war. But after three meetings, hopes for a swift agreement
evaporated. The talks have been suspended since mid-January. Talks
between Israel and Palestinian leaders also stalled this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon and Israel have not been talking, although Ehud Barak,
the Israeli prime minister, has said he wants to pull Israeli
troops out of the security zone in southern Lebanon by summer.
Until the air strikes, the fighting in south Lebanon, had not
raised alarms among Arab officials.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has some 35,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is considered to
control the Hezbollah militia, in part because Syrian forces
control its weapons and supply lines.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest Syrian-Israeli talks ended on a sour note, the
Hezbollah attacks on Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon and
Israel's retaliatory raids were assumed by many diplomats in the
Middle East to be related to the skirmishing at the bargaining
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an escalation with the intent to reactivate the peace
process,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a military analyst in Cairo and a
former Egyptian diplomat. ''But it could get out of hand.''

NEW CHINESE GUIDED-MISSILE SHIP HEIGHTENS TENSION

<P>
   China's first Russian-built guided-missile destroyer is expected
to arrive in the East China Sea as early as this week, enhancing
Beijing's ability to threaten American aircraft carriers in any
future encounters over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the Sovremenny-class destroyer's arrival, Russia
is expected to deliver the ship's most formidable weapon, Sunburn
antiship missiles specifically designed to penetrate American
carrier battle group defenses. The sea-skimming supersonic
missiles, in the version employed by the Russians, can carry both
nuclear and conventional warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Nonproliferation conventions and Russia's own strategic
interests make it unlikely that the missiles will be delivered with
nuclear warheads. But Russia could provide, or China could develop,
the technology that would enable the missiles to deliver a Chinese
nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, expected to join China's East Sea Fleet based in
Ningbo, arrives at a time of heightened tension in the narrow
strait separating the mainland from Taiwan, which Beijing has long
considered a breakaway province. Taiwan holds presidential
elections next month and during the last elections, in 1996,
Beijing fired missiles into the sea near the island. The United
States responded by sending two aircraft carrier groups to the
area, infuriating Beijing and embarrassing its military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Even with conventional warheads, China's new missile-armed
destroyers, together with four recently purchased Kilo-class
submarines from Russia will raise the threshold for any future
American intervention in the region, military analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two systems, in particular, are ones that give us pause
and make us realize that we are in fact going in harm's way,'' says
Eric McVadon, a retired rear admiral who was a defense and naval
attache in Beijing and is now a consultant on East Asian security
affairs. ``That's something the Chinese didn't possess before.''
</P>
<P>
   China has built its own guided-missile destroyers, but they are
considered less threatening than the Sunburn-equipped destroyers
from Russia. China purchased two of the Russian ships last year and
is believed to be negotiating the purchase of at least two more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a generational leap for China into a much more
advanced type of surface weaponry,'' said James Lilley, a former
American ambassador to China and now a fellow at the conservative
American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Official American reaction to the ships' arrival has been muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is adequately prepared'' to deal with any
threat posed by the destroyers, a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr.
Terry Southerland said this week. He said there has been no
decision on Taiwan's request to buy American Aegis destroyers as a
countermove to the Chinese purchases. And military analysts say it
could take China years of training before its navy can handle such
a sophisticated ship in an actual conflict.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said China ``is trying to make us sweat ... but one
ship does not a Navy make.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is currently considering expanded military ties with
Taiwan. Last week the House passed the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act, which would increase coordination between U.S. and Taiwan
forces and provide more American training of Taiwan's military
officers. The Senate has yet to vote on the bill, which the Clinton
administration has threatened to veto if it does pass.
</P>
<P>
   American military technology could find and sink the new Chinese
destroyers in a matter of hours of any conflict. But the presence
of the ships and their missiles in the Taiwan theater complicates
the delicate calculus of cross-straits relations, the most volatile
flashpoint in East Asia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Chinese Nationalist Army retreated to Taiwan in
1949, Beijing has threatened to occupy the island by force if its
government declares independence from the mainland. Tensions
increased last summer after Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui,
declared that talks between his government and the mainland
government should be on a ``state-to-state basis,'' affording
Taipei diplomatic parity with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   So far China has lacked the ability to carry out its threat of
invasion _ dubbed by skeptics ``the million-man swim'' _ largely
because of Taiwan's superior air force and the backing of the U.S.
7th Fleet. Instead, Beijing has elected to threaten and intimidate
Taipei with a formidable, and steadily increasing, arsenal of
short-range ballistic missiles such as those used in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the United States is
obligated to help Taiwan defend itself from a mainland attack _
although in a 1982 joint communique with Beijing, Washington
pledged not to increase the quantity or quality of arms sold to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to Taiwan's defense was reinforced last year when
a senior State Department official told a group of Chinese
businessmen that a mainland attack on Taiwan would be ``disastrous
for U.S.-China relations, and could, no doubt, pit us in an actual
war.'' Those comments were intended as a warning to Beijing,
American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But China's new destroyers and their Sunburn missiles, with a
range of up to 65 miles, will alter the equation. The U.S. Navy
currently has limited defense against the missile, which Russia
designed in the 1980s to sink Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyers
guarding American carrier groups or to hit the carriers themselves.
The radar-guided missiles can deliver a 200-kiloton nuclear warhead
to a target beyond the horizon in about two minutes. Even one of
its conventional warheads could sink a cruiser or disable a
carrier, depending on where it hits, military analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   China's purchase of the destroyer and its missiles is part of an
emerging pattern of procurement in the wake of warming relations
with Russia. With the United States and much of Europe refusing to
supply China with advanced weapons, Russia and Israel have been the
country's primary options. Israel has helped China with the
avionics for a fighter aircraft it is developing. But Russia, with
a sophisticated arsenal and weakened economy, has been a more
willing supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has sold China four quiet Kilo-class submarines, which
carry ``wake-homing'' torpedoes designed to detonate beneath a
ship's keel. The torpedoes are difficult to detect because they
approach the ship from the rear where their sound is masked by the
noise of the ship's propellers. And Russia is helping China
assemble Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Many American politicians, military officials and analysts
deride these purchases, saying China is assembling a ``junkyard
army,'' cobbled together piecemeal from out-of-date, cast-off
weaponry that poses little threat to the United States or its
allies. And many of the weapons systems China has purchased require
extensive training and sophisticated electronics and software to be
used effectively. The People's Liberation Army has not demonstrated
prowess in mastering such technology.
</P>
<P>
   But other American analysts see a sinister logic to the
procurement program, suggesting that the weapons purchases meet
specific tactical needs within broader strategic goals _ the
ability to challenge American dominance in the Taiwan Strait, for
example, or to protect its claims in the resource-rich South China
Sea. Some warn further that the incremental arms build-up
represents the early stages of a broader armament intended to
prepare China for potential conflict with the United States or to
allow the country to eventually supplant the United States as the
leading military power in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   China says it has no interest in projecting military force
beyond its borders, arguing that it wants to maintain regional
stability and focus on its own economic development. And, clearly,
it would take decades to develop the integrated armed forces
necessary to challenge American dominance in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing considers Taiwan a domestic, not regional, issue.
``China sees the `Taiwan problem' as a wholly internal issue _ not
a matter of an aggressive action against another country,'' said
McVadon, the former military attache. ``And, of course, enormously
large and economically dynamic China believes it has a rightful
place as a key part of the East Asian security architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick,'' he said, ``is to find a way to preserve U.S.
interests in Asia and yet accommodate China as an emerging military
and economic power in the region and the world.''

PARALYZED LINEBACKER THOMAS DIES IN HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The death of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Derrick
Thomas Tuesday shocked even the doctors who were treating him at
the University of Miami/Jackson Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 33, died at the hospital's Miami Project to Cure
Paralysis, the world's largest spinal cord injury research center,
where he had been recovering since being paralyzed from the chest
down in a Jan. 23 auto accident in Kansas City. He died of
cardiorespiratory arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank J. Eismont and Dr. Barth A. Green said Thomas had been
released last weekend to visit his family and was planning a press
conference next week to report his progress.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas's mother, a registered nurse, was with him when he died
and immediately summoned help from a resuscitation team, according
to Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was feeling great and was going to the gym for
rehabilitation,'' Green said during a 10-minute news conference at
the Ryder Trauma Center of the hospital. ``He was being moved from
the bed to a wheelchair. The doctors were right there with a
response team like Green Berets. They arrived within seconds, not
even minutes. But there was nothing that could be done physically
to save him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother is a nurse with experience with spinal cord
injuries,'' said Green. ``She was part of his medical team as well
as part of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the son of an Air Force pilot who died in Vietnam, was,
said Green, ``an extraordinary person and he was breaking all
records while he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas ``suddenly uttered something to his mother and his eyes
rolled back,'' according to Eismont, vice chairman of the
department of orthopedics and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was progressing extremely well in his rehabilitation. He
had been out on passes during he weekend and things were going
well. We were hoping Derrick's story would have a happier ending
that could have been reported down the line. This was unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said Thomas was stricken with ``most likely a massive
blood clot. He was on all the right medicine to prevent blood
clots. We are all about preventing these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs president Carl Peterson, who became a father figure to
Thomas, visited the linebacker Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upbeat, he was positive, he was Derrick,'' Peterson
said. ``He was in a wheelchair. I said `Son, you're mobile.' He
said, `Father, I am. I've got wheels.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a devastating tragedy to the Kansas City Chiefs family,
the people of Kansas City, the fans of the NFL, and to me
personally. Derrick Thomas has been such an important part of the
Chiefs family for the past 11 years. He has done so much for this
team and our city during his time with us. He had so much love for
the game, for his teammates, and for our town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prayers go out to Derrick's family, to his fellow
teammates, and to our fans who knew Derrick. A light has gone out.
I hope people do one thing as a result of this accident: buckle
that seatbelt.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was driving during a snowstorm Jan. 23 as he and two
friends headed to the Kansas City airport to fly to St. Louis for
the NFC Championship game. Thomas lost control of the car and it
overturned at least three times. Michael Tellis, 49, was killed in
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Thomas was speeding and weaving in traffic, but
there wasn't enough evidence to file charges. Thomas and Tellis,
neither of whom was wearing a seatbelt, were thrown from the car.
Thomas's spine and neck were broken. The third victim, who was
wearing a seatbelt, sustained only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Flags were lowered to half-staff at Arrowhead Stadium Tuesday in
Kansas City, and Thomas's death was announced to the Missouri
Legislature by Bill Kenney, a state senator and former Chiefs
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick Thomas was a true hero,'' said Kenney, who urged
lawmakers to support a bill for spinal cord research in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham recalled telephoning
Thomas at the hospital from the Pro Bowl in Hawaii, after seeing
players and fans honoring him by wearing his number. (Thomas had
not been selected for this year's game.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick said, `Coach, be strong,' '' said Cunningham. ``He
never told me how strong I needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was known nearly as much for his gregariousness as for
his playing accomplishments as a nine-time All-Pro. He was
nicknamed ``social director of the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas also had a serious side, which included involvement
in civic projects, mostly aimed at helping disadvantaged
youngsters. Thomas had been appointed by former President Bush to
lead a reading program called ``third and long'' in Kansas City. He
appeared at libraries weekly to read to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Said NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, ``The entire NFL is deeply
saddened today by the death of Derrick Thomas. Derrick's immense
talent on the football field was matched by his caring and generous
spirit in the Kansas City community. As both a football player and
an individual, Derrick Thomas leaves a tremendously positive legacy
that will enrich everyone whose life he touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cunningham, ``I never looked at Derrick Thomas as a
football player. I looked at Derrick Thomas as one of the finer
people that I had ever been around and a friend. The thing I'll
always remember about Derrick is his smile, that's one thing I'll
never get out of my mind. Derrick will hang over this stadium
forever.''

GORE, THE ARTIST, DETOURS FROM THE TRAIL TO THE STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BRADLEY)

<P>
   Not every politician gets to grace the salons of the New York
art world, as Al Gore did on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With entree provided by his daughter and son-in-law, Gore found
himself in an East Side gallery offering a paean to struggling
artists, and then, with entree provided by a former Harvard mentor,
he basked in the limelight at Avery Fisher Hall, reciting (well,
reading) the words of Lincoln accompanied by a full orchestra and a
nimble Aaron Copland score.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, rigid in his blue suit, did not seem entirely comfortable
in these uncampaignlike settings. When the Gay Men's Chorus
concluded with a stirring ``Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' the vice
president had the good sense to step back from his microphone and
tap it to make sure it was off, lest his own singing be carried by
acoustical miracle across the audience of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, to paraphrase Willie Sutton, the art world is
where the votes are, so Gore soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
   He was billed in the happy chatter of a Lincoln Center press
release as ``a country and western fan who sings at the drop of a
hat for friends and family.'' Although his father, a former
senator, was renowned for his fiddle playing, the vice president
has refrained in months of campaigning from any display of musical
inclination, not counting a momentary burble of ``I Just Called to
Say I Love You'' at a New Hampshire coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   On his plane to Florida Tuesday, Gore told reporters that he had
been nervous about singing at Lincoln Center. Asked to give a
sample of his musical abilities, he demurred. ``I don't want to
clear out the plane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is more at home in the visual arts, often
taking up a brush and watercolors, although few outside his
immediate family have seen his work. Before appearing at Lincoln
Center on Monday night, he spoke at a reception in a gallery of the
Municipal Arts Society on Madison Avenue. He was introduced to
about 150 artists, musicians, actors and media celebrities by the
artist Chuck Close as a ``dabbler.'' Gore interjected that this
referred to ``the frequency, not the technique.''
</P>
<P>
   However infrequent his moments with smock and easel, Gore
impressed Close for having once referred to the ``gestalt'' of a
painting. Still, Close, speaking to an audience that included
Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose, delivered what seemed a casual
slight to the budding artist by concluding, ``If you promise not to
make paintings, we'll promise not to go into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore rejected the proposition. ``I can't promise not to paint,''
he said somewhat solemnly. ``It's one of my forms of relaxation.''
</P>
<P>
   But he pushed on, in a far more abstract talk than he usually
gives on the campaign trail. He praised artists for their social
antennae, saying they ``have an early perception of trends in our
society.'' He said that he used to have an argument with his father
about whether people think only in words, suggesting he did not. He
affirmed his support for public funding of the arts, his only
applause line of the evening. The moment most remarked upon by
receptiongoers afterward was his quotation of Ghandi: ``You must
become the change you wish to see in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Spalding Gray, the actor, pronounced Gore ``astute
and aware and intelligent.'' But Gray was not happy with the vice
president's delivery. He said that Gore was ``very long-winded''
and had spent much time stating the obvious, and suggested that
Gore needed to ``find his way in'' to a conversation better and be
more playful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the evening ended on a majestic note, with Gore standing
on the stage at Lincoln Center and the audience singing along to
the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' in what could have been an ode
to the life of a busy presidential candidate:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps
</P>
<P>
   they have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps
</P>
<P>
   I can read his righteous sentence in the dim and flaring lamps
</P>
<P>
   his day is marching on!''

REGISTERED BAY STATE VOTERS CROSSING OVER TO MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Caught up in the surge of support for Senator John
McCain, Massachusetts Democrats are seeking in droves to drop their
party affiliation and cast ballots in the Republican presidential
primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William F. Galvin said his office has been
swamped with thousands of phone calls from residents asking whether
they can vote in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Many are Democrats who want to cross over and vote for John
McCain, who is aggressively wooing supporters across party lines,
Galvin said. Other are seeking to register for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could influence the primary in a very dramatic way,''
Galvin said. ``In the past, they (unenrolled voters) haven't been
that participatory.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls started last Wednesday, one day after McCain
trounced Texas Governor W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary, and
have been ``overwhelming,'' coming at a rate of thousands a day,
Galvin said. Even staff attorneys have had to drop their work to
answer the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who want to cast a ballot for a Republican candidate
must change their party status to unenrolled or Republican by Feb.
16. Members of the GOP can do the same thing if they want to back a
Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Westhaver, assistant clerk in the overwhelmingly Democratic
Boston suburb of Milton, has seen Democrats ditching their party
label.
</P>
<P>
   Some may believe Vice President Al Gore has sewn up the
Democratic nomination, and are backing McCain because he is seen as
having a chance of toppling Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want a choice,'' Westhaver said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Massachusetts adopted the national parties' standards
for presidential primaries, which allows independents to vote in
either party primary, but effectively registers them as a member of
the party in whose primary they participate.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the numbers of unenrolled voters have swelled. And
the state now gives those voters the option of unenrolling from a
party as soon as they exit the booth, becoming independent again.
</P>
<P>
   But not all states allow that flexibility. In New York and
Delaware, for example, only party members can cast votes for
candidates of the same affiliation during presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the competitive races between Democrats Gore and
former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, and especially McCain and
Bush on the Republican side, are generating surprising interest
among the nation's seemingly sleepy voters at primary time, when
usually only party stalwarts are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   If New Hampshire is prologue, voters could turn out in huge
numbers, make their decisions at the last minute and supporting
candidates that do not share their ideological leanings.
</P>
<P>
   James Glaser, chairman of the political science department at
Tufts University, said although Massachusetts is a ``strongly
democratic state,'' he believes voters will mimic their independent
New Hampshire counterparts, who largely pulled the lever for
McCain, because they were exposed to him here through local media.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign, especially in recent days, is aggressively
targeting moderate and reform-minded Democrats much the way Ronald
Reagan -- the senator's idol -- did in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is a very compelling figure and we got a big dose of
him in the New Hampshire primary. More than anybody else did,''
Glaser said. ``I don't agree with very much of what he said (on the
stump in New Hampshire) but I loved him. He is a magnetic,
exciting, authentic candidate and he's so different from the
offerings. He matches up really well against Al Gore. He matches up
really well against George Bush and he matches up really well
against Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Glaser wondered, ``as a social scientist, I'd be
interested to know if this is happening in other places as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It is.
</P>
<P>
   Just take California, a state where independent voters don't
count toward delegate selection. Only party members can cast votes
that truly matter there. In theory, McCain could win the popular
vote there, but lose the primary because of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   So with nearly 19 percent of California's electorate registered
as something besides Democrat or Republican wanting to have their
vote count, McCain's ground troops launched a publicity campaign to
get those ``others'' registered in one of the major parties --
namely, his.
</P>
<P>
   Although the evidence is still anecdotal, the results have been
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had thousands and thousands of indies and Democrats -- or
as McCain would say, Libertarians and vegetarians, wanting to have
their vote count when they found out about this rule,'' said Ken
Khachigian, McCain's top adviser in California. ``We set up a
process to get at least 30,000 switches'' as of Monday's
registration deadline.The San Jose Mercury News reported Tuesday
that, as of late Monday afternoon, 689 Santa Clara County voters
had switched parties.
</P>
<P>
   Khachigian said it's ``almost impossible to know'' if the
campaign reached that goal, but the whole process has gotten a lot
of attention. A popular radio talk show host even reregistered on
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real phenomenon,'' he said.

DOCUMENTS DETAIL CAPITAL FLOW FROM RUSSIA TO US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal agents seized more than $15 million in two
accounts at BankBoston and Bank of New York in 1998 as part of an
international investigation into money laundering and capital
flight out of Russia, according to documents released Tuesday in US
District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, including portions of an FBI affidavit that
sought the seizure of the bank accounts in November 1998, were
ordered released by US District Judge Robert E. Keeton after The
Boston Globe and The New York Times filed motions seeking their
release late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The documents shed light on the immense problem of US financial
institutions being used by Russian businessmen to move funds out of
the Russian economy into safe havens in the West. They also reflect
the difficulty that US and internal law enforcement officials face
in helping Russian authorities staunch the flow of that money.
</P>
<P>
   The office of US Attorney Donald K. Stern had opposed the
release of the documents, stating that it could jeopardize an
ongoing investigation by US and Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigations encompass the same individuals and
corporate entites, the same bank accounts in Boston and New Jersey
and the same US and foreign financial transactions as are the
subject of the sealed seizure affidavits,'' Stern and assistant US
attorney Michael J. Pineault told Keeton last month in a written
status report on why they opposed release of the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stern's office consented in March to allow for the
seizure of the accounts to be dropped and the $15 million to be
returned to Swinton Ltd., the company in whose name the accounts
were written.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Swinton was controlled by nine principals
of a Russian firm that in 1995 had sold its license to provide
telephone and other communications services in Moscow to a US-based
firm, Global Telesystems, a giant telecommunications firm in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said that the
authorities in United States and Russia are trying to determine
whether the money in the accounts represented payoffs to the
Russians for allegedly selling off their Moscow license and
equipment for below its value.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Laufer, a New York lawyer who represents Swinton, and
officials at Global Telesystems have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was out of state Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment. Federal officials said in September, when the Globe first
reported on the case, that Stern's office had consented to giving
the $15 million back to Swinton, because of the perceived
difficulty in proving that the money had been gained by illegal
means.
</P>
<P>
   While much of their affidavit that had sought the seizures was
edited, the two federal agents investigating the case stated in the
document that the $15 million wound up in the accounts ``in the
course of a single, connected, money laundering conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of the alleged conspiracy were blacked out of the
copy of the affidavit released by Keeton Tuesday. But the agents,
William A. Schureck of the FBI, and Andrew A. Moore of the Customs
Service, said in the document that they believed the case was
another example of corrupt Russian businessmen using US financial
institutions to hide their profits. Although Russian law prohibits
capital flight out of the country, US officials believe that the
equivalent of $2 billion a month in rubles was being transferred
out of Russia, the agents stated in the 1998 affidavit.

 &HT;    Hearing on Rocker suspension to begin
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pitcher John Rocker's grievance will be heard beginning today at
a two-day hearing scheduled in New York, the city that bore the
brunt of the Atlanta Braves closer's venomous tirade in an article
in Sports Illustrated in December.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator Shyam Das has the decisive vote on a three-man panel
that includes Donald Fehr, executive director of the players
association, and Robert Manfred, executive vice president of Major
League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The three will vote whether to uphold Rocker's punishment, which
included a suspension until May 1, no spring training and a $20,000
fine; to overturn it; or to find a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   No decision is expected until the end of next week, at the
earliest. As a result, Rocker _ as speculation grows that the
Braves are trying to trade him and acquire another reliever _ will
not report to spring training next Wednesday with the other
pitchers and catchers.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mariners general manager Pat Gillick said Tuesday that
he has had recent contact with the Braves but characterized the
conversation as more of a ``staying in touch, passing through sort
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker might testify, depending upon the choice of Gene Orza,
who will represent the players union. Commissioner Bud Selig, who
levied the initial penalty against Rocker, will testify, as will
Braves president Stan Kasten. Lawyer Howard Ganz will represent
Major League Baseball. The hearings are closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's appeal will be based on the premise that it would be a
dangerous precedent to serve a lengthy suspension for speech. His
is believed to be the longest non-drug suspension since 1977, when
Lenny Randle of Texas was suspended 30 days for punching manager
Frank Lucchesi.

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ After the Israeli air raids that lighted the
midnight sky, the people of Beirut returned to time-tested routines
Tuesday, firing up generators, lighting candles, putting new
batteries into flashlights and preparing with quiet stoicism for
the expected months without a regular power supply.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three power stations severely damaged by the raids is
at Jamhur, in a valley six miles east of the city that runs into
snowy mountains that reach toward Syria. It was reduced to a
smoldering mass of blackened transformers, still pushing a pall of
black smoke into the sky nearly 12 hours after the raids. This was
the third time in less than four years, and the second time in a
little more than seven months, that Israeli planes have hit the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, Israeli officials have said the raids were prompted
by attacks on Israeli targets by Islamic militants from Hezbollah,
the Party of God, with the support _ or at least the acquiescence _
of the governments of Lebanon and Syria, which is the dominant
power here.
</P>
<P>
   But ordinary Lebanese ultimately pay the price. And after nearly
30 years of turmoil, starting with the civil war that began in
1975, and the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon from 1978, the
mood is embittered resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, we've lived like this for 25 years and more _
bombings, killings, snipers, blackouts,'' Houssein Alameh, owner of
a taxicab service, said as he cruised down Hamra Street in of old
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Merchants were tending portable generators humming on the
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my story,'' Alameh said. ``It's everybody's story. It's
an old story.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is something especially poignant about the
aftermath of the new raids, occurring at a time when Lebanese have
taken to celebrating the tentative rebirth of their country, or at
least of Beirut. The city shows fewer scars every month from the
brutal street-to-street warfare between Christian and Muslim
militias that had reduced much of it to rubble by the time that the
16-year civil war exhausted itself in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor these days can only marvel at the new expressways, the
spanking new sports stadium, the chic boutiques and restaurants,
the new high-rise apartment blocks that lookout toward crystal
beaches busy with joggers, dog walkers and pickup games of soccer.
Wide swatches of open ground and rubble still exist, of course, and
building facades pockmarked with rifle and machine-gun fire are no
rarity. But over all, the city has cause to vaunt its renaissance
in its glossy magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like an old fighter who staggers to his feet only to be
knocked back down to the canvas, the people of Lebanon yearn now
for nothing so much as an end to it all. Many began finally to
believe that might be possible last year, when Ehud Barak was
elected prime minister of Israel on a pledge to end the southern
Lebanon occupation and to broaden the Middle East peace agreements
by reaching a land-for-peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (ATTN EDITORS: IF PRECEDING 4 GRAFS ARE TRIMMED, ADD BARAK'S
FIRST NAME AND TITLE TO 3rd GRAF BELOW: ``... Ehud Barak's
self-imposed deadline ...'')
</P>
<P>
   After the air raids Monday, with the towers of flame and smoke
from the Jamhur plant, few people seemed to know how to assess the
strikes or the Hezbollah attacks Sunday and Monday that provoked
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the first attack, Shiite Muslim militants killed a top
commander of the Israeli-backed Christian militia force, the
Southern Lebanon Army. Twenty-four hours later, they ambushed an
Israeli patrol garrisoned at an old crusader fort in the area,
killing five Israeli soldiers and wounding many others.
</P>
<P>
   Was all of this, some Lebanese wondered, part of a deadly
endgame, a necessary show of strength by old enemies _ Israel, on
one side and Hezbollah, Syria and the Lebanese government on the
other _ that prefigured a deal that will move Israeli troops out of
Lebanon by July 1, Barak's self-imposed deadline? Or was it, on the
contrary, new evidence that the enmities are too deep, the basis of
trust too shallow or nonexistent for the great leap that Barak and
President Hafez Assad of Syria seemed to be working toward when the
Syrian-Israeli talks broke down in January?
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear, beside the rubble of the power stations, was
that many Lebanese harbor a jumble of feelings _ anger at Israel,
certainly, for hitting installations on which all Lebanese depend
and for its 22-year occupation of a major section of their country.
There is also a degree of sympathy, or at least respect, for the
Hezbollah guerrillas, who have promised to end the occupation and
paid a heavy price in casualties, like the Israeli troops and
settlers, for their cause. There is also a deep desire for a
generation of bloodshed and hatred to end.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Baalbek, a predominantly Shiite Muslim town 70 miles
north-east of here that has been a Hezbollah stronghold, Ali
Jaafar, 56, a grandfather, seemed to reflect all these emotions as
he consoled members of his brother's family.
</P>
<P>
   They became refugees during the night from the ruins of their
own house, one of perhaps 12 reduced to chunks of concrete and
broken furniture by the missile attacks on the Baalbek power plant.
Residents were among the 17 civilians said to have been injured in
the raids. ``We don't need bridges,'' Jaafar said. ``We don't need
water. We don't need power. We need to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``We will resist until we see the end of the war
between Lebanon and Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   His niece Karin was one of three sisters who were asleep in
their nearby house when debris from the exploding power station hit
it. She offered a less tempered view. ``I don't like Israel,'' she
said, glancing shyly at her father as he prompted her to spread two
fingers in a ``V'' for victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the state electricity utility, Goerges Moawad,
said the damage at Jamhur and Baalbek and at the third plant, at
Deir Nbuh, outside Tripoli, would take months to repair, at a cost
of $35 million to $40 million. Electricity Minister Suleiman
Traboulsi estimated that half the population of 3.5 million would
be without power for some or all of the time until repairs were
finished.
</P>
<P>
   After the last attacks on power plants, in June, much of Beirut
and its surrounding region was without power for four months.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the government ordered rotating rationing. At
Jamhur, which had returned to near full capacity, engineers said
the damage this time appeared to be far worse. Because the plant is
old, the operators cannot obtain spare parts, and the government
might have to scrap the plant, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Among top Lebanese officials, at least publicly, there was no
reproach for Hezbollah for having ignored Israeli warnings of new
attacks if the guerrillas' strikes on Israeli soldiers and their
allies in the south continued. There was only condemnation of
Israel.

WELD USED INFLUENCE TO HELP LAW FIRM CLIENT IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ William F. Weld, who said he would stay ``a million
miles away'' from state affairs after leaving the governor's
office, successively lobbied his successor, Paul Cellucci, to
approve a drug-purchasing program pushed by a client of Weld's law
firm, according to well-placed State House sources.
</P>
<P>
   Weld and his firm, McDermott Will &AMP; Emery, helped Citizens
Energy Corp. draft and advocate for a new, unusual law that allows
the state to pay lower prices for prescription drugs for elderly
and poor citizens by buying in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   But Weld's involvement went further. Using his close personal
and political ties to the governor, he stepped in and persuaded
Cellucci to back off a plan to veto the program in November.
</P>
<P>
   One source familar with Cellucci's decision said Weld made at
least several calls to the governor, who was under heavy pressure
from the state's biotechnology industry to veto the plan. Cellucci,
sources said, has privately said he would have vetoed the
Democratic-inspired measure had Weld not lobbied him.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci was facing a campaign by biotech companies who warned
him the measure _ slipped into the state budget without debate _
would be a major blow to their industry and discourage research.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Weld's involvement _ which also included his
co-authoring an editorial page column in The Boston Globe with
Citizens founder Joseph P. Kennedy II _ seems to run counter to his
free market, libertarian political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   But Weld and Kennedy, for years political rivals, said in their
joint column that the plan ``marries capitalism with compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Weld violated state law by lobbying the governor without
registering with the secretary of state's office is not clear. That
depends on whether Citizens Energy was billed at least $5,000 for
Weld's lobbying work, and neither the law firm or Citizens would
answer questions about payments.
</P>
<P>
   But the activity sharply contradicts Weld's pledge upon leaving
office in 1997 that he would not involve himself in matters before
state government, and instead concentrate on McDermott Will &AMP;
Emery's international practice, especially in Latin America. He
told a reporter he would go well beyond the state ethics law
requiring he refrain from lobbying state officials for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I have to stay a million miles away from state
government,'' Weld said at the time. ``There will be a massive wall
between me and that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld's lobbying could also reinforce a perception that former
members of both the Weld and Cellucci administrations have traded
on their connections to state government after leaving government
for the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Weld did not return several phone calls from the Globe Tuesday
and Monday. Cellucci declined to comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Citizens Energy said neither the firm or Kennedy
would comment on the relationship with Weld. Sources at the law
firm confirmed it did background legal work for Kennedy's
nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens wants to represent a pool of over 1 million poor and
elderly residents who are covered by Medicaid and Medicare, along
with state employees, and use its expertise gained through buying
discount oil to negotiate with insurers to gain reduced
pharmaceutical prices.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens has acknowledged it could earn a fee of up to $1
million for its involvement, but has said the money would be put
back into its programs to provide heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose the bulk-buying plan say it is akin to
government-imposed price controls on drugs, and will discourage
investors from backing drug company research and development
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Biotechnology Council warned Cellucci last
fall that the proposed law will interfere with the free market and
``have a chilling effect both on the skeptical capital markets and
on our high risk development venturesm.''
</P>
<P>
   The council described the proposal as a ``lose-lose
proposition'' that would also ``block patients from access to
innovative drugs already on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weld and Kennedy, the former congressman, said in their
opinion piece it would allow business to thrive by ``identifying
and capitalizing on market opportunities.'' They said it would also
bring ``significant financial relief to Bay State consumers for the
cost of perscription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   A liberal Democrat who was involved in pushing the program on
Beacon Hill was suprised by Weld's activities but praised his
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely helpful,'' said the source. ``I thought it
was guts. He got his back up about the issue and thought the drug
companies were being greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld's involvement in the issue came in the weeks before he
returned to his native New York and asserted that he has withdrawn
from Massachusetts. Although he has kept his home in Cambridge, he
says he has settled in Manhattan where he is now heading his law
firm's New York City office.
</P>
<P>
   Weld, who is also dropping broad hints that he may run for
governor in New York at some point, even boasted in a New York
Times interview last month that ``I got away with being a
carpetbagger in Massachusetts the puny 30 years that I was there.''

IN INTERVIEW, BRADLEY RETURNS FIRE AGAINST GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley, bound for a day of Seattle
campaigning on Friday, said Tuesday he is the only Democrat who can
run on a message of political reform and hold the presidency for
his party in this year's volatile election.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, responding to criticism leveled by Al
Gore last Thursday in Olympia, Wash., Bradley identified the vice
president as an apostle of ``the old politics, a thousand promises
and a thousand attacks'' that will alienate independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independent voters feel strongly that he (Gore) personifies
the way Washington, D.C., works,'' Bradley said. ``That is the old
politics, of seeing people as interest groups rather than
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given John McCain's victory in New Hampshire, and his current
lead over the vice president in the polls, I believe I am the only
Democrat who can win in the fall because I don't have the 1996
(Clinton-Gore) financial scandals around my neck. I would not be
subject to that kind of attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries,
McCain has identified campaign finance reform as the key to victory
for Republicans in the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has promised to confront Gore with such episodes as 1996
donors' overnight visits to the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House,
and Gore's appearance at a Democratic fund-raiser held at a
Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The visit Friday will be Bradley's first stopover in Seattle
since last summer. He was scheduled to appear here in December, but
canceled after experiencing an irregular heartbeat during
California appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He lately has come under withering fire. Gore used his rally
last Thursday to identify Bradley with the economic policies and
disengaged presidency of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Bradley supported the slashing budget cuts President
Reagan proposed in 1981,'' Gore charged. He also claimed that
Bradley identified with Reagan's big-picture leadership style
rather than viewing the presidency as ``a day-by-day fight for real
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley responded by saying that Gore is ``misstating and
misrepresenting reality'' both in how he views the presidency and
how he fought Reaganomics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've said is that a president has to establish priorities
rather than try to do a hundred things simultaneously,'' Bradley
said. ``It is necessary to prioritize if you want to do big things.
... I would stand for a very active national government. I will set
priorities, which any true national leader must do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that Gore ``neglected to tell you'' that in 1981
Bradley was the Democratic Party's chief spokesman against Reagan's
bill to deeply cut back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the Senate, I was appointed by the Democratic leader to
deal with the budget cuts Reagan was proposing. I led the fight
against the tax cut and mitigated many of the budget cuts that were
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, I voted for the budget cuts after they
were mitigated by our efforts, and I voted against Reagan's tax
cuts. If everyone in Congress had done what I did, we would not
have had the huge budget deficits of the 1970s and 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was on the attack again in Florida Tuesday, charging that
Bradley's plan for universal health coverage would not reserve ``a
penny'' of the federal budget surplus to prop up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scare tactic,'' Bradley countered. ``It's what he did
in New Hampshire. It's what he's trying to do in Florida, which has
2.8 million people on Medicare. I expand Medicare. I set aside
money from the budget surplus for Medicare. And the important thing
to know about Medicare is that it is solid until 2017.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has used attacks on Bradley's health plan to stall the
former New York Knicks' momentum in his insurgent bid for the
Democratic nomination. National polls show the vice president with
a better than two-to-one lead among Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, however, Bradley used advocacy of political
reform to pick up some ground, particularly among independent
voters. He lost, 52 to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Feb. 29 Democratic primary here is only a beauty
contest, Washington has assumed considerable importance to
Bradley's efforts. It is the Democrats' first presidential test in
the West. Independents can vote in the primary. And it comes a week
before California's crucial March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that he is the Democrat who can win the hearts,
minds and votes of those who are not moved by Gore's promises to
fight for traditional Democratic interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a major risk in the general election,'' Bradley
said of Gore's approach. ``I believe it is the old politics, a
thousand promises and a thousand attacks. It is the playbook he
operates from. It is the playbook that hurts with independents.''

DOCUMENTS DETAIL CAPITAL FLOW FROM RUSSIA TO US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal agents seized more than $15 million in two
accounts at BankBoston and Bank of New York in 1998 as part of an
international investigation into money laundering and capital
flight out of Russia, according to documents released Tuesday in US
District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, including portions of an FBI affidavit that
sought the seizure of the bank accounts in November 1998, were
ordered released by US District Judge Robert E. Keeton after The
Boston Globe and The New York Times filed motions seeking their
release late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The documents shed light on the immense problem of US financial
institutions being used by Russian businessmen to move funds out of
the Russian economy into safe havens in the West. They also reflect
the difficulty that US and internal law enforcement officials face
in helping Russian authorities staunch the flow of that money.
</P>
<P>
   The office of US Attorney Donald K. Stern had opposed the
release of the documents, stating that it could jeopardize an
ongoing investigation by US and Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigations encompass the same individuals and
corporate entites, the same bank accounts in Boston and New Jersey
and the same US and foreign financial transactions as are the
subject of the sealed seizure affidavits,'' Stern and assistant US
attorney Michael J. Pineault told Keeton last month in a written
status report on why they opposed release of the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stern's office consented in March to allow for the
seizure of the accounts to be dropped and the $15 million to be
returned to Swinton Ltd., the company in whose name the accounts
were written.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Swinton was controlled by nine principals
of a Russian firm that in 1995 had sold its license to provide
telephone and other communications services in Moscow to a US-based
firm, Global Telesystems, a giant telecommunications firm in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said that the
authorities in United States and Russia are trying to determine
whether the money in the accounts represented payoffs to the
Russians for allegedly selling off their Moscow license and
equipment for below its value.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Laufer, a New York lawyer who represents Swinton, and
officials at Global Telesystems have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was out of state Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment. Federal officials said in September, when the Globe first
reported on the case, that Stern's office had consented to giving
the $15 million back to Swinton, because of the perceived
difficulty in proving that the money had been gained by illegal
means.
</P>
<P>
   While much of their affidavit that had sought the seizures was
edited, the two federal agents investigating the case stated in the
document that the $15 million wound up in the accounts ``in the
course of a single, connected, money laundering conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of the alleged conspiracy were blacked out of the
copy of the affidavit released by Keeton Tuesday. But the agents,
William A. Schureck of the FBI, and Andrew A. Moore of the Customs
Service, said in the document that they believed the case was
another example of corrupt Russian businessmen using US financial
institutions to hide their profits. Although Russian law prohibits
capital flight out of the country, US officials believe that the
equivalent of $2 billion a month in rubles was being transferred
out of Russia, the agents stated in the 1998 affidavit.

 &HT;    Bush wins Delaware, declares victory early
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush won the Delaware Republican presidential
primary on Tuesday, but Arizona Sen. John McCain, a no-show
candidate, ran second and declared something of a victory.
</P>
<P>
   With all 28 precincts reporting, Bush had 51 percent of the
votes. McCain was second with 25 percent. Millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes, who won the Delaware primary in 1996, was third with
20 percent, an outcome that could force him to decide whether to
continue spending the family fortune on his presidential dream.
Former ambassador Alan Keyes came up with 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his solid showing despite not campaigning in
Delaware adds to his ability to lay potholes in Bush's path to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bound to give us a boost,'' said McCain. ``I think there
are some good signs for us, but I think we still have a long, long
way to go. I'm still the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain skipped Delaware in order to concentrate on upcoming
contests in South Carolina, Michigan and Arizona _ three states
that will go a long way in determining whether his Feb. 1 win in
New Hampshire was the high point in his campaign or the springboard
toward an unprecedented win over the candidate embraced by the GOP
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared victory four minutes before the Delaware polls
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won quite substantially and for that I'm grateful,'' he told
an audience of homebuilders in Columbia, S.C. ``I'm confident that
the news media will put me on the cover of every run of the major
news magazines,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   McCain earned cover-boy treatment this week in the wake of his
19-point win over Bush last Tuesday in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush are rumbling toward a showdown on Feb. 19 in
South Carolina, followed by Feb. 22 contests in Michigan and
Arizona and a Feb. 29 primary in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Those battles lead up to March 7, when primaries will be held in
California, New York and several other major states.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 delegates of the 2,066 available nationwide were up for
grabs in Delaware. But, as in many of the early contests, the
battle was more about momentum than delegates. Bush, who captured
all 12 Delaware delegates, called the win ``a piece of good news
that will buoy our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain saw nothing but good news for him in his second-place
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really got to be remarkable to get these kinds of numbers
in a primary in which you don't even appear in the state,'' he
said. ``We never even went there. We didn't spend a penny there.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The
Associated Press and the major television networks, picked up the
trend toward McCain that began in New Hampshire. Almost half of the
people who voted for him Tuesday said they made the decision to
back McCain in the week since the Granite State surprise that
rocked the Bush campaign and stripped him of frontrunner status.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain showing also is strong in light of the fact that the
Delaware primary, unlike New Hampshire's, was open only to
registered Republicans. McCain detractors have tried to make the
case that independents and cross-over Democrats were giving him a
boost, and that Bush is the candidate of true Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain tried to spin his second-place finish into a
positive outcome, Bush said, ``I'd rather be in first place with 51
percent and every delegate. I won every delegate and we're in the
delegate business.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed that Bush did best among voters who are
middle class, elderly, conservative and believe Bush is the likely
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the candidate that can get elected, and he has
all the right philosophies as far as I'm concerned,'' said Bush
voter Robert French, 68, of Lewes, Del.
</P>
<P>
   McCain backers were clustered among the affluent, well-educated
and moderates who said they favor a candidate who stands up for
what he believes.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure loser in Delaware was Forbes, who won the state's
primary in 1996. Forbes' second consecutive third-place finish puts
real doubt on the viability of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is not mounting a campaign in South Carolina, setting
that contest up as a head-to-head battle between McCain and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For months, polls gave Bush a 20-point lead over McCain. But
that edge evaporated last week after McCain used his reform message
to trounce Bush in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls now show McCain with a slight edge in South Carolina,
a state where Bush is road-testing a new message aimed at
positioning himself as ``a reformer with results.''

BRITISH AUTHORITIES SPECULATE THAT HIJACKERS MAY WANT ASYLUM
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS 2nd and 3rd grafs with four hostages escaping; SUBS 5th graf

<P>
   STANSTED, England _ More than 150 passengers spent their third
night aboard a hijacked Afghan airliner Tuesday, held prisoner by
an armed gang who perplexed police by giving no explanation for
their seizure of the plane or making any political demands.
</P>
<P>
   The desultory pace of a largely uneventful day quickened
significantly at 10:45 p.m. when four hostages slipped out of the
darkened windows of the cockpit and, using an emergency rope
ladder, leapt to the tarmac and ran to a hangar where police
officers were stationed. The escape, which the police said was
spontaneous, occurred just after lights were dimmed on the plane.
It seemed not to have been noticed by the hijackers, who are armed
with grenades and pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators, who say they have established a degree of rapport
with the hijackers, were in urgent radio contact with them shortly
afterward and reported that the atmosphere on the plane remained
calm. ``It is obviously sensitive at this time,'' said Assistant
Chief Constable Joe Edwards. ``We are now trying to unravel exactly
what impact this has had on the people on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the continuous negotiations might succeed in coaxing
the hijackers to let more passengers off the plane produced only
one release Tuesday, following the eight freed from the Afghan
state-owned Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 on Monday. The man released
was described as a 45-year-old suffering from asthma who had
complained of feeling ill.
</P>
<P>
   He was the 28th passenger to be released at various stops since
the plane was seized minutes after taking off on a domestic flight
from the Afghan capital, Kabul, early Sunday and forced to fly
across Central Asia and Russia to Stansted, where the plane landed
early Monday. A total of 152 people, including 21 children, 17
women, 14 crew members and as many as 10 hijackers were still on
the blue-and-white airliner parked at the end of a remote airstrip
next to a hangar and a perimeter fence at this airport east of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Another assistant chief constable, John Broughton expressed the
possibility that the men, all of whom speak English, may have come
to Britain in an attempt to secure asylum. Asked to comment,
Broughton said only, ``In talking around the issues, there are a
lot of things raised.''
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified representative from the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees arrived Tuesday night at the airport. Edwards
described the visitor as an ``observer offering background.'' Asked
whether her presence came in response to asylum requests, Edwards
said the subject was too ``sensitive'' for him to elaborate on.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office confirmed Tuesday that all six Iraqis who
hijacked a Sudanese Airbus in 1996 in Britain's last hijack drama
are now living in this country as asylum seekers, drawing benefits
and receiving legal aid. They held 197 passengers and crew members
hostage on a flight from Sudan to Jordan that they forced to come
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis were tried, convicted and jailed for terms ranging
from five to nine years, but they were cleared in 1998 after an
appeals court ruled that the trial judge had erred in preventing
the jury from considering their defense that as opponents of Saddam
Hussein they were acting out of ``necessity.'' The men asserted
that they had taken action in a desperate effort to gain asylum in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign citizens convicted of crimes in Britain are usually
deported, but these men escaped that fate under another law that
obliges Britain to consider any asylum claim once criminal
proceedings are completed. Another hijacker, Yassin Membar, gained
asylum after serving two years of a three-year sentence for seizing
an Air Tanzania flight in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers coming
to Britain, with refugee status being granted in about a third of
the cases. An average of 360 applications a month have been made by
Afghans since October.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the speculation that asylum might be the goal of the
current hijackers was the fact that after nearly 40 hours of almost
nonstop discussions, the gunmen still had made no political
demands. ``There have been no specific requests other than for
food, water and medication _ what we would term housekeeping
requirements,'' Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the point, an Essex police spokesman said, ``We are
not being evasive. There have been no specific demands.'' The
police have not corroborated a report from the Pakistan-based
Afghan Islamic Press that the hijackers had taken their action to
free Ismail Khan, 58, an Afghan opposition figure who was jailed in
1997 by the fundamentalist Taliban movement, which rules most of
the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Broughton said the hostages appeared to be well treated, but
added that conditions on the plane, even with the steady resupply
of water, food and air-conditioning and the removal of trash and
sewage, had to be trying. ``Conditions must be very difficult,'' he
said, ``but we are told the atmosphere is calm and that the
negotiations are businesslike.''
</P>
<P>
   Although camouflaged marksmen and commandos have been deployed
around the airport, the emphasis remains on maintaining calm and
keeping the conversation going.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban government urged the British to storm the plane, but
officials here say that will become an option only if the hijackers
threaten the safety of their captives.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators hope to persuade the captors to release increasing
numbers of people from the plane. The Taliban movement Tuesday
confirmed that among the passengers, all of whom are Afghans, are
four members of the government, but it said they were not high
ranking.

DOCUMENTS DETAIL CAPITAL FLOW FROM RUSSIA TO US

<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal agents seized more than $15 million in two
accounts at BankBoston and Bank of New York in 1998 as part of an
international investigation into money laundering and capital
flight out of Russia, according to documents released Tuesday in US
District Court in Boston.
</P>

capital flight out of the country, US officials believe that the
equivalent of $2 billion a month in rubles was being transferred
out of Russia, the agents stated in the 1998 affidavit.

$255 MILLION SEEN NEEDED TO RESCUE AILING HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK AND RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Regulators now figure they must raise $225 million in
cash, an amount that is already making some potential investors
balk, to keep Harvard Pilgrim Health Care afloat as a nonprofit
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is contained in a confidential memo that was
distributed to potential investors on Saturday and obtained by The
Boston Globe. It says regulators are trying to get $175 million of
the total from area hospitals, Harvard University and other
investors willing to sign 10-year, high-risk notes in the hope that
the troubled health plan will be able to pay them back with
interest. The remainder would come from the sale of Harvard
Pilgrim's health centers.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal carries so much risk that some of the hospitals,
strapped for cash themselves, have backed out while the others are
on the fence. An executive at one hospital network said he he might
actually prefer Harvard Pilgrim be sold to a for-profit insurer _
an option that might allow the HMO to pay off its hospital debts
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   UMass Memorial Health Care, the state's second largest provider
network, will not sign onto the rescue plan because it does not
have enough available cash, said chief executive officer Dr. Peter
Levine. Levine said he made the decision after two UMass Memorial
executives attended a meeting for potential investors on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we do not have a gigantic endowment nor do we
have a gigantic amount of free cash,'' he said. ``And what money we
do have is going for health care in central Massachusetts, not to
recapitalize a failed managed care plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertainty, it appears that the Harvard Pilgrim saga
will be a cliffhanger.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at several hospitals said it is premature to conclude
there will be insufficient investor interest in the proposed state
deal by Friday, the date that Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas
F. Reilly has said he expects firm expressions of interest from
investors in the nonprofit deal and from potential for-profit
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Harvard Pilgrim might be converted into a
for-profit insurer has already stirred considerable debate in
Massachusetts, which has a 200-year history of nonprofit health
care institutions.
</P>
<P>
   No hospital's answer to the state's cash infusion scheme should
be considered a definite ``yes'' hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the players there are different levels of skepticism,''
said one Boston hospital executive who was involved all day in
``hectic'' discussions about Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   But a nonprofit future for Harvard Pilgrim is by no means
assured.
</P>
<P>
   What it will come down to, for many if not all hospitals, is a
cold calculation of their best chance of getting the tens of
millions of dollars that Harvard Pilgrim owes them.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts hospitals have said Harvard Pilgrim owes them
about $265 million, but state officials have indicated that
payments during January have lowered the total.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a for-profit solution can bring in enough to pay off the
liabilities, you then leave providers facing the debate of: `Well
we've got all receivables covered, is there any reason we should go
after this not-for-profit solution and put more money at risk?' ''
said one hospital official, who did not want to be identified.
``Highly unlikely. At that point it's a straight investment
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this decision could hinge on how much a
for-profit buyer proposed to pay to acquire Harvard Pilgrim's 1.1
million subscribers, its hospital and physician networks, and other
assets. If the price is not enough to cover the HMO's debts, that
could tip investors toward participating in the nonprofit rescue
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Since a judge ordered Harvard Pilgrim into state receivership on
Jan. 4, investment bankers hired by Reilly have solicited proposals
from for-profit insurers and worked to pull together the
alternative surplus note deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have proposed several variations of the deal,
including investing in Harvard Pilgrim in return for a seat on the
HMO's board of directors _ a request Reilly said he will not allow.
Another variation was that the surplus notes would be used instead
to allow Harvard Pilgrim to pay off its debts over a period of
years.
</P>
<P>
   But during a meeting Saturday at a downtown Boston law firm,
investment banker Thomas Green of Salomon Smith Barney made it
clear that the state wanted hospitals to actually kick in cash. A
``confidential preliminary private placement memorandum'' stated
that Harvard Pilgrim need $175 million from private investors at an
undetermined interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   The memo contains several qualifying statements, noting that
investment in the notes is ``highly speculative and involves
substantial risk,'' and ``there can be no assurance that any
payment. . .will be made at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors will only be paid back if Harvard Pilgrim resolves its
management problems and retains its members.
</P>
<P>
   Potential investors are exploring whether they can buy private
bond insurance to reduce the risk of their loans to Harvard
Pilgrim. Moreover, some still hope that the Legislature will come
forward with loan guarantees if that is ultimately the only way to
preserve the nonprofit alternative.
</P>
<P>
   If Harvard Pilgrim is unable to sell its health centers for at
least $50 million, then it could cancel the sale of the surplus
notes, the memo stated.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's 14 health centers are valued at $147 million,
but under the proposal state officials are planning on preserving
some of the real estate in case the HMO needs cash later.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators believe Harvard Pilgrim needs roughly $225
million to reduce its negative net worth of $90 million plus
another $130 million to continue operations and pay off debts.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University is still a potential investor in the scheme
to keep its namesake HMO nonprofit. But a university spokesman took
pains Tuesday to dispel any notion that Harvard would become ``the
principle investor in any Harvard Pilgrim recovery plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wrinn, the Harvard spokesman, said a total bailout by the
university would be ``an inappropriate and irresponsible use of
Harvard funds.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wrinn laid out some compelling reasons why the
university had a strong interest in seeing the HMO survive and
prosper. First, many of the university's 15,000 employees are
covered by Harvard Pilgrim. And, he noted, the university's 19
affiliated teaching hospitals could be in deep trouble if the HMO
fails.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, more than half of Harvard Medical School's clinical
teaching in outpatient centers is done in Harvard Vanguard Medical
Group's centers, 90 percent of whose patients are insured by
Harvard Pilgrim, according to a medical school source.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1969, Harvard lent its name to the Harvard Community
Health Plan, which evolved into Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The
university also provided a modest startup loan, which the HMO paid
back. The university never had a role in the health plan's
governance.

PARALYZED LINEBACKER THOMAS DIES IN HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds name of Thomas' mother, Edith Morgan, in fourth graf.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The death of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Derrick
Thomas Tuesday shocked even the doctors who were treating him at
the University of Miami/Jackson Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 33, died at the hospital's Miami Project to Cure
Paralysis, the world's largest spinal cord injury research center,
where he had been recovering since being paralyzed from the chest
down in a Jan. 23 auto accident in Kansas City. He died of
cardiorespiratory arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank J. Eismont and Dr. Barth A. Green said Thomas had been
released last weekend to visit his family and was planning a press
conference next week to report his progress.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas's mother, Edith Morgan, a registered nurse, was with him
when he died and immediately summoned help from a resuscitation
team, according to Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was feeling great and was going to the gym for
rehabilitation,'' Green said during a 10-minute news conference at
the Ryder Trauma Center of the hospital. ``He was being moved from
the bed to a wheelchair. The doctors were right there with a
response team like Green Berets. They arrived within seconds, not
even minutes. But there was nothing that could be done physically
to save him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother is a nurse with experience with spinal cord
injuries,'' said Green. ``She was part of his medical team as well
as part of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the son of an Air Force pilot who died in Vietnam, was,
said Green, ``an extraordinary person and he was breaking all
records while he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas ``suddenly uttered something to his mother and his eyes
rolled back,'' according to Eismont, vice chairman of the
department of orthopedics and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was progressing extremely well in his rehabilitation. He
had been out on passes during he weekend and things were going
well. We were hoping Derrick's story would have a happier ending
that could have been reported down the line. This was unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said Thomas was stricken with ``most likely a massive
blood clot. He was on all the right medicine to prevent blood
clots. We are all about preventing these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs president Carl Peterson, who became a father figure to
Thomas, visited the linebacker Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upbeat, he was positive, he was Derrick,'' Peterson
said. ``He was in a wheelchair. I said `Son, you're mobile.' He
said, `Father, I am. I've got wheels.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a devastating tragedy to the Kansas City Chiefs family,
the people of Kansas City, the fans of the NFL, and to me
personally. Derrick Thomas has been such an important part of the
Chiefs family for the past 11 years. He has done so much for this
team and our city during his time with us. He had so much love for
the game, for his teammates, and for our town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prayers go out to Derrick's family, to his fellow
teammates, and to our fans who knew Derrick. A light has gone out.
I hope people do one thing as a result of this accident: buckle
that seatbelt.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was driving during a snowstorm Jan. 23 as he and two
friends headed to the Kansas City airport to fly to St. Louis for
the NFC Championship game. Thomas lost control of the car and it
overturned at least three times. Michael Tellis, 49, was killed in
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Thomas was speeding and weaving in traffic, but
there wasn't enough evidence to file charges. Thomas and Tellis,
neither of whom was wearing a seatbelt, were thrown from the car.
Thomas's spine and neck were broken. The third victim, who was
wearing a seatbelt, sustained only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Flags were lowered to half-staff at Arrowhead Stadium Tuesday in
Kansas City, and Thomas's death was announced to the Missouri
Legislature by Bill Kenney, a state senator and former Chiefs
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick Thomas was a true hero,'' said Kenney, who urged
lawmakers to support a bill for spinal cord research in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham recalled telephoning
Thomas at the hospital from the Pro Bowl in Hawaii, after seeing
players and fans honoring him by wearing his number. (Thomas had
not been selected for this year's game.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick said, `Coach, be strong,' '' said Cunningham. ``He
never told me how strong I needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was known nearly as much for his gregariousness as for
his playing accomplishments as a nine-time All-Pro. He was
nicknamed ``social director of the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas also had a serious side, which included involvement
in civic projects, mostly aimed at helping disadvantaged
youngsters. Thomas had been appointed by former President Bush to
lead a reading program called ``third and long'' in Kansas City. He
appeared at libraries weekly to read to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Said NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, ``The entire NFL is deeply
saddened today by the death of Derrick Thomas. Derrick's immense
talent on the football field was matched by his caring and generous
spirit in the Kansas City community. As both a football player and
an individual, Derrick Thomas leaves a tremendously positive legacy
that will enrich everyone whose life he touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cunningham, ``I never looked at Derrick Thomas as a
football player. I looked at Derrick Thomas as one of the finer
people that I had ever been around and a friend. The thing I'll
always remember about Derrick is his smile, that's one thing I'll
never get out of my mind. Derrick will hang over this stadium
forever.''

GORE TACKLES MEDICARE IN CRITICIZING BRADLEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEMBROKE PINES, Fla._ Taking his campaign to the heart of senior
citizens country, Vice President Al Gore pounded his Democratic
presidential opponent Bill Bradley on Tuesday for espousing plans
he claimed would harm the future of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also was taken aback by a request from the
head of South Carolina's Democratic Party for Bradley to withdraw
from the race for the White House. But his campaign said the
candidate would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, campaigning in Columbia, S.C., accused the two leading
Republican presidential candidates of trying to ``bottom-fish for
votes'' by refusing to condemn flying of the Confederate flag over
the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in wooing senior citizens, claimed a Republican ally in
his Medicare fight, saying that his ideas about dealing with the
federal program were closer to those advanced by GOP presidential
hopeful John McCain than Bradley's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain and I have in common putting money from the surplus
into Medicare and keeping it from being drawn down when the baby
boomers retire,''' Gore told reporters en route to Florida, which
holds its primary March 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of aspiring Democratic presidential contenders,
Gore made the pilgrimage to Century Village, a sprawling senior
citizens complex filled with New Deal style Jewish liberals who
migrated to South Florida from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told a capacity crowd in the bingo room that Bradley's
health-care plan would sap all of the federal budget surplus and
leave no money left to extend the life of Medicare. Furthermore, he
warned that his opponent had proposed eliminating Medicaid and
replacing it with vouchers that would not pay for many medical
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying anything against him personally. Not a word. I
am not going to have any negative campaign attacks,'' Gore said.
``But I am going to defend Medicare. And I am going to defend
Medicaid. And I am going to defend working families that need the
kind of steady achievable progress that I am talking about here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed spending $300 billion of the projected $4
trillion surplus to extend the life of Medicare and provide
prescription drug benefits for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would tap the surplus to provide direct aid and tax
breaks to the 43 million uninsured and other lower income people
who are having difficulties paying their medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   John Clarkson, dean of the University of Miami Medical School
and a Bradley supporter, showed up at the event and accused Gore of
resorting to ``scare tactics'' on Medicare, which is not expected
to go bankrupt for more than a decade. Clarkson said it was more
important to deal with the immediate problem of helping Americans
who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was hoping that his attacks would hurt
Bradley in a state that has the highest percentage of elderly in
the nation. According to a Gore campaign handout, 2.8 million
Florida residents are on Medicare and 2 million are on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Later at a meeting with undecided voters in Tampa, Gore said he
opposed the decision by Gov. Jeb Bush to abolish state affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is dead wrong in trying to repeal affirmative
action here in Florida,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who on Monday in Florida slammed Bush's stand against
affirmative action, was in South Carolina on Tuesday criticizing
the Republican candidates for not taking a stance against flying
the Confederate flag above the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flag shows the true colors of the Republicans who want to
be president,'' Bradley told The Associated Press. ``That flag
should not fly another day over the state Capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley went to historically black Benedict College to launch
his stinging assault on Republicans, generally sparing Democratic
rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakness and passivity of the Republicans on this issue is
appalling,'' the AP reported Bradley as saying. ``At a time when
leadership, courage and principles should guide our leaders on this
issue, both George Bush and John McCain have instead embraced the
narrow political expediency of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a hot one in South Carolina, and Bradley was
sending a signal to minority voters in important early states like
New York and California, part of a big round of primaries March 7
that could settle the Democratic presidential nomination. South
Carolina Democrats vote two days later.
</P>
<P>
   In an unwelcome good-bye gesture, Bradley was handed a letter by
state party chairman Dick Harpootlian at the airport as he was
leaving, saying it was time for him to drop out of the race and
support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is time for you to pass the ball to the vice
president, who has the opportunity to make the game-winning
basket,'' the Boston Globe reported Harpootlian as saying in one of
several metaphorical references to Bradley's Hall of Fame
basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley camp rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, asserted that Bradley has been
``picking up steam'' since his four-point loss in New Hampshire and
that Gore is unelectable in the fall because of his role in the
1996 fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not dropping out,'' he told the Globe.
``Voters get to decide elections, not party chairmen.''
</P>
<P>
   But polls have shown that since the New Hampshire primary, Gore
has widened his lead over Bradley nationally and in such key states
as New York and California.

   WASHINGTON _ Minutes before their first face-off in a
presidential debate two months ago, Gov. George W. Bush and Sen.
John McCain shared a gesture that distilled the remarkable and
seemingly durable amity between them. With their arms extended and
their faces lit by smiles, the two embraced.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a tightened race makes. With McCain's
emergence as a real threat to Bush's claim to the Republican
presidential nomination, the air between the two men has taken on a
sharp, nasty chill, and hugs seem entirely out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is calling the Arizona senator a hypocrite
and a liar, even if he is not using those words. The Arizona
senator is saying that the Texas governor is no more trustworthy
than a certain Democratic president, in almost precisely that
language.
</P>
<P>
   And the backbiting, finger-pointing and negativity that once
existed almost exclusively in the Democratic contest has crossed to
the Republican side, with potentially damaging effects on the way
voters come to view Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone from a friendly joust for the nomination to an
all-out food fight,'' said Scott Reed, who ran former Sen. Bob
Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. ``The tone of everything
today was very ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bush have long fashioned themselves as
trailblazers above the practice of politics as usual, with McCain
promising to sweep up the mess of government and Bush pledging a
campaign that appeals to ``our better angels, not our darker
impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, those noble postures yielded to recriminations and
accusations on the campaign trail in South Carolina, where both
candidates stumped for votes, and to new television commercials
there that were anything but refined.
</P>
<P>
   An advertisement from the McCain camp labels Bush ``desperate''
and asserts that the Bush crew ``twists the truth like Clinton.''
An advertisement from the Bush crew casts McCain, chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, as someone who ``solicits money from
lobbyists with interests before his committee and pressures
agencies on behalf of contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials make dueling claims about which candidate was
the first to break a January agreement, sealed with a handshake
during yet another televised debate, not to go negative, and the
candidates both insisted Tuesday that they were merely fighting
back against the other's dastardly salvos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, isn't it?'' Bush said at an appearance early Tuesday
in Delaware, where he campaigned briefly before heading to South
Carolina. ``The true nature of John McCain evidently is coming
out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeatedly mocked the clutch that preceded the debate in
Manchester, N.H., in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embraced!'' McCain told reporters in South Carolina. ``I
didn't know that we knew each other that well! He said, `You're my
buddy. You're running a great campaign. I'm proud of you.' We were
30 points behind. Now, all of a sudden, he's turned into Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director, complained
Tuesday that McCain's campaign had dealt out the ``lowest blow of
the political season'' with a commercial, released Monday, that
equated Bush with President Clinton, though less explicitly than
the follow-up advertisement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Davis, the manager of McCain's campaign, gave reporters a
letter that he had written Karl Rove, chief strategist for the Bush
campaign, that pleaded for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   And on and on it went, as each campaign unleashed a blizzard of
electronic mailings, sent the candidates' surrogates onto
television news programs and portrayed itself as the aggrieved,
pained victim of an opponent's aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Republicans said this was par for the course
of a fiercely contested primary, but a few admitted to being
troubled by it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these guys have talked about bringing dignity and
honor to the office,'' said former Education Secretary William
Bennett, who has advised McCain and Bush on policy matters but has
not endorsed either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this is contact sport, these guys need to be
careful,'' Bennett said in an interview Tuesday. ``They're running
to govern an entire nation. People pay attention to what they're
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett took particular exception to the two commercials by the
McCain campaign that likened Bush to Clinton, which Bennett said
was the most egregious crossing of the line between fair play and
unwarranted warfare so far.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, this was bound to happen. With Bush still
reeling from McCain's stunning victory in New Hampshire and McCain
surging in the polls, the South Carolina primary Feb. 19 has
assumed enormous significance and dramatically raised the stakes
for both.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to one recent poll of voters in South Carolina, both
McCain and Bush have sky-high favorable ratings there. That means
that each candidate has less to gain by singing his own praises
than by exposing his opponent's warts.
</P>
<P>
   The new message that Bush brought to South Carolina on Tuesday
afternoon _ that he is a ``reformer with results'' _ clearly
implied that McCain is a reformer without anything to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Bush continued to position himself as the true
Washington outsider, and signaled that McCain was the real insider.
He even accorded the Arizona senator a pointed new nickname: ``the
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for his part, pressed his demand for an apology from
Bush for a rally in Sumter, S.C., last week during which Bush
smilingly accepted endorsements and plaudits from military veterans
who lambasted McCain's record on veterans issues. McCain spent five
and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign also accused people affiliated with the Bush
campaign of conducting ``push polls,'' or telephone surveys with
loaded questions that are meant to disparage an opponent. The Bush
campaign said that it was not, but that the McCain campaign was.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the acrimony began with McCain's assertion, in a
television commercial that ran in New Hampshire and in South
Carolina, that Bush's tax cut frittered away the entire surplus on
tax cuts for the wealthy and did not save any money for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial did not name Bush, but he was the clear target of
it. Moreover, its claim was contradicted by the arithmetic and
details of Bush's plan, at least as he and his aides laid it out.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush's loss in New Hampshire last Tuesday, he publicly
kicked himself for not defending himself against McCain's charge
more aggressively. So, on Friday, he changed his ways, releasing a
new television commercial that mentioned McCain by name and said
that McCain was knowingly misrepresenting the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Republicans said this Tuesday that the
subsequent sniping between the candidates seemed less out of the
ordinary than their cuddly relations leading up to the New
Hampshire primary. A few of these Republicans also said it would
not have a lasting impact.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was less sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party needs a good fight for the nomination, to
produce a candidate capable of taking on Al Gore and the national
Democrats, who are the meanest, toughest campaigners on the
earth,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``we have to be careful we don't destroy our
top two candidates in the meantime, and that's very serious. There
are a whole lot of Republicans around the country shaking their
heads.''

BRADLEY ATTACKS GOP OVER THE CONFEDERATE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley on Tuesday leveled his
harshest attack yet against the two leading Republican presidential
candidates, saying that Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain
were pandering to conservative votes by failing to condemn the
Confederate flag flying over the state Capitol as a symbol of
hatred and segregation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the controversy over the flag in South
Carolina has become an issue in the Republican primary here on Feb.
19. About 47,000 people rallied here on the Martin Luther King
holiday calling for the removal of the flag, but neither of the
leading Republican candidates has echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flag shows the true colors of the Republicans who want to
be president,'' Bradley said Tuesday morning in a speech at
Benedict College, a predominantly black institution here. ``Both
George Bush and John McCain have instead embraced the narrow
political expediency of the Republican Party. It's an expediency
that ignores a hateful, shameful past in an effort to bottom-fish
for voters from the most right-wing elements of the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an increasingly rare moment of party unity, Bradley
said to rousing applause: ``When it comes to social justice and
racial unity these days, there's a clear difference between the two
parties. Al Gore and I say, `Take the flag down.' John McCain and
George Bush say, `Leave it up.' So it does matter who you trust to
lead this country.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment it almost sounded as if Bradley were running on the
same ticket with Vice President Gore against the two Republicans in
a general election campaign. That moment quickly passed, though,
when Bradley briefly criticized Gore as a Democratic candidate who
could not win in the fall because of a cloud of fund-raising
improprieties hanging over him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was also demonstrating a willingness to tackle issues
with a strong, national appeal to a core Democratic constituency,
African-American voters, who are crucial to any chance he may have
of upsetting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Florida primary is not until March 14, Bradley
traveled to Tampa on Monday to attack Gov. Jeb Bush's decision last
week to repeal affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bradley's wife, Ernestine, embarked on a tour of black
colleges primarily in the South, including Spelman College in
Atlanta, where she taught more than 30 years ago. Bradley,
meanwhile, took a detour to South Carolina, whose Democratic
caucuses on March 9 will not be nearly as important as the
Republican primary three weeks earlier.

 &HT;    Thomas' death a surprise to all
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Derrick Thomas was recovering so well from a paralyzing
auto accident that his doctors had met a day earlier to plan a news
conference about his progress. They gathered instead on Tuesday to
talk about his unexpected death.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 33, the nine-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Kansas
City Chiefs who grew up in Miami, was being moved from a hospital
bed to a wheelchair bound for a rehab gym at about 10 a.m. Tuesday
when he called out to his mother. His eyes rolled up in his head.
Doctors rushed to the room, but they could not start his heart or
his breathing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most likely cause was a massive blood clot,'' said Barth
A. Green, chairman of the department of neurological surgery at
Miami's Jackson Memorial Medical Center. Such clots are common
among spinal patients, and he was on medicine to prevent clots,
Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Eismont, vice chairman of orthopeaedics and
rehablitation at Jackson Memorial, denied that Thomas was dropped
while being moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that story was out there, but he was never dropped,''
Eismont said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's official statement said Thomas died ``following
cardio-respiratory arrest,'' which does not necessarily mean a
heart attack but simply that his heart and lungs stopped
functioning. A blood clot that goes to the brain, for example, can
trigger a series of problems that lead quickly to heart and
respiratory failure.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said they did not know if an autopsy would be
performed, saying it was a decision being handled ``on a
legal-administrative level,'' in Green's words.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham recalled telephoning
Thomas at the Miami hospital from the Pro Bowl on Sunday in Hawaii,
after seeing players and fans honoring Thomas by wearing his
number. Thomas had not been selected for this year's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick said, `Coach, be strong.' He never told me how strong
I needed to be,'' Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Flags were lowered to half staff at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas
City, and the Missouri Legislature paused for a moment of silence
after Thomas' death was announced by state Sen. Bill Kenney, a
former Chiefs quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for Thomas was grim after a car crash on an icy road
in Kansas City on Jan. 23. The car he was driving flipped, and
passenger Michael Tellis was killed. Thomas' spinal cord was badly
bruised and he could not move below the waist. A third occupant,
the only one wearing a seat belt, walked away with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' mother _ herself a nurse who has worked with spinal-cord
patients, according to doctors _ requested he be moved to Miami.
She was active in his treatment and was with him Tuesday morning,
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were able to stabilize and reconstruct a section of his
spinal column and Thomas's outlook seemed to improve.
</P>
<P>
   He was allowed out of the hospital on short trips _ a detail
revealed Tuesday in a reference to ``weekend passes'' that doctors
declined to elaborate on. He was working out in a rehab gym. It was
going so well that some people who knew Thomas began to hope
someday he might walk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick was breaking all the records when he was here, not
just on the field,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio shows and Internet sites from Miami to Tuscaloosa were
filled with tributes to Thomas, who starred at the University of
Alabama after his prep career at South Miami High School.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had overcome misfortune before. His father was a pilot
who died in Vietnam during Operation Linebacker II. Even as a
college student, Thomas worked on behalf of groups concerned with
missing soldiers and prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   An All-American at Alabama, the 6-foot-3, 255-pound Thomas
became an immediate star as a pass-rushing specialist after being
taken in the first round of the 1989 draft. He ranked ninth on the
career list with 126.5 career sacks.
</P>
<P>
   He holds the NFL one-game sack record with seven against Seattle
in 1990, and is ninth on the career list. Thomas was proud of his
reputation as a hard-working player who cared about his community.
His biggest regret, he has said, was an infamous Monday Night
Football game against Denver in 1998 when he was flagged for three
personal fouls after losing his cool on a drive late in the game.
It hurt him, he said, that kids would see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping Derrick's stay would have had a happier
ending,'' Eismont said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Chiefs president Carl Peterson had visited Thomas on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done so much for this team and our city during the time
that he had with us,'' Peterson said. ``He had so much love for the
game, for his teammates and for our town. ... A light has gone
out.''

COMMENTARY: SHE'S DROPPING NAMES! 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I just love the perky campaign slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``HILLARY!''
</P>
<P>
   It evokes all those shiny divas who need only one name _ Cher
and Madonna and Charo and Ann-Margret. It also has a whiff of
royalty. Those House of Windsor gals never bother with last names.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there's something very That Girl about it. (Remember how
Marlo Thomas, a struggling actress, had this inexplicably huge New
York apartment? And now HILLARY!, a struggling candidate, has this
inexplicably huge New York house?)
</P>
<P>
   The familiarity of it makes you want to just call out to her,
over the white picket fence in Westchester: ``Hey, HILLARY!, heard
any hot commodities tips?''
</P>
<P>
   Her new moniker crystallizes the question posed by the first
lady's campaign: Is it possible to wipe out everything people know
about you and start over again?
</P>
<P>
   ``In this moment of McCain, in this day of authenticity and
character and personality driving much of the presidential race,
can HILLARY! wipe out the CLINTON! in her life?'' wonders Paul
Costello, a crisis-management expert who worked as a press
secretary for both Rosalynn Carter and Kitty Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ultimate in re-branding, as they say in the ad biz. If
you thought it would be tough for ValuJet to leave behind grisly
images of the Everglades by changing its name to AirTran, that was
nothing compared with this bit of name-dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary is the first Cubist politician. All you see are the
parts, not the whole, because she's always rearranging and changing
the perspective. Different names and hairstyles and clothes and
issues are deployed to send the message of the day, and we're left
with a fractured jumble of pink and black, frizzy and straight,
Cubs and Yankees, staff firings and tossed salads, second fiddle
and first string, two for the price of one and one for the price of
two.
</P>
<P>
   I picture her corner office at campaign headquarters in New York
with four incoming phone lines: Hillary Rodham, Hillary Clinton,
Hillary Rodham Clinton and HILLARY!
</P>
<P>
   Suha Arafat can send kisses on the H.R.C. line, while her new
Jewish relatives can say ``Shalom!'' on the HILLARY! line.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood can come in on all four lines. So can Al Sharpton, but
he goes straight to voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard keeping all those lines from getting crossed. The
blond Hillary Rodham Clinton wears pastels and pumps and plans
state dinners. The blonder HILLARY! wears black pantsuits and black
androgynous shoes and brings chicken and rice casseroles to
suburban potluck dinners!
</P>
<P>
   H.R.C. always lived in taxpayer-financed housing. HILLARY! can't
believe how much she has to pay in taxes! H.R.C. was the great
liberal hope. HILLARY! believes the era of big government is over!
H.R.C. believes in redemption. HILLARY! believes in the death
penalty!
</P>
<P>
   H.R.C. is introduced by her husband on stage. HILLARY! doesn't
introduce her husband on stage! H.R.C.'s husband is the president.
HILLARY!'s husband needs a caddy!
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY! told The Times' Adam Nagourney that she was stung when
some of her early Senate supporters deserted her when the going got
rough. But H.R.C. and her husband are famous for turning friends
and supporters into roadkill when the going gets rough.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years, H.R.C. acted as though her loftiest goals
were decorating at Christmas and lunching with gossip columnists.
But now HILLARY!'s aides are busy spinning that backstage she has
been, as Newsweek put it, ``a West Wing fixer ... an aggressive and
committed policymaker and strategist.''
</P>
<P>
   What HILLARY! really wants is a time warp where everyone would
forget the last eight pesky years. If only she could recapture her
age of innocence, before her tacky brothers tainted the name Rodham
and before her husband tarnished the name Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as the campaign wears on, the candidate formerly known as
first lady will shed her first name also and, Prince-like, adopt a
symbol instead of a name.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, given the voters she most desperately needs, she could
use the circle and cross that designates Woman. Or cut back to just
the ``!''
</P>
<P>
   Given that she is such a puzzle, there is really only one
perfect symbol: ``?''

CRITICISM OF CASINO MISSES MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There has been some misunderstanding about
what happened recently when ill-advised punters chased a
progressive slot machine jackpot to their financial oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   As the elusive prize at Station Casino Kansas City swelled from
$130,000 to more than $250,000, those chasing the payoff camped out
at the riverboat. The casino was happy to accommodate them and
provided free room and board.
</P>
<P>
   These freebies were criticized by some who say the casino went
too far to encourage self-destructive behavior. Such criticism,
however, misses the point of what this exercise in gambling folly
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Those who lost small fortunes weren't innocent pilgrims. There
is an old saying on Wall Street that the prime movers of the stock
market are fear and greed. The same can be said of gambling. Those
who frequent gambling emporiums know what they're doing and the
risks involved. It's the sort of awareness that prompted the
cognoscenti to dub Las Vegas ``Lost Wages'' long ago.
</P>
<P>
   What happened recently was an honest commercial exchange between
a business and its customers. In this case, the business offers its
patrons a chance to flirt with Dame Fortune and score a financial
windfall in the bargain. What's being marketed is guilty pleasures
to spice up humdrum lives.
</P>
<P>
   As for the freebies, these are routine marketing initiatives.
There are certain lessons serious gamblers must learn quickly. One
of the most important is that if you're a customer for whom casino
operators are eager to provide free transportation, meals and//or
lodging in return for your business, then you can safely consider
yourself a pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism of the casino was that management didn't react
aggressively enough to identify those participating in this
foolishness as compulsive gamblers who shouldn't have been allowed
to indulge their self-destructive passions.
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism denies the reality of our litigious society and
puts the casino in an unfair position. What happens if the casino
bars the patron from chasing the jackpot and a few hundred coins
later the next plunger hits the big bonanza? It's a certain bet the
casino then not only will lose the jackpot money but also will find
itself in the position of having to settle a lawsuit brought by
somebody claiming denial of the rightful chance to win a couple of
hundred grand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few truly honest observations proffered in the debate
over the implications of what happened came from the Missouri
Gaming Commission agent at the scene. ``Unfortunately,'' he said,
``losing is part of gambling. I cannot protect anybody from
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of legalized gambling invariably see this type of
situation as further proof that casinos are broadly detrimental to
society by offering more temptation than most humans can resist.
Such arguments, however, ignore the fact that it is only a relative
few who are unable to handle this form of entertainment
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   No legally constituted business should be required to deny its
prospective customers the opportunity to buy its goods and
services. If that were the case, restaurant operators would be
obliged to monitor the eating habits of their seriously
weight-challenged diners.

BUSH RECORDS STRONG WIN AMONG DELAWARE REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Delaware - Texas Gov. George W. Bush won a
badly-needed show of support from Delaware Republicans Tuesday,
finishing well ahead of his chief rival in what his campaign hopes
will be a first step toward reclaiming momentum in the GOP
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   With his campaign reeling from a stinging loss to Arizona
Senator John McCain in last week's New Hampshire GOP primary, Bush
dodged a potential humiliation with his showing here, and now heads
into the Feb. 19 South Carolina primary on a more upbeat note.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain claimed a victory of sorts as well, earning a quarter
of the vote in a contest he all but ignored.
</P>
<P>
   With all 28 precincts reporting, Bush won handily with 51
percent of the vote, while McCain placed second with 25 percent.
Conservative publisher Steve Forbes finished third with 20 percent,
a result which is bound to increase pressure on him to reconsider
his campaign. Former Ambassador Alan Keyes tallied 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush collected a mere 12 delegates _ 1,034 delegates are needed
to win the party nomination _ but his win had a larger significance
at a delicate stage of his candidacy. Another loss to McCain, who
did not campaign or spend any money here, would have been a
symbolic disaster for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``honored'' by the vote, and again pressed his
new theme that he is a more genuine reformer than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''My message I'm going to share with you is a message people
heard. It's a message of being a reformer with results,'' Bush said
at a dinner held by the South Carolina Association of Home Builders
at Seawell's Restaurant in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the Associated Press his win was ``a piece of good
news that will buoy our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, said he was pleased to finish a respectable
second in a state where he ran no ads and did not campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely surprised and pleased that we get that kind of
vote in a state we never visited,'' McCain said on his campaign bus
in South Carolina Tuesday night. McCain also stressed his view that
he remains the underdog in the race to nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware's primary was open to registered Republican voters
only, depriving McCain of the independent votes that were crucial
to his New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
   The results were another blow for Forbes, whose campaign has
been flagging badly since he finished second in last month's Iowa
caucuses and third in New Hampshire. The magazine publisher's
third-place finish was in particularly grim contrast to his 1996
victory here over eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole. He was, however,
the only GOP candidate to actively seek the Delaware vote that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who has spent more than $28 million of his own money on
his candidacy, had spent more time campaigning here than any of his
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has rejected calls that he consider dropping out of the
race. Aides say he will run at least until a set of major primaries
on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we would have liked to have done better. We will go
on to Michigan and South Carolina and assess the situation as
things move forward,'' campaign manager Bill Dal Col told the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes himself had no immediate comment in the aftermath of the
vote. But the candidate earlier this week suggested that Bush may
have had an unfair advantage here. He complained that the Delaware
GOP had made voting deliberately difficult as a way of aiding Bush,
who enjoyed institutional support and fielded a substantial primary
day organization.
</P>
<P>
   Only 28 polling places were open statewide, and some voters were
apparently confused about where to cast ballots. When Forbes asked
Wilmington resident John Vella for his vote in a hotel cafeteria,
Vella replied: ``If I can find the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the usual place and I just assumed it would be
there, but it's not,'' Villa said. Forbes gave him a number to call
for poll information.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the Voter News Service showed that Bush
did well among conservatives and middle-class voters, while
McCain's support was rooted more among more affluent and better
educated voters who see themselves as moderates and independent
thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did best among voters who said moral values were their
biggest concern. McCain won among voters who said they wanted a
candidate who stands up for his beliefs. Forbes voters tended to
put a premium on ideas over character, and said taxes were their
chief concern.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls also suggested McCain may have benefited from an
explosion of publicity following his New Hampshire victory. Nearly
half of McCain's supporters made up their minds in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbia, Bush joked about McCain's fast-rising profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that the news media will put me on the cover of
every one of the major news magazines,'' Bush added, referring to
McCain's appearance this week on the covers of Time, Newsweek and
U.S. News &AMP; World Report. The Bush campaign has suggested the news
media is biased in favor of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Forbes stayed in Delaware for results. Both
flew out of the state in the early afternoon, hours before the
polls closed. Bush traveled to South Carolina, which holds its
primary Feb. 19. Forbes head to Michigan, where Republicans vote
three days later.

BRADLEY PLAN CALLS FOR SPENDING $80 BILLION ON SCHOOLS IN POOR
AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his most extensive speech on education, former
Senator Bill Bradley will call for increasing spending by $80
billion over the next decade to improve schools in poor areas. His
plan includes requiring schools to have teachers meet minimum
standards, or face state takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is scheduled to unveil his proposals in a speech on
Wednesday in St. Louis, where he will also criticize Vice President
Al Gore, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, for
failing to do enough to improve education in seven years in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The speech comes as Bradley _ who lost to Gore in the Iowa
caucuses and the New Hampshire primary and trails him in national
polls _ is making his most concerted effort of the campaign to
reach core Democratic voters. Polls consistently show that
education is the first or second most important issue for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's new emphasis on education is a shift for his campaign.
Unlike Gore, who made education a focus from the beginning, Bradley
has interlaced educational themes into policy initiatives on
poverty and working families. Until recently, Bradley's aides were
vague about whether he would even deliver a major education
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Al Gore is winning on the issues and education
is right at the top of the list of issues that people care about,''
said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign. ``This
turnaround is clearly coming because Bradley realizes he's been
losing on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said the campaign had been
working on the education proposals for several months and had
delayed unveiling them until the weeks preceding March 7, or
``Super Tuesday,'' when voters in a dozen states, including New
York and California, will be paying attention to the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they care what month of the campaign you offer a
proposal,'' Hauser said. ``Gore is proposing to increase defense
spending more than education spending. It's pretty clear who the
education candidate is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is calling for spending $175 billion over the coming
decade on education, a figure that includes his previous proposals.
The vice president has proposed spending $115 billion over the same
period to increase salaries for teachers in high-poverty areas,
expand preschool programs and help schools modernize, among other
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Bradley's speech is a proposal to double
federal spending, to $16 billion a year, on Title I, the federal
aid program for schools in poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1965, Title I is the largest federal program for
primary and secondary education, providing nearly $8 billion
annually to help schools improve the academic performance of 10
million poor children. Though conservatives often criticize the
program, it has gained broad support in both major parties because
Title I funds go to schools in almost every congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley will link his Title I proposal to the
broad vision of his campaign: that the nation has a moral
obligation to use its soaring prosperity and the federal budget
surplus to lift up the neediest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow Jones has been soaring to record heights, but our
children's test scores in reading, writing, math and science have
stayed essentially flat,'' Bradley will say, according to an
advance copy of the speech. ``The achievement gap between minority
and nonminority, between poor and nonpoor, remains unacceptably
vast.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, parts of which mirror a Title I bill passed by
the House last year, Bradley would also require the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Every teacher in districts that receive Title I money would
have to have majored in the subject they taught or passed state
aptitude tests in the subject. Schools would have to show within
four years that all teachers had met those qualifications, or be
subject to a state takeover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every Title I school district would have 10 years to eliminate
the performance gaps between its minority and nonminority students,
and between poor and nonpoor students. Schools that failed to close
the gaps could be subject to takeover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Schools that are deemed failing would have to allow students
to transfer to other public schools in those districts. Title I
money would follow students to their new schools to encourage
high-performing schools to accept the additional students.
Currently, Title I money does not move with children who transfer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bradley's proposals won praise from several education experts on
both sides of the aisle on Tuesday. While liberals said they liked
its large investment in poor students, conservatives said Bradley
was right to expand the ability of poor students to choose their
schools and to require individual schools to meet clear performance
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to invest so much money, focusing on the
achievement gap is the right way to go,'' said Nina Rees, a senior
education policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation and an
education adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is seeking
the Republican presidential nomination.

FORD ENDS PRODUCTION OF GLOBAL CAR AT CLAYCOMO PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The global car has left town for good.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. officially ended production of the Ford Contour
and Mercury Mystique on Friday at the Claycomo plant. The plant is
retooling its passenger car line in anticipation of sport-utility
vehicles to be introduced this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some passenger line employees remained on the job over the
weekend and are working through the week for maintenance, said Rich
Voytowich, a Ford spokesman at its Dearborn, Mich., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how long the Claycomo passenger line will be down,
although company and union officials have speculated that a
changeover might take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,300 hourly workers are affected by the temporary
shutdown. Voytowich said Ford and United Auto Workers officials
were negotiating compensation terms for the temporarily furloughed
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ford will continue producing F-series trucks at
Claycomo on its second assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   The Claycomo plant employs about 5,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The new compact sport-utility vehicles to be built at Claycomo
are the Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute. The vehicles are expected to
compete with the popular Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has said the new sport-utility vehicles will be in
production by spring, but it has not set a launch date.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also remains mum on speculation that the Escape and Tribute
could create jobs at Claycomo. UAW officers last year said 500 or
600 production jobs could be added, but company executives said the
new vehicles would bring little change in the size of the work
force. Both sides have declined to comment further on the
employment issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape and Tribute will replace the Ford Contour and Mercury
Mystique, which were launched by Ford in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``global car'' because Ford also built a European
version, the Contour and Mystique never reached U.S. sales levels
anticipated by the automaker.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the quality of the Contour and Mystique, auto
industry analysts said the vehicles faced stiff Japanese
competition during a time when consumers were beginning to favor
light trucks over passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also noted that the Contour's market was squeezed by the
smaller Escort and the bigger Taurus, popular Ford brands with
loyal buyers.
</P>
<P>
   During the production of the Contour and Mystique at Claycomo,
Ford passenger line employees had periodic one- and two-week
layoffs because of slow sales.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, about 1 million Contours and Mystiques have been
built. The cars will continue to be produced at Ford's plant in
Cuautitlan, Mexico, until October.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape would be the second of three new vehicles expected to
be built at Claycomo this year. The F-150 SuperCrew, a four-door
version of the popular truck with a bigger backseat, recently began
production on Claycomo's truck line. Retail prices for the F-150
Super Crew range from $26,755 to $31,790, according to a recent
issue of Automotive News.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, Claycomo expects to build the Lincoln
Blackwood, which combines elements of a luxury SUV and a pickup
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing Ford's passenger line at Claycomo is Robert J.
Webber. The Ford executive was appointed manufacturing manager
responsible for passenger vehicles at Claycomo in November.
</P>
<P>
   Webber previously was final assembly area manager for Ford's
plant in Edison, N.J. He has been with Ford since September 1988,
when he started as a training specialist at its assembly plant in
Wayne, Mich.

THE CHIEFS' THOMAS DIES SUDDENLY DURING HOSPITAL STAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ala)   (With FBN-VECSEY-COLUMN) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Derrick Thomas, the Kansas City Chiefs' Pro Bowl linebacker
known for his ferocious play on the field and his charity work off
it, died suddenly Tuesday morning in a Miami hospital, nine days
after a car crash had left him paralyzed from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Thomas suffered from cardiorespiratory arrest while
being transferred from his bed to a wheelchair on his way to a
therapy session.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' death surprised the physicians who were working closely
with the former NFL star. Dr. Frank J. Eismont, a neurosurgeon at
Jackson Memorial Hospital, said he believed that Thomas died from a
pulmonary embolus, which is a blood clot traveling through the
lungs. The 33-year-old linebacker had been taking blood thinners
and wearing compression stockings to prevent such clots, Eismont
said, but that doesn't always keep them from occurring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total shock,'' said Dr. Barth Green, chairman of the
department of neurosurgery at Jackson Memorial. ``We had a medical
team there within seconds, but there is nothing that could be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Eismont, who, along with Green, operated on Thomas after the car
crash, said: ``He'd been doing extremely well. This past weekend he
had even been out of the hospital. Therapy had been going fine. He
was actually progressing probably better than expected for someone
with his level of paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Eismont said that Thomas was being moved from his bed to begin
his daily physical therapy, which had begun over one week ago.
Thomas, Green said, was speaking to his mother when suddenly
Thomas' eyes rolled back. Medical officials determined that Thomas
was having a heart attack and after working on him for at least 30
minutes, he was pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just been transferred from his bed to the wheelchair,''
Eismont said. ``He muttered a few words to his mother like, `I
don't feel very well,' and then literally one or two seconds later,
she looked at him and his eyes were rolled back. It was apparent
that he had passed out. At the time they essentially called a nurse
and the nurse immediately called an arrest and there was a
full-scale attempt at resuscitation with all of the appropriate
things _ the medicines _ and were never able to resuscitate him.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL was anguished by the death of Thomas, one of its most
respected players and solid citizens. In Kansas City, flags were
lowered to half-staff at Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Chiefs. The
Missouri Legislature paused for a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a devastating tragedy to the Kansas City Chiefs family,
the people of Kansas City, the fans of the NFL, and also to me
personally,'' said Carl Peterson, the team's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue released a statement saying,
``Derrick's immense talent on the football field was matched by his
caring and generous spirit in the Kansas City community. As both a
football player and an individual, Derrick Thomas leaves a
tremendously positive legacy that will permanently enrich everyone
whose life he touched.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Thomas continued what has been a series of bizarre
and sad incidents in professional sports. The NBA lost one of its
players in a car accident last month when the Charlotte Hornets'
Bobby Phills was killed while racing a teammate. In the past few
weeks, two NFL players, Rae Carruth of the Carolina Panthers and
Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens, have been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was injured on Jan. 23 on an icy road in Kansas City
while driving to the airport to fly to St. Louis to attend the NFC
title game. Witnesses say that the 1999 Chevrolet the defensive
lineman was driving was speeding and weaving through traffic when
it struck a median and flipped over several times on Interstate
435. A friend who was in the car with Thomas, Michael Tellis, was
killed in the crash. Neither he nor Thomas were wearing seat belts.
Another passenger, who was wearing a seat belt, was treated for
minor injuries and released from the hospital soon after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the crash, Thomas sustained a broken spine and neck,
specifically the T5 vertebrae in the middle part of the back, and
awoke semiconscious, with no movement or motor function below the
chest. Thomas also had several fractures of the cervical spine,
which caused weakness in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Once it became clear that the star player might never walk
again, friends and family members came to the hospital for support.
Thomas vowed to them he would walk again.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Thomas was taken Jackson Memorial, which houses the Miami
Project to Cure Paralysis, which is among the most renowned spinal
cord injury research centers in the world. Thomas and doctors had
begun plans for his rehabilitation. Thomas' spirits were so high he
was planning to hold his first news conference sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact he had just been joking with the people on the rounds
a few minutes before'' his death, Eismont said, ``and his mom said
he was even joking with her a few minutes before.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was one of the best pass rushers to play the game, and
ranks ninth on the career sack list with 126.5. He holds the record
of seven sacks in a game, set on Nov. 11, 1990, against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Miami on Jan. 1, 1967, Thomas went on to become an
all-American at the University of Alabama, where he set a school
record with 52 career sacks. He was drafted with the fourth choice
overall by Kansas City in 1989. Before arriving in Kansas City, the
team had made the playoffs just once in 17 years. With Thomas on
the defensive line, and the talents of the former coach, Marty
Schottenheimer, the Chiefs were one of only three teams in the
1990s to win 100 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious on the field, Thomas was a gentle giant off it. He
started a program for poverty-stricken children called the ``Third
and Long Foundation.'' As a part of the program, he read books to
children at local libraries every Saturday the Chiefs played at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas performed other charity functions that he did not
publicize. Chiefs players and team officials estimate that Thomas
gave at least several hundred thousand dollars to various groups in
the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he was the NFL's man of the year. Two years later, the
players association awarded Thomas the Byron ``Whizzer'' White
Humanitarian Award for service to the community.

BEING A SPORTS FAN MORE THAN CELEBRATING THE WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a loaded title. (itals)Sports fan.(unitals) Who knew that
it required so much responsibility? By the end of this sad and
chaotic year, the description may need a few amendments so we can
truly understand what it means.
</P>
<P>
   Calling yourself a sports fan now means implicitly agreeing to
embrace all of the flammable package. There is escapism in there;
there are also things that you might have been trying to escape
from. So you learn to be cautious when you see sports news scroll
across your television screen. You learn to brace yourself when
your buddy says, ``Did you hear about . . .?''
</P>
<P>
   You're not sure whether that sentence will contain news about
Tiger Woods's brilliant comeback at Pebble Beach, or whether your
friend is trying to tell you about another pro athlete who died too
young. Did someone say something crazy? Was someone arrested? What?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon it was, ``Did you hear about Derrick Thomas?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a Kansas City Chiefs linebacker, had been in a car
accident Jan. 23. Some witnesses say he was speeding on an icy
interstate, weaving in traffic. He was trying to get to the Kansas
City airport so he could fly to St. Louis and watch the NFC
Championship game. His friend, Michael Tellis, was thrown from the
car and instantly killed. Thomas broke his spine and neck, injuries
that left him paralyzed from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas died of cardiac arrest Tuesday. He was 33.
</P>
<P>
   This year is not yet two months old, but the sports roll call
has been numbing. A 25-year-old pitcher suspended for racist
remarks. A 25-year-old receiver, hiding out in a trunk, accused _
with three others _ of murdering his girlfriend, who was pregnant
with his child. A 24-year-old linebacker accused of double murder
after the Super Bowl. A 30-year-old basketball player killed in a
drag racing accident in Charlotte. A 33-year-old football player
paralyzed in an auto accident, then losing his life two weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   Any fan who is paying attention can see the obvious: The borders
for the pro sports world are shrinking. The Metro and Sports pages
used to be distant relatives, never having to worry about
overlapping. They were of different worlds and, clearly, the sports
world's dimensions were as vast as the old West's. Now? We are
talking about Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Arenas and ballparks adopted corporate names and the borders
shrank. There was an Olympic scandal and the borders shrank some
more. The Nike name and logo were branded on the sports psyche, and
the borders shrank again. Domestic violence, murder, surreal
contracts, and teams on the move collapsed the borders further.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Sports fan.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the definition hasn't changed. We still love our
games. We love talking about moments such as the ones Thomas
provided for us. He once had seven sacks in a game on Veterans Day
and afterward dedicated the performance to his father, who was
killed in Vietnam when Thomas was a child. Thomas was a nine-time
Pro Bowler, the 1993 NFL Man of the Year, and one of the most
dominant pass rushers in league history. Any sports fan can
appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   But now, I think the appreciation is deeper than ever. Since the
sports world has become a sports village, you tend to cling to
moments such as Woods's comeback and the mesmerizing end of the
most recent Super Bowl. You cling because you understand this is an
era of mergers. And since that is the case, you know the games will
not be able to stand on their own without some influence from the
``real'' world.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing from that world that we, as sports fans,
would be wise to steal. Compassion. Thomas was not wearing a
seatbelt when he crashed his car. A third passenger in the vehicle
was, and he is alive today because of it. Bobby Phills exceeded 100
miles per hour when he lost control of his car and was killed in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, some sports fans _ writers included _ have talked about
this as if they were discussing a controversial call on third and
3. Should Thomas have been wearing a seatbelt? Yes. Should Phills
have been speeding? No. But I imagine that their families know
this, and that makes them grieve even more.
</P>
<P>
   A couple days ago, I received an e-mail from a Boston sports fan
who is attending school in Maryland. He wanted to know how I, as a
sportswriter, felt about the current trend in sports. He noted that
legends such as Bud Collins and the late Shirley Povich didn't have
to wade through so much sadness to cover the sports news of the
day. He asked if I were disappointed that I have to write about
spousal abuse, murder, and men and women dying before their time.
My answer?
</P>
<P>
   I am a sports fan. All of that is part of the sometimes
unsettling package.

 &HT;    Football argument behind slayings?
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A barroom squabble that ended in the deaths of two
Decatur men and murder charges against NFL star Ray Lewis may have
started over football.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Lollar, grandmother of one slaying victim, said Tuesday
she was told the argument that erupted in the Cobalt nightclub was
about football players. Richard Lollar and his friend Jacinth Baker
were stabbed to death two blocks from the club.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, an All-Pro middle linebacker with the Baltimore Ravens,
has been in the Atlanta jail since Jan. 31, accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Lollar said her grandson, Baker and several of their
friends from Akron, Ohio, were celebrating the Super Bowl at
Cobalt, a trendy club on East Paces Ferry Road.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar's friends gave his grandmother this account of what
happened:
</P>
<P>
   After Lollar, Baker and their friends left Cobalt, ``They were
at the tail end of everything, like a crowd of people. The guys
jumped out of a limousine on them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her grandson and his friend didn't realize their
attackers had knives.''
</P>
<P>
   At least six people jumped from the stretch limo and began
attacking Baker, Joyce Lollar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody out there started fighting,'' she said. ``My
grandson wasn't involved in the fight. All I heard is he was just
trying to keep peace, just trying to calm everybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lollar said the people she spoke to are wary of talking to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be frank. People are afraid,'' she said. ``We just
keep hoping and praying whoever did it gets punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lollar's friends are not the only ones who are not
talking to police.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, has not spoken to homicide investigators since they
handcuffed him Jan. 31 at his attorney's Gwinnett County home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came over here with an arrest warrant last week and they
took him and I told him, 'Don't say a word to them,''' said lawyer
Max Richardson, a member of Lewis' defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Lewis may start talking to police if he is
granted bond. Last week Municipal Court Judge Elaine Carlisle
denied bond after Lewis appeared before her. Another hearing is set
for Monday in Fulton County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could cooperate, but we want some cooperation in
return,'' Richardson said Tuesday. ``Our main goal is getting our
client out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Lewis called him the afternoon after the Super
Bowl and said: ``Max, I missed my flight. I've been followed by the
police. I want to cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(I told him) come to my house. We'll talk. We'll do the right
thing,'' the attorney said. ``We sat down for four to five hours
and talked. I called a homicide detective and said, 'Ray is in my
house. We'll give you a statement.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though Atlanta investigators were armed with a search warrant
when they arrived, Richardson said police did not look through his
house. ``All they wanted was Lewis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have since said they want to talk to Lewis' longtime
friend Kwame King and former University of Maryland football player
A.J. Johnson. Investigators say they believe the two men were with
Lewis in the limo.
</P>
<P>
   King, who has been staying in an Atlanta hotel, told The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution on Tuesday: ``All I can say is that Ray Lewis
is innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who grew up across the street from Lewis in Lakeland,
Fla., said he has hired an attorney. He sounded distressed and
tired and would not elaborate on what happened outside Cobalt. King
is enrolled at Florida A&AMP;M University in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has said he wasn't even in Atlanta on Super Bowl
weekend. He said police interviewed him last week and he has since
hired an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, WBAL -TV in Baltimore reported that a key witness in
the case identified from photographs two men who did the stabbing.
The witness told police Lewis did not stab anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The TV station also reported that the two stabbers got into the
limousine, sat behind the driver and told him where to go as they
talked about the killings. The station did not identify the ``key
witness'' and did not name the source of the information.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta investigators with the Criminal Investigations Division
have said their key witness is Duane Fassett, the chauffeur of the
Lincoln Navigator limousine that carried Lewis and his friends as
they celebrated during Super Bowl weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator said Tuesday that Fassett is familiar with the
limousine passengers' faces, but not their names.
</P>
<P>
   Don Samuel, another of Lewis' attorneys, said lawyers questioned
``six or so'' of the people who rode in the limo and each said
Lewis was not involved in the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Lollar says she and her family want answers. ``Sunday was
the first day we could actually eat,'' she said. ``I have been
reading everything I can get on the Internet about these murders.
Right now we're trying to decide whether we should leave Richard's
pictures out or put them away.''

SOUTH AFRICA TO EXPAND PRIVATIZATION TO ATTRACT INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Eager for more foreign investment,
South Africa is promising to expand privatization in coming months
to its biggest state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   This effort, which had focused on restructuring and selling
smaller assets owned by the government, will now be aimed at
electric, transportation, telecommunications and military hardware
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the companies _ Eskom, Transnet, Telkom South
Africa and Denel, respectively _ are valued between $16 billion and
$20 billion and employ roughly three-quarters of the people working
for state enterprises. Many of their operations lose money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government can't continue to bear the cost,'' said
Katharine Butt of Business Map, an economic research firm. ``It's
putting a strain on the country, and it's not encouraging to
foreign investors to see how those parastatals are being run as an
example of how South Africa is being run.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to make the country attractive to those investors,
President Thabo Mbeki said in his state of the union message last
weekend that a team of blue-chip international financiers would
serve as advisers to the government. The newly created
International Investment Council will include the financier George
Soros; the chairman of Mitsubishi, Minoru Makihara, and
DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Juergen E. Schrempp. The advisers will
guide the government as it works to speed privatization.
</P>
<P>
   After some difficult years, South Africa's economy has been
drawing encouraging reviews in the last few months from investors
and analysts who welcome the declining inflation rate and improved
fiscal discipline. With an accelerated privatization effort,
economic policy-makers hope to build on that success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cornerstone of the policy path they've embarked
upon,'' said professor Ben Smit, director of the Bureau for
Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch. ``If you want
to see sustained growth, growth beyond that 3 or 3.5 percent
ceiling, privatization is going to be important.''
</P>
<P>
   The planning for the country's post-apartheid economy had
envisioned an important role for privatization. But progress has
been far slower than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Sivi Gounden, director-general of the country's public
enterprises department, said in an interview: ``Having reviewed our
efforts on restructuring and privatization over the past four
years, we felt that any acceleration needed to target the big four
enterprises. If you look at the services those enterprises provide,
the number of people they employ and the capital they require, it's
clear why.''
</P>
<P>
   The reach of these companies extends beyond South Africa into
much of the southern part of the continent, and the effects of
their restructuring will ripple across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Telkom is likely to be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
by next year, and Eskom, or one of its eventual spinoffs, may be
listed as well. Already, Telkom and South African Airways, a
Transnet subsidiary, have sold minority stakes to foreign
investors. And by the end of March, the government will firm up its
blueprint for drawing capital to the big state companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues it is grappling with are the considerable debt
carried by some state enterprises, burdensome regulations and the
prospect of large-scale layoffs in a country with severe
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere are these issues more pronounced than at
Transnet, the vast web of government-run transportation operations,
which is more than $4 billion in debt. To attract investors, some
of that debt will almost certainly have to be assumed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Spoornet, Transnet's money-losing rail subsidiary, is one reason
the debt has increased. Last week, the government announced plans
to sell one of Spoornet's more attractive lines. But as in many
parts of this privatization process, it will probably take changes
in regulations to convince potential investors that the rail line
can be profitable. Current rules favor road transport of freight.
</P>
<P>
   Union reaction to the privatization plans is a politically
sensitive matter. Last week, the Congress of South African Trade
Unions organized demonstrations to draw attention to the loss of
jobs in the South African economy, a problem to which Spoornet
could soon be contributing.
</P>
<P>
   The Spoornet restructuring plan has proposed laying off as many
as 27,000 workers to make the rail company profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in our mind that there is a need for
restructuring,'' said Mukoni Ratshitanga, the trade union congress
spokesman. ``But whether that restructuring should mean
privatization, or bringing in an equity partner, or revamping the
institution, are things that need to be analyzed case by case. You
can't just make a blanket commitment.''

BONFIRE-ALCOHOL INVESTIGATION ON HOLD PENDING COMPLETION OF MAIN
INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
 (This is the story budgeted as A&AMP;M-BONFIRE) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state investigation into the source of alcohol consumed by
underage workers on the night of Texas A&AMP;M bonfire collapse is on
hold until the commission created by university completes its
inquiry, a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission investigator said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told them we're not going to get in their way,'' said
Randy Field, a TABC investigator. ``I think they're looking at the
alcohol subject pretty closely, but their concerns, while related
to ours, are a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   The TABC's investigation was sparked by toxicology reports that
showed that two of the 12 who died _ Jerry Don Self of Arlington
and Jeremy Frampton of Turlock, Calif., _ were intoxicated and that
a third victim had a trace amount of blood alcohol. Those tests
were disputed by the families of Self and Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   A second series of toxicology tests showed dramatically lower
blood alcohol contents for the two, but showed they were still
legally intoxicated. Brazos County Justice of the Peace George
Boyett launched an inquiry because of the discrepancies in the two
tests, but said it is still not complete.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nov. 18 collapse, which killed 12 and injured 27, the
Alcoholic Beverage Commission has made little progress in learning
who provided the alcohol to students.
</P>
<P>
   But revelations, such as one this month that Frampton had a beer
in his pocket when he died, indicate alcohol was an issue, Field
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one more thing that shows alcohol was out there a little
more than some people want to admit,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   The alcohol issue is related to proper supervision at the
bonfire site, which is one of the areas the bonfire commission is
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released by the university on Tuesday showed that a
1990 bonfire evaluation of alternative sites for the annual event
recommended two locations over the polo field, where two
under-construction stacks have collapsed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A May 21, 1990, memo from John Koldus, the vice president of
student services to then-university president William H. Mobley,
recommended keeping the bonfire at Duncan Field and stressed the
need for university oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major concerns associated with bonfire in recent
years is that we exercise an even greater control over the
construction of bonfire,'' Koldus wrote. ``Moving bonfire to an
even more remote location would make it more difficult to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire commission created by Texas A&AMP;M is working under a
March 31 deadline to finish its inquiry, but the commission's staff
in a weekly update warned that goal may be difficult to reach.
Interviews with 250 people and delays in engineering analysis could
push that date back, the update said, and will likely raise the $1
million budget set by the university.
</P>
<P>
   One consultant, Kroll Associates, which is conducting interviews
and organizing much of information gathered, has already been
allocated $450,000, by the commission, the update said.

<P>
   While the twin sons of Violet and Adam Graves fought for their
lives, there was no moratorium of outward grace from this most
generous of families.
</P>
<P>
   Before the premature birth of his sons, Adam Graves had taken an
interest in a teen-ager from Westchester County who had lost his
limbs to a rare virus.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, as it turned out, was a huge fan of Martin Brodeur, the
goaltender of the Devils. The rivalry was of no matter. Eight
nights ago, Graves made sure the boy got to meet Brodeur in the
visiting clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   This gesture was not some isolated good deed performed in the
crucible of a fearful crisis. This was the way the Graves family
has lived for at least two generations, taking in homeless children
from the streets and shelters of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   No publicity was sought, not then, not now, since Jaxon Graves,
the smaller of the twins, died Tuesday night, after only 25 days.
Logan, his larger brother, is said to be improving.
</P>
<P>
   As he played hockey and performed kind acts during this terrible
time, Adam Graves pondered the perseverance of his two little boys,
born two months too soon, Jaxon slightly under 2 pounds, Logan
slightly above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam said the doctors told him they had never seen a child
fight like this,'' a friend of the family said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a hockey term he has heard a time or two himself, Graves
called his two sons ``scrappers.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are used to battling. The public would never learn
their names if professional athletes had not shown courage at an
early age. Athletes learn they can overcome. Sometimes this history
of overcoming gives athletes a false sense of security, a grandiose
sense of their own powers that leads them to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Thomas, who played linebacker for the Kansas City
Chiefs, was a paragon of aggression on the field and decency in his
real life. One day last month he did not fasten his seat belt while
driving in foul weather, and his vehicle crashed. A friend who was
not buckled died quickly. A friend who used his seat belt walked
away from the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Thomas, who had planned to walk again, died suddenly in
a hospital while going for a therapy session. Even his all-star
resourcefulness could not pull him through. No matter how many
times it happens, the public always seems to be shocked when an
athlete dies young, but the reality is, there are no promises.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors made no promises to Violet and Adam Graves, either.
But Logan began to gain an ounce here, an ounce there. Jaxon's
victories were temporary.
</P>
<P>
   The father, who has come back from broken bones and ugly
bruises, understood this would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   This courage of the two little boys will be something to
remember as the family pulls together for the private grief, the
private ceremonies. The Rangers, who admire Graves even more for
his private life than for his ferocious hits in the corners, wanted
to surround the family, to emphasize the sorrow on the broadcasts
of Tuesday night's game in the Garden, but the couple asked the
Garden for one brief mention, and nothing more. No moment of
silence, no flowers, no patches. They are modest, and they are in
pain, and they did not want anybody to make a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for people to accept that something this gratuitous
could happen to these fine people. All the players, all the
writers, all the fans who have paid attention understand that Adam
Graves is one of the best people they have come across. They have
seen Violet Graves at the games when she could get a sitter for
their daughters, Madison and Montana. Just about everybody
understands this is a close family. And everybody knows the stories
of the children that Graves' parents took in.
</P>
<P>
   Now this family that has cared for so many children must deal
with going back to the hospital and seeing one incubator where
there used to be two. But in its own sad, unpredictable way, life
will go on.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 19 in Scarsdale, N.Y., there will be a fund-raiser for a
7-year-old girl, Julianne Borsella, who is battling cancer. The
main attraction is supposed to be Adam Graves signing autographs to
raise money for medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Rob Ingraham, a family friend, asked Graves if he
wanted to cancel his appearance, only 10 days away. No way, Graves
said. And he wants to take 4-year-old Madison with him, so she will
understand what others go through. The Graves family has always
extended beyond blood lines, and in a time of grief, it still does.

INITIAL FAILURE DIDN'T CAUSE JET CRASH, INVESTIGATORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The initial problem with equipment that keeps a
plane level, which led an Alaska Airlines jetliner to a harrowing
drop of more than a mile, was not the problem that triggered the
plane's second, fatal dive, air safety investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the second dive the jet, an MD-83 with 88 people aboard, fell
out of the sky so fast that people on board were pushed toward the
ceiling at three times the normal force of gravity, said James E.
Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
based his comments on information from the flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said radar showed that some parts might have fallen
off the plane at about the time it began its second dive. He added
that the Navy had been dispatched to search for wreckage in an area
about four miles from the main debris field in the Pacific Ocean,
about 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have already pulled up parts of the tail from the
main wreckage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great to find a piece of the elevator,'' said one
person involved in the search, referring to a part on the tail that
might have come loose and caused the final dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the piece may be only one or two square feet of metal, and
if it is lying flat on the bottom it will be very difficult to
find, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, Alaska Airlines Flight 261, was flying to San
Francisco and then to Seattle from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, when it
crashed on Jan. 31 while trying to make an emergency landing at Los
Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers quickly found both flight recorders and most of the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The crew had radioed to mechanics on the ground asking for help
in troubleshooting a problem with the stabilizer, which makes up
about two-thirds of the horizontal tail, because they could not
adjust it to the proper trim to give the plane the desired nose-up
or nose-down angle.
</P>
<P>
   But even before information from the flight data recorder was
available, aviation experts said that stabilizer trim problems did
not make planes crash. Trim problems are so common that most are
never reported beyond the airline where they occur, safety experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   On Flight 261, the stabilizer had apparently been shifting
gradually toward a full nose-down attitude. ``The stabilizer moves
only in one direction, when we see it, which is nose down,'' said
Dr. Bernard S. Loeb, the board's director of aviation safety,
referring to what happened on the Alaske Airlines plane. And then
the stabilizer abruptly swung the rest of the way, making the plane
drop from its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet to about 24,300
feet, more that three times the rate that airliners usually
descend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the crew was able to regain control by moving the
elevators, the movable surfaces at the rear third of the tail,
about half their maximum travel distance.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear from the board's comments Tuesday how much
control was left with the stabilizer pointing full down. The crew
experimentally lowered the flaps and the slats, devices on the wing
that are used in landing, probably to see if they still had
control, and then retracted them without a problem. But soon after
they extended the flaps and slats a second time they lost control.
</P>
<P>
   The board also included in its briefing, without elaboration,
the fact that the crew had switched the autopilot on soon after
takeoff, but then flew the plane for an hour and 53 minutes without
it. Aviation experts said that this could indicate that the crew
recognized a problem with the stabilizer soon after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The data released Tuesday raises a number of questions for
investigators. One is that pilots are trained to intervene promptly
if a stabilizer begins an uncommanded movement and shut it down.
This crew already knew it had a problem with the stabilizer, yet it
failed to catch it when it began its final movement _ or was unable
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether there was any unusual movement in
the stabilizer in the early phases of the flight or on the inbound
flight, from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta.

 &HT;    High school remembers Thomas as a man ``doing the right thing''
 &HT;    By Michael Berger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It's a bittersweet memory now, but South Miami High
School Athletic Director James Colzie still jokes about sitting
Derrick Thomas on the bench during his high school basketball
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a smart move, huh?'' he asked rhetorically on
Tuesday, just hours after learning the Kansas City Chiefs
linebacker died of cardio-respiratory arrest at nearby Jackson
Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Colzie's office is quite cluttered, filled with old yearbooks
and newspaper clippings of South Miami athletes in the last 29
years. Colzieput his finger on a picture of Thomas, his head in his
hands, at the end of the Cobras bench some 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Colzie smiles. When remembering Thomas, that's all he seemed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has lost a good person, one who was dedicated and
determined and always strived for perfection,'' Colzie said of
Thomas, who had spent the last month in a hospital after being
paralyzed in a car crash. ``It's so hard to describe ... a
33-year-old young man in the prime of his life. Everybody remembers
Derrick Thomas getting after the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to South Miami faculty members, Thomas was more
unassuming _ but equally as striking _ in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him being very quiet and very sweet,'' said Ann
Jacobs, Thomas's high school English and reading teacher. ``It's so
sad because so many athletes today are being apprehended for doing
the wrong thing, and this young man spent his life trying to do the
right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has a legacy, it would be to remember his sweet spirit
and his kindness and gentleness towards others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a phenomenal kid,'' said Donald Reinhofer, who
coached Thomas in track and taught his industrial arts class in
1983. ``Seems like this stuff always happens to really good kids.
He always did for other people, never worrying about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinhofer said Thomas qualified for the state track meet in a
number of different events, and anchored one of the area's top
relay teams.
</P>
<P>
   Most current South Miami students weren't even born when Thomas
terrorized quarterbacks and touched lives in the early 1980s. But
in spite of the generation gap, Colzie said students flooded his
office on Tuesday, asking if the news was true.
</P>
<P>
   One South Miami senior wrestler, Gabe Estopinan, even painted a
portrait of Thomas after learning that he also wrestled during his
high school athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   The painting now hangs high in Colzie's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a part of Derrick Thomas,'' Colzie said. ``I knew
Derrick deep down inside, and everyone who knew him said he always
talked about South Miami Senior High School.''
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the portrait, Colzie flips through one of those
yearbooks. He found Thomas's senior picture and smiled once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was a great athlete, but we didn't know anything
about Derrick being a star,'' Colzie said.
</P>
<P>
   On the football field, that is.

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS' DERRICK THOMAS DEAD AT AGE 33 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM TEICHER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Only days after he was released from
intensive care and given passes to leave the hospital because he
was progressing so well, Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas died
Tuesday as he was on his way to rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 33, died at 9:10 a.m. CST at Jackson Memorial Hospital
in Miami after going into cardio-respiratory arrest. Thomas was
being transferred from his hospital bed to a wheelchair when he
told his mother that he wasn't feeling well and his eyes rolled
back, neurosurgeon Frank Eismont said. Extensive efforts to revive
him were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had not determined the exact cause of death, but one of
Thomas' doctors, Barth Green, said a massive blood clot called a
pulmonary embolism was the most likely cause of Thomas' death.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Tuesday, but an hour-long
candlelight vigil is scheduled for 6 Wednesday night on Lot D at
Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done so much for this team and our city during the time
that he had with us,'' said Chiefs president and general manager
Carl Peterson. ``He had so much love for the game, for his
teammates and for our town....A light has gone out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who sustained paralyzing spinal cord injuries in an auto
accident Jan. 23 in Kansas City, had been upgraded to good
condition and had begun his rehabilitation last week, making his
sudden death all the more shocking. He had received visits from
teammates and from former Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dark day, a very dark day,'' Chiefs owner and founder
Lamar Hunt said from his office in Dallas. ``But I don't want to
put it in terms of the franchise because it's a whole lot more than
that. It's a loss for the Thomas family and for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was in Miami recovering from spinal cord injuries
received in a Jan. 23 auto accident in Kansas City that left him
without movement from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., Missouri and Chiefs flags outside the club's Arrowhead
Stadium offices were lowered to half-staff immediately after word
of Thomas' death. The Missouri legislature paused for a moment of
silence after his death was announced by state Sen. Bill Kenney, a
former Chiefs quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   A steady flow of fans came by the stadium, some wearing No. 58
Chiefs jerseys in honor of Thomas, to leave flowers, balloons,
signs and other signs of affection.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs of people struggling to cope with Thomas'
death. A normally composed Peterson paused at times to gather
himself while speaking with the media. His remarks were followed by
those from somber coach Gunther Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the mood of the day was best expressed by Leigh
Steinberg, Thomas' agent and friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a surrealistic quality to all of this,'' Steinberg
said by phone from his office in California. ``Yes, I understand
what the doctors said. I understand intellectually what has
happened here. But emotionally, I sure don't get it yet. It's going
to take some time. It just hasn't sunk in.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson and Thomas had an unusual relationship for a general
manager and player. They were extremely close, and they often _
partly in jest but with a good measure of seriousness _ referred to
themselves as father and son.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who wore a No. 58 button on the lapel of his suit
coat, returned to Kansas City on Monday night from Miami after a
visit with Thomas. He was headed for Miami again immediately after
his news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upbeat, he was positive, he was Derrick,'' Peterson
said of his most recent visit. ``I know he had the best medical
assistance possible. I know these things do happen unfortunately
with people who have had an accident like Derrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said Thomas' mood was in contrast to a previous visit
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was flat, he was immobile, he wasn't in a good way,''
Peterson said. ``(Monday), when we got there, he was in (physical)
therapy. I stepped out into the hall. Coming down the hall is
Derrick Thomas, in a wheelchair but upbeat. I said, `Son, you're
mobile.' He said, `Father, I am. I've got wheels.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said Thomas had been planning to make a public
statement soon, thanking fans for their support.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he called Thomas from Atlanta recently when he
was there for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't doing real well at the time,'' Cunningham said.
``Derrick said, `Coach, be strong.' He never told me how strong I
needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the Chiefs' No. 1 draft pick in 1989, played 11 NFL
seasons, all in Kansas City. He was one of the top players at his
position for much of that time. He made the Pro Bowl in his first
nine seasons and is ninth in the NFL in all-time sacks, with 126
and one-half.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also was well-known for his work in the community. He
founded the Third and Long Foundation, which promotes literacy
among Kansas City's youth. He also was involved over the years in a
number of businesses, a roofing company being his latest venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy transcended the football field,'' Peterson said.
``What he gave to this community, I don't think you can measure in
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to be three things in life. He wanted to be the
greatest linebacker that ever played. I think he came pretty darn
close to that. He tried to be the best businessman he could be. I
know how hard he worked at that. He also wanted to be the biggest
philanthropist, the biggest charity-giving guy there was. He did
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of Kansas City, all of the National Football
League and all of America should be extremely proud of this young
man. Thirty-three years is not long enough, but he did accomplish
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, who has several of the NFL's highest-profile players
as his clients, also said he was impressed with Thomas' off-field
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never met an athlete who has as strong a vision in
terms of how he could make an impact on the world,'' Steinberg
said. ``It's the Derrick Thomas standing next to President Clinton
on Memorial Day, speaking for all children of deceased veterans,
that we'll remember. It's the Derrick Thomas whose commitment to
children's literacy was so profound that we'll miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Elnora Tellis-Jefferson, the sister of fellow crash victim
Michael Tellis, said Thomas' friends and family were overwhelmed
with sadness at the loss of the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all sitting here thinking and praying for both of these
mothers who lost children, our mother and Derrick's,'' she said.
``Our entire family _ having lost our loved one _ has hearts filled
with great sympathy for Derrick's mother and his family upon his
passing. Our mother prayed for Derrick every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellis-Jefferson said her brother and Thomas were ``the best of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The third passenger in the car crash, John Hagebusch of Raymore,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' survivors include his mother, Edith Morgan; his
grandmother, Annie Adams; three sisters; and four brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to make contributions in Thomas' memory are
encouraged to send donations to Third and Long, his foundations.
The address is Third and Long, 1627 Main St., Suite 404, Kansas
City, MO 64108.

</HEADLINE>

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was telling to hear John McCain proclaim his
impatience with President Clinton's last State of the Union
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``A two-hour marathon,'' McCain said dismissively, promising
reporters that should he be elected president he would keep the
ritual address to Congress to a crisp 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you should do is give a vision for America,'' he
said, ``not give a laundry list that looks like a Chinese menu with
one from column A and one from column B.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he likes that,'' he said, ``because he's a policy
wonk.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain by contrast is not a policy wonk, at least when it comes
to domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   While the Arizona senator can speak in great detail about
unneeded weapons systems or his theories of containing rogue state
dictators, he seems less fluent on the issues that were not his
Senate specialties _ like health care or the environment or
education.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago McCain sometimes used the words Medicare
and Medicaid interchangeably, mixing up the federal health
insurance programs for the elderly and for the poor. He has since
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   And it is instructive that his pledge to audiences that he would
never be guided by opinion polls but would always act ``on
principle'' applies only to national security matters. On domestic
affairs, McCain says it would be helpful to use polls to find out
what Americans want.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite McCain's reliably conservative voting record in
his 17 years in Congress and his image as a reformer, his ideas on
domestic matters sometimes seem far from fixed or fully developed.
Although he has declared war on pork barrel spending and continues
to call for an overhaul of the system of unlimited donations to
political parties, he has yet to explain how his vision of
conservative reform would translate into a comprehensive domestic
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, McCain seems caught between his desire to help
people solve big problems and his natural instinct as a
conservative Republican to find small-government solutions.
Occasionally when voters ask him about difficult social problems,
he pledges to gather ``the best minds in America'' to work toward
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   At other moments, McCain almost plays down the importance of
domestic matters when he says he is ``fully prepared to lead''
because of his experience in the military and his expertise in
national security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in McCain's command of foreign policy and
domestic policy shows on his free-wheeling campaign bus, where
reporters can question him all day long.
</P>
<P>
   He assesses world leaders and European defense capabilities with
gusto. But he was far less animated last month when reporters
pressed him at great length on whether he would stick to his vow
against Internet taxation if recession ever loomed or if so much
commerce moved to the Internet that states started seeing a decline
in sales tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a permanent ban on Internet taxation,'' McCain
finally said, when questions continued even after he said that
Internet commerce was expanding the economy, not cutting into other
sales. ``I cannot elaborate.'' He repeated that statement several
times in order to cut off the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   On another day he became impatient when quizzed closely over
when he views an issue as a state matter and when he sees it as a
federal concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting into the rarefied atmosphere here of the
academic Talmudian aspects of the role of the federal government,''
he said as reporters pressed him on federalism. ``I like to deal on
the level of the problems today.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he considers the lack of universal health care
coverage a pressing social problem, he shies away from a big
government solution, instead proposing tax-free savings accounts to
help some people buy insurance and saying that general tax cuts
would also help people buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every American should have access to health
insurance,'' he says. ``I can't force every American to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, this has mattered little in an insurgent campaign run on
a blend of character, biography and reform. ``What's driven the
McCain candidacy thus far is his story, his personality, not his
issue positions,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster
unaffiliated with any presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, voters virtually never point to any specific issue when
asked why they like him. Katie Koenen, 18, who waited until 3 a.m.
for McCain to arrive for a rally in South Carolina after he had won
the New Hampshire primary, proclaimed him ``more upfront'' than
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Avery, a retired bookkeeper who went to one of McCain's
New Hampshire town hall meetings, said simply, ``I think he's
truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences even seem appreciative when McCain admits he has some
learning to do. ``I don't claim to you to be an expert on this
issue,'' he told a group of young people demanding a solution to
global warming at one of his town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will all catch up to him is an open question. Bush
is beginning to point to his record as a governor to draw
distinctions with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand before you as a governor who led my state to
managed-care reform,'' Bush said Tuesday in Delaware. ``Some people
in Washington say we can't get anything done because of all the
lobbyists and special interests,'' he said, in a reference to
McCain. ``That's somebody who doesn't understand how to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the governor like Ralph Reed also note that McCain
has never unveiled a comprehensive education plan the way Bush has.
McCain had an education speech scheduled before the New Hampshire
primary but canceled it rather than shift the focus in New
Hampshire away from the tax cutting and Social Security debate.
</P>
<P>
   He advocates a test of school vouchers paid for by closing
corporate subsidies. And he speaks generally of giving merit pay to
teachers based on student performance. McCain has put forward plans
for Social Security, tax cuts, health care and the environment, but
even as he has done so, he has been hazy on the fine points of his
own proposals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain become the Republican nominee, he will face
Democrats who are already researching his voting record in order to
paint him as a Gingrich-style Republican out of step with
mainstream values.
</P>
<P>
   He embraced the Contract With America and voted with his party
on the budget and tax cut proposals of 1995 that would have made
$270 billion in savings in Medicare while granting $245 billion in
tax cuts. Democrats are also poised to run against his
anti-abortion votes and his votes against an assault weapons ban
and against the Brady bill's five-day waiting period for gun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for now McCain has managed to transcend ideology and appeal
to voters across a broad spectrum in part because his battle
against special interests does not fall neatly along the right-left
divide. Conservatives and liberals alike can warm to his promises
to ``give the government back to the people of the United States,
take it out of the hands of the special interests and the big money
and give it back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the polarizing social issue of abortion, McCain
constantly points to his 17-year record of anti-abortion votes in
Congress. Yet at the same time, his comments suggesting that he
would let his daughter decide whether to have an abortion have
created the impression among people on both sides of the question
that he is not committed to the cause. He later said that he had
misspoken.
</P>
<P>
   He tells audiences, ``Everyone _ pro-life or pro-choice _ has
the same goal, which is to eliminate abortion.'' He also says that
he would not use abortion as a litmus test in picking Supreme Court
nominees, but would look instead for judges who are strict
interpreters of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters last month, ``I don't think that anybody in my
personal opinion, who can say they adhere to the Constitution,
would have rendered the Roe vs. Wade decision.'' But he also said
he would consider judges as nominees not on one decision but on
their ``overall philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted for example that he continued to admire Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia even though he had dissented from a recent
decision upholding limits on campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   What adds to the enigma of McCain is that he sometimes seems to
be embarking on a new intellectual journey along the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   After years of voting for Republican tax cuts, McCain broke with
his party's supply-siders in this campaign and advocated that the
federal surplus be used for modest tax cuts and for shoring up
Social Security. He likes to point out that virtually no one at his
town hall meetings asks for a tax cut. And in New Hampshire at
least, the primary results suggest he had a better grasp of public
sentiment than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   When listener after listener in New Hampshire spoke of elderly
friends and relatives who could not afford prescription drugs, he
instructed his aides to draw up a federal-state block grant program
to help the older people pay for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is minuscule compared with Clinton's call to expand
Medicare to prescription drug coverage, but it does represent a
call by a self-proclaimed conservative for a new federal program.
</P>
<P>
   McCain likes to say that his many town hall meetings and
inquisitive audiences have helped him. ``I am a better candidate,''
he said one night, summing up the results of his 114 town hall
meetings in New Hampshire.

MAJOR E-COMMERCE WEB SITES ARE ATTACKED BY HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: This story has now been added to the New York Times front
page; it is developing and will be updated.)  
(bl) 
 By MATT RICHTEL with SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a series of attacks that opened a window on
the widespread vulnerability of the Internet, hackers Tuesday
mounted what appeared to be a coordinated siege on the world's
largest e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which began Monday with a three-hour assault by
hackers on Yahoo.com, one of the world's most popular Web sites,
continued Tuesday, temporarily crippling at least four other major
sites, including Amazon.com, eBay.com and Buy.com. By Tuesday night
it had spread to a leading media site, CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Buy.com, an online retailer, and the popular
auction site, eBay.com _ said they could not determine for certain
whether all the attacks were related or had been mounted by the
same person or persons.
</P>
<P>
   George Grotz, a spokesman for the San Francisco office of the
FBI, said: ``We are still in dialogue with Yahoo. We are aware of
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the attacks had been mounted by the same people,
Grotz said, ``I think it would be premature at this point to say
anything along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But security experts and the companies themselves said the
nature of the attacks seemed too similar to be coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the attackers used what is known as distributed
denial of service, a technique that basically hijacks dozens or
even hundreds or computers around the Internet and instructs each
of the highjacked computers to bombard the target site with
meaningless data. But attached to each packet of data is a request
for the victim site to send back a response. As the site's server
tries to accommodate all these phony requests, it soon runs out of
memory and other resources. As a result, its responses to real
customers slows to a crawl or cease altogether.
</P>
<P>
   While such attacks are not unusual, the intensity of these
attacks, as measured by the sheer number of computers thought to
have been hijacked for the effort, was virulent enough to bring
down e-commerce sites that are typically fortified enough to fend
off barrages of malicious data.
</P>
<P>
   An eBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said, ``We think it's
similar, but until we have all the evidence, we're not going to
jump to any conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said eBay became inaccessible to some customers around
3:20 p.m. Pacific Standard Time and was still struggling to thwart
the attack two hours later. He said the company had contacted Yahoo
and Buy.com to seek advice and assistance in defending its servers.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour assault on Buy.com started at 10:50 a.m. Pacific
time and the timing coincided with the company's initial public
offering of stock. In the first day of trading, its shares closed
at $25.125 each.
</P>
<P>
   A distributed denial of service attack does not give access to a
company's internal files or documents. Rather, it slows or
completely takes out the target Web site by bombarding it with a
meaningless stream of data from dozens, even hundreds of computers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Yahoo, the company said it was getting hit with
data from ``more than 50'' computers on the Internet. The company
said it was contacted Tuesday morning by the FBI in connection with
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Hawkins, chief executive of Buy.com, said the timing of the
attack on the day of the IPO was ``completely out of control,
needless to say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some people get in, '' he said, ``but in most cases,
people couldn't get into the site.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the site ``clearly lost revenue'' though he did not know
how much. ``We were hoping to see an increase in traffic because of
the IPO.'' The stock opened at $27 and traded as high as $35.
</P>
<P>
   John Vranesevich, founder of Anti Online, a Web site that
monitors computer security and hacking issues, said the preliminary
evidence suggested that the same hackers were responsible for each
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a denial of service attack, hackers hijack computers not
their own and use them to direct random streams of data at the
target, essentially causing the target machine to become
paralyzed. &QL;

LEAK IN COOLANT PIPE IS PROBABLE CAUSE OF ANTIMISSILE FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pentagon investigators said Tuesday that a leak in
a coolant pipe in a missile interceptor might have caused its
failure last month in a test critical to plans to create a national
missile defense system but that it was too early to determine if it
was the sole error.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a nitrogen gas leak, but whether or not that is why
we had a failure, we don't know,'' said a Pentagon official.
``There is no way we can say conclusively it was the only
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take until next month for the Pentagon's national
missile defense program to complete its investigation of the
failure. The Pentagon is considering delaying by two weeks a third
test to ensure that all the proper modificiations are made to the
system, which is expected to cost $12.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a slippage of maybe a couple of weeks,'' said
P.J. Crowley, a Pentagon spokesman. ``We hadn't fixed a specific
date for the test but it now will probably be mid-May.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the inquiry is whether the failure in the final six
seconds of the test on Jan. 18 can be attributed solely to a leak
in a pipe carrying frigid nitrogen gas that cools the infared
sensors. The missile-propelled interceptor was traveling on target
in the test over the Pacific Ocean toward the mock warhead when the
infrared sensors went blind and missed the target, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Repairing that pipe is simple, the equivalent of fixing a broken
radiator hose in a car, and would not require a major change in
design, said an official involved in the investigation. This cause
for the test failure was first reported in The Washington Post
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said Tuesday that
regardless of the cause of the failure, President Clinton would be
able to decide this summer whether to go ahead with the system to
defend against a limited nuclear missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are on track,'' he told the Senate Armed Service
Committee in testimony Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   European allies, as well as Russia and China, have opposed the
development of such a system, which is forbidden by the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is negotiating with Russia to amend the
treaty, but several leading Republican senators supporting the
missile system have joined with critics of the program to ask
Clinton to delay his decision on deploying the system until after
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is to recommend to Clinton in June whether the Pentagon
believes the missile defense system is ready for deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have emphasized that they are being asked to
create what has become the most sophisticated weapons system ever
on a ``rigorous schedule'' that allows for few failures.

<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ In the first contest after his bruising
defeat in New Hampshire a week ago, Gov. George W. Bush handily won
the Republican primary in Delaware on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With all 28 polling places reporting, Bush had 51 percent of the
vote, Sen. John McCain 25 percent and Steve Forbes 20 percent. Alan
Keyes had 4 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am honored by the vote,'' Bush told reporters in Columbia,
S.C., adding that he thought Delaware voters had responded to his
new message that he was the reform candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Wryly taking note of the publicity surrounding McCain's victory
in New Hampshire, he said, ``I'm confident that the news media will
put me on the cover of every one of the major news magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not campaign here, but he did at least as well as
Forbes, who spent much more time in Delaware than any other
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of voters indicated that McCain's victory in New
Hampshire helped him here, The Associated Press reported. Almost
half of his supporters decided to vote for him in the week since
that primary, the surveys showed, and a quarter of his supporters
had not voted in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters in Goose Creek, S.C., Tuesday night that
he was gratified by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing because, as you know, we didn't spend one
minute there, so we're very pleased,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he had promised voters in New Hampshire, jealous of
its distinction as holding the first primary, that he would not
campaign in Delaware so soon after their state's contest, he added,
``I told them in New Hampshire if I went through Delaware in
Amtrak, I'd pull down the shades.''
</P>
<P>
   In most respects, the Delaware primary was a sideshow to the
main events in New Hampshire last week and in South Carolina on
Feb. 19. With but 12 delegates at stake _ barely one-half of 1
percent of all the delegates to the Republican National Convention
_ and with only 28 polling places statewide, the race drew little
attention in the press, and until recently was treated as an
afterthought by the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes, who won the Delaware primary in 1996 when he was the
only candidate who campaigned here, began pouring resources into
the state, hoping to demonstrate that his candidacy was still alive
after his distant third-place finish in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he wrapped up a four-day bus tour of Delaware at a
retirement center. There, he made a pitch for the abolition of the
federal inheritance tax, which applies only to estates worth more
than $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be allowed to leave this world unmolested by the
IRS,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made a point of campaigning in every state, and Forbes'
effort forced Bush to allocate more time here than he might have
wished, given the emphasis he is placing on stopping McCain in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor had the support of most of the corporate and
political establishment, including the only two Republicans elected
statewide, Sen. William Roth Jr. and Rep. Michael Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent full days in Delaware on Friday and Monday. Before he
left for South Carolina Tuesday morning, he asked a group of
elderly voters in Wilmington to ``give me a chance to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   At every stop here, he chided McCain for skipping the state,
saying that anyone running for president should be willing to
campaign everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain never took the bait, just as he never campaigned in
the Iowa caucuses last month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interest in his candidacy grew in Delaware after his
smashing victory in New Hampshire last week. This week, a small
band of volunteers took it upon themselves to make phone calls to
encourage McCain supporters to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pick their delegates in caucuses next month, but
11,000 of the state's 200,000 registered Democrats voted in a
nonbinding primary on Saturday. Vice President Al Gore won with 57
percent of the vote, to 40 percent for former Sen. Bill Bradley.

ILLINOIS MULLS MILESTONE BILL ON REDRESS FOR BASHING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Illinois Legislature is considering what could
become the first state law in the country specifically tailored to
allow victims of wife-beating, gay-bashing and other violence based
on gender or sexual orientation to sue their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, modeled on an embattled federal statute, was
introduced in the state's House of Representatives on Monday with a
strong push from Gov. George Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Gender Violence Act in place, Illinois would become a
true pioneer, a state with an anti-violence law that empowers
victims,'' said Ryan, a moderate Republican often at odds with his
party's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sisters, wives and daughters,'' he said, ``as well as our
brothers, sons and friends, deserve the right to their day in court
if they are brutally victimized or threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would specifically empower the targets of
violence or threats motivated by gender or sexual orientation, or
by ``actual, perceived or attributed sex or gender role conformity
or nonconformity,'' to sue in the Illinois courts. It is likely to
pass the Democratic-controlled House but faces an uphill battle
against the state Senate's Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative organizations oppose the legislation. ``There is no
reason in the world to give preference to homosexuals,'' said Jack
O. Roeser, president of the Family Taxpayers Network, which
advocates family values and tort reform. Roeser said criminal law
already provided protection against such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Women's and gay rights groups praised the measure. ``There is
not another such bill, much less law, at the state level,''
declared Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization
for Women, who said NOW would like to see similar laws enacted in
each state. ``This is the first of its kind for civil damages for
gender- and sex-based'' crimes.
</P>
<P>
   And Patricia M. Logue, supervising attorney at the Chicago
office of the gay-rights Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund,
said: ``It creates one more set of disincentives to this kind of
conduct. It is a logical next step for our state,'' which already
has a criminal statute that strengthens penalties when an assault,
say, is judged a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   As for business groups, they are divided on the new legislation.
One organization against it is the Illinois Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not opposed to the concept,'' said Todd C. Maisch, the
chamber's vice president for government affairs, but ``the way we
look at it, it looks like it is intended for a victim of violent
crime to go after the deepest pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Maisch was referring to a provision that would allow victims to
sue not only their attackers but also any individual, group,
business or other institution responsible for the discrimination
that led to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, representing businesses
in and around the city, supports the bill. ``This gives an
individual an opportunity to sue the real perpetrator,'' said Jerry
J. Roper, the Chicagoland chamber's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While victims of assault can always sue under broadly worded
civil statutes, the thinking behind the Illinois legislation is
that a law specifically tailored to particular kinds of victims
gives them a better chance of prevailing at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Enactment would make Illinois the first state to adopt a law
modeled on the federal Violence Against Women Act, a 1994 statute
that, specifically tailored to assaulted women, allowed them to sue
their attackers in federal court. A challenge to the federal law is
now before the Supreme Court, a majority of which appeared
skeptical about the measure when arguments were heard on Jan. 11;
the justices seemed inclined to the view that jurisdiction ought to
lie in the states, not Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the Illinois bill would go further than the
federal law, because it would cover not only women as a whole but
specifically lesbians and also gay men, as well as those who, like
transvestites or transsexuals, are assaulted because of their
``sexual or gender nonconformity.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was drafted by the Governor's Commission on the Status
of Women, whose chairwoman, Judith A. Gold, said: ``We hope that
this serves as a model for other states. ``Violence against women
is not a partisan issue.''

 Jamie Malanowski's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman.  
 By JAMIE MALANOWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the '80s, presented with merger mania and junk-bond madness,
Hollywood produced movies like the polished ``Wall Street'' and the
glossy ``Working Girl,'' films about the nexus of big money and big
morality. Now the current Money Moment, this dot-com expansion, or
bubble, or souffle, or whatever it turns out to be, has its first
opus: ``Boiler Room.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Seth, a young man played by Giovanni Ribisi,
who, in a misguided effort to placate his demanding father, takes a
job as a broker trainee at a hip-deep-in-fraud Long Island
securities firm _ the overheated, testosterone-driven,
100-phone-line, folding table, boiler room operation of the title.
</P>
<P>
   It's a real New York movie, right from the opening, when we are
presented with the spectacle of a caravan of buses full of young
brokers, partying loud and hard to the accompaniment of an
avalanche of rap, invading a dark and deserted Lower Manhattan,
rolling through the sullen streets like Armani-clad Visigoths. What
is all the more remarkable about this sublime vision is that the
young man who directed the picture and wrote its screenplay was
doing both for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   He is Ben Younger, now 29, a native of Flatbush, graduate of
Queens College, current resident of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Perhaps
too aptly for someone of his name, the general impression one gets
from him is youthfulness, an excitement about what is happening to
him that is uncalculated and unfeigned, an almost carbonated
exuberance about how all the elements of his saga have come
together, a creaminess and a dreaminess.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he is all New Yorker, asphalt-educated and
gimlet-eyed and seemingly choosy about the blandishments that will
impress him.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictions between these character traits and the career
he has chosen almost naturally invite speculation about how they
will play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's a real sweetheart, isn't he, a real innocent,'' says Ron
Rifkin, the veteran actor who plays Seth's father in the film. Such
is Younger's ingenuousness that almost immediately the paternally
proud Rifkin gloomily adds: ``One hopes he'll stay that way. Of
course we're all corruptible.''
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is, of course, the story of ``Boiler Room,'' which
opens on Friday. Seth's desire to please his impossible-to-please
old man _ a judge both in occupation and in parenting style _
naively leads him to the boiler room, a bare-bones brokerage where
unscrupulous sellers make cold calls to pressure people into buying
dubious _ even nonexistent _ stocks.
</P>
<P>
   There he meets a crew of young men he identifies with and
idolizes, brash, aggressive and above all rich. He dedicates
himself to becoming one of them, and he does, but unlike them he
cannot very easily keep from questioning the deceitfulness he sees
all around him.
</P>
<P>
   Younger got the idea for the film when he interviewed for a job
and was one of a gaggle of slightly lost young men who were
promised the opportunity to quickly become millionaires by a boiler
room evangelist. ``Just like in the film,'' Younger recalls, ``a
guy said to me I could become a millionaire in two years, so I
went. Who wouldn't? That was my single visit to a boiler room. I
knew something was up. But I also knew there was a story there.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger could not find a boiler room that would let him observe,
so he spent a chunk of the next two years interviewing boiler room
brokers. ``I talked to 30 or 40 brokers from six or seven firms,''
he says. ``The thing that struck me about these guys from the
beginning is that they were living in this alternate reality. It's
not like these are guys running a three-card monte game on the
sidewalk. They know what they're doing and they're good at it, but
they know they're doing illegal things. But at the same time, they
sort of don't know. If you really made them look at it, I'm sure
that they'd realize. But the way they act on the job _ they're this
tight crew, there's a real sense of camaraderie, they're wearing
suits, they're driving expensive cars, they have an office _ `We're
stockbrokers!' As long as they don't look at the fact that all the
stocks go down, they're OK''
</P>
<P>
   In a decision both subtle and technically stylish, Younger lit
the scenes in the boiler room with a distinctive fluorescence,
underlining the ``alternate reality'' he found. ``These brokers
really have very skewed perspectives,'' he says. ``One of the first
guys I interviewed told me about all this illegal stuff he was
doing, all these illegal tactics. When he finished he said: `Just
do me one favor. Just use my real name.' I said, `You know, they
could actually use this film to incriminate you in a court.' He
said he didn't care. He just wanted the infamy. And that's what I
mean when I say they don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing the screenplay took a long time, mostly because Younger
kept being distracted by the inconvenient necessity of earning a
living. He worked as a grip, handling props and sets _ ``I was
doing a lot of rap music videos, 18-hour days were the norm'' _ a
tutorial that provided invaluable technical expertise but left
little room for creativity. (Before he was a grip, he was an aide
to Alan Hevesi, then an assemblyman and now the New York City
comptroller. But he never went to film school.)
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, he quit and took a job waiting tables at Steak
Frites on East 16th Street in Manhattan, where he caught a break
when he ran into an acquaintance who made corporate videos and who,
on the spot, guaranteed him enough work so that he could hang up
his apron and finish the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   After that, things went swimmingly for Younger. He put together
a short film (``L &AMP; M,'' about a nicotine-addicted con man),
acquired a Hollywood agent, interested producers in ``Boiler Room''
and found himself at New Line Cinema with a greenlit picture.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of the film are Team Todd, the sisters Suzanne and
Jennifer Todd, who are perhaps best known for producing the
``Austin Powers'' movies. ``I was immediately struck by the
writing,'' Jennifer Todd recalls. ``It was so powerful and
authentic. But what really attracted me was that the main character
was flawed. You'd think more writers would realize that in so many
of the great movies we remember, the hero is a flawed person, but
they don't. But Ben created a very compelling character in a
completely unique environment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So the screenplay was good; how easy was it to let Younger
direct? ``After we met him, and we saw his short, we had no problem
backing him to the studio,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Which, as it turned out, was not that hard a sell, once the
Todds managed to persuade Ben Affleck to play the role of Jim
Young, the boiler room's flashy, charismatic recruiter. Affleck
appears in only a few scenes, all but one of them near-monologue
star turns before the audience of impressionable broker wannabes.
In these scenes, Younger was, as he puts it, ``tippin' my hat to
David Mamet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Alec Baldwin in `Glengarry Glen Ross,''' he says. ``I
mean, when I saw that movie, I rewinded that scene five million
times.'' But it was more than his personal appreciation that
inspired these scenes. ``It wasn't just me knowing Mamet. It was
the boiler room guys knowing Mamet. These guys really do watch
`Wall Street.' They really do know every line in `Glengarry Glen
Ross.' They all loved that Alec Baldwin monologue. It wasn't a
stretch. And so when Jim Young gives that speech, yes, he's a great
orator, yes, he wants to convince those kids to come to work, but
he's also thinking, `Yes, I want to be Alec Baldwin.'''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck has the star turn, but he is not the only standout.
Giovanni Ribisi brings out all the sides of Seth's character,
showing him at different times to be confident enough to run his
own business, unsteady in the face of his father's scorn, cunning
enough to sell the stock, decent enough to feel ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel, Nicky Katt, Tom Everett Scott and, as the love
interest, Nia Long, are all convincing. ``We worked really hard on
the phone call scenes,'' Ribisi says. ``I really wanted to know
that I could sell. Seth goes through this progression where he
starts out as somewhat of an innocent, and then becomes this thing
that eats people alive over the phone. And Ben Younger was just so
great at making me feel I was doing that, at making me feel
confident. And I think that's because he was so confident, right
from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger says: ``I never told anyone this, but the first morning
of the first day on the set, I froze so bad. I mean froze, man! I
just turned around, and there were 30 people waiting for me to tell
them what to do, and I actually started to hyperventilate.''
</P>
<P>
   This was just one of a number of situations he credits Jennifer
Todd with rescuing. ``Jen knew something was up, and she just said:
`OK, everyone, can we just have five minutes? Ben wants to go over
this with the actor.' An hour later, I was off and running, full
speed ahead. I can't explain to you how scary that first thing was.
I just didn't know what to do for a second.'' Once the feeling
passed, Younger completed the shooting in 30 days and $300,000
under budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it wasn't his first movie, it would be a phenomenally
good picture,'' says Ribisi, who saw the film just before it played
at Sundance. ``You can sort of anticipate what people are going to
expect _ young MTV-generation director, everything's going to be in
your face. But the pacing and the rhythm are right on. There's all
these intense moments, but then he lets the picture breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger is working on another screenplay, a romantic comedy, and
he has written a television pilot about a football coach. He
desperately wants not to be pigeonholed, not a surprising thing to
hear from someone whose directorial idols are Woody Allen and
Michael Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is enjoying having more money and eating at a better
class of restaurants, he does not plan to give up his apartment in
Brooklyn; his friends in the industry are still the electricians
and grips he knew from before, and he really did not care for Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, everybody knows I'm Ben,'' he says. ``There, everybody
thought I was a `writer-director.' I was very happy to come back
and be with people who knew me. I like my new world, I just don't
want to go there alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger realizes, if grudgingly, that with a first-rate cast,
supportive producers and a largely hands-off studio, he enjoyed an
experience with ``Boiler Room'' that he can never replicate. ``I
kept hearing horror stories,'' he says. ``Everyone kept saying, `Be
prepared, you're not going to get what you want.' But basically the
studio came the first week, and when they saw I had everything
under control, nobody showed up for weeks. That's nice. And
unfortunately I'm used to it, because now I hear everyone saying:
`Don't ever expect to have a movie greenlit this fast. Don't ever
expect to have this much autonomy again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is my first movie!''

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The baritone Thomas Hampson would never call himself a
musicologist. He lacks the academic training and has too much
respect for the field to claim a place in it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for more than 10 years he has been part of a small team of
scholars doing important research into the songs of Gustav Mahler.
The work has already produced authoritative critical scores of
Mahler's complete songs in the versions for voice and piano,
published by Universal Edition, the house that brought out Mahler's
music in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, this comprehensive project will also
have produced critical editions of the complete songs in their
versions for voice and orchestra, including transpositions to
higher and lower keys, as well as orchestral study scores.
</P>
<P>
   Hampson, who will present recitals of Mahler's songs on Tuesday
and Thursday evenings at Carnegie Hall with the pianist Wolfram
Rieger, plays down his role in the project, which has primarily
been supervised by an Austrian musicologist, Renate Stark-Voit, a
Mahler scholar for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a sort of mascot,'' Hampson said recently at a
restaurant near Lincoln Center in Manhattan. ``I guess you could
call me the `Mitarbeiter,''' or collaborator, he added. Still, in
the Universal catalog the edition of the Mahler songs for voice and
piano, published five years ago, is called the Hilmar-Hampson
Edition (Hilmar having been Dr. Stark-Voit's surname in an earlier
marriage).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of fun,'' Hampson said. Most musicologists would
consider it much more than that. Having one's name on an important
new edition of works by a major composer could clinch tenure for a
teacher at a university.
</P>
<P>
   That Hampson would become so scholarly in midlife is not what
his background and early career suggested. Born in Elkhart, Ind.,
he was raised in eastern Washington State. His father was a nuclear
engineer; his mother, an accomplished organist, played at the
family's Seventh-day Adventist church.
</P>
<P>
   When he emerged in the 1980s, he attracted immediate attention
for his robust baritone voice and dashing stage presence. Then a
client of the powerful manager Herbert Breslin, Hampson was
promoted as a hunky, thick-maned, all-American opera star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were made by a lot of people at the time, including
me,'' he said. ``I came on so quickly. I underestimated how
in-your-face I can be sometimes, because of my own enthusiasm. But
that enthusiasm is born out of abject curiosity and a lot of
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his work in opera has won him greater popularity, his
devotion to the art song has earned him the gratitude of song
devotees and the respect of critics. At 44, he is an inquisitive
artist who champions songs by living composers, especially
Americans, and neglected repertory.
</P>
<P>
   A recent project is typical: Hampson sings the title role in a
new EMI Classics recording of ``King Roger,'' an ecstatic, late
Romantic and nearly forgotten opera from 1926 by the Polish
composer Karol Szymanowski. Set in the 12th century, it deals with
the attractions and dangers of Dionysian sensuality. Hampson
learned the role in the original Polish, a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   His involvement with Mahler deepened in the late 1980s, when he
performed and recorded several Mahler song cycles conducted by
Leonard Bernstein. ``I knew at the time that scholars were marching
through the works of Mahler, preparing critical editions for
publication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the Universal volumes of the symphonies and other works
the ``famous blue books.'' But, Hampson wanted to know, where were
the blue books for the songs?
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Stark-Voit heard Hampson perform in a Mahler festival
in Kassel, Germany, she said recently. Coincidentally, at the very
moment she recalled this _ while speaking by telephone from
Germany, where she was vacationing _ Hampson's voice was coming
over her radio, performing the role of Germont in the Metropolitan
Opera's live broadcast of Verdi's ``Traviata.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At that concert in Kassel, he interpreted the Mahler songs in
a manner that impressed me so very much,'' Stark-Voit remarked. ``I
said to myself, `This is the man I want to work with on the
critical edition.''' She met him that evening and explained the
scope of the project but also the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Mahler Gesellschaft, the Austrian society formed in the
1960s to promote Mahler's music and support research and
publication, was facing financial trouble, and Universal would
publish the works only with outside financing. Hampson was eager to
help, so Stark-Voit introduced him to Dr. Karl Heinz Fussl, a
respected, elderly scholar then supervising the research, who has
since died.
</P>
<P>
   Hampson offered to pay for an assistant to help Fussl and
Stark-Voit. But they wanted him to have a role in the research as
well. At first he was reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that I wasn't a musicologist, that I did not
deserve to sit at this table,'' Hampson said. But it proved
eminently helpful to have a singer involved with the work,
Stark-Voit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His point of view was different from that of actual
scholars,'' she explained. As they examined manuscripts together,
in places far and wide (including the Morgan Library in New York,
which owns several manuscripts), Hampson noticed things that many
scholars would have missed, Stark-Voit said. He was especially
struck by recurring divergences in the songs between their piano
and orchestral versions. Sometimes even notes in the vocal lines
and words in the texts are different.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery fortified the case for the most important finding
of the entire project, namely, that Mahler considered the versions
of the songs with piano, which were almost always composed first,
independent works, not just preliminary drafts of orchestral
conceptions. ``It was a new idea,'' Stark-Voit said, ``and he was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampson is quite convincing on the subject. Mahler was ``very
chastising to anyone who presumed that the process he followed in
composing his songs was one of filling in the piano parts with
orchestration,'' he said. Moreover, Mahler was an immensely
practical musician, attentive to performers' needs, flexible with
regard to transpositions and seldom fixed in his mind about whether
a particular song should be sung by a man or a woman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Hampson cites a letter Mahler wrote to Johannes
Messchaert, a Dutch singer and close colleague. Messchaert was
preparing a recital that he was going to perform with Mahler at the
piano.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote regarding two nettlesome problems, Hampson said.
``First, the key of the song `Das Irdische Leben' from `Des Knaben
Wunderhorn,' which was E flat minor, was too high for him. Second,
something troubled him about the vocal contour of the line `Wie
holen sie ein auf jenen Hoh'n! Im Sonnenschein!' from the fourth
song of `Kindertotenlieder.' The vowels necessary to sing the
German were not right at those pitches, he felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahler wrote back posthaste, Hampson said, telling Messchaert
not to worry about the key and offering to play ``Das Irdische
Leben'' in any key the singer wanted once they rehearsed. As to the
problematic vocal line, Mahler wrote that he would not change the
melody but could provide a different scan of the words.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter he scribbled a staff and notes offering an
alternative way of fitting the text to the melody in that phrase.
To Hampson, this was not the act of a composer who thought of the
piano versions of these songs as mere orchestral sketches.
</P>
<P>
   In his Carnegie Hall programs Hampson will sing the songs
Messchaert inquired about as well as some 30 others. The programs
include songs from ``Des Knaben Wunderhorn,'' the complete
``Kindertotenlieder'' and ``Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen,'' and
four of the Ruckert lieder.
</P>
<P>
   Although these works are best known in their orchestral
embodiments, Hampson's fondness for the piano versions is easy to
understand. While the orchestral versions bring Mahler's
incomparable sense of instrumental color and lush beauty to the
songs, the intricacies of the music arguably come through more
clearly in the versions with piano. Moreover, the singer is laid
bare, so the emotional content of the music can be even more
wrenching, though in an intimate way.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler never expected people to choose between the two. Nor does
Hampson. He simply wants to validate the versions for voice and
piano. As a de facto musicologist, he has helped provide
authoritative information about the music.
</P>
<P>
   The critical edition includes his English translations of
Mahler's performance directions, as well as explanatory comments by
Hampson in footnotes. To him, when Mahler writes that a phrase is
to be sung, say, ``with a breaking voice'' (in English
translation), it means something subtly different from when he
writes ``with a broken voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to tell anyone how to sing these songs,'' he
said. ``I just want singers to have a proper basis to make their
own decisions. Now they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampson's continuing involvement with Mahler research should be
easier now that he lives with his family in Vienna, in a newly
renovated apartment large enough to house his extensive collection
of scores, books and recordings. He was recently named a
Kammersanger of the Vienna State Opera, an honor infrequently
bestowed on Americans. ``Especially baritones,'' Hampson added
wryly. ``We take what we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   His career in opera proceeds excellently. He returns to the Met
in March to sing the title role in Rossini's ``Barbiere di
Siviglia.'' He feels that his voice has gotten stronger in recent
years, enabling him to enter ``into a new kind of tormented,
full-bodied lyric repertoire,'' as he put it: roles like
Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin and, in Vienna in 2002, the weighty
title role of Verdi's ``Simon Boccanegra.''
</P>
<P>
   He did his first Wagner role, Wolfram in ``Tannhauser,'' at the
Zurich Opera last spring, and he feels that his lyrical vocal style
is truer to the European tradition than the heave-ho approach that
has been so common. ``I think we have taken the big sound idea in
Wagner as far as humanly possible,'' he said. ``Maybe it's time to
pull back.''
</P>
<P>
   His explorations of song still seem to claim him the most. He is
rightly proud of ``To the Soul,'' a 1997 EMI album of 26 songs by
18 composers, all settings of poems by Walt Whitman, performed with
Hampson's frequent collaborator the pianist Craig Rutenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the composers are famous, like Ned Rorem; some are
obscure, like the Brooklyn-born William H. Niedlinger, who died in
1924. The idea was to entice listeners to consider the different
ways such wide-ranging composers treat Whitman's remarkable words.
</P>
<P>
   The glory of song is that it allows words and music to mingle:
what Hampson calls the ``dialogue of the poetry'' and ``the musical
comment.'' He knows that song recitals can be a hard sell for
audiences and that many people may come to his because he is a
famous opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' he said. ``I love cashing in whatever celebrity
I have, if people will turn out for a song recital.'' With his
Mahler recitals this week, audiences will get to hear the work of
Thomas Hampson the scholar as well as Thomas Hampson the songster.

MEXICAN POLICE RELEASE 654 ARRESTED IN RAID ON UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Moving swiftly to blunt protests against the
police occupation of the national university, Mexican justice
authorities announced Tuesday that they have freed 654 of the 745
people arrested in the raid Sunday that ended a nine-month student
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The federal police also began to return control of the
university to its administration, handing over at least five
schools or departments to their academic directors.
</P>
<P>
   Even though no one was hurt when the federal police charged into
the main campus and rounded up the strikers, the mere sight of
uniformed troops standing guard in the university has drawn outrage
from human rights groups, opposition leaders and intellectuals.
Their demands for the release of the prisoners and withdrawal of
the police have poured in to the Mexican news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This escalating violence has not left marks on the bodies of
any Mexicans, but it has injured our dignity,'' wrote a group of
university professors in a letter to La Jornada, a daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said 89 adults and 2 minors would remain in
jail because they faced criminal felony accusations separate from
the charge of illegal seizure of property for which they were
picked up on the campus. Some of the strikers are facing charges
for their role in a riot outside the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that the public at large strongly supports the
police operation to end the strike, after the university
administration yielded to almost all of the strikers' demands.
</P>
<P>
   While several buildings, like the nursing and medical schools,
suffered little damage, others inspected for the first time Tuesday
by university officials were a shambles.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the
American Museum of Natural History brings us face to face with
something commensurate to our capacity for wonder. Night and day,
astronomers, astrophysicists and weekend stargazers behold awesome
images of the unknown. Even reading about their exploits can give a
person goose bumps.
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers who care about architecture, the wonder won't be
limited to the star show. Even before the building opened, many of
us were rubbing our eyes in disbelief that it exists at all.
Designed by the New York firm Polshek Partnership, the planetarium
is an aesthetic apparition as well as a major civic event.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that a public building of such prominence could
arrive unburdened by the trappings of historical pastiche that have
suffocated New York architecture in recent decades? Is it possible
that an august institution like this, in a part of town notoriously
hostile to change, has produced a work of architecture?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe. Even harder to understand. Like a quasar, a
black hole or a subatomic particle, the planetarium defies easy
comprehension. But there it is, nonetheless: architecture, not the
theme park simulation of it that has distorted the cityscape for so
long like the convex lens on a rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rare instance where a time, a place, a function, an
architect and a client (the heroic Ellen V. Futter, president of
the museum) have come into perfect alignment to produce an
intelligent design that will also appeal to broad public taste.
It's like finding another world.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Center, on West 81st Street between Central Park West
and Columbus Avenue, replaces the Aztec Art Deco movie palace that
housed the Hayden Planetarium. The demolition of that delightfully
campy structure is one of this project's most welcome side effects.
It has dealt a blow to the preservationist mentality that has
gripped New York for 30 years to increasingly morbid effect.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your feelings about the old planetarium, you cannot
accuse the new one of lacking long-term historical memory. The
design is saturated with it. This is a mature modern building, a
structure unafraid of revealing the deep roots from which modern
architecture arose. The design's historical awareness far exceeds
that of buildings that merely ape period styles.
</P>
<P>
   The science museum is an Enlightenment concept. It derives from
Newton's revolutionary ideas about the physical laws of the
universe. In 1780-90, the French architect Etienne-Louis Boullee
designed a celebrated (but unbuilt) monument to Newton that remains
perhaps the greatest example of the desire to translate
Enlightenment values into architectural form.
</P>
<P>
   ``O Newton,'' wrote Boullee, ``as by the extent of your wisdom
and the sublimity of your genius you determined the shape of the
earth; I have conceived the idea of enveloping you in your own
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The design was an immense sphere, supported by a tiered
cylindrical base. Huge cuts in the base, inverted arches, allowed
views of the sphere's lower half. A planetarium occupied the
interior of the sphere. Stars were illuminated by sunlight shining
through small holes in the dome. Visitors would enter through
subterranean passages and emerge at a memorial to Newton built at
the base.
</P>
<P>
   Trees were to be planted along the perimeter of the cylinder, a
visual reminder that these abstract geometrical forms derive their
meaning from nature, or at least the 18th century's understanding
of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Natural History has essentially brought Boullee's
design to realization more than 200 years after it was conceived.
The basics are all here _ the sphere (87 feet in diameter,
contained within a 7-story, 95-foot-tall glass cube), the
planetarium, the structural base, and the counterpoint between
abstract geometry and organic form.
</P>
<P>
   In place of Newton's cenotaph, we have an extraordinary Zeiss
star projector rising from the center of the planetarium. Instead
of rings of trees, we have planted terraces and the nearby
landscape of Central Park. Nonetheless, the design transports us to
an era when physicists called themselves natural philosophers and
the United States was new.
</P>
<P>
   And it propels us into the architecture that emerged in the 20th
century as the built version of Enlightenment thought. Boullee did
not have glass, steel, electric light, air-conditioning or
prefabricated construction. The aesthetic treatment of these modern
materials and methods did not become commonplace until 1919, with
the appearance of the New Objectivity in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The pragmatic industrial vocabulary of that movement is the
basic language of the planetarium and other projects designed by
the Polshek office. Here, modern form is given the inflection of
Wallace K. Harrison, architect of the trylon and perisphere at the
1939 New York World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Time to look at the building designed by James Stewart Polshek
and Todd H. Schliemann, the principal architects. What we see on
approaching the Rose Center may well be the finest example of glass
curtain wall construction ever realized in the United States. Cheap
glass, poor craftsmanship and the compression of individual panes
by mullions and spandrels have done much to distort the image of
glass architecture. Here, we see glass as the transcendent material
envisioned by architects who pioneered its use in the early 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The glass is of the water white variety, so-called because it is
purified of the iron that gives most glass a greenish tint. It is
expensive glass, and looks it. Resilient gaskets join the panels;
thus there is little buckling or distortion in the reflections. The
transparent skin vividly reveals the structure that supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Made of vertical trusses as thin as Gothic tracery, the
structure evokes comparisons once drawn between glass architecture
and medieval cathedrals. The soaring trusses counteract the cube's
tendency to look squat.
</P>
<P>
   The architects must have been looking at recent glass
architecture in Europe. The glazed edges of the cube's roof line
show the influence of Jean Nouvel's dazzling Cartier Foundation in
Paris. Along with the glass' uncommon purity, the transparent edges
prevent the structure from hardening into the stonelike solid that
diminishes the lightness of the typical glass tower.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Truman Capote writes about the dusk in Central Park
falling like blue flakes. No New York building has ever taken
better advantage of the blue hour. Picking up reflections from the
sky, the trees, the buildings along 81st Street and the yellow
light framed by their windows, the glass turns into a box full of
mood indigo.
</P>
<P>
   One must keep that ball-in-a-box picture in mind on entering the
building. The scale of the interior does allow the entire sphere to
register on close inspection. This is initially deflating. We're
used to buildings whose interiors expand dramatically beyond the
expectations created by their exterior scale.

WRITER DEBORAH LAAKE, 47, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN STANLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Deborah Laake, a former Phoenix journalist whose
fiery style and brutally honest prose won numerous awards, died
Sunday at her South Carolina home. She was 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other journalists talk about truth, but Laake was dedicated to
it,'' said longtime friend and colleague Michael Lacey, executive
editor of Phoenix New Times. ``In many ways, her writing served as
a beacon to other journalists to show how timid they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues remembered Laake as a driven, dedicated journalist
with a larger-than-life personality and an infectious, staccato
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Laake, who had battled breast cancer since
1994 and was being treated for depression, had taken her own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laake was a very talented writer who was also a troubled
soul,'' author and television personality Jana Bommersbach said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Laake won the Arizona Press Club's top prize, the Virg
Hill Print Journalist of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Laake's 1993 book, Secret Ceremonies: A Mormon
Woman's Intimate Diary of Marriage and Beyond, that created a
national sensation, remaining for 16 weeks on the New York Times
bestseller list. It was a shockingly candid account of Laake's
upbringing as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints and her later rebellion against the church. Laake detailed
some of the church's temple rites in her book, angering many church
members. Others praised her for revealing little-known aspects of
Mormon culture.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the book's publication, Laake was excommunicated
from the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   Bommersbach said Laake's was the best interview she'd ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deborah was very straightforward, very honest and very
funny,'' Bommersbach said. ``We were talking about all these taboo
subjects, and she really opened up her heart and soul when she
talked about her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret Ceremonies is painfully honest. In it, Laake revealed
embarrassing details of her personal relationships and wrote
candidly of her stint in a mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said her book was a brave thing to do, noting that she
completely exposed herself to serve her belief that the truth is
never wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, who first hired Laake in 1981, said she was the most
memorable journalist he has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked for hours about stories,'' he said of her job
interview. ``I knew immediately she was a soulmate. It was just one
of those things you knew would work out. She has been my dearest
friend ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an over-the-top personality who absorbed everything
around her at a very intense level. Probably too intense, at
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Laake won many honors during the course of her career. In 1983,
she won a special award from the Columbia School of Journalism for
her story titled ``Wormboys,'' a memoir of her dating experiences
in which she made the argument that the American male had lost his
gumption and manliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an outrageous and hilarious story that featured a photo
of a line of men wearing diapers. It created an absolute
sensation,'' Lacey said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republic cartoonist Steve Benson, who shared with Laake
a painful separation from the Mormon Church, said Laake was a
sensitive but aggressive and demanding journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had an exquisitely appealing style and a real knack for
capturing the essence of people. Perhaps because of her own
suffering, she always stood up for the vulnerable in our society,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Her aggressive style struck fear into the hearts of insecure
men, Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went right to the heart of issues. She was honest in an
absolutely relentless way. It made her a great human being and a
great reporter,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said a service will be held for Laake at New Times,
probably sometime next week. &QL;

 NEW YORK: exterior scale.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Older Broadway theaters commonly create this effect. At the Rose
Center, the sequence is reversed. The nearly scaleless geometric
grandeur of the exterior shrinks to a series of smaller spatial
vignettes. The white sphere still dominates, but we behold it up
close, an astronaut's view of the moon in the minutes before
landing.
</P>
<P>
   To get inside the cube, visitors pass through a lobby and onto a
balcony that looks out onto the structural base of the globe and
the open exhibition space beneath it. The floor is paved with black
terrazzo sprinkled with twinkling crystal chips. Pale blue light
glows from circular lighting coves in the ceiling, a Morris Lapidus
effect.
</P>
<P>
   It is traditional to place a compression chamber between a
building's exterior and a tall room within _ a kind of air lock for
the eyes. Even the Guggenheim Museum has one. But the Rose Center
interior never opens up to full-throttle, opera house dimensions.
Instead of gazing at infinite space, we find ourselves staring at
the nether regions of a finite object.
</P>
<P>
   A sweeping staircase descends from the balcony to the floor of
Cullman Hall. It goes far toward regaining the exterior's spatial
grandeur. Some visitors may be put off by the stair's Ziegfeld
Follies theatricality. It screams Party Space! But this place ought
to have swank parties, preferably with Yma Sumac warbling Incan
high priestess arias on the building's roaring sound system.
</P>
<P>
   Two elements vie for attention in the lower part of the cube.
One is a spiral ramp that corkscrews one and a half turns around
the sphere, starting at the equator line. A mind-expanding walk
through space-time, the ramp presents a captioned history of the
universe, from the Big Bang to the appearance of Homo sapiens,
which occurred less than a second ago on the cosmic scale of
things.
</P>
<P>
   Concealed neon lighting keys this time line to the spectrum
shifts astronomers use to measure time and distance. The building's
most dynamic moment arrives as you approach one full turn of the
ramp. Gazing back at the spiral's curving edge, you become a
heavenly body streaking through space that is warped by the gravity
of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtaposed to the ramp's sinuous curve is the muscular steel
tripod that holds the sphere aloft. Each leg is three-pronged. Six
struts support the globe, three hold up the ramp. Tough-guy stuff,
big and brawny. Charles Atlas. Or Atlas himself, for the exhibition
space is a temple for the modern mythology of science, appointed
with video monitors, projection discs, touch-screens and other
techno-fetishes of the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Floor mosaics and low dividers give this area the appearance of
a free-form, organic space, to use Frank Lloyd Wright's term. The
effect is magnified by the ramp and the softly swelling underbelly
of the globe. Stretch your fingers skyward, and you can feel like a
mythical hero, too, especially if the weight of the globe overhead
puts you in mind of crashing asteroids. (A cartoon image of a
meteor striking Manhattan is a design source for Polshek.)
</P>
<P>
   Three glass-enclosed elevators (another Nouvel touch) rise six
stories to a penthouse that deserves to be a cafe or other public
space. From there, a glass-enclosed bridge pierces the building's
cosmic heart: the Hayden Planetarium, which is nestled in the
sphere's top half. Functionally, formally and symbolically, this
sequence is first rate.
</P>
<P>
   From the street, we have seen the world from the perspective of
a Newtonian God: we're outside the universe and outside the
building, too. Inside the globe, our perspective shifts. We're
sitting on a small stone, circling a modest star, in a universe
whose size is calculated according to scientific laws that may turn
out to be relative.
</P>
<P>
   Does it serve any purpose to peg the Rose Center stylistically?
Clearly, many New Yorkers have reacted to it as if they'd never
seen a modern building before. Others see it as a reprise of a
period style they evidently believe died some years back, around
the time Philip Johnson and John Burgee's AT&AMP;T building opened. The
museum, for its part, has characterized the Rose Center as an
example of progressive design.
</P>
<P>
   In a parochial sense, this is true. Until Christian de
Portzamparc's LVMH Tower opened last year on East 57th Street,
Manhattan had not seen a serious piece of modern architecture in
years. In fact, since 1966, the year the Ford Foundation building
was completed, the city has scarcely seen serious architecture of
any kind.
</P>
<P>
   This is no coincidence. The collapse of New York architecture is
a direct result of the postmodern reaction against the
International Style. But it turns out that modern architecture
cannot be equated with a particular style. Around the world,
architecture has continued to evolve, despite New York's rage to
leave itself out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   Like many contemporary buildings, the Rose Center is eclectic.
It absorbs historical elements and contemporary influences into an
organic whole. Neo-classicism. Bauhaus. Pop-uluxe. Euro Millennial.
At moments _ the sunrise entrance arch on 81st Street; the grand
staircase; the pastel planets dangling above; the stardust paving _
the entire edifice teeters on the verge of camp.
</P>
<P>
   If New York hadn't lost confidence in its creative energies, the
Rose Center would look less startling. It would be seen as part of
a continuum that includes Richard Meier's Canal Plus headquarters
(Paris), James Ingo Freed's United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
(Washington), Rafael Vinoly's Tokyo International Forum and other
recent works by distinguished New York architects. But architecture
in New York is an interrupted art. The Rose Center interrupts the
interruption.

CISCO'S REVENUE AND PROFIT SOAR, AS DO ITS SHARES AFTER HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The love fest between Wall Street and Cisco
Systems reached a new level of ardor Tuesday as the company
surpassed earnings estimates and reported a 53 percent gain in
revenue for the second quarter, prompting investors to send its
shares to a 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said Cisco, the leading supplier of essential
hardware for the Internet, had seen little or no impact from Year
2000 computer problems on sales or service.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding acquisition-related charges, Cisco earned 25 cents a
share, exceeding analysts' published estimates by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco reported its results after the stock market closed. Its
shares ended regular-session NASDAQ trading at $124.8125, down 37.5
cents, then, as word of the results spread after hours, rose as
high as $133.75 before settling at $131.625.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, its ninth
since going public in February 1990.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, which ended on Jan. 29, Cisco reported earnings
of $825 million, or 23 cents a diluted share _ nearly three times
the $282 million, or 8 cents a share, in the comparable period a
year earlier. Sales rose 53 percent, to $4.35 billion, from $2.85
billion in 1999's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Cisco completed the acquisitions of Calista,
the Internet Engineering Group, Tasmania Network Systems and
Worldwide Data Systems for a combined purchase price, including
assumed liabilities, of approximately $135 million. It took a
one-time charge of $43 million, without which it had 25
cent-a-share earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected 24 cents, according to First Call. The
so-called whisper number was 27 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco has made 50 acquisitions, 20 of them in just the last 12
months. In a conference call Tuesday with securities analysts, John
Chambers, Cisco's president and chief executive, said the company
expected to make 20 or 25 further acquisitions in the next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as IPOs are occurring sooner, we find we are acquiring
companies sooner than we would like,'' Chambers said of the rapid
pace of Internet business development fueled by initial public
offerings of infant companies.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that buying companies at an earlier stage
increases Cisco's costs and ``dramatically increases the risk of
the acquisition.'' What is more, Chambers said, Cisco is expanding
the geographic reach of its acquisitions because the best start-up
companies are no longer all to be found in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Large corporate networks, Cisco's traditional market, now
account for slightly less than half its revenue. Growth is coming
from telecommunications service providers that are hastening to
offer combined voice and data lines, as well as from small
businesses adding Internet connections and internal networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to advance the new world strategy of integrated
data, voice and video networks,'' Chambers said. Though such
integrated networks are appearing first within corporations,
telecommunications companies are moving this way, he said, adding,
``Over time, data, voice and video networks will occur in all of
the major service providers.''

 STARS' DEFENSE GAINS IN TRADE (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) By JENNIFER FLOYD c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Four points, a single spot in the standings and
maybe a couple of moves separate the Stars from the Detroit Red
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to come down to Dallas or Detroit \Rto
reach the Stanley Cup Finals\S,'' ESPN hockey analyst Barry Melrose
said. ``I still think it's Detroit, but Dallas got a lot closer
today. ... I think the deal is great for Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   A mere Kevin Dean, Derek Plante and a second-round draft pick in
2001 helped close the gap, bringing the Stars both the skilled
defenseman they sought, in Sylvain Cote, and the physical
defenseman they needed, in Dave Manson, from Chicago in a trade
yesterday. Both are expected to join the team for tonight's game
against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had had their antenna up for one or the other. They
got both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it started out as a smaller trade and through
discussions it expanded, started to encompass more people,'' Stars
general manager Bob Gainey said. ``We've been working that certain
group of defensemen very hard. They've held up very well
defensively and been able to really supply us, along with our
goaltending, with the backbone of our season so far. I think these
two players will be able to absorb some of that demand on other
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson, 33, isn't nicknamed ``Charlie'' for nothing. He has
accrued 2,644 penalty minutes in his career. He's a defenseman with
a knack for playing physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about the trade because Dallas is a solid
team obviously,'' Manson said. ``One time, I got traded from
Edmonton to Winnipeg \Rin 1994\s, and I went from one team that was
out of the playoffs to another team that was even further out of
the playoffs. So it's nice to be going to a team that is in the
thick of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cote, 34, adds a Darryl Sydor-like player, willing to join the
attack off the rush. He passes well. He has six goals and 19
assists in 48 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Cote,'' Melrose said. ``He's really one of the
underrated defensemen in hockey. He skates very well, moves up in
the play, can score goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Cote and Manson will be unrestricted free agents on July 1,
and the Blackhawks were looking to get younger and cheaper. Cote
will earn $1.5 million this season while Manson's season salary is
$1.65 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the Stars made the move was the uncertainty
surrounding defenseman Shawn Chambers, who has been out since the
second week of the season after having surgery to repair the
surface of his kneecap. Chambers said last week that a real
possibility exists that he won't return this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we miss Shawn, we couldn't wait on Shawn,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``If Shawn comes back, we're really in a
bonus situation now.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chambers and Derian Hatcher out with injuries, Stars
defensemen Sergei Zubov and Richard Matvichuk have been logging a
lot of ice time. Zubov ranks second among NHL defensemen in
icetime, averaging 29:49 minutes a game, while Matvichuk's at No.
24 with 24-plus minutes. Hatcher had been averaging 29:40 before
getting injured.
</P>
<P>
   The trade filled the Stars need for defensive depth, but Gainey
didn't rule out the Stars making another before the March 14
trading deadline. Maybe for a forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have some time to watch,'' Gainey said. ``The timing of
this makes it valuable to us in that way that we've still four,
five, six weeks until the trade deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's Mark Messier is one of the bigger-name players
reported to be on the trading block.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Stars decided to stand pat at the trading
deadline while teams such as Colorado and Detroit made bold moves.
The Red Wings acquired Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson, Wendel Clark
and Bill Ranford but were eliminated in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said sometimes its not as much a matter of who you get
but when you get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something that we were pretty emphatic on,''
Hitchcock said. ``We felt the way our team had battled and clawed
and scratched this year it wasn't going to do us any good to go and
pull the trigger in the middle of March and expect the team to come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said the trade gives the Stars the look and feel of last
year's Cup winner.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Manson and Cote are a lot like Chambers and Craig Ludwig,
who made up their third defensive pair in 1999. So what message
does that send the team?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you right now the message if I were a player would
be that we're not going to go quietly into the night,'' Hitchcock
said. ``We want a piece of the pie, too. We've clawed and we've
scratched and we want to get better and that's what this trade is
going to help us do, get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like the way we've played is not good enough for the
end of the year and we want to keep pushing ahead.''

 FEELING NO NUMBNESS, LANGENBRUNNER RETURNS
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JENNIFER FLOYD c.2000
Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ He doesn't remember if the needles hurt or not.
He doesn't really want to know.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner is content to let his knowledge
of the procedure begin and end with the simple fact it worked. The
injections to his neck have helped calm the pinched nerve enough to
get him back into the lineup for tonight's game against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put you on an X-ray bed, give you something to put you
out so you don't flinch or move and then stick needles into the
side of your neck,'' Langenbrunner said. ``It was a painful place
once in a while because injections and stuff aren't the most
pleasant thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury began with a hit he took Dec. 17 in Edmonton. He
experienced numbness in his hands but missed only one game before
returning. He thought it would get better. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   By Jan. 7 against Vancouver, it had become worse. Langenbrunner
had maybe 20 to 25 percent of the strength in his hands. He hasn't
played since.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the scary part. Pain was more of a discomfort,'' said
Langenbrunner, whose only real symptom was the numbness. ``That was
the frustrating part. I could do anything I wanted. I felt like I
really wasn't injured. I could walk around. I could do this. I
could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He just couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   When a couple of weeks passed without significant improvement,
Langenbrunner said he seriously considered having surgery, which
would've sidelined him for another six weeks. He felt much better
after his second injection, though. And his last injection had him
feeling even better.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he started skating. Skating turned to practicing,
including a hard one yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's a player, to be honest with you,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll likely begin on the fourth line, with Roman Lyashenko and
Jamie Wright, and build up from there.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner had been playing on the second line, with Joe
Nieuwendyk and Brenden Morrow, when he got hurt, but the Stars are
hoping he can return to the form he displayed in the playoffs last
season, when he scored 10 goals.
</P>
<P>
   For a team ranking among the worst in the NHL in goals scored,
the Stars could use an impact player on offense.

   ``I don't think we've been able to stretch anything out,''
Hitchcock said. ``He's a guy who can give you scoring depth,
tenacity depth. He's a guy that can make a play at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner will be the first one to admit that, aside from
that playoff stretch, goal scoring has been frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough year that way. Last year I probably wasn't
feeling good at the beginning, and then this. It's been a tough go.
It's been a tough year that way,'' Langenbrunner said. ``Once I'm
feeling good again and healthy, I'll be OK.''

 TV REPLAY RULE A BIG MISTAKE (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By WENDELL BARNHOUSE c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It took less than two weeks for a committee
with the letters ``N C A A'' in its title to meet, discuss and
approve a significant in-season rule change for college basketball.
Now, referees can refer to a television replay to see if they made
the correct call on a buzzer-beater shot.
</P>
<P>
   Time to step behind the line and launch a 3-point opinion.
</P>
<P>
   1. The NCAA, which should have either a glacier or a snail on
its corporate logo, made heads spin with the speed with which this
rule change was made.
</P>
<P>
   2. If there is a Knee Jerk Hall of Fame, this rule change would
be eligible for immediate induction.
</P>
<P>
   3. Allowing officials to use television replays to confirm their
decisions is wrong. And I don't need to go to the videotape to
decide whether or not I'm making the right call.
</P>
<P>
   For all of this, we have Charles Range to thank. From all
accounts, Range is a solid official (he worked the 1995 Final
Four), but his 45 minutes of indecision before making a final call
during the Texas A&AMP;M-Texas Tech game on Jan. 15 brought nationwide
attention to last-second decisions. (The sport needed Regis Philbin
growling ``Is that your final answer?'' at Range.)
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Big East Conference officials called a
last-second shot by Miami good, giving the Hurricanes a victory
over Villanova. Even though it appeared the officials got that call
right _ and replays were inconclusive _ suddenly everyone was
yelling and screaming for the use of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is no call in the game that is more
important, and it's the one call that's remembered longer than any
other,'' said Air Force coach Reggie Minton, chairman of the men's
rules committee. ``We want to give our officials every tool
possible at the end of the game. If we have the technology
available to help us, we want to make sure we use it to get the
call right.''
</P>
<P>
   Referees have been allowed to use TV replay to review timing
errors and to decide if a disputed shot was a two-pointer or
3-pointer. Minton argues that using replays to decide last-second
shots is merely an extension of that rule.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is like allowing baseball teams to use the
designated hitter only in games televised by national networks. For
college basketball, this is an uneven rule, because it can be
applied only in games being televised. And for that reason it's a
rule that benefits the schools in the major conferences, where most
of the games are televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction to this rule was, `So what?' '' Delaware coach
Mike Brey said. ``We've just got three regular-season games
televised, so it really doesn't affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   You can argue and debate whether instant replay works in the
NFL. In pro football, there are fewer games, all of which are
televised, and those games are produced by more experienced
television crews. In college basketball, the telecasts are more
inconsistent. Even in games that are televised, there's no
guarantee that the cameramen, tape operators and directors will be
able to provide the right replay needed to confirm a buzzer-beater.
</P>
<P>
   The rationalization for this rule is a desire to ``get it
right.'' This is a bad mixture of science and nature. It's a game
played by 10 people officiated by three people. Stuff happens. In
the 1989 national championship game, John Clougherty called a
ticky-tack foul on Seton Hall that allowed Michigan's Rumeal
Robinson to hit the game-winning free throws. A human being made a
mistake. That call is part of the game's history, its lore.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this being part of college basketball lore. An NCAA
Tournament game, maybe even a national championship game, comes
down to a buzzer-beating shot. What we'll be left with won't be the
image of a Lorenzo Charles dunk or a Keith Smart jumper and the
ensuing spontaneous celebration.
</P>
<P>
   We'll remember three men in striped shirts, huddling around a
courtside, 15-inch color monitor trying to decide whether the shot
beat the clock while the teams wait to either celebrate or cry.
</P>
<P>
   What drama.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine, if you can, the spectacle of Mae West
playing Norma Desmond in ``Sunset Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility, reported by Cameron Crowe in his book
``Conversations With Billy Wilder,'' must seem incomprehensible to
anyone who treasures Gloria Swanson's sinuously macabre performance
in the 1950 classic.
</P>
<P>
   Was Mae West some kind of joke? Apparently not. But even if
Wilder initially intended ``Sunset Boulevard'' to be an outright
comedy, it is difficult to see how he might have used an actress
who possessed such a limited, if vivid, professional persona.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know. Mae wasn't interested in the Wilder project
because, it seems, she didn't want to play a faded movie star. She
knew her fans would never believe it. Though she was then in her
mid-50s, and no longer in demand by the film studios, she felt she
was still in the bloom of her youth, successfully touring with
``Diamond Lil'' from time to time and discovering new fans on the
nightclub circuit.
</P>
<P>
   She was then someone recognized and/or sought out by such as
Cecil Beaton, Colette and Sacheverell Sitwell. In his admiring
review of her 1949 revival of ``Diamond Lil,'' Brooks Atkinson of
The New York Times was moved to acknowledge what he called, in an
uncharacteristically poetic effusion, ``the sublime fatalism of the
entire business,'' going on to ask, ``Is she kidding or is she
serious?''
</P>
<P>
   Mae West had become an institution, which is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Today it seems that Wilder's vision of Norma Desmond in the
stout form of Mae West was nothing less than prescient. Gloria
Swanson may have acted Norma Desmond, but Mae West lived the
character, far longer and far more successfully than Wilder, in the
late 1940s, might have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the subsidiary revelations of ``Dirty Blonde,''
the nervy, exceptionally entertaining Off Broadway production that
contemplates the legacy of Mae West in a format that mixes comedy
and song to suggest that life, after all, is very much like a
revue. Unfortunately, ``Dirty Blonde'' plays its last performance
sunday at New York Theater Workshop, but don't despair. There are
expectations it will soon transfer either to Broadway or to another
Off Broadway house. It deserves an afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   So does the season's second Mae West tribute: the Hourglass
Group's pocket-size but exuberant Off Off Broadway revival of
``Sex,'' West's 1926 comedy-melodrama, which ends its run Monday in
the tiny theater at the Gershwin Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex'' is notorious in Broadway history for having been labeled
``a public nuisance'' by the New York police and closed down, even
though it had already played 41 weeks of sold-out performances
without incident. In the trial that followed, Mae was found guilty
and sentenced to serve 10 days in the Women's Workhouse on Welfare
(now Roosevelt) Island.
</P>
<P>
   She received great publicity from the trial, but at a certain
cost. The publicity also scared New York theater owners from
booking her latest production, ``The Drag,'' a male drag show that,
reportedly, was the real target of the attack on ``Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Blonde'' is wise and moving and seemingly effortless in
the way that it evokes the life, times and manners of Mae West. The
work is a seamless collaboration between Claudia Shear, the star
and author of her own autobiographical play, ``Blown Sideways
Through Life,'' and James Lapine, the playwright, director and
frequent theatrical partner of Stephen Sondheim.
</P>
<P>
   Shear and Lapine together ``devised'' the show, which was
written by Shear, directed by Lapine, and is being acted by Shear,
Kevin Chamberlin and Bob Stillman.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a comic enchantment about two klutzy New Yorkers:
Jo ( Shear) and Charlie (Chamberlin), whose unusual relationship
begins when they meet at Mae West's mausoleum in the Cypress Hills
Cemetery in Brooklyn. Each is a seriously dedicated fan, though
Charlie has the edge over Jo.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager on a summer vacation in Los Angeles, he came to
know the ancient Mae in her Ravenswood apartment, her home from the
early 1930s until her death in 1980. Briefly, Charlie was accepted
into her small, sealed world, where she lived her days in perpetual
twilight (the sun did terrible things to her skin), attended by
hangers-on from the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Mae liked nothing better than to spend hours leafing through
Charlie's Mae West scrapbooks; on a special occasion, the queenly
bee and her drones might go out to eat Chinese, being driven to and
from in her Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Blonde'' moves swiftly in and out of the lives of Mae
(also played by Shear) and her various male attendants (played by
Chamberlin and Stillman), and the contemporary trials of Jo and
Charlie. One of Jo's comic/sad epiphanies about Mae: ``She never
saw Paris ... but she could have.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Mae's obsession with self and climbing to the top is
seen as funny, as when we're told that her mother once advised her,
``Don't be selfish, think of your career.'' Only later, as Jo and
Charlie gain some understanding of their own lives, do they begin
to see Mae in perspective. The show's final image, which shouldn't
be described, is as eccentric as it is triumphant, though in a very
unusual way.
</P>
<P>
   The Hourglass Group's production of ``Sex'' is something else: a
chance to see the three-act play more or less as it was presented
with music interludes in 1926, but also framed with quotations
taken from the court proceedings against it. Elyse Singer is the
director of the first-rate cast headed by Carolyn Baeumler in the
Mae West role.
</P>
<P>
   Mae not only starred in ``Sex'' as Margy LaMont, an upwardly
mobile whore with a heart of gold, but she also took credit as the
playwright. According to Emily Wortis Leider's biography ``Becoming
Mae West,'' ``Sex'' has its origins in ``Following the Fleet,'' a
play by J.J. Byrne that Mae bought and rewrote in collaboration
with the uncredited Adeline Leitzbach _ Mae never shared credit
easily.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes ``Sex'' from other so-called exploitation
plays of the time is Margy LaMont's brazenly untroubled attitude
toward her profession.
</P>
<P>
   Mae always said she was too nervous to read, so it is unlikely
that she ever had contact with George Bernard Shaw's ``Warren's
Profession.'' Yet she would seem to agree with Shaw that
prostitution, while not something to be celebrated, should be
understood as a natural consequence in a society that denies women
their economic rights and encourages their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to ``Three Plays by Mae West,'' published by
Routledge, Lillian Schlissel, the editor, notes that at the end of
``Sex,'' Margy LaMont ``is neither saved or reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   She continues, ``There is no spiritual redemption ... The
ethical arithmetic is redrawn _ the wages of sin are reduced from
mortal transgression to misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what scared Broadway and then delighted the movie
audiences in the early years of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   When Mae went to Hollywood, her good humor and bold assumption
of sexual authority, coupled with her raunchy aphorisms of Wildean
balance, transformed her into one of the world's biggest box-office
attractions. She was also the reason Hollywood overhauled the
Production Code, the apparatus by which the industry censored its
own material, in this way to combat the new licentiousness
represented by little Mae.
</P>
<P>
   Her first three movies, ``Night After Night'' (1932), ``She Done
Him Wrong'' (1933) and ``I'm No Angel'' (1933), are stuffed with
the grand doubles-entendres that she never tired of recycling for
the rest of her life. It's in ``I'm No Angel'' that she plays a
lion tamer who sticks her head into the big cat's mouth, prompting
an admirer to say significantly, ``She's safer in that cage than
she is in bed.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is the same movie in which she enunciated as her dictum
about men: ``Find 'em, fool 'em, 'n forget 'em.'' Which, in 1933,
was her variation on what men, especially the sort whom Mae admired
most, were supposed to say about women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the end of the 1930s, Mae's movies were no longer
sure-fire box-office hits. It wasn't only because the Production
Code was sanitizing her material. Her range was limited and she was
repeating herself. She might have gone on forever as the supporting
character actress she was in ``Night After Night,'' but she
couldn't resist playing the star. When she hogs the screen a
certain monotony creeps into her work; it soon seems as if she is
imitating herself.
</P>
<P>
   A further problem was her age. Mae started late in Hollywood;
she had her 40th birthday while shooting ``I'm No Angel.'' Her
ample figure was less easily disguised in contemporary clothes than
in the sort of gowns worn by Lillian Russell, but she couldn't
confine her films to tales set in the Gay Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   Mae West isn't forgotten today, but she is probably best
remembered in oblique ways, in association with other things, like
the busty life jackets that World War II servicemen nicknamed for
her. She is still recalled by occasional impersonators, some of
whom are more bizarre than others.
</P>
<P>
   Following the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, there was a news
photograph of the child wearing the sort of feather boa and
cartwheel hat that Mae sported in ``She Done Him Wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mae's films still can be found in video rental shops, of course.
Yet I suspect that the one rented most frequently is ``My Little
Chickadee.'' This 1940 comedy-western about a hooker and a card
shark is not, strictly speaking, a true Mae West movie, having been
stolen by the nimble, white-gloved digits of W.C. Fields, her
larcenous co-star.
</P>
<P>
   Mae made three films after ``My Little Chickadee,'' but she
might as well have retired then and there. Fields _ no gallant
gentleman he (as Mae well knew) _ damaged her reputation in subtle
ways that, for lethal effect, equaled the destruction wreaked on
her pictures by the Production Code.
</P>
<P>
   Fields didn't try to clean up her act; he did something far
worse: he made Mae, the laid-back, self-mocking good-time girl of
``She Done Him Wrong'' and ``I'm No Angel,'' look not only
humorless but mean and spiteful. Though Mae, playing Flower Belle,
sets up the elaborate gag that transforms ``My Little Chickadee''
into one of the funniest movies ever made, the way the gag works
out demolishes Mae's public persona.
</P>
<P>
   To escape Cuthbert J. Twillie (Fields), who believes he has
conjugal rights, Flower Belle puts a goat in the bed of their
bridal suite, blows out the lamps and leaves the room in darkness.
Twillie enters from the bathroom and climbs into bed, noting, after
a decent pause, that Flower Belle seems to be sleeping in her
caracul coat. ``Better take it off, dear,'' says Twillie with
concern, ``you won't feel the good of it when you go out. ...''
When the goat lets out a long ``m-a-a-a-a!,'' Twillie is sent into
paroxysms of bliss. ``The sweet little dear,'' he says, ``is
calling for her mama. Such blind innocence. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The sequence is priceless, but it also has the effect of making
Mae West appear to be frosty and completely out of touch with her
co-star, which she was. Mae was not a team player. But then she
knew enough to realize that the character she always played,
Superhooker, couldn't stand too much realism.
</P>
<P>
   When actual joy, passion or even humiliation are evident, the
Superhooker appears ridiculous, like Piggy in an otherwise
conventional adaptation of ``Little Women.'' Mae took top billing
in ``My Little Chickadee'' but she wound up sandbagged by Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Dirty Blonde'' and the revival of ``Sex'' remind us of
the genuine good humor and common sense that were the basis of Mae
West's art, which today survives in recognizable form only in her
first three films. All the others are _ to greater or lesser
degrees _ imitations.
</P>
<P>
   In a category of its own is ``Sextette,'' Mae's last movie,
which opened in New York in 1979 when she was nearing 86. The film
is Mae's equivalent to the biblical epic about Salome in which
Norma Desmond intends to make her return to the screen in ``Sunset
Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mae's film is a sex comedy, based on a play she had written some
years earlier, about a world-famous movie star and the attempts of
her former husbands and lovers to prevent her from consummating her
sixth marriage.
</P>
<P>
   I'm embarrassed to admit that, at the time the film opened, I
took a dim, rather puritanical view of it and of Mae, pointing to
the age of the star and to the infirmities she shared with the
production. You didn't have to be a wit to find a few laughs at her
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having seen ``Sunset Boulevard'' a year ago and, much more
recently, ``Dirty Blonde'' and ``Sex,'' I feel quite differently.
There is no desire to sit through ``Sextette'' again, but bully for
Mae for having got the screenplay onto the screen, directed by Ken
Hughes (one of whose earlier epics was ``Cromwell''), with a cast
including Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, Timothy Dalton and Regis
Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilder's satiric Gothic romance, the 50-year-old former movie
star shoots her screenwriting collaborator-lover and goes mad. In
real life, Mae West was equally obsessed with the public
personality she had created, but she wasn't nuts. She made her
movie and, a year after it came out, died without melodramatic
incident, at the age of 87.

 ALL ROADS LEAD TO HOME FOR UT-ARLINGTON
COACH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By DARRIN SCHEID
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Clay Gould is a local-boy-done-good story
waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old lifetime Arlington resident, formerly an
outfielder at the city's oldest high school, returns to his former
college at UT-Arlington and leads the team to the College World
Series. Before he signs the movie deal and casts Robert Redford to
play him, Gould points out his total number of victories heading
into this season.
</P>
<P>
   Zero. UTA coaching legend Butch McBroom, the person Gould
replaced, is still ahead by 801 wins after the Mavericks pushed
their record to 3-2 with a victory yesterday against TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the right track, but what we've done so far doesn't
mean anything if we don't win games,'' Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like people aren't pulling for him. Gould is more of a
local boy and a golden boy than anyone UTA could find to take over
for McBroom, whose No. 30 was retired at Saturday's home opener.
Gould grew up in Arlington. His parents and grandparents are
natives. He played baseball at Arlington High before his college
days two miles north on Cooper Street for the UTA Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint playing in the minor leagues and a graduate
assistant coaching year at Texas A&AMP;M, Gould found a full-time
assistant coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was in Arlington at UTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time in high school when all I wanted to do was
get out of Arlington,'' Gould said. ``I would have played anywhere.
After being gone playing and coaching for a while, I realized all I
want is be right here at UTA. It's not often your life works out
exactly like you hoped it would.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, Gould said it has worked out even
better.
</P>
<P>
   Getting support from the city, always tough when the former
coach had the job 26 years, was a cinch. The day Gould announced he
got the job on June 11, every important Tom from Vandergriff to
Cravens and other longtime Arlington civic leaders were there to
offer congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview process, UTA's administration narrowed the
list of candidates to Gould, 11-year UTA assistant coach Ron
Liggett and assistant coaches from Louisiana State, Oklahoma and
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks athletic director Pete Carlon said community leaders
lobbied for Gould. At UTA, where Carlon admits a gap has existed
for years between the school and city, leave it up to a 28-year-old
baseball coach to help build the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been Arlington's favorite son for a while, and there
were a lot of people in Arlington who thought he was the right
person,'' Carlon said. ``But that's not why we hired him. We hired
him because of his baseball knowledge, his personality and an
unbelievable work ethic. You can already see what he's capable of
doing with the recruiting class Clay and his staff signed. I guess
I feel a little exonerated, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting class is why Gould says the Mavericks staff did a
lot before winning a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have 21 new players, including a school-record
five recruits who were picked by major-league teams in the June
amateur draft. All five turned down signing bonuses to play for
UTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collegiate Baseball'' magazine ranks UTA's class No. 26 in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lewisville High School outfielder Daniel Ortmeier, who
had been to UTA's campus once in his life, said UTA was an
afterthought during his senior year of high school. That changed
the first time Ortmeier sat down with Gould.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken in by his love and passion for the game,'' said
Ortmeier, a 27th-round pick and UTA's starting center fielder. ``I
had to play for him. I wanted to be a part of all this.''
</P>
<P>
   UTA's second recruiting class already includes major-league
prospect, Matthew Meisenheimer of Greenville High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, recruiting is just outworking people,'' Gould said.
``If we're ever going to get where we want to go with this program,
we have to get the exact same guys Texas and Texas A&AMP;M are after.
Let's have a list of the top-notch guys, get to work and go after
them. Hopefully, we'll get our share, and I think we're starting to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould admits a great recruiting class still doesn't win games.
</P>
<P>
   But he said teachers such as McBroom and Texas A&AMP;M coach Mark
Johnson helped give him an eye for talent. Gould also has some
experience after summers he spent from 1997-99 as head coach of the
Liberal (Kan.) Bee Jays in the amateur Jayhawk League. Gould said
he has coached more than 20 players who have been in the College
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Before spending the past three seasons as a UTA assistant, Gould
was a graduate assistant coach at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   One season with the Aggies opened his eyes to the possibilities
at UTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered how much different it would be,'' Gould said. ``I
wondered how much better the players are. I was expecting something
unbelievable, and it's just not what I found. They have the same
problems as anybody, and all the players are not all great. The
amount of knowledge I got there was unbelievable, but what I found
out is that it's not that different. It can be done with any
program, and it can be done at UTA.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould is convinced the Mavericks can do it because they came
pretty close when he was a player. He played on UTA's Southland
Conference championship teams of 1990 and 1992. In 1992, the
Mavericks were 40-15 and climbed to No. 26 in the ``Collegiate
Baseball'' national poll. In 1993, Gould was a finalist for the
Golden Spikes Award, given to the best collegiate baseball player
in NCAA Division I.
</P>
<P>
   That was UTA's last winning season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to get back on the same track we were on back
then,'' Gould said, ``and a little beyond.''

 UNT FRESHMAN MAKING LONG-PREDICTED IMPACT
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Maybe Erven Davis Jr. has been right all these
years. His son, Chris, really is special.
</P>
<P>
   Special simply because of how his life began and what he has
fought through _ death of loved ones, sharing only one parent with
three siblings for five years and overcoming a potential
career-ending injury. Special for many reasons off the basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   To North Texas basketball fans, though, Davis is special because
of his ability to score as no other freshman in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 redshirt freshman guard is the Big West
Conference's leading scorer with an average of 21.3 points per
game, 11th best nationally and second best among all freshmen,
trailing only George Washington's SirValiant Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is quickly fulfilling the potential UNT coach Vic Trilli
knew Davis had when he recruited Davis out of Dallas Kimball High
School two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the top five players in the state,'' Trilli
said. ``It was huge for him to decide to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   But to his father, Chris Davis is far more than just a
basketball star. He's an integral part of a tight-knit family
forced to grow even tighter in the first months of his life.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis' mother, Robbie, was pregnant with him, she learned
that she had breast cancer. Late in the pregnancy, doctors said
they might be able to remove the cancer, but in doing so, she would
risk losing her baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way she was going to risk that,'' Davis' father
said.
</P>
<P>
   So, Robbie Davis went on with the pregnancy and delivered a
healthy boy on Oct. 7, 1980. Two months later, she died from
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Erven Davis Jr. assumed the role of both parents to Chris and
three older brothers and sisters. He coached YMCA teams, helped
with schoolwork and even turned down job opportunities that would
have involved travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job of handling everything,'' Chris Davis said.
``Whenever any of us played ball, he was always there. He never
allowed any excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Davis' father remarried when Chris was 6. Erven Davis Jr.
and his wife, Sherry, had two more children. All the while, Chris
Davis' game was attracting notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy used to kid me,'' said Chris' brother, Erven Davis III.
``I was about 12 and I guess Chris was 7, and he could already
handle the ball better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Chris grew past 6 feet, his father kept him playing
point guard on the YMCA teams to make sure he improved his
ball-handling skills. Soon, he was starring at Atwell Middle School
and catching the eye of then-Kimball coach Goree Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized then he could shoot,'' Johnson said. ``We were
counting on him to be one of our big guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis didn't go directly to Kimball.
</P>
<P>
   First, he moved in with his aunt in Irving to play at Nimitz
with his cousin, Dexter Tennell. As juniors, he and Tennell helped
lead the Vikings to a 20-13 record. For his senior season, he
decided to move back home and play at Kimball, where he averaged
23.8 points, 15 rebounds and 6.2 assists and earned All-State
honors.
</P>
<P>
   With Tennell's encouragement, Davis chose UNT over powerhouse
programs such as Arizona, Georgetown, Texas Tech and SMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a brother up here and a cousin who's in a sorority
here,'' Davis said. ``I thought it would just be easier for me to
get around. I wouldn't have to worry about flying home all the
time, and I always enjoy seeing my dad in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be awhile before his father could see him play,
however. Two games into his freshman season, Davis began noticing
pain in his left foot, which doctors initially thought might be a
tumor. Once it was determined he had a deteriorating bone in his
leg and a stress fracture in his foot, he underwent surgery that
sidelined him for the season. While spending six months in a
plastic boot cast and unable to work out, Davis gained nearly 40
pounds, up to 248. He spent the first part of this season working
into his playing weight of 210.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out everything was all right, but with what happened
to his mother, you know what was on our minds,'' Davis' father
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he was rounding into top shape, he was suddenly without
his closest friend on the team, Tennell, whom Trilli kicked off
Dec. 30 for disciplinary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over it, but we're still close,'' Davis said. ``I wish him
good luck whatever he does and he supports me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, he has kept the same demeanor _ always calm,
always soft-spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a laid-back dude,'' teammate Kyle Crawford said. ``He's
too cool. Everything he does has to be cool. Even the way he talks;
it's never too high, never too low.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the league's best spot-up shooters, Davis has displayed
range far beyond the 3-point arc. He can also create his own shot.
Trilli has given him free rein to shoot, though Davis knows he
needs to bring his shooting percentage up from his current 38.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Davis seems to deal with whatever life hands him, but one thing
he doesn't accept is losing. UNT is 7-12 overall but 5-3 in the Big
West Conference. Davis has made two game-winning shots. Saturday
night, he scored 32 points, including a career-high seven
3-pointers and the game-winning 3-pointer in overtime at Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   And if he has his way, Erven Davis Jr. said, it's just going to
keep getting better for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he leaves there, North Texas is going to win,'' he
said. ``It may not be this year, but believe me, it's going to
happen because Chris loves to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went up there to make history, and before he leaves, he's
going to.''

 HOUSTON SPOILS DEBUT OF NEW RICE STADIUM (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By WHIT CANNING c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Reflecting on his first experience at Reckling Park,
Rice's new $7.5 million baseball facility, Houston coach Rayner
Noble had to admit it was a sight to behold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it has to be one of the top 10 in the country,'' he said.
``Every chair-back seat has an individual cup holder, you've got
the city skyline in the background. ... It's tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   It also held the largest home crowd in Rice's baseball history,
a sellout throng of 4,117. But, Noble decided, it really wasn't
much of a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got used to noise and a vocal home crowd at Texas over the
weekend,'' he said. ``This was nothing like Disch-Falk Field. This
crowd wasn't real boisterous. ... They seemed kind of quiet and
subdued.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably because the Cougars (2-2) jumped up early and rolled to
a 6-2 victory without much difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work to do,'' said Rice coach Wayne Graham,
after watching his team drop to 0-4 on the year. ``But it was a
great occasion for us, and the weather was great. At least the fans
were comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, there will be better days here.''
</P>
<P>
   This one pretty much belonged to the guests, who clinged to a
3-1 lead behind the pitching of Greg Runser and Nick Torina before
scoring three unearned runs in the ninth. In a park filled with
dignitaries, the only no-show was the Rice offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having some really bad at-bats,'' Graham said. ``We're
swinging at pitches we can't hit and taking pitches we can hit.
Kenny Baugh pitched well, as usual, but that was about all we can
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh, who pitched six innings in relief of starter Jeff
Nichols, who left in the third, departed in the ninth after a
throwing error opened the gates for Houston's final runs.
</P>
<P>
   Runser, who pitched five innings before giving way to Torina,
said ``I'm really happy with the win and the way I pitched, but
what made it especially good was that it was Rice. It was great to
come in here and ruin their new ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was mostly a festive day for the crowd, which included
Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker and former TCU All-American
Royce Huffman, an Astros farmhand whose brother, Scott, plays for
the Owls. A succession of Graham players who left recently as high
draft choices was introduced, including major-leaguers Lance
Berkman and Matt Anderson, along with recent draftees Bubba Crosby
and Damon Thames, among several others. Red Murff, the scout who
originally signed Nolan Ryan, got a big hand.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest cheer was reserved for local investor Tommy
Reckling and his wife, Isla, who donated $6 million for the
facility, built entirely with donated funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is raving about this place,'' Rice athletic director
Bobby May said. ``Now, we have to make sure we can raise the money
to maintain it.''

 Andersen Launching Dot-Com Incubators  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Andersen Consulting will announce today a global network of
high-tech incubators.
<P>
   The network of 17 ``dot-com launch centres,'' including one in
Palo Alto, is designed to provide e-commerce startups with the
tools and counsel they need to quickly become viable,
revenue-producing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The New York management and technology consulting firm, which
has 65,000 employees in 48 countries, said it will invest up to
$1.2 billion in the venture over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a growing number of high-tech incubators that work with
businesses in their first 60 to 120 days and help them get their
first financing, Andersen seeks to nurture young companies that
already have a nucleus of management and $1 million to $2 million
in financial support.
</P>
<P>
   It is focusing on the next critical stage where companies need
to achieve marketing and other milestones to not only survive but
thrive. For the past two years, Andersen has forged alliances with
and invested in more than 175 dot-com companies.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the launch centers is to work with another 500
companies, either in their offices or on Andersen's own premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the leader in serving young companies and
helping them with management, technology, branding, customer and
strategic relationships, expanding geographically and getting to a
successful IPO faster,'' said Mary Tolan, Andersen's global
managing partner for growth and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other professionals who deal with venture-backed
startups, Andersen will barter for its compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're flexible on the economic arrangements,'' said Tolan.
``One thing dot-coms love is having everyone aligned with their
success in creating share value. We are happy to work out a hybrid
model and accept a combination of cash (immediate or deferred) and
equity.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Andersen Consulting said it plans to create its own
venture capital fund to invest up to $1 billion in Internet
startups over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Tolan said the company could invest in some of the same
companies it takes under its incubator wing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its Palo Alto office, Andersen's dot-com centers
are located in Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Dublin, Ireland;
Frankfurt, Germany; Helsinki, Finland; Johannesburg, South Africa;
London; Madrid, Spain; Milan, Italy; Paris; Sao Paulo, Brazil;
Singapore; Stockholm, Sweden; Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo.

 New Tools Fine-Tune Web Searches  &HT;     By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
``Search sucks.''
<P>
   That's the slogan of a new Web search /directory company called
Quiver, but it could also be the motto for legions of frustrated
users.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-evolving maze that is the World Wide Web confounds many
surfers, who complain that search results are too copious and
chaotic to be useful.
</P>
<P>
   Doing a Web search ``is like asking someone a simple question
and getting 100 or 1,000 answers,'' said Bob Rosenschein, founder
and chairman of Palo Alto's GuruNet. ``For ordinary users, the Web
is too cluttered and getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiver and GuruNet are part of a new generation of search tool
that is trying to improve the information-gathering process. Some
are tying to fine-tune queries, others are offering information
before the user even knows he or she needs it, and others are
harnessing search results of past users. About half a dozen of the
new tools, all free, made their debut this week at the trade show
Demo 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new approaches is to piggyback on other searchers'
past efforts. ``Right now, there's no sharing of one another's
explorations,'' said Chris Shipley, Demo executive producer. If
someone asks the same question as a previous searcher ``it's as if
the prairie was wide open and you never got any maps from the
pioneers who went before.''
</P>
<P>
   Redwood City's Quiver (www.quiver.com) calls itself ``a
human-powered directory.'' It tracks what sites its users click on
and also asks users to volunteer their bookmark lists; that
information then is used to guide future search results.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, searching ``MP3'' returns not only well-known
sites such as MP3.com, but also www.mp3.box.sk1 _ a South Korean
site that is one of the largest sources of pirated MP3 tunes and
thus extremely popular.
</P>
<P>
   Although Quiver can be used as a straight directory, it also
lets users download a floating toolbar called Qbar that lets them
search from any page. Users can see what sites are surging in
popularity with other surfers. ``We allow you to tap into the
trends early,'' said chief executive Scott Potter.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to make money through ads, partnerships and
private-label versions of the technology for other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto's Clip2.com (www.clip2.com) also uses past search
results. It doesn't try to be a comprehensive directory of the Web.
Instead, it offers a slew of ``topic guides'' on areas from Java
programming to James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   The guides, essentially bookmark files contributed by its users,
are rated daily on their popularity to help new users select the
most useful ones. Clip2 doesn't pay contributors, although it might
in the future. But people whose guides link others to e-commerce
sites can collect a commission from those sites.
</P>
<P>
   Simpli.com of Providence, R.I., tries to narrow searches to make
results more relevant. Chief executive Jeff Stibel points to the
example of someone searching for ``chips.'' Simpli brings up a
pop-up menu where the searcher can specify what kind of chips: fish
and chips, potato chips, chocolate chips, microchips, poker chips,
the defunct TV cop show _ or some other meaning.
</P>
<P>
   If the user selects chocolate chips, a second pop-up menu might
offer choices among cookie recipes, baking sites, Ghirardelli and
Nestle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People enter keywords that are ambiguous,'' Stibel said. ``We
try to identify the context of that keyword and generate a concept
cluster around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the site www.simpli.com is up and running for
consumers, the company's business strategy is to license its
technology to other sites. Sibel said Simpli is in talks with two
major search engines about a licensing deal.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Simpli could allow search sites to charge higher rates
for targeted advertising _ so someone interested in microchips
wouldn't get served an ad for Tollhouse cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to eliminate ``searching'' all together.
Instead, software monitors users' actions and suggests related
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future might be anticipatory search engines, which are
constantly in the background seeking out information relevant to
what you're doing,'' said Shipley.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most promising tools in this category is Kenjin, from
a British company called Autonomy whose U.S. office is in San

   Kenjin ``goes out and finds information for you before you know
what you want to know,'' said Autonomy chief executive Mike Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Kenjin ``reads'' whatever the user has on screen, whether it's
an e-mail, word processing document or Web page and shows a list of
related links and documents in a floating bar on screen. The user
can select the sources of information from the Web, current news
stories, shopping sites or even the user's own hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The software works by analyzing the on-screen document and
identifying its main ideas. ``It understands natural language at a
concept level,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, Autonomy's technology has been strictly for
corporations. The likes of Procter &AMP; Gamble, Lucent and Volkswagen
have all employed it to help employees find information on their
huge intranets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's client roster has propelled its market cap to $4
billion; it is listed on the European exchange Easdaq.
</P>
<P>
   A test version of the consumer version at
www.autonomy.com/kenjin just came out. Lynch said referrals from
the shopping links will underwrite the product.
</P>
<P>
   GuruNet (www.gurunet.com) and Third Voice (www.thirdvoice.com)
aren't search engines per se, but both offer relatively seamless
links to related destinations. Both let users select a word or
phrase on screen and see a pop-up list of related information.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood City's Third Voice is best known for its online ``sticky
notes,'' which let users put electronic Post-it notes on Web pages
with their comments about the page.
</P>
<P>
   The company's latest product, the eponymous Third Voice, is a
small application used along with a regular browser that shows
related links, shopping destinations and discussions.
</P>
<P>
   GuruNet works in word processing, spreadsheet and e-mail
documents, as well as Web pages. Select author ``Stephen Ambrose,''
for instance, and you'll get a pop-up with his bio, a list of his
works, links to Web sites where he's discussed, and links to online
bookstores. Buy a book and GuruNet collects a commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly no one's got it right yet because there are so many
new players on the field,'' said Gail Bronson, a senior analyst for
IPO Monitor in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Bronson, who also works as a strategist for Silicon Valley
startups, was skeptical about some of the companies' business
models.
</P>
<P>
   For sites that hope to make money by referring surfers to
shopping sites, ``there have to be a whole lot of clicks to get
enough action that will be significant to the bottom line,'' she
said. ``They may only get 5 cents or 50 cents a transaction; after
their overhead, what's left?''

 New BofA Chief Cuts Out Community Group  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A leading California community activist group said yesterday that
it failed to reach a multibillion-dollar community lending
agreement with Bank of America despite months of negotiations.
<P>
   Talks between the California Reinvestment Committee and BofA
broke down last year when Hugh McColl, the bank's chief executive,
refused to sign the kind of low-income lending and investment
agreements that have become standard for the state's big financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The CRC, a coalition of nonprofit groups that promotes community
lending, noted in its quarterly newsletter that it no longer has a
``partnership relationship'' with California's largest bank after
McColl failed to write a letter supporting an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   CRC and BofA negotiated for months last year on lending to small
businesses and home buyers in California low-income neighborhoods,
as well as funding for economic development projects. The two sides
reached an agreement in June, but McColl declined to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina bank, known as NationsBank until it bought
San Francisco's BofA in 1998 and took its name, is generally
regarded as a strong supporter of low-income community development
and has unilaterally pledged to lend or invest $70 billion in
California low-income communities over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the hot-tempered McColl has consistently refused to sign
agreements with activist groups on the grounds that outsiders
shouldn't be able to dictate bank policies.
</P>
<P>
   That stance contrasts with those of Wells Fargo, Washington
Mutual, Union Bank of California, California Federal Bank and the
old BofA, all of which signed formal community lending agreements
with CRC endorsed by their respective CEOs. Banks are legally
required to lend in low-income communities, but such CRA agreements
with community groups go much further.
</P>
<P>
   CRC Executive Director Alan Fisher said the coalition continues
to work with BofA on initiatives such as a program to channel
several million dollars to assist small businesses in low-income
communities. But, Fisher said, ``we don't have a real relationship
the way we had with the bank since the late 1980s, like we have
with other major banks in California.''
</P>
<P>
   CRC believes CEO backing is essential for a lending agreement to
have credibility inside a bank, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   A BofA official said the bank is putting into practice the
programs it hammered out with CRC, even without a formal pact. ``We
feel we have a working agreement,'' said Jim Roby, the bank's chief
community development executive in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Under BofA's system, Eugene Taylor, the bank's top executive in
the West, has full authority over regional community lending
programs, making McColl's endorsement unnecessary, Roby said. ``We
felt we could make the (agreement) work on the back of Gene
Taylor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BofA officials point to a long list of programs unveiled over
the past year as evidence of the bank's commitment to community
development in California. This month, for example, the bank
extended a $7 million loan to finance 71 low-income housing units
in West Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, California's other major community lending coalition,
the Greenlining Institute, decided not to seek a formal agreement
with BofA after McColl made his position clear. Instead,
Greenlining consults regularly with the bank on an ad-hoc basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, they appear to be doing a good job,'' said Robert
Gnaizda, policy director for the Greenlining Institute, about
BofA's community lending and economic development spending.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Corporate E-Mail Makes Snail Mail Seem Zippy  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Nearly every business these days talks about e-commerce, but most
companies can't even answer their e-mail, according to a survey to
be released today.
<P>
   NewGate Internet in Sausalito recently e-mailed a simple
question to the country's 100 biggest companies, based on sales.
``Who is your CEO and how can I contact him or her?''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds didn't answer the question within a month.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar survey last year, just under a quarter failed to
respond, a sign that the problem is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be getting more and more e-mail and not be able to
keep up,'' said Beverly Ulbrich of Brightware Inc., a Novato e-mail
management firm that financed and published the survey. ``They
might just have people (answering e-mail) on the side, and that's
not good enough today.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Brightware has a vested interest in highlighting
companies' problems handling e-mail, since it sells software to
route the messages. So The Chronicle did a similar survey of Bay
Area companies and got comparable results.
</P>
<P>
   We attempted to e-mail the same question to 29 of the biggest
local companies, based on stock market value (as reported in the
1999 Chronicle 500). Only about half managed to answer both
questions within nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless (e-mail) is directed to someone specifically, if often
ends up in the dead letter basket,'' said Doug Dickinson, a
spokesman for Linear Technology, which still hadn't responded to
the Chronicle's e-mail after nearly 10 days. Dickinson said
companies have long had the same problem with conventional mail
sent without a specific address.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies _ Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric, McKessonHBOC and
Safeway _ failed to respond either to Brightware's survey or The
Chronicle's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response was unacceptable,'' said PG&AMP;E spokeswoman Renee
Parnell. ``This is not typical. ... We try to respond to simple
questions (like this one) within 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies simply sent automated replies that didn't answer
the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, for example, sent a generic reply that contained answers
to common questions, such as, ``How long has Larry been at
Oracle?'' The e-mail never explained that ``Larry'' referred to
chief executive Larry Ellison or mentioned how to contact him.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo said it couldn't answer the question because normal
e-mail isn't secure. The company said people with questions should
set up an online account, tied to a bank account, then sign in with
a password and Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   Golden West Financial, through its unit World Savings, said in
an e-mail that it first needed to know the ``purpose of your
inquiry'' to direct the question to the proper person.
</P>
<P>
   For two companies _ Franklin Resources and AirTouch
Communications _ The Chronicle failed to find an e-mail address on
their Web sites and did not send a query. AirTouch spokeswoman
Kathy Reinhart says users now need to follow a link to the Vodafone
corporate site to find the address.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many of the firms clearly list the name of
executives and contact information on their Web sites. And some
firms handled the e-mail without a hitch. Yahoo, for instance,
replied with Tim Koogle's name and contact information within 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some companies have installed software to try to
keep up with the flood of e-mail. E-Trade, for instance, didn't
initially respond to the e-mail. But after six days, the company
said an internal check spotted the problem and sent a letter
promising a rapid response if it was still needed. After the
question was posed again, E-Trade answered the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Brightware also sells software to route messages, though it
concedes that some of its own customers never responded to its
queries. Ulbrich said the firms simply haven't fully deployed the
software.

 _ SF CHRON   Golden Rules to Attract Angel Investors 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: In your column last week, you offered some advice on making a
presentation to investors. But how do you get angel or venture
capital investors' attention in the first place, and what are some
tactics for getting them to do more than lend an ear?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Guy Kawasaki, chief executive officer of Garage.com, which links
entrepreneurs and investors, and author of ``Rules for
Revolutionaries,'' offers these 10 tips for raising capital:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Don't outsmart yourself &LR; . Keep your corporate structure simple
and use service pros (lawyers, accountants, bankers) who always do
high-tech startup work. Uncle Joe, the divorce lawyer, might be
cheaper, but you'll regret using him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Don't be paranoid.  &LR; If you're concerned about a competing
investment, explain the basics of your company and ask potential
investors if there is going to be any overlap. Corollary: Take
money from people you like. You're going to be working together for
a long time, so ``chemistry'' counts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Be brief.  &LR; These are the metrics: one-page introductory e-mail
(no attachments); 20-page business plan; 12-slide PowerPoint
presentation; and 40-minute presentation plus 20 minutes for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Acknowledge the competition. &LR;  If you tell potential investors
that you have no competition, they will conclude one of two things:
There's no market or you're clueless. Both are not conducive to
getting funded.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Look for value, not valuation.  &LR; All money is not created equal.
Take money from investors who ``get it'' and have relevant
experience and connections.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Eat when served.  &LR; This is the wisdom of Eugene Kleiner (Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers). When people want to give you money, take
it. Lots of things can happen between now and the next time you
need to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Keep ``burn rates'' low and cash balances high. &LR;  Keep enough
capital on hand to last a year so that you can change your business
model. Watch, don't buy, Super Bowl ads.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Ask for ``less'' than you need.  &LR; If there is anything investors
hate more than bad deals, it's being locked out of good deals. Ask
for less than you need so that you can declare victory as soon as
possible. Then, graciously ``let'' others get in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Let a thousand flowers bloom. &LR;  Sometimes the most ``logical''
investors won't bite. On the other hand, investors in unrelated
fields might. Don't be proud: Take the money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Don't let the bozos grind you down. &LR;  Some of the most successful
entrepreneurs couldn't raise money for months. The founders of
Cisco are one example. Frankly, if you give up, you aren't an
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Kawasaki apparently knows what he's talking about.
Yesterday, Garage.com said it completed a $27 million financing
round with private, venture capital and institutional investors.

 Zhone Finds New Ways to Get Cash  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
When Zhone Technologies Inc. of Oakland raised $500 million in
capital last November, it set a fund-raising record for a
communications equipment startup and broke some traditional rules
for high-tech investing and building a business in the process.
<P>
   Zhone's objective from the outset was to ramp up as quickly as
possible to become a leader in building networks that deliver
voice, video, Internet and entertainment services to homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that goal, it adopted an unconventional plan. It
developed and acquired the technologies it needed. Instead of
taking the usual fund-raising route and getting capital in $20
million or $50 million increments, Zhone quickly snared a
half-billion dollars. And rather than rely on venture capital or
corporate investors, it tapped corporate takeover and leveraged
buyout firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhone is breaking the rules with its build-and-buy strategy,''
said Dick Kramlich, general partner of New Enterprise Associates, a
Menlo Park venture capital firm that invested $55 million in Zhone.
``It's also a unique hybrid model where a variety of investors
committed $500 million that can be drawn down as the company needs
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhone is the brainchild of Mory Ejabat, the former chief
executive officer of Ascend Communications in Alameda, and Ascend
co-founder and former Chief Technology Officer Jeanette Symons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most startup companies are caught up in a funding cycle that
limits their product vision and slows time to market,'' said
Ejabat. ``They use funding rounds to develop technologies, then
create sales and support channels, and finally to expand their
product set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go raise money every three to six months and
dilute our efforts,'' he explained. ``Zhone's strategy is to
deliver a total solution very rapidly by taking advantage of
existing technologies and expertise to fuel parallel development
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Ejabat, who came to California from Tehran,
Iran, in 1970 to attend college, had already tried the slow,
incremental route to high-tech success. Ascend started in 1989 and
received $19 million in venture capital financing over four rounds.
The maker of Internet switching gear went public in 1994 and was
purchased last year by Lucent Technologies for $24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ejabat and Symons left Ascend and pondered their next venture. A
major problem they decided to tackle was to deliver voice, data and
video to the home or small office quickly and inexpensively through
one provider and any means of connection.
</P>
<P>
   Zhone does not plan to provide the Internet, voice, cable TV or
wireless communications services. Instead, it intends to sell gear
to telecommunications and cable companies and Internet service
providers so that they can provide all-in-one services to customers
any way they want to receive them _ by copper or fiber-optic lines,
coaxial cable or wireless connections. Such service could save the
bother and expense of dealing with multiple providers of voice
lines, Internet service and cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Ejabat and Symons figured they needed about half a billion
dollars for their ambitious venture. They approached two well-known
corporate buyout firms, Texas Pacific Group in San Francisco, which
was started by former advisers to the Texas Bass brothers, and
Kohlberg Kravis &AMP; Roberts in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew most VCs don't invest that much money,'' said Ejabat.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas Pacific and KKR heard about Zhone's plans to dominate
the so-called ``final-mile'' or ``local-loop'' network market, each
firm offered to commit all the outside capital. Ejabat declined.
``I'm not a control freak,'' he said, ``but I didn't want the
majority of the company owned by one organization.''
</P>
<P>
   KKR and TPG ended up committing $150 million each. New
Enterprise Associates, which also backed Ascend, put up $55
million. Ejabat, Symons and a few other Ascend recruits put up $50
million. The California Public Employees Retirement System also
invested $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The investors were all willing to back Ejabat's notion that
although proprietary technology is important, it is also imperative
to collaborate with others to get to market quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are integrators of different techniques,'' Ejabat
said. ``We create and we combine technologies to put together a
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhone lost little time making a major acquisition to augment its
internal development. In December, it bought Premisys
Communications of Fremont for about $240 million and then sold off
its manufacturing operations. Ejabat liked Premisys' proven
products that which  &LR; link voice and digital networks, its
employees, established customer base and its price.
</P>
<P>
   Although Premisys was the top-performing Bay Area initial public
offering in 1995, it recently missed some sales targets and its
stock price tumbled from a peak of $60 to below $10 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Zhone also bought Los Angeles hardware platform developer CAG
Technologies &LR; , &LR;  for more than $10 million in December, and has
other deals in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The company also broke ground last week on a 300,000-square-foot
corporate campus for 1,500 employees across the freeway from the
Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland.

 Bay Area Rolling in Venture Gold  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The torrent of venture capital flowing to dot-com and other
startups reached flood proportions last year.
<P>
   Venture capital firms invested $36.5 billion in nearly 3,000
promising private U.S. companies in 1999. That was more than the
total invested during the previous three years combined.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of the total amount of VC investments in the
United States _ $14.6 billion _ was funneled to 1,081 Bay Area
companies, according to VentureOne Corp, a San Francisco research
company. That was more than was invested in all U.S. venture-backed
companies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter alone, $6 billion was invested in 333
local companies. That was 30 percent more than was invested locally
during all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The median-size local investment in the final quarter of 1999
was $13 million _ double the $6.5 million investment in the
year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the money went to Internet-related companies,
including information technology and telecommunications companies
that build gear to run the Web and dot-com companies that sell
goods and services on it.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are moving quickly to capitalize on the surging
initial public offering market. Last year, 126 Northern California
companies sold stock to the public for the first time, and the
average gain from offering price to end of trading on December 31
was a stunning 358 percent. Nationwide, 504 companies launched
IPOs, with an average gain of 191 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-related companies were the biggest winners of venture
capital, raising more than four times what they raised in 1998,
according to the National Venture Capital Association and Venture
Economics. E-commerce and Web content companies required the most
money to quickly build name recognition and leadership position in
their respective niches.
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce companies that raised the most money in the past
quarter to advertise heavily and bolster their brand image
included: Petstore.com, an Emeryville online retailer of pet
supplies, which raised $97 million; iMotors, a San Francisco online
used-car buying service, which raised $57.7 million; and Wine.com,
a Palo Alto online wine retailer, which raised $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   Startups are starting to raise almost as much money in late
private financing rounds as they do by selling shares to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Telocity, the Cupertino provider of high-speed,
self-installed Internet access services to the residential market.
After raising $127.5 million in its third-round private financing
in December, it announced plans in early January to raise as much
as $150 million more in an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big push to get companies into the public market
quicker,'' said Jean Yaremchuk, vice president of research and
technology for VentureOne. ``Four years ago, it took startups about
six years to go public. Now, it's about two years on average.``
</P>
<P>
   Another change is that startups increasingly are tapping other
sources for private financing besides traditional venture capital
firms that raise money from institutional investors such as company
pension and college endowment funds.
</P>
<P>
   They often turn to wealthy individuals, or angel capital, for
seed financing. As their cash requirements balloon, fast-track
companies frequently link with corporate investors for financial as
well as strategic support.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in its last private financing round, Telocity got
$57 million from such VC firms as Bessemer Holdings and Soros
Private Equity Partners. It raised even more _ a $70.5 million
package that included cash and $33 million worth of TV and online
production _ from General Electric, NBC, NBC Internet and
ValueVision International.
</P>
<P>
   Now, startups are even turning to corporate buyout funds and
merger-and-acquisition specialists. For example, Advanced TelCom
Group, the Santa Rosa company that received the most local VC money
in the fourth quarter, raised $175 million, including a major
investment from Texas Pacific Group, an M&AMP;A specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Since the summer of 1998, ATG has raised $440 million to deploy
its digital telephone network to midsize cities.
</P>
<P>
   The local company that raised the most private capital from From
 &LR; October 1 through December 30 was Zhone Technologies (see &LR;  story
below) &LR; . The Oakland company raised $500 million but did not show
up on the VentureOne radar screen because the private placement was
managed by an investment bank (Credit Suisse First Boston) and
wasn't a classic VC deal.
</P>
<P>
   Zhone illustrates the blurring of lines involving private equity
investments. With the huge success of Internet and other high-tech
initial public offerings, all sorts of investors are clamoring to
back early-stage companies. In addition to traditional venture
capital and wealthy individual investors, more companies are
setting up internal ``corporate development'' funds.
Merger-and-acquisition firms and even a few closed-end mutual funds
are entering the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the torrid pace of venture capital investing, few see
any slowdown. That is because new VC funds are forming at a record
clip. It used to be that venture capital firms raised money in the
first part of the year and shifted focus to investing it in the
second half. That is no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of last year, VC funds raised $9.9
billion, according to VentureOne. That came on top $5.5 billion in
the third quarter and $4.6 billion in the second quarter. Since all
this money needs somewhere to go, it is unlikely that entrepreneurs
will run short of financial fuel anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the economy remains under control with employment
and inflation in check, the outlook remains extremely strong,''
said Dick Kramlich, a general partner of New Enterprise Associates
in Menlo Park. ``Capital formation is alive and well. The
opportunities are as good as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   NEA invested in 38 local deals last year, more than any other VC
firm. It was followed by Sequoia Capital, which invested in 27
local companies, Accel Partners, 25; Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers, 21; and U.S. Venture Partners, 20.

MARKET PLACE: BOND MARKET APPEARS WARY OF AMAZON.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see TECH-HACKERS)  
 (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors have long been happy to suspend their disbelief when
they buy shares of Amazon.com. Jeff Bezos' plan to spend whatever
he must to build Amazon.com into the must-stop for Web shopping has
produced losses of $882 million since its creation in 1994. And
even though the company reported that its book business actually
made money in the most recent quarter, Amazon.com's overall
business is still years away from turning a profit.
</P>
<P>
   None of this matters to stock investors, who have pushed
Amazon.com's stock up nearly 20 percent since the fourth-quarter
results were announced. But bond investors are another matter
altogether. Pleasing them is proving to be a bit more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Amazon.com announced its return to the capital
markets with a convertible bond offering that is expected to raise
$578 million from European investors. The deal is expected to be
done late Thursday and to be priced in euros to yield 6.875 percent
to 7.375 percent. The bonds will mature in 10 years and,
interestingly, carry a sweetener intended to protect bondholders
should Amazon.com's stock price plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Convertible bonds are hybrid securities that give investors the
safety of an interest payment while also providing the potential
for price appreciation since the bonds move in tandem with the
issuing company's stock. The bonds can be converted to common
shares at a specified price, known as the conversion price.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's bond offering is revealing on several counts.
First, its lofty 7 percent or so interest rate is considerably
higher than the 4.75 percent rate Amazon.com paid on a $1.25
billion convertible issue last January, demonstrating that even
Internet companies can be hurt by rising interest rates. After the
deal, Amazon.com's interest payments will rise to $125 million a
year, from $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of the deal, like the bonds' conversion price,
will not be known until the sale later this week, a coupon around 7
percent, quite high for the convertible market, indicates that
investors are not exactly clamoring to buy and have to be lured in
with a rich yield. This is confirmed by the fact that Amazon.com
added some protection for buyers of the bonds, promising to
renegotiate the price at which the bonds will convert to common
stock at one and two years after the offering if Amazon.com's stock
has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In the convertible bond world, such sweeteners are called
resets, and they are somewhat unusual. One money manager
specializing in convertible bonds said that companies with debt
rated below investment grade, as Amazon.com is with its triple-C
rating, did not often use them. ``Of the many convertible deals
done in the past three months by companies losing money, none of
them had resets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't Amazon.com simply issue stock to raise funds? Even
though the company's shares have rallied in recent days and closed
Tuesday at $83.125, they are still well off their December high of
$113. Management may have worried that a stock offering would
depress the stock further. But taking the bond offering to Europe
made some observers wonder whether United States investors had
turned up their noses when approached about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company disputed any notion that the bonds were a tough sell
stateside. Bill Curry, an Amazon.com spokesman, said the company
took the bond offering to Europe as part of its effort to establish
the company's brand overseas. Proceeds of the deal will help expand
Amazon.com's core business, its European operations and propel
Amazon.com into new markets, Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fresh funds will probably go toward investments in
other Internet retailers. In January and February alone, Amazon.com
took stakes in Audible.com, a public company that delivers
entertainment and information audio on the Internet;
Greenlight.com, a private company that sells automobiles on the
Web; and Living.com, a privately held retailer of home furnishings.
Amazon.com also increased its investment in Drugstore.com in
January.
</P>
<P>
   These are not simply passive stakes in other Internet companies.
In exchange for giving these companies space on its online shopping
center and promoting their offerings, Amazon.com receives millions
of dollars over a period of years. For instance, in its
fourth-quarter earnings release, Amazon.com said that partnerships
with other Internet retailers represented more than $500 million in
revenue commitments over the next five years. Among the deals
announced this year, Drugstore.com will pay Amazon.com $105 million
over three years; Audible.com has agreed to pay $30 million over
three years, and Greenlight.com has promised to pay $82.5 million
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Behind these investments is Bezos' drive for revenue growth,
something he needs almost as much as the bond financing later this
week. Of course, the bulk of the company's operations continue to
generate rapid sales growth, rising 170 percent in 1999 from the
previous year to $1.64 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the revenue from outside partnerships is much more prized.
That is because it is expected to generate much higher profits than
those from the company's book, toy or music businesses, which
require outlays for warehouses, servicing and distribution. The
partnership costs consist mostly of Web site integration and
servicing.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Wall Street expect the partnerships to make sizable
contributions to Amazon.com's revenue in coming years. In a recent
report, Preston M. Harrington, convertible research analyst at
Merrill Lynch, estimated that Amazon.com could sign 25 partnerships
in the next two to three years that would generate an incremental
$375 million of revenue a year. That is a bit more than the company
generated in book sales during the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington may be right. But what if these companies do not
exist long enough to pay Amazon.com the revenue it expects to
receive?
</P>
<P>
   Dalton Chandler, a stock analyst at Needham &AMP; Co., is one of the
few analysts currently uttering cautionary words on Amazon.com. He
rates the company's stock a ``hold'' and wonders about the
certainty on Wall Street that Amazon.com's deals will come to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think it was so strange if Living.com or
Drugstore.com were substantial companies in their own right,''
Chandler said. ``But there's no assurance that these companies will
be in business 12 months from now.'' &QL;

Marist poll in December found a 59 percent to 15 percent spread.
Gore leads former Sen. Bill Bradley 50 percent to 35 percent in the

   VOTER INTEREST IN CALIFORNIA: Tens of thousands of Californians
swamped registrars' offices, post offices, fire stations and

to enter a party affiliation for the March 7 presidential primary.
California adopted an open primary system under a voter initiative
approved in 1996, but the votes only count toward a nomination if
the voter is registered in the same party as the candidate for whom
he votes. In recent weeks, John McCain's supporters have sought to
lure at least 30,000 Democratic and independent voters to register
as Republicans through chain e-mails, news conferences and phone
banks. McCain's communications director, Dan Schnur, said counties
reported that new registrations and reregistrations seemed to be
more Republican than Democratic. The office of the California
secretary of state said more than 50,000 people registered on
Monday alone.

<P>
   The efficiency of American workers surged in the last six months
of 1999, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. With these final
numbers, the 1990s entered the books as the decade that produced
the greatest improvement in productivity since the golden 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity, an arcane statistic, nevertheless explains _ more
than any other single statistic _ how the American economy can grow
as strongly as it has the last four years without generating more
inflation. Workers, in effect, are producing much more without
having to be paid more, and that takes the pressure off corporate
America to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of data keeps alive the expectation that the economy
will keep growing strongly with low inflation and that means the
Federal Reserve will not have to end the expansion,'' said Kermit
L. Schoenholtz, chief economist at Salomon Smith Barney, the Wall
Street unit of the Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the improvement came in the last four years, when
computers became much faster and the Internet expanded rapidly,
suggesting to some economists that the new technologies played a
significant role in lifting labor productivity. Others insist that
technology has made only a small contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in stocks, perhaps reassured that the expansion has
more running room, pushed up share prices after the Labor
Department announced that productivity rose at an annual rate of 5
percent in both the third and fourth quarters. The Nasdaq market,
where most of the Internet companies are listed, jumped 105.73
points, to 4,427.50, another record, and the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 51.81, to 10,957.60.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates also eased off in bond market trading, one
interpretation being that the Federal Reserve _ while still
committed to one or two more small rate increases similar to the
quarter-point increase last week _ won't raise interest rates
enough to so discourage spending that the expansion is brought to
an end. At nearly nine years, it is the longest in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity rises when a worker produces more goods or services
in an hour on the job than he did the prior year. A telephone
operator who handled 100 toll calls in 1998, for example, handled
103 in 1999. This extra revenue can then be used to raise profits
or the wage paid to the operator, or both profits and wages. In any
of these cases, customer tolls do not have to rise to cover the
extra outlay.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the early 1970s, the productivity growth rate fell
sharply, averaging no more than 1.5 percent a year until 1995, a
sea change from the 1960s when the average growth rage was a
spectacular 2.9 percent a year. Productivity no longer made
possible the improvement in wages, and living standards, that had
benefited so many Americans in the 1960s. And to compensate,
millions of people worked longer hours or at more than one job to
keep from falling behind.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in late 1995, productivity surged. The growth rate
jumped to 2.6 percent annually, on average, pulling up the
performance for the entire decade to 2 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest numbers, announced on Tuesday, reinforced this
improvement. Productivity in the fourth-quarter rose at an
unusually strong annual rate of 5 percent, the Labor Department
said. An earlier third-quarter estimate was revised up to 5 percent
from 4.9 percent, and thanks to the last six months, the growth
rate for all four-quarters of the last year of the century averaged
2.9 percent, the highest of any single year in the 1990s except
1992, when there was a momentary jump.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that the productivity drought that has afflicted
the United States since the early 1970s is now over? Has a ``New
Economy'' arisen, one in which faster computers, the Internet and
the new high-speed communications network have resulted in a
permanent improvement in labor productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists argue that this is the case. But others note
that the rise in productivity coincided with a jump in economic
growth as a run-of-the-mill economic expansion suddenly turned into
a boom in late 1995. While technology plays a role, they say, the
booming economy is the main cause of the rising productivity growth
rate, which will taper off once the economy inevitably slows or
falls into recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to know how much is due to strong economic
growth and how much to the new technologies until the current
business cycle runs its full length,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief
economist at Merrill Lynch, who gives most of the credit to
technology. ``We are seeing things in this cycle that are
unprecedented. Productivity is accelerating late in the expansion,
when it should be easing off. That is because of the new
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that productivity surges when economic growth
surges, whether that strong growth comes early or late in an
expansion. During the 1980s, for example, the strongest growth came
early in the expansion, the usual pattern, and the productivity
growth rate, in response, rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent
from 1982 through 1986 _ virtually the same performance as the late
1990s _ only to taper off as the economy grew more slowly in the
last years of the '80s expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Productivity is very sensitive to growth,'' said Robert
Gordon, a Northwestern University economist. ``When the economy is
growing above normal, the output of a worker also jumps. That is
because companies, faced with a growing demand for their products
and services, find ways to squeeze more output from their
employees. And when the economy slows, the same workers find
themselves producing less.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Manufacturing has been an enormous contributor to the latest
surge in productivity, rising at an annual rate of 10.7 percent in
the fourth quarter, and 6.4 percent for all of 1999, the best
performance since 1971. Nearly half the latest improvement came in
the manufacture of computers and other electronic gear.
</P>
<P>
   Citing this bias, Gordon argues that the productivity in
manufacturing is narrowly focused, while Steinberg sees in the same
data a much broader improvement. That is partly a result of new
technology, he said, and partly a result of a strong rise in
capital investment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final outcome of this debate, the productivity
report on Tuesday had buried in it more evidence that labor costs
are rising rather mildly, even if the productivity growth rate
might justify bigger raises. Unit labor costs in the fourth quarter
fell by 1 percent, which means that the cost of producing a
particular piece of merchandise fell.
</P>
<P>
   That is a result of three factors. The total output of goods and
services rose faster than the total hours needed to produce them,
the Labor Department said, and compensation costs _ wages, bonuses,
benefits and stock options _ rose at an annual rate of 4 percent,
down from 4.7 percent in the third quarter and 4.8 percent in the
second quarter.

MINOR LEAGUE STADIUM DEAL IS NEAR FOR STATEN ISLAND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is
nearing completion of a deal to construct what would be the
country's most expensive minor league baseball stadium, a $71
million complex near the Staten Island ferry terminal that would be
built entirely with taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, the Staten Island
Yankees, which play at the lowest level of the legendary Yankees
farm system, would pay a modest rent and control the stadium
year-round. The team, which plays 38 home games a year, would not
have to pay any money for construction and would reap half of any
advertising revenue and 70 percent of the revenues from any events
booked into the stadium during the 327 days annually that the
Yankees would not play there.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium would be the first new professional ballpark in the
city since Shea Stadium opened in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration and the Staten Island borough
president, Guy V. Molinari, hailed the project as a boon to the
neglected area surrounding St. George Station, where the ballpark
would be built.
</P>
<P>
   The city would have the right to use the stadium for about 30
public events. ``These things are very popular, affordable family
entertainment,'' Michael G. Carey, president of the city's Economic
Development Corp., said Tuesday. Carey said that the lease
negotiations with the Staten Island Yankees should be completed by
Friday. The 6,500-seat stadium, which has already been approved by
the City Council, would include 21 luxury boxes, a restaurant, a
clubhouse, an arcade and a novelty store.
</P>
<P>
   Many cities have proved themselves willing to provide enormous
subsidies to lure professional teams, but the cost of the project
for a team in the Class A New York-Penn League is extraordinary,
said Robert Baade, an expert in the economics of professional
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated price tag is well above that for the $34 million
minor league stadium that opened last year in Newark, N.J., and the
$18 million stadium in Fishkill, N.Y., that is home to the Yankees'
Penn League rival, the Hudson Valley Renegades. Leases for those
stadiums have revenue-sharing similar to what is being negotiated
for the Staten Island ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Since major league clubs cut their financing for farm clubs in
the early 1990s, minor league teams have increasingly moved to
those cities willing to build new parks. At the same time, minor
league baseball has drawn new fans, because of relatively low
ticket prices, intimate settings and the chance to talk to the
players from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Some local officials and analysts criticized the project,
calling it another gift from Giuliani to a borough that provided
the margin of victory in his 1993 race against David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because baseball is played on a diamond, it doesn't mean
you have to build a jewel box,'' said John Sabini, a Councilman
from Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In separate projects for the borough, the city is also
rebuilding the decrepit Staten Island ferry terminal for more than
$80 million, subsidizing construction of the nearby National
Lighthouse Museum and paying for a new home for the Staten Island
Institute of Arts and Sciences. Giuliani has also promised to close
the Fresh Kills landfill by 2002, a pledge that helped secure the
loyalty of Staten island voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as reparations for the landfill so much as
the city of New York getting something wonderful,'' Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
   But economists questioned whether there would be any economic
benefit from a minor league team that plays only 38 home games a
year. They said the deal could set a pattern for large public
subsidies at a time when the Giuliani administration is pressing to
build a $30 million minor league stadium for the Mets in Brooklyn,
as well as major league stadiums for both the Yankees and Mets, and
possibly the New York Jets football team. The total cost to
taxpayers could exceed $2 billion if all the plans come to
fruition. But the stadiums, critics argue, provide mostly seasonal
jobs and redistributes money spent on entertainment, rather than
generates additional spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about serving the interests of the private sector
through public subsidies,'' said Baade, a professor of economics at
Lake Forest College in Illinois. ``We're not talking about an
industry that's large enough to have an impact on an economy as
large and diverse as New York's.''
</P>
<P>
   The project has wide political support on Staten Island,
although some residents are concerned about potential traffic
tie-ups when commuters pour off the ferry and head for their cars
at the same time baseball fans are trying to get into the parking
lots to see a 7 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   During a City Council hearing last December, Jerome X.
O'Donovan, a local councilman who favored an alternative location
on Staten Island, pushed for more community-based events at the
stadium and additional parking, while complaining about how the
project's cost had soared well beyond Giuliani's original $20
million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration and Molinari prefer to put the cost
of the stadium at $29.5 million, not $71 million. ``The other costs
are not the true costs of constructing the stadium,'' Molinari
said, ``but infrastructure improvements that must be made whether
or not there's a stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   But the city's scaled-down figure does not include the cost of
buying the land on which the stadium is to be built, architectural,
engineering and construction management fees, the environmental
cleanup, landscaping, parking lot construction and an esplanade.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which moved to Staten Island last year from Watertown,
N.Y., drew an average of 3,183 fans a game. The team is owned by
the Getzler family and members of the Steinbrenner family, who also
have a stake in the major league team.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Getzler, the club's chief operating officer, disputed
criticism that the Yankees were getting a sweetheart lease. ``The
reality of the situation is that it's probably the most substantial
lease of any minor league affiliate,'' he said, ``in terms of the
amount of money going back to government.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Getzler said, the city could get as much as $1
million a year in rent and fees. City officials estimated the
stadium would generate $175 million in economic activity in the
life of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of its agreement, the team would have the option
of walking away from the lease if it failed to make a profit for
three consecutive years.

REUTERS' SHARES SOAR ON INTERNET STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Reuters Group PLC said Tuesday that it planned to
reposition itself as a high-flying Internet concern. Word of the
financial news service's ambitions caused shares of Reuters to soar
23 percent, their largest one-day gain in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters plans to invest $802 million in the next four years to
shift its content delivery systems to the Internet, including the
creation of a Reuters branded World Wide Web portal that will
compete directly with the same sites that now license content from
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters, which is based here, said it would also develop a
wireless news delivery system for handheld devices and form a joint
venture to build a Web site for private investors in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters disclosed its Internet strategy Tuesday as it reported a
10.6 percent increase in net income for 1999 compared to the year
before. The company is under pressure to accelerate its growth even
as many core products, like its financial-news terminals for
professional traders, have begun to mature.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters Web site, which is expected to be operating by
mid-year, is expected to compete for many of the same Internet
users who view its news on the Web sites of 900 clients, including
Yahoo and C-net.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are playing the Internet card,'' said Anthony de
Larrinaga, an analyst at S G Securities here. ``It's encouraging
that they are throwing a lot of money at this, but it remains a
question if they'll get any of it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Reuters jumped 232 pence, to 1,239 pence, or $19.98.
The company's American depository receipts _ each representing six
shares _ soared $26.125, to $125.50, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to take a charge of $479 million in the next
two years for the cost of shifting its services to the Internet.
Peter Job, chief executive of Reuters, said that the charge would
``significantly lower'' profit this year. Reuters said it hoped
that the change would save (PS)150 million annually by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Tuesday that profit for 1999 rose to (PS)425
million, or $681.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its reorganization, Reuters said it planned to offer
shares of its Greenhouse Fund _ which invests in Internet and
technology companies _ and its Instinet trading service to the
public by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   The company also forged a joint venture with Multex.com to
develop a Web site for the growing community of private investors
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Reuters entered an alliance with Aether Systems to
create a wireless system to distribute Reuters news and data to
mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is changing dramatically the landscape of
Reuters' customer base,'' Job said. ``Reuters is no longer about
the hundreds of thousands but about the tens of millions, in
customer terms. The Internet just opens up a whole new door for
us.''

ADVERTISING: MAKEOVER CONSULTANT DECIDES TO PRACTICE WHAT IT
PREACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A consulting company known for rebranding advertisers
is rebranding itself.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel &AMP; Gale in New York, the corporate identity consultant
that recast MasterCharge as MasterCard, dubbed Xerox ``the document
company'' and molded U.S. Steel into USX is adopting a new name,
effective Wednesday: Siegelgale.
</P>
<P>
   If the snappy new moniker seems like a Web address, that's no
coincidence. One goal of the renaming, to be promoted in a campaign
with a budget of $6 million, is to focus attention on the Internet
work that Siegelgale does for dot-coms like Lycos and Truste,
traditional marketers like American Express and Eastman Kodak and
``click and mortar'' hybrids like Petsmart, which has a Web site at
www.petsmart.com, and Toys ``R'' Us, with a Web site at
www.toysrus.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We founded our interactive media practice five years ago,''
said Alan Siegel, chairman and chief executive at Siegelgale. ``We
were one of the first companies to join the space in a serious way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've faced up to the fact that we didn't present
ourselves accurately and effectively,'' he added, as ``a major
force in the e-commerce world. We have to practice what we
preach.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity makeover for Siegel &AMP; Gale, which was founded 31
years ago, is indicative of how the Internet continues to change
the way businesses of all types operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Established companies need to do more to be competitive,''
said Scott Lerman, Siegelgale's president.
</P>
<P>
   Did the executives at Siegel &AMP; Gale consider some fanciful
coined word as the new name, along the lines of Allegis, Ameritech,
Amstar, Diageo or Novartis?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some thought that the fastest way to signal a change
is to change the name of a company,'' Siegel said, ``but that could
be a strategic mistake,'' particularly for ``professional service
firms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our case,'' he added, ``it was more appropriate to make a
minor adjustment in the name and emphasize the changes in our
marketing communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ``our corporate name and our URL (www.siegelgale.com)
are one and the same,'' Siegel noted. ``That's something we also
recommend to our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   When Siegelgale opened in 1969, five employees worked at a
single office in New York and revenue was estimated at $120,000. In
1998, when the company was bought back by top managers after 14
years of ownership by Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, there were 240 employees
and revenue of $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Projections for this year call for Siegelgale to have 432
employees in offices in London and Los Angeles as well as New York
and revenue of $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, created in house, carries the theme ``Ideas that
transform,'' which echoes a thought expressed by Lerman about
working in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether names are imaginative or generic, you also have to
concentrate on what the experience is once you get to the site,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is composed of print advertisements, radio
commercials, posters in airports, online advertising and the
corporate Web site, which has been redesigned. The focus will be on
offering examples of projects that Siegelgale has completed for
clients in realms from identity consulting and advertising to
strategic marketing and information architecture.
</P>
<P>
   One print ad describes how Siegelgale created, designed and
branded an e-commerce Web site for Lycos at shop.lycos.com. For T.
Rowe Price, the company designed and built a Web site at
www.troweprice.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects include the transfer of the American Express
Financial Direct brand to the Internet with a site at
www.americanexpress.com/direct and, for Ernst &AMP; Young, the creation
of a character named Ernie featured on a customer Web site at
ernie.ey.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to raise the noise level,'' said David Webster,
director for interactive media at Siegelgale, ``and let people know
what we've become.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two types of repositioning exercises,'' he added.
``One is aspirational: `This is where we intend to go.' This is the
other, `We've already become this but we're not perceived this
way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel &AMP; Gale confronts growing competition from a wide variety
of rivals. There are other identity consultants, many of which are
part of larger companies; they include Interbrand, a unit of the
Omnicom Group; Landor Associates, owned by Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.;
and Lippincott &AMP; Margulies, part of the Mercer Consulting Group
unit of Marsh &AMP; McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors include management consultants like McKinsey&AMP;
Co.; consultants that specialize in e-commerce like Frog, Sapient
and Zefer Corp.; and interactive agencies like U SWeb/CKS Group,
which agreed in December to be acquired by Whittman-Hart, a
computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But can any of them claim a new name as nifty as Siegelgale?  &QL;

 THE AD CAMPAIGN: McCAIN LAUNCHES A NEW SALVO 
 (rk) 
 By PETER MARKS  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 30-second advertisement from the McCain campaign is a
companion to another attack ad that also began running on Monday in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Stevens Reed Curcio &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Sen. John McCain, in a blue suit and red tie,
stares into the lens of the camera, which slowly zooms in on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: McCain: ``I guess it was bound to happen. Governor
Bush's campaign is getting desperate, with a negative ad about me.
The fact is, I'll use the surplus money to fix Social Security, cut
your taxes and pay down the debt. Governor Bush uses all of the
surplus for tax cuts, with not one new penny for Social Security or
the debt. His ad twists the truth like Clinton. We're all pretty
tired of that. As president, I'll be conservative and always tell
you the truth. No matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The senator repeats one of his chief criticisms of
Gov. George W. Bush's $483 billion tax-cut proposal _ that it does
not provide money from a budget surplus to shore up Social
Security. McCain's plan does allocate more resources for that
purpose, but its tax cut amounts to less than half of Bush's.
Still, what has not been mentioned in the flurry of commercials on
the subject is that both proposals are based on projected surpluses
that may never materialize.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: McCain's placid demeanor only partly masks the
vehemence of the advertisement, which contains a fairly dramatic
dig at Bush, at least as far as Republicans are concerned: that one
of his newest commercials ``twists the truth like Clinton.'' In the
exchange of attack ads this week, McCain appears to be holding back
less than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's newest commercial, in which he quotes The Wall Street
Journal as reporting that the McCain campaign is ``crawling with
lobbyists,'' comes close to the level of vitriol of the McCain
commercials. Up to now, the news media have been reporting more
regularly on the enmity between former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice
President Al Gore. But with the latest 30-second salvos on South
Carolina television, the relationship between Bush and McCain may
appear to viewers to be even more antagonistic.

AN EARLY BULLET PROBABLY KILLED DIALLO, PATHOLOGIST SAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The pathologist who performed the autopsy on
Amadou Diallo's body testified Tuesday that the bullet that tore
through his aorta and spinal cord, and probably caused his death,
came early in the barrage of 19 shots that struck him as he stood
in the lobby of his Bronx apartment building one year ago. The
doctor said that at least one bullet hit Diallo while he was lying
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, he's on the way down or down,'' said Dr. Joseph
Cohen, the final prosecution witness in the murder trial of four
New York City police officers who fired 41 shots at Diallo, who was
unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet that entered his lower right leg and lodged near his
knee had to have struck him while he was down, Cohen said, and two
others, including one that entered the bottom of his shoe and
exited from the top, very likely did.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers spent much of the day cross-examining Cohen in
an effort to raise doubts about his conclusions. One suggested that
he was grasping at straws. ``No, I'm not,'' Cohen replied.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen left the New York City medical examiner's office last year
and is now the chief pathologist in Riverside County, Calif. The
defense plans to call its own pathologist in an effort to refute
Cohen's statements.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors intended Cohen's testimony and explicit
photographs of the wounds as a powerful ending to their case. They
have presented 12 witness over four days who testified about the
lighting at the scene of the shooting, the recovery of bullets and
fragments and Diallo's appearance in the hours before he was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging witnesses may have been three people who lived
near Diallo and heard the shooting. Each said there was a pause
between two rounds of shots, and two who may have been close enough
to hear voices said they did not hear any of the officers call out
to Diallo or identify themselves as police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the graphic nature of Tuesday's testimony, Diallo's
mother, Kadiatou, did not attend the session. Diallo's father,
Saikou, who did attend, said it was a ``very difficult'' day. ``I
said a strong prayer for my son,'' he said. ``I said a strong
prayer when I saw how he struggled before he died.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Cohen said, Diallo, who was 5 feet 6 inches tall and
weighed 150 pounds, was shot in the aorta, spinal cord, lungs,
liver, spleen, kidney, intestines, arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little or no bleeding from nearly all the wounds,
and ``very little bleeding into the clothing,'' he said, leading
him to conclude that the shot to the aorta, which left a hole an
inch and a half wide, was among the first. Such a hole, he said,
would cause an immediate and precipitous drop in blood pressure and
decrease the likelihood of bleeding from other wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only wound of all the 19 that would account for such
an immediate drop in blood pressure,'' Cohen said. About 45 percent
of Diallo's blood was found in his abdominal and chest cavity, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he could not be sure of the precise order of the
shots, only that the bullet that pierced the aorta and spinal cord
was among the first. That bullet went through the spinal cord but
did not sever it completely, Cohen said. But it did enough damage
to make Diallo a paraplegic, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo would have fallen to the floor within a few seconds of
the wound, Cohen said, adding, ``He also developed,
instantaneously, an inability to support himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any number'' of the wounds could have been inflicted while
Diallo was falling to the floor, he said. And three, he said,
``were consistent with him actually being on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullet that entered his lower right leg and lodged near his
knee after shattering his tibia and fibula struck him when he was
``necessarily down,'' Cohen said. He added that hemorrhaging in
that bullet's track was nearly ``imperceptible,'' an indication
that the shot came after the aorta was hit.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, defense lawyers suggested that the
bullet might have ricocheted, making it appear, falsely, that it
had been fired when Diallo was on the ground. But Cohen said that
could not have happened because the bullet was intact when it was
recovered and not deformed in the way a bullet would be if it had
ricocheted.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding two other bullets, Cohen said that he was less sure
that they were fired when Diallo was on the floor, but that it was
very likely that he was. One pierced the sole of Diallo's shoe,
passed through the middle toe on his right foot and exited through
the top of the shoe. The other entered the front of Diallo's left
shin and passed upward through his leg.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, after the prosecution rested and the jury left the
courtroom, each defense lawyer made a motion for the judge to
dismiss all charges in the case or throw out the more serious
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The officers each face two counts of second-degree murder _ one
based on a theory of intentional murder, the other on a theory of
depraved indifference to human life _ and one count of reckless
endangerment, the least serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Joseph C. Teresi said that he would reserve his decision
on all of the motions.

ACCORD ENDS BOYCOTT BY JAPAN OPPOSITION

<P>
   TOKYO _ In a carefully worked out compromise, opposition
politicians agreed Tuesday to return to Parliament, ending an
11-day boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators dropped their demand that Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi apologize for pushing through without debate a bill to
reduce the number of Parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Obuchi's governing coalition committed itself to
hold a new debate over the his policies for the current session,
which were detailed in a speech to Parliament that the opposition
boycotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is desirable to achieve the opposition's participation in
the Diet sessions and operate parliamentary functions properly,''
Obuchi told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has to hold a parliamentary election by October, and
political analysts said the heightened bickering reflected
positioning by the two sides.

ON GOLF: WOODS' SHORT GAME KEEPS FIELD IN DISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN  
c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ On Sunday at dusk, after many of his
competitors had left the course, Tiger Woods was on the Pebble
Beach practice green, working on his putting as the sun set over
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene that has been repeated around the world at many
locations. Woods at work, looking for an edge, striving to become
even better. He generally plays his practice rounds early, teeing
off not long after sunrise, getting his work done before the large
galleries arrive. Then after lunch, he will often head to the
driving range for more practice, working as hard, if not harder,
than players who haven't made a cut in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is the world's No. 1 player not only because he is blessed
with physical talent, but also because he has chosen to maximize
it. Money has not extinguished his desire. Success has not
diminished his passion.
</P>
<P>
   The results, particularly over the last six months, have been
astonishing. The golf world was treated to another extraordinary
comeback by Woods on Monday, when he stormed from seven strokes
behind with seven holes to play to win the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am. By winning his last six starts on the PGA Tour,
Woods equaled Ben Hogan's streak of six consecutive victories in
1948, the second-longest in Tour history.
</P>
<P>
   It is still difficult to fathom that Woods will tie or surpass
Byron Nelson's mark of 11 consecutive victories in 1945. And
because Woods lost two tournaments that were not official tour
events during the course of this streak, Woods has played down the
notion of a streak.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Woods has far greater goals in mind than winning
streaks. He wants to be remembered as the greatest golfer ever. In
his quest for greatness, he has distanced himself from those who
are simply good. Matt Gogel learned that lesson, after losing his
seven-stroke lead Monday, when he was passed by Woods like a turtle
on the autobahn. Afterward, Gogel was asked if he thought Woods was
destined to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about destiny,'' Gogel said. ``He's just damn
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has raised the bar of excellence in golf. Starting with
his victory at last year's PGA Championship, Woods has won eight of
his last nine starts on tour. When Woods' name hits the leader
board, other players notice it like a neon sign on the Las Vegas
strip. He has gained the psychological edge that champions possess,
the ability to create doubt in opponents. Woods won't come out and
say it, but at least some players have looked intimidated during
his current run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask these guys,'' said Woods, when asked if a fear
factor works in his favor. ``But I have the confidence. It gives
you a shot in the arm coming down the stretch, knowing you have
done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   The double-bogeys that once appeared on Woods' card, even when
he was playing well, are rarely seen anymore. With his more
controlled swing, which took over a year to develop, Woods has
sacrificed a little distance for far greater accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   His bad drives are not nearly as wild, and his short irons have
became lethal weapons. People talk about Woods' power, but two
crucial wedge shots on Monday led to his victory, the one he holed
for an eagle at No. 15, and the one he almost holed at No. 16 that
resulted in a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Experience has made Woods wiser with course management. At No.
10 on Monday, far behind and needing a birdie, Woods hit a perfect
drive, leaving him a 7-iron to the green. But with the pin in a
difficult position, Woods resisted the temptation to fire at the
flag, played it safe with an approach shot, then made a two-putt
for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not firing at the flag on the right-hand side like that,''
Woods said. ``If I lose it right, I lose my chance at winning the
tournament. You play safe and make a putt. These are the things I
have learned by playing out here.''
</P>
<P>
   With Woods' domination setting the tone, the atmosphere on tour
has changed. The fitness trailer at tour stops has become almost as
popular as the driving range, and more players are becoming
passionate about working out. David Duval, the world's No. 2 ranked
player, looks as if he spent the off-season locked in a weight
room. Craig Stadler has lost more than 30 pounds. Dozens of other
players are in the best shape of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always told me don't lift weights, you will lose your
feel and your touch,'' Davis Love III said. ``David and Tiger have
proven you can keep your swing and your touch, and they are better,
stronger golfers because of it. If you have to play to 100 percent
of your game to beat Tiger and you are only 80 percent physically,
you are not going to beat him. I've got to get stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   A key shot for Woods at Pebble Beach came during Sunday's third
round, when he muscled a shot out of shin-high grass onto the green
at No. 8, making a bogey when double bogey or worse was in the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Tour Championship, Woods' ball was lodged against
a rock, but instead of taking a penalty stroke, Woods intentionally
hit the rock and the ball at the same time, straining a muscle in
his neck. It was ill-advised, but without his strength, Woods would
most likely have suffered further injury. Instead, he completed his
round in pain, grimacing whenever he took a full swing. Then after
treatment, he went on to win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The streak will keep Woods in the spotlight as long as it lasts,
but majors are the tournaments he covets most. He won his second
major at the PGA Championship last year, but Woods believes he
could have also won the U. S. Open last year, where he tied for
third, and the British Open, where he tied for seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this year's schedule, Woods sees great possibilities.
The Masters, which Woods won by a record-setting 12 strokes in
1997, is less than two months away. This year's U.S. Open is at
Pebble Beach, where Woods just won. The British Open is at St.
Andrews, where John Daly, another long hitter, won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thursday, Woods will turn his attention to the Buick
Invitational at La Jolla, Calif., where by the way, he is the
defending champion. The gallery and the news media will be focused
on Woods. But for Woods, the focus always remains on winning.

U.S. OFFERS U.N. RESOLUTION FOR 5,500-TROOP CONGO FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After a series of high-level meetings in
January about how to end a widening war in Congo, the United States
introduced a Security Council resolution Tuesday to create a
peacekeeping force of 5,500 troops for the country, but said they
should not be deployed until the warring factions had stopped
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   No action is expected on the resolution for at least two weeks
because the Clinton administration has acquiesced to a
congressional demand for 15 days' notice of all U.N. peacekeeping
missions. That notice went to Congress on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Other council members said they found the restriction
irritating. But, if Congress is not notified, there is a danger
that no money will be allocated in Washington to pay the U.S.
share. Officials have not made a long-term cost estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks ahead are quite likely to see draft revisions as other
council members try to add or remove provisions. The U.S.
representative, Richard C. Holbrooke, plans to make trips to
Washington to consult Congress during that time, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said no U.S. soldiers would serve in the Congo
force. A European envoy said Tuesday that he did not expect
European soldiers to be sent, either.
</P>
<P>
   Some African diplomats assessed the proposed force as too little
to do the job. Opponents and allies President Laurent Kabila of
Congo wanted a substantial force that could separate the warring
sides. Western diplomats and U.N. officials said that would take
tens of thousands of soldiers in a country one-third the size of
the United States, and there is no chance of that level of
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's U.N. envoy, Joseph W. Mutaboba, said in an interview
Monday that 5,000 troops was ``a meaningless number'' for a country
the size of Congo. Rwanda and Uganda are Kabila's main foes. But
the Tutsi-led Rwandan government says it has a unique fear. At
least 20,000 exiled fighters from the Hutu-dominated former Rwandan
army and militias are in Congo and available for recruitment by
Kabila to bolster his army.
</P>
<P>
   At a lunch with reporters Tuesday, France's representative,
Alain Dejammet, suggested that the United Nations should have
considered establishing a protected border zone between Rwanda and
Congo. The French also pressed for a provision against exploiting
eastern Congo's diamonds, other minerals and wildlife. In a speech
here last month, Kabila said Rwanda and Uganda were looting those
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Congo resolution, introduced by Nancy Soderberg, the African
expert at the U.S. mission to the United Nations, would let the
peacekeepers use force to protect themselves and 500 monitors and
officials from relief, human rights and medical operations. But it
would prohibit ``peace-enforcement or forcible disarmament.''

GROUPS CANCELLING RESERVATIONS AT HOTEL CHAIN BECAUSE OF BIAS
SUIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Mo., Fla.)  By SOMINI SENGUPTA  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Adam's Mark hotel chain, facing a federal racial
discrimination suit, has lost the patronage of two national
organizations, and two other groups that had booked rooms for
national conferences are considering cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Episcopal Church of America, which had planned
to use the Adam's Mark in Denver as its headquarters for a
convention in July, canceled its contract with the company. The
Human Rights Campaign, a national gay and lesbian political
organization, has canceled a fund-raising dinner it had planned at
the Denver hotel later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America are
discussing whether to continue to rent rooms at the Adam's Mark in
St. Louis for two huge youth conventions this summer. The
Organization of American Historians has found itself divided by an
unusually intense internal debate over whether to proceed with its
annual gathering next month, also in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   As one executive board member of the historians group, Kenneth
T. Jackson of Columbia University, put it, ``This issue is causing
many of us to lose sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit accuses the hotel chain of charging black
customers higher prices than white customers and segregating them
in less desirable rooms as part of a corporate pattern of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear to what extent the chain, which is based in St.
Louis and has 21 large hotels in 13 states, will suffer financial
losses, because each organization that reneges on its contract,
company officials insist, will have to pay cancellation fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopalians stand to lose $1.2 million, or 3 percent of
their annual operating budget. But a church spokesman said its
leaders were unequivocal. ``Given the church's public posture on
racism issues,'' the spokesman, Jim Solheim, said, ``it would be a
contradiction to stay in a hotel that's part of that chain.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are arguably highest for the historians. Canceling
the contract, organization officials say, will cost them at least
$425,000, about a third of the group's operating budget. Making
matters particularly difficult is the urgency of a decision: the
conference starts on March 30. Also, the question of doing business
with the Adam's Mark has unearthed a delicate dilemma for the 9,000
members of the group, many of whose leaders specialize in the study
of race. If the historians cancel their contract, they risk
bankrupting their treasury, but if they go ahead, some members
insist, they stand to lose something greater _ a longstanding
reputation as scholars with a record of civil rights leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of division has not occurred before,'' said William
Chafe, an executive board member and dean of the faculty of arts
and sciences at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Some conference speakers have pledged not to attend a convention
at the hotel, a few panels have been canceled, and there has been
talk of demonstrations by people inside and outside the group.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a departure from its initial position, which was to
proceed with the convention as planned, the board plans to urge
hotel executives to reach a settlement agreement with the Justice
Department, in a telephone conversation scheduled for Thursday. If
the hotel does not agree, board members say they will consider
other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go ahead with the convention we will be doing it under
protest,'' David Montgomery, the group's president and a professor
emeritus at Yale University, said in an interview. ``We will be
using the convention not only to pursue the academic work to which
we are devoted and which is the purpose of our existence, but also
to use it as a moment for public methods of teaching about the
past, present and future of racial discrimination in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit is the first to charge a national hotel chain with a
companywide pattern of racial discrimination. It was filed in
December after the Justice Department failed to persuade hotel
owners to settle, an agency spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal case was prompted by a lawsuit filed by five black
college students who rented rooms at the Daytona Beach hotel in
Florida last spring for an annual social gathering called Black
College Reunion. The plaintiffs complained that the hotel
overcharged them for rooms, required extra deposits to have their
room telephones turned on and forced them to wear orange plastic
wristbands to indicate that they were guests. Justice officials
also contend that the company had a policy to limit the number of
minority patrons in its bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kummer, chief executive of HBE Corp., which owns the chain,
has maintained that race had nothing to do with its policies.
``It's 100,000 young people trying to have a lot of fun,'' he said,
referring to the reunion. ``The fact that they're black is
absolutely incidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP, which joined the students'
suit, said his group had not called for a boycott but was
encouraged that the groups voluntarily considered not patronizing
the hotels.

EX-CIA CHIEF ASKS TO END HIS SECURITY CLEARANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former CIA director, John Deutch, asked the
Pentagon Wednesday to drop his last remaining security clearances,
which had remained in effect even after the agency's current
director suspended his highest clearances last August.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement prepared by his Washington lawyer, Deutch said
that he had not used the ``industrial'' security clearances to gain
access to any classified information since the current director,
George Tenet, suspended the other clearances.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension was ordered by Tenet as a result of an
investigation by the agency's inspector general, which found that
Deutch had mishandled classified documents while serving as
director. The inquiry found that he had placed classified material
on personal computers in his home, including information about some
of the government's most sensitive covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet had suspended Deutch's clearances at the CIA and the
Defense Intelligence Agency. But Deutch had retained three
industrial security clearances, which allowed him to work on
specific Defense Department contracts for Raytheon, the SAIC Corp.
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Deutch
teaches. The clearances were limited ones, and did not give him
access to a wide range of intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 position at
the Pentagon, from 1994 until May 1995, when he was confirmed as
director of central intelligence. He resigned from the CIA in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon was
considering ending the former director's security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutch short-circuited the process Tuesday when his lawyer,
Terrence O'Donnell, sent a letter to the deputy secretary of
defense, John Hamre, asking that the clearances be revoked.

   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Feb. 9: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are a professional golfer, you do not want to be on the
same course with Tiger Woods these days _ whether a stroke or two
behind him, or tied with him or even ahead of him by a commanding
margin _ because chances are you are going to lose. Woods won his
sixth straight victory on the PGA tour at Pebble Beach on Monday,
coming from seven shots down with seven of the most difficult holes
in golf left to play. Obviously, someone had to lose this
tournament (it was a rookie named Matt Gogel, who made four bogeys
down the stretch), but then again, Woods had to play spectacularly
well to turn Gogel's lapses into victory.
</P>
<P>
   That he did, in a way that was not just spectacular but almost
unnatural. On the par-4 15th, Woods scored a rare eagle with a
300-yard drive and a 97- yard pitch that landed near the pin and
spun back into the hole. He almost eagled the next hole, settling
for a birdie after his approach jumped over the cup and stopped two
feet away. After a routine par at 17, he birdied the formidable
par-5 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Woods later said he was genuinely surprised that his approach
shot on 16 did not go in the hole, so pleased was he with its
trajectory and what he called its ``shape.'' That tells you
something about the way his mind is working these days and the way
he is playing. There is an air of inevitability that attaches to
Tiger Woods right now, both mentally and physically. Call it a
zone, call it a groove, but whatever it is, he is in it.

   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Feb. 9: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being sworn in as Israel's prime minister last
July, Ehud Barak announced an accelerated timetable for reaching
broad new peace agreements with the Palestinians and Syria. Seven
months later there seems little chance he can realize those
expectations as quickly as he hoped, but the delays and renewed
turbulence in the Middle East do not mean a durable peace is
unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   This week Palestinian negotiators broke off talks with Israel
about the transfer of the next installment of West Bank territory.
Peace talks with Syria also stand suspended, and hopes for resuming
them in the near future are threatened by escalating violence
between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas across the Lebanese border.
In this volatile climate, Israelis, Palestinians and Syrians must
keep their sights clearly on the larger goal of peace and avoid
unnecessary provocations.
</P>
<P>
   Informal discussions with the Palestinians about land transfers
and other issues will continue. But Barak's goal of negotiating the
broad outlines of a peace agreement by Feb. 13 is unlikely to be
achieved. The problems still to be resolved, including the future
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlers and Palestinian refugees, are the
most sensitive yet. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators need to
show their domestic constituencies they are fighting hard on these
questions, so delays and interruptions must be expected.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important that during the hard bargaining both sides
continue to demonstrate their shared commitment to peacemaking. For
that reason it is regrettable that Yasser Arafat chose this
delicate moment to release a senior Hamas leader, Dr. Abdel-Aziz
Rantisi, known for harsh criticism of the peace talks and a history
of inciting violence against more moderate Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with Syria resumed last month after a nearly four-year
interruption. The first round, in West Virginia, made little
progress, and a scheduled second round was postponed. But the delay
was expected to be brief since both sides have so much to gain from
peace. Syria could get back all or most of the Golan Heights that
it lost in 1967. Israel, for the first time in its history, could
win peace and recognition from all of its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But renewed fighting between Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrillas in Lebanon now threatens to block resumption of the
Syrian talks. Hezbollah attacks against Israeli positions in
Lebanon have already killed six Israeli soldiers. On Monday night
Israeli planes struck back hard, and additional Israeli air raids
followed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel must protect its security along the Lebanese border. But
it should also be careful not to overreact. The United States,
which intervened diplomatically to help damp down the last major
round of clashes between Israel and Hezbollah four years ago, ought
to do so again, as part of a larger effort to revive the peace
talks with Syria.

MAJOR E-COMMERCE WEB SITES ARE ATTACKED BY HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hackers mounted what appeared to be coordinated
attacks on the world's largest electronic commerce sites Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which opened a window on the widespread
vulnerability of the Internet, began Monday with a three-hour
assault on Yahoo.com, one of the world's most popular Web sites,
and continued Tuesday, temporarily crippling at least four other
major sites, including Amazon.com, eBay.com and Buy.com. By Tuesday
night it had spread to a leading media site, CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Buy.com, an online retailer, and the popular
auction site eBay.com said they could not determine for certain
whether all the attacks were related or were by the same person or
persons.
</P>
<P>
   George Grotz, a spokesman for the San Francisco office of the
FBI, said: ``We are still in dialogue with Yahoo. We are aware of
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the attacks had been by the same people, Grotz
said, ``I think it would be premature at this point to say anything
along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But security experts and the companies themselves said the
nature of the attacks seemed too similar to be coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Levy, chief technology officer for SecurityFocus.com,
which researches computer security issues, said the scope of the
attacks was rare, if not unprecedented. He said the attackers had
managed to assault and take down some of the world's most heavily
enforced sites.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said the evidence suggested the attacks were related.
Significantly, he said given how many resources were required to
take down these sites, it would have been difficult for a copycat
who witnessed Monday's attack on Yahoo to have instantly have
followed suit in such similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt these are coming from the same individual or
group,'' echoed John Vranesevich, the founder of antionline.com, a
Web site focusing on computer security and hacking issues.
</P>
<P>
   It ``is unthinkable'' that several groups of hackers would have
access to this many computers used to direct the attack, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he expected to see a substantial response from the FBI
in the coming days. ``We're going to see some very busy law
enforcement tomorrow,'' he said. ``I picture planes full of FBI
agents heading to San Jose right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the attackers used what is known as distributed
denial of service, a technique that basically hijacks dozens or
even hundreds or computers around the Internet and instructs each
of the hijacked computers to bombard the target site with
meaningless data.
</P>
<P>
   As the site's server tries to accommodate all the phony data, it
soon runs out of memory and other resources. As a result, its
responses to real customers slows to a crawl or ceases altogether.
</P>
<P>
   However, while it cripples the servers ability to deliver Web
pages to customers, it does not violate the integrity of the
system, nor does it allow access to data stored on the server. So
while such attacks are an expensive form of vandalism, they do not
threaten sensitive data like credit card numbers or other consumer
information.
</P>
<P>
   While such attacks are not unusual, the intensity of the recent
attacks, as measured by the sheer number of computers thought to
have been hijacked for the effort, was virulent enough to bring
down e-commerce sites that are typically fortified enough to fend
off these kinds of assaults.
</P>
<P>
   An eBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said the auction site became
inaccessible to some customers around 3:20 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time, and it was still struggling to thwart the attack two hours
later. He said the company had contacted Yahoo and Buy.com to seek
advice and assistance in defending its servers.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour assault on Buy.com started at 10:50 a.m. Pacific
time and, unfortunately for the company, the timing coincided with
the company's initial public offering of stock. In the first day of
trading, its shares closed at $25.125 each.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said it was getting hit with data from ``more than 50''
computers on the Internet. The company said it was contacted this
morning by the FBI in connection with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Hawkins, chief executive of Buy.com, said the timing of the
attack on the day of the IPO was ``completely out of control,
needless to say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some people get in, '' he said, ``but in most cases,
people couldn't get into the site.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the site ``clearly lost revenue'' though he did not know
how much. ``We were hoping to see an increase in traffic because of
the IPO.'' The stock opened at $27 and traded as high as $35.
</P>
<P>
   Vranesevich said the preliminary evidence suggested that the
same hackers were responsible for each attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a denial of service attack, hackers hijack computers not
their own and use them to direct random streams of data at the
target, essentially causing the target machine to become
paralyzed. &QL;

COWBOYS' COACHING STAFF ALMOST COMPLETE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Andre Patterson has resigned as defensive line
coach of the Minnesota Vikings to accept a similar position with
the Cowboys, it has been learned.
</P>
<P>
   Finalization of Dave Campo's coaching staff is expected today.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Patterson brings with him three years of NFL
experience (New England 1997, Minnesota 1998-99). He received a
two-year contract worth an estimated $250,000 per year, with a
third-year rollover after the 2000 season, according to a source.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson will work in tandem with former Cowboys defensive end
Jim Jeffcoat, which will carry with it more authority for Jeffcoat
than the past two seasons in which Jim Bates (now Miami Dolphins'
defensive coordinator) was the defensive line coach and Jeffcoat
was his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones indicated yesterday that the 38-year-old Jeffcoat
was ready to step up and take over more responsibility, i.e.,
handle the defensive ends or the defensive tackles, rather than
serve in a subordinate role.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings made the announcement yesterday that Patterson had
resigned to interview with the Cowboys, thereby becoming the sixth
member of Dennis Green's staff to either resign, be fired or be
reassigned this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   About that same time, former New England defensive line coach
Ray ``Sugar Bear'' Hamilton, a 13-year NFL assistant, was at Valley
Ranch also interviewing with Campo and Jones for the same job as
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Patterson served one season in New England (1997) as
Hamilton's assistant. Three years later, the younger Patterson beat
out his former boss for the job in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 49, was a part of the Pete Carroll purge in New
England last month. After meeting with Campo and Jones yesterday
morning, Hamilton flew out of town and headed for Green Bay, where
he is expected to interview next with the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jason Garrett's possible switch (at the urging of
Cowboys' management) from backup quarterback to quarterbacks coach
might not be nailed down in time for today's announcements. Jones
has had only preliminary talks so far with the 33-year-old Garrett
on his future with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cowboys will move ahead on coaching decisions
``whether Jason Garrett is quarterbacks coach or not,'' said Jones.
This would suggest that new offensive coordinator Jack Reilly may
pick up the QB coaching responsibilities as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hasn't been willing to discuss particulars about Campo's
staff, although he did indicate again yesterday that Buddy Geis,
the Cowboys' quarterbacks coach each of the past two seasons, could
be in the mix but in another capacity on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Chandler, the former New Orleans-San Diego star receiver,
will be named wide receivers coach, according to a source. Chandler
replaces Dwain Painter, whose contract expired after last season.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese was at Valley
Ranch this week. Details are being made in naming him to a
consulting position. Zampese and Reilly have worked together each
of the past three seasons at Dallas (1997) and New England
(1998-99).
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends coach Les Miles will be the only Chan Gailey hire of
two years ago to be retained in his present position. The Cowboys
haven't interviewed any candidates at Miles' position.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, both Clancy Pendergast and Bill Bates
will be assigned to position-coaching roles. This would mean a
promotion for Pendergast from defensive assistant/quality control
into a position title either with the secondary or linebackers.
Bates' expertise lies in the secondary and special teams.
</P>
<P>
   New defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer is also expected to keep
his old title as secondary coach, while George Edwards returns to
coach linebackers after turning down an assistant head
coach/defensive coordinator position at the University of Georgia.

<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Wading back into an area that brought her both
national prominence and a high-profile defeat, Hillary Rodham
Clinton pledged Tuesday to push anew for universal health care
coverage, proposing legislation that would give consumers
unrestricted access to low-cost prescription drugs sold in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep moving,'' Clinton declared to an audience of
doctors, nurses and researchers at Strong Memorial Hospital. ``I
didn't give up then, and I won't give up now. I have always
believed health care is a fundamental human right.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We can never give up until we figure out a way to
provide quality health insurance to everyone in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   With that declaration, Clinton began setting out the ways she
would try to make health care coverage a central issue in her
campaign for the U.S. Senate. In contrast to 1994, when Clinton and
the president pushed a wide-ranging universal health care coverage
that collapsed in the face of opposition from Congress, Clinton
argued Tuesday for incremental steps, starting _ at least for the
purposes of her campaign _ with the prescription drug bill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, pharmacists in the United States would be
allowed to buy medicines from their counterparts in Canada, where,
because of cost controls imposed by the government, costs are
typically one-third lower. Although Clinton did not mention it,
similar legislation has been introduced in Congress by Rep. Bernie
Sanders, I-Vt., but it has faced strong opposition from
pharmaceutical manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the drugs, both those shipped to Canada and
those sold in the United States, were typically made with the same
ingredients, in the same factories and under the same controls.
``The only difference is that Americans are paying more in retail
costs than the rest of the world,'' she said. ``I was told that New
Yorkers never bought retail. Well, that's wrong when it comes to
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The restriction on reimporting drugs was contained in
legislation passed by Congress in 1988. That measure was an effort
not to control the cost of prescription drugs, but to assure their
safety. The concern was that the Food and Drug Administration could
not monitor the potency or quality of drugs that were imported into
the United States, even if they had been manufactured here.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America, a trade association, denounced
Clinton's announcement as ``an election-year proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   `` Mrs. Clinton's proposal would overturn landmark consumer
protection legislation by a partisan Congress, led by her own
party, passed 10 years ago to protect consumers from unsafe,
potentially adulterated medicine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Clinton's likely Republican opponent,
had no reaction to her proposal, said his campaign spokeswoman, Kim
Serafin.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton campaigned slowly across the state, Giuliani followed
her _ but over the radio, not in person. He gave a series of
interviews to upstate radio stations throughout the day, denouncing
her qualifications and campaign at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   In an early morning interview with WBEN in Buffalo, he did
address health care in general, saying it was an important issue.
``My approach to health care is to expand coverage for people,''
Giuliani said, ``instead of a government-controlled,
government-dominated, basically government-run medical program.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a Rochester station, he mocked Clinton's
proposals to encourage job development upstate, which include
measures to promote Internet access and lower air fares. ``I don't
think she has any sense of what is going on in upstate New York,''
he said. ``This information comes from a poll, rather than actually
having lived in the state, or being part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, I have lived here all my life and have been
mayor for seven years,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the mayor signaled that he did not believe the
Conservative Party endorsement was necessarily closed to him,
contending that if the party had a primary, he would win it.
</P>
<P>
   The party's state chairman, Michael Long, has said he would
prefer that Giuliani not run, all but saying that the mayor would
not get the nomination.

CLINTON TAPS MONEY DONORS CRITICIZED FOR AIDING PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton flew to South Florida last month for a
fund-raiser attended by a few dozen people at the home of a wealthy
bankruptcy expert, William A. Brandt Jr. It was an afternoon of
tea, finger sandwiches, speeches and $2,000 donations.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt has long been a prominent Democratic contributor and
supporter of President Clinton. He is also one of dozens of donors
to the first lady's Senate campaign whose names surfaced in the
fund-raising scandals of the president's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy executives complained to congressional investigators
that Brandt had promoted a $10,000-a-plate dinner attended by the
president in 1996 as an opportunity to influence federal policy.
Republicans in the Senate called the incident one of a long list of
fund-raising improprieties involving the president, and they urged
the Justice Department to open a criminal inquiry into whether
Brandt had lied to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said the accusations were ludicrous, and in August 1999,
the Justice Department told the Senate that ``prosecution is not
warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's aides say that donors and fund-raisers like
Brandt have done nothing wrong, and that it is natural for people
who supported the president to want to help her. Her Republican
opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has tried to portray her
fund-raising as unethical, saying it is patterned after the
president's practices.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the donors themselves scoffed at the idea that
their contributions had been tainted. They said they believed in
Democratic principles, were determined to play a role in the
political process and were eager to see Mrs. Clinton win.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Republicans who have criticized the Clintons'
fund-raising, Brandt said, ``What these people are trying to do is
drive people like me from the arena so that their viewpoints can
dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's network of donors includes Texas trial lawyers,
Hollywood celebrities, New York investment bankers and others who
assisted the president in collecting the largely unregulated
donations known as soft money to bolster his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Several of her donors stayed at the president's invitation in
the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House and attended the so-called
White House coffees, gatherings that aroused criticism that the
president was using his official residence for inappropriate or
even illegal political activities.
</P>
<P>
   People who spent the night in the Lincoln Bedroom and have given
to Mrs. Clinton's committees range from Walter Kaye, an insurance
executive who helped Monica Lewinsky get her White House
internship, to John Catsimatidis, a New York supermarket magnate.
</P>
<P>
   In a trip by Mrs. Clinton to Texas last fall, two prominent
contributors who attended the White House coffees, Tilman J.
Fertitta, chairman of Landry's Seafood restaurant chain, and John
Eddie Williams, a trial lawyer active in tobacco litigation, held
fund-raisers that reaped a few hundred thousand dollars for her
campaign committee and another she set up with the Senate
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Another coffee guest who has become a big donor for Mrs. Clinton
is Farhad Azima, chairman of Aviation Leasing Group. In 1997, the
Democratic National Committee returned $143,741 in contributions
from Azima, whose company was involved in the mid-1980s in ferrying
military equipment to Iran in exchange for the release of hostages
held in Lebanon. The committee later reversed itself, apologized to
Azima and kept the money.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt, along with his company, Development Specialists, gave
nearly $20,000 to committees set up by Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Another major donor, Bernard L. Schwartz, is chairman of Loral
Space and Communications Corp., which is being investigated by the
Justice Department in connection with questions of whether it
violated export laws by giving sophisticated satellite technology
to China. He and his wife, Irene, donated more than $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions from those people are a small percentage of
the amount that Mrs. Clinton raised last year, and her spokesman,
Howard Wolfson, said the campaign had not hesitated to accept them.
``It's not an issue,'' Wolfson said. ``It's not surprising that
people who supported the administration policies would also be
supporting Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have used campaign finance as fodder for their
attacks. Mrs. Clinton contends that Giuliani is reaching out for
donations to staunch conservatives around the nation whose ideology
is out of step with the state's. Giuliani has seized on the issue
of soft money, which the law allows political parties to collect in
unlimited amounts if it is not to be spent on candidates'
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The president has been dogged by charges that he channeled large
sums of soft money into his 1996 campaign, and last fall, his wife
began raising soft money through the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After she collected more than $360,000 in soft money through
November, Giuliani questioned her ethics. Unbowed, she raised an
additional $300,000 in soft money in December, according to newly
released records. Giuliani has not yet collected soft money but
also has not repudiated the practice, leading Mrs. Clinton's aides
to call him a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has also tried to rally his conservative supporters by
asserting that Mrs. Clinton has tapped into a network of liberal
Hollywood celebrities, and her donor list includes many famous
names, among them Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw; Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman; David Geffen; Jeffrey Katzenberg; Norman Lear; and
Mary Steenburgen.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of those celebrities, Brandt is a longtime Democratic
benefactor. He has described himself as a friend of both Clintons
and has stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom and attended White House
coffees.
</P>
<P>
   He also shares an interest with Mrs. Clinton in federal
bankruptcy policy. She has attacked a bill approved by the
Republican-controlled Congress that would make it more difficult
for people to seek legal protection from paying off their debts.
The president has threatened to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt has lobbied Congress on bankruptcy bills before, and he
opposes this one. He said he had talked to Mrs. Clinton about the
bill but had not lobbied Congress on it. He said that the bill
would not affect his business, but that, like Mrs. Clinton, he
believes that it will hurt poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt, who specializes in turning around bankrupt or poorly
performing companies, acknowledged in an interview that when the
Senate Republicans began investigating him, he and his wife
considered withdrawing from politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `What are we doing this for?''' Brandt recalled.
```Why are we putting up with this? Why don't we just get out of
the process?' But I can't do that. It is just not in my
constitution.''

TELEVISION-REPLAY RULE A BIG MISTAKE IN NCAA BASKETBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took less than two weeks for a committee with the letters ``N
C A A'' in its title to meet, discuss and approve a significant
in-season rule change for college basketball. Now, referees can
refer to a television replay to see if they made the correct call
on a buzzer-beater shot.
</P>
<P>
   Time to step behind the line and launch a 3-point opinion.
</P>
<P>
   1. The NCAA, which should have either a glacier or a snail on
its corporate logo, made heads spin with the speed with which this
rule change was made.
</P>
<P>
   2. If there is a Knee Jerk Hall of Fame, this rule change would
be eligible for immediate induction.
</P>
<P>
   3. Allowing officials to use television replays to confirm their
decisions is wrong. And I don't need to go to the videotape to
decide whether or not I'm making the right call.
</P>
<P>
   For all of this, we have Charles Range to thank. From all
accounts, Range is a solid official (he worked the 1995 Final
Four), but his 45 minutes of indecision before making a final call
during the Texas A&AMP;M-Texas Tech game on Jan. 15 brought nationwide
attention to last-second decisions. (The sport needed Regis Philbin
growling ``Is that your final answer?'' at Range.)
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Big East Conference officials called a
last-second shot by Miami good, giving the Hurricanes a victory
over Villanova. Even though it appeared the officials got that call
right _ and replays were inconclusive _ suddenly everyone was
yelling and screaming for the use of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is no call in the game that is more
important, and it's the one call that's remembered longer than any
other,'' said Air Force coach Reggie Minton, chairman of the men's
rules committee. ``We want to give our officials every tool
possible at the end of the game. If we have the technology
available to help us, we want to make sure we use it to get the
call right.''
</P>
<P>
   Referees have been allowed to use TV replay to review timing
errors and to decide if a disputed shot was a two-pointer or
3-pointer. Minton argues that using replays to decide last-second
shots is merely an extension of that rule.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is like allowing baseball teams to use the
designated hitter only in games televised by national networks. For
college basketball, this is an uneven rule, because it can be
applied only in games being televised. And for that reason it's a
rule that benefits the schools in the major conferences, where most
of the games are televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction to this rule was, `So what?' '' Delaware coach
Mike Brey said. ``We've just got three regular-season games
televised, so it really doesn't affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   You can argue and debate whether instant replay works in the
NFL. In pro football, there are fewer games, all of which are
televised, and those games are produced by more experienced
television crews. In college basketball, the telecasts are more
inconsistent. Even in games that are televised, there's no
guarantee that the cameramen, tape operators and directors will be
able to provide the right replay needed to confirm a buzzer-beater.
</P>
<P>
   The rationalization for this rule is a desire to ``get it
right.'' This is a bad mixture of science and nature. It's a game
played by 10 people officiated by three people. Stuff happens. In
the 1989 national championship game, John Clougherty called a
ticky-tack foul on Seton Hall that allowed Michigan's Rumeal
Robinson to hit the game-winning free throws. A human being made a
mistake. That call is part of the game's history, its lore.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this being part of college basketball lore. An NCAA
Tournament game, maybe even a national championship game, comes
down to a buzzer-beating shot. What we'll be left with won't be the
image of a Lorenzo Charles dunk or a Keith Smart jumper and the
ensuing spontaneous celebration.
</P>
<P>
   We'll remember three men in striped shirts, huddling around a
courtside, 15-inch color monitor trying to decide whether the shot
beat the clock while the teams wait to either celebrate or cry.
</P>
<P>
   What drama. \Ntagtop:Wendell Barnhouse, (817) 390-7238

STATE SENATE APPROVES BILL TO INSURE SOME TREATMENTS FOR
INFERTILITY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Republicans in the state Senate passed a bill
Tuesday that would require health insurance companies to pay for
some infertility treatments, potentially setting the stage for
negotiations with Assembly Democrats who have adopted their own
version of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The move prompted Democratic leaders of the Assembly to call for
the creation of a conference committee of lawmakers appointed by
both houses to iron out the differences between the Senate and
Assembly plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects of a compromise seemed murky Tuesday. Among
other things, the two sides disagree on a provision in the Senate
bill that would potentially deny the proposed benefits to employees
of the Roman Catholic Church and any other group with religious
objections to some infertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   John McCardle, a spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate
majority leader, said the Senate's leadership would be willing to
negotiate with Democrats in the Assembly, if they dropped their
objection to that provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are open to discussing this issue,'' McCardle said. ``But
what we are not open to is forcing religious groups to adhere to
practices that they oppose on moral grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Sheldon Silver, the
Democratic speaker of the Assembly, asserted that the provision was
unacceptable, saying it thwarted the overall goal of the bill that
the Assembly passed on Monday: providing coverage for families that
needed infertility treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonnegotiable,'' she said. ``It is a poison pill that
undermines the heart and soul of the legislation we want to
enact.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and Assembly plans would require health
insurance companies and health maintenance organizations to pay for
the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. Both bills are opposed
by insurance companies and by employers who pay premiums and are
concerned that the mandated coverage would increase the cost of
those premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments covered under both bills include hormone drug
therapy, artificial insemination, in-vitro fertilization and gamete
and embryo donation.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several other differences between the two bills.
The Senate version would limit the mandated benefit to $60,000, but
the Assembly bill has no cap. In addition, the Senate bill applies
only to people between 25 and 44; the Assembly bill has no age
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also says that insurance coverage must be
provided for infertility treatment only if there is a ``reasonable
expectation that treatment will result in a healthy child.'' The
Assembly bill has no such language. Groups pushing for mandatory
insurance coverage for infertility treatments believe that such a
provision is unnecessary.

ONCE SHY AND RESERVED, RODMAN IS THE HOT TICKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Long before Dennis Rodman evolved into an eccentric
basketball icon, he was the product of a broken home, a kid from
the projects just trying to find his niche in life.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Rodman describes her son as shy and reclusive, but
always humble in the way he carried himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was a kid under my regime, I would be reining him in
like mad,'' she once said. ``But he's not. He's his own person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just proud he has learned to speak for himself, because
he's had a lot of personal things that hit him hard, and a lot of
people blame his parents for that. But I think he's a wonderful
young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman's parents divorced when he was young, and he has
had very little contact with his father, Philander Rodman Jr. He
considers his mother his only parent.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Rodman always was the backbone of the Rodman family. In
addition to Dennis, she has two daughters _ Debra and Kim _ who
were both All-America basketball players at South Oak Cliff High
School.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodman sisters were taller than Dennis, who was only
5-foot-11 when he graduated high school and failed to make the high
school football team because he was so small.
</P>
<P>
   But as time passed, Rodman began to grow. When he reached 6-8,
he decided to get a piece of the basketball action.
</P>
<P>
   Rufus Lewis used to play pickup and summer league games against
Rodman at Cummings Recreation Center and Singing Hills Recreation
Center in Oak Cliff in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Lewis, now
the chief executive officer of Big Dreams Sports Management and
Marketing company, remembers Rodman as very quiet and respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he still was a hard worker on the boards, and he filled
the lanes and dunked the ball,'' Lewis said. ``But I never thought
he would excel to the greatness that he has _ no one ever thought
he would go that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has reached unbelievable status for a guy who comes from
the hood. But when I reflect back on his playing during that time,
the thing that I still see and like about him is he's still a
humble guy. Even in the midst of his drama and showmanship, he's
still a humble guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That humble guy will be making his Mavericks debut tonight at
7:30 in Reunion Arena against Seattle. Because of Rodman, ESPN,
Turner Sports, ``Sports Illustrated'', CNN, ``The Sporting News'',
``the Chicago Sun-Times'', NBA Photos and KSAT-TV in San Antonio
are part of the expected 125 media organizations in town just to
see 38-year-old Dennis Rodman play basketball for the first time in
nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, a seven-time rebounding champion and five-time NBA
champion, said he expects to play about 30 minutes tonight.
Mavericks coach-general manager Don Nelson holds the robo rebounder
in high regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two guys who have been stars who have ever
played the game and done the dirty work,'' Nelson said. ``Bill
Russell was one; Dennis Rodman is the other one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most all of the other star players want to participate on the
offensive end and not do the dirty work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman has a penchant for diving for loose balls and doing the
dirty work. The Mavericks hope he'll be able to guide them to their
first playoff berth since the 1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a piece of the pie,'' Rodman said yesterday. ``I've
already had pressure. I've been married once.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Rodman came to the NBA as a second-round draft pick of
the Detroit Pistons, Mark Aguirre said he tried his best to get the
Mavericks to draft him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the spring of 1986, and Aguirre had already built a
reputation as one of the toughest small forwards to defend in the
NBA. The setting was the Martin Luther King Center in South Dallas,
where legends are made _ or embarrassed _ on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Aguirre admittedly got embarrassed by the
defensive blanket Rodman threw over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing against each other, and it was a tough night
for me,,'' Aguirre said yesterday. ``But \Rthe Mavericks\S wouldn't
waste a second-round draft pick on him, which I cried for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him on my team, because Dennis is the only person
I've ever been up against that could possibly guard me one-on-one.
So I didn't want to see him on anybody else's team.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre and Rodman eventually became teammates and led the
Pistons to back-to-back NBA titles in 1989 and '90. Rodman also
helped the Chicago Bulls win three consecutive NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people flock around Rodman and cling to his every word as
if it's gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ortegel, who has been a television analyst for Mavericks
games for 13 years, described Rodman as the master
showman/basketball player who knows how to get a crowd going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a stage for him? I don't know whether it is or not,''
Ortegel said. ``But I really believe inside that he's missed the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done it all of his adult life, and I think he's looking
forward to \Rtonight\S. A lot of other people are, too, I know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's mother, Debra and Kim all live in separate homes in the
same Lancaster neighborhood. They have unlisted phone numbers now,
because of their brother's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks describe Rodman as a savvy businessman. He's done
movies and had his own TV show, and had books written about him. He
owns an excavation company in Frisco, and the employees there are
excited that he's now employed by the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Penz, an estimator with Rodman Excavation Company and a
close friend of Rodman, said 15-20 of the employees plan to attend
tonight's game. Penz endorses owner-in-waiting Mark Cuban's
decision to bring Rodman back to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be good for the team,'' Penz said. ``I think
it's a smart move on Mark Cuban's part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are also anxiously awaiting for Rodman's arrival
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is no superman,'' guard Michael Finley said. ``By
putting him on our roster, he's not going to put us in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but Aguirre said the Mavericks are better served by
having Rodman on their roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People never get to know the real passionate side of Dennis
Rodman,'' Aguirre said. ``When we were going for our second title,
we weren't getting a lot of numbers off the bench, and I went to
him and told him he had to start and he just broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `I don't know how to do that, I'm not comfortable
with that. It took me three games before I had to personally
convince him that if he didn't start, I wasn't going to be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis changed ballgames by himself. Without Dennis, the Bulls
don't win all those championships. And without Dennis, we don't win
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gangly, shy kid from Oak Cliff has come a long way.

BUSH SCORES PRIMARY WIN IN DELAWARE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush won a needed victory in Delaware's Republican
presidential primary Tuesday, but insurgent John McCain made a
surprisingly strong second-place showing without even campaigning
there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won 51 percent of the vote, followed by McCain at 25
percent and magazine publisher Steve Forbes at 20 percent. Former
Ambassador Alan Keyes received 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware's primary was open to registered Republican voters
only, depriving McCain of the independent votes that were crucial
to his New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored by the vote. I accept the vote of the good people
of Delaware,'' Bush told supporters in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had sought a lift for his campaign in Delaware after his
crushing upset loss to McCain a week ago in New Hampshire. Bush won
what he called a ``substantial'' victory in Delaware, but some of
his state leadership had predicted he would win with as much as 70
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in Goose Creek, S.C., crowed over winning a
quarter of the Delaware vote while ignoring the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing, because as you know we didn't spend one
minute there,'' McCain said. ``We're very pleased ... It's really
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a win as a win, noting he had won all 12 Delaware
delegates to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be in first place with 51 percent and every
delegate. I won every delegate, and we're in the delegate
business,'' Bush said. ``I think I did pretty darn well.''
</P>
<P>
   The real stake for Bush, McCain and Forbes in Tuesday's voting
had been potential momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush needed to offset his New Hampshire loss. McCain needed
added momentum going into the Feb. 19 South Carolina primary. And
Forbes, who has spent more than $60 million of his own money
running for president in 1996 and 2000, needed a victory anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bush goes into the South Carolina primary as the most recent
victor, but McCain's second-place finish signaled that his New
Hampshire victory was not a fluke and that he could have national
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has closed to a tie with Bush in South Carolina public
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Feb. 22 Michigan primary, where Bush led 51 percent
to McCain's 17 percent last month, a poll to be published Wednesday
in The Detroit Free Press is expected to show Bush and McCain are
now in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where McCain gained a spot on the ballot just last
week, Bush's lead among likely GOP voters has been cut from 44
percentage points in December to 9 percentage points in a poll
conducted last week by the Marist Institute of Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Bush proved for certain Tuesday is that he can
defeat Forbes. Forbes won Delaware in 1996 but came in third in
this contest. Bush also defeated Forbes in Iowa, another state
where McCain did not participate and where Forbes had campaigned
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders are expected to pressure Forbes into dropping out
of the race Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we would have liked to have done better. We will go
on to Michigan and South Carolina and assess the situation as
things move forward,'' Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain's New Hampshire victory shook Bush's image as the
Republican who can most likely win the White House in November,
Delaware voters said they still have confidence in Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed 61 percent of those who voted said Bush was
the most likely candidate to win in November, while 25 percent said
McCain could win.
</P>
<P>
   Self-described conservative voters went for Bush 53 percent to
McCain's 18 percent, with Forbes capturing 22 percent. But among
moderates, the numbers narrowed, with Bush capturing 48 percent to
McCain's 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's history as a Vietnam prisoner of war has been one of
the most compelling aspects of his personal history to voters. But
49 percent of Delaware's veterans voted for Bush; 31 percent for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has attacked McCain's credibility on campaign finance
reform, portraying him as a Washington insider who takes
contributions from lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent most of Tuesday campaigning in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving The First State eight hours before the polls
closed, bound for South Carolina, Bush pleaded for votes among
elderly Wilmington residents and among volunteer firefighters _ one
of whom fainted while standing at Bush's side, cutting short his
final campaign stop here.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he went, Bush subtly _ and not so subtly _ chided
McCain for his stances on tax cuts and campaign finance reform as
he continued for a second day his new, more aggressive campaign
strategy. He used prolonged question and answer sessions with
voters to tout his plans, and he did away with prepared remarks and
rostrums in favor of wireless mikes and a more casual style.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his numerous trips to Delaware showed his concern
about the state's issues. Bush needled McCain for his ``amazing''
strategy of bypassing the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Iowa, he skipped the caucuses. He said, `That's not
important for me to be there' and said the same thing to the
citizens of Delaware, and I don't think it was the right thing to
have done,'' Bush said in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After voting for Bush, Hockessin resident Patti Roman said, ``I
didn't think McCain was even on the ballot. When I saw he was, I
was shocked.'' She added that she was bothered that McCain ``didn't
feel Delaware was important enough to come to.''

<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ In the first contest after his bruising
defeat in New Hampshire a week ago, Gov. George W. Bush handily won
the Republican primary in Delaware Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took 51 percent of the vote. Sen. John McCain, who won in
New Hampshire but did not campaign here so he could concentrate in
South Carolina, took a surprising 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who spent more time and apparently more money in
Delaware than any other candidate, finished a disappointing third
with only 20 percent. Alan Keyes got 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This is a small state with only 165,000 registered Republicans,
and the turnout Tuesday was light. But in Columbia, S.C., Bush
said, ``I am honored by the vote.'' Bush added that he thought
Delaware voters had responded to his new message that he was the
reform candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Wryly taking note of the publicity surrounding McCain's victory
in New Hampshire, he said, ``I'm confident that the news media will
put me on the cover of every one of the major news magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in Charleston, S.C., offered a far different
interpretation of the vote. ``I'm extremely surprised and pleased
that we'd get that kind of vote in a state we never visited,''
McCain told reporters Tuesday night. ``It's bound to give us a
boost when you haven't even visited the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of voters indicated that McCain's victory in New
Hampshire helped him here, The Associated Press reported. Almost
half of his supporters decided to vote for him in the week since
that primary, the surveys showed, and a quarter of his supporters
had not voted in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday night, McCain told reporters in Goose Creek,
S.C., ``It's astonishing because, as you know, we didn't spend one
minute there, so we're very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he had promised voters in New Hampshire, jealous of
its distinction as the first state to hold a primary, that he would
not campaign in Delaware so soon after their state's contest, he
added, ``I told them in New Hampshire if I went through Delaware in
Amtrak, I'd pull down the shades.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said Tuesday night: ``We
are disappointed. Clearly, we would have liked to have done better.
Now we move to South Carolina and Michigan, and we will assess
things as they move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Forbes might withdraw from the race prior to the
March 7 Super Tuesday primaries, Dal Col said, ``I wouldn't
anticipate it, but anything is open.'' He said Forbes would be
emphasizing the primaries in Michigan and Arizona. In South
Carolina, Forbes will appear at a Republican debate and will have
ads on television.
</P>
<P>
   In most respects, the Delaware primary was a sideshow to the
main events in New Hampshire last week and in South Carolina on
Feb. 19. With but 12 delegates at stake _ barely one-half of 1
percent of all the delegates to the Republican National Convention
_ and with only 28 polling places statewide, the race drew little
attention in the press and was until recently treated as an
afterthought by the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes, who won the Delaware primary in 1996 when he was the
only candidate who campaigned here, began pouring resources into
the state, hoping to demonstrate that his candidacy was still alive
after his distant third-place finish in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he wrapped up a four-day bus tour of Delaware at a
retirement center. There, he made a pitch for the abolition of the
federal inheritance tax, which applies only to estates worth more
than $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be allowed to leave this world unmolested by the
IRS,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made a point of campaigning in every state, and Forbes'
effort forced Bush to allocate more time here than he might have
wished, given the emphasis he is placing on stopping McCain in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor had the support of most of the corporate and
political establishment, including the only two Republicans elected
statewide, Sen. William V. Roth Jr. and Rep. Michael N. Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent full days in Delaware on Friday and Monday. Before he
left for South Carolina Tuesday morning, he asked a group of
elderly voters in Wilmington to ``give me a chance to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   At every stop here, he chided McCain for skipping the state,
saying that anyone running for president should be willing to
campaign everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain never took the bait, just as he never campaigned in
the Iowa caucuses last month. Still, interest in his candidacy grew
in Delaware after his smashing victory in New Hampshire last week.
This week, a small band of volunteers took it upon themselves to
make phone calls to encourage McCain supporters to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that its exit poll showed that
Bush had done best among voters who were middle class, elderly and
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the survey showed, was strongest among the affluent, the
well educated and those who considered themselves moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was supported by voters who said their biggest concern
was high taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pick their delegates in caucuses next month, but
11,000 of the state's 200,000 registered Democrats voted in a
nonbinding primary on Saturday. Vice President Al Gore won with 57
percent of the vote, to 40 percent for former Sen. Bill Bradley.

DOUG HENNING, 52, SUPERSTAR OF ILLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henning, the ebullient, shaggy-headed magician who sparked
a renewed interest in his craft and breathed new life into some of
history's most famous illusions, died Feb. 7 in Los Angeles. He was
52 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, according to The Associated Press.
He had been ailing for five months.
</P>
<P>
   With a curly mane of hair and a near-constant grin, Henning was
one of the most famous illusionists in the world during the 1970s
and early '80s, appearing in three Broadway shows and a dozen
television specials. In each case, he stunned audiences with a
seemingly impossible array of disappearing assistants and
levitating ladies. Doves became rabbits in Henning's hands, and
horses took wing.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most impressive acts was ``Metamorphosis,'' an
illusion borrowed from Harry Houdini, his idol. In the trick, which
Henning performed in Broadway theaters, on television and even on
Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, his assistant was handcuffed and tied in
a sack. The sack was put in a chest and padlocked. Henning stood
atop the chest and counted to three. Suddenly the assistant was
standing in his place, and Henning was in the trunk, handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trick that Houdini needed 20 seconds to perform;
Henning did it in less than 10.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Winnipeg, Canada, Henning made his U.S. debut in
``The Magic Show,'' a rock musical that opened on Broadway in May
1974 and subsequently ran for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Henning broke through to an even larger audience when
he performed Houdini's ``Water Torture Escape'' on a live
television special. Shackled hand and foot and encased underwater
in a steel canister, he broke free in under a minute, emerging wet
and beaming.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, he was a regular presence on television,
adding splashy new tricks to his repertoire, like a 1980 show where
he appeared to have been eaten by a shark.
</P>
<P>
   His shows led to a general resurgence of interest in magic, said
Phil Willmarth, editor of The Linking Ring, a magic magazine. ``He
was a kind of Peter Pan,'' Willmarth told The Associated Press,
``who led magic away from the tuxedo approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, part of Henning's popularity could be laid to his style
of performing, one that immediately set him apart from the
vaudevillian conjurers of the past. Gone were the black capes and
magic wands; Henning wore jeans, flashy jumpsuits and tie-dye
T-shirts onstage. Steeped in the pop philosophies of the 1960s,
Henning meditated daily and did yoga between shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, being a magician was not the classiest
thing to be,'' he said. ``It was like being a folk singer before
Bob Dylan.''
</P>
<P>
   As a student at McMaster College in Hamilton, Ontario, Henning
studied psychology but planned all along to pursue magic as a
career. (His senior thesis was on hypnosis.)
</P>
<P>
   He got his first professional job at 14, performing at a family
friend's house. He later put an advertisement in a local newspaper
reading: ``Magician: Have Rabbit, Will Travel.''
</P>
<P>
   After his success with ``The Magic Show'' and on television,
Henning returned to Broadway twice, in the 1983 musical ``Merlin,''
and in a 1984 solo show, ``Doug Henning and His World of Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   In each show, his illusions became increasingly complex. In
``Merlin,'' for example, Henning created the image of a flying
horseman disappearing into thin air and his co-star Chita Rivera
being turned to stone. As happened with ``The Magic Show,'' the
musical portion of the show received poor marks while Henning's
ingenuity was hailed.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Henning retired from the stage and became
increasingly interested in transcendental meditation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he announced that he and the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a
spiritual adviser, would build a $1.5 billion theme park near
Niagara Falls, Ontario. Dubbed Veda Land, it would be the first
theme park concerned with spiritual enlightenment and would include
a levitating building and a journey into the heart of a rose. The
project's status is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his absence from the scene, the monthly Magic Magazine
reported last July that Henning had been sighted at several magic
stores around the country. He posed for photographs, signed
autographs and then disappeared once again.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and former assistant, Debby.

GOVERNMENT REPORT PROPELS MARKETS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to adjust figures in 6th graf and for Cisco, IBM, Wal-Mart,

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad advance Tuesday after a
government report indicated that the economy could continue to
expand without an appreciable increase in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were particularly strong, and the Nasdaq
composite index rose to its third consecutive record. But the Dow
Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index,
which so far this year have been struggling, registered solid
gains. And the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks
rose to a new record.
</P>
<P>
   One billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
At 1.94 billion shares, the Nasdaq stock market had its
second-busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
   All these gains were set in motion by the Labor Department,
which early Tuesday issued a report showing that worker
productivity rose faster than expected in the fourth quarter while
labor costs fell for a second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calculus is pretty straightforward,'' said Jeffrey
Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. ``As
productivity accelerates, the need for the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates becomes less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by stocks like Microsoft, Immunex and Qualcomm, the Nasdaq
composite index jumped 105.73, a gain of 2.5 percent, to 4,427.50.
It was the seventh straight gain for the index, and the first time
it has closed above 4,400.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dow gained 51.81, an increase of 0.5 percent, to
10,957.60. Interest-rate-sensitive financial stocks like J.P.
Morgan and retailers like Wal-Mart Stores helped to pull the Dow
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Big gains in technology names like Yahoo and EMC pushed the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 17.51, or 1.2 percent, to 1441.75.
And the Russell 2000 small cap index, which like the Nasdaq is
moving on strength in technology and biotechnology stocks, closed
at 537.49, a gain of 5.10, or 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of people who are seeing technology as the
instrument for growth,'' said Steve Witt, a managing director at
Firsthand Funds in San Jose, Calif., a mutual fund that invests
exclusively in technology issues. ``As long as technology is
perceived that way, I don't think this is going to stop. The
majority of these companies have reported phenomenal earnings
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems became the latest technology company to issue a
strong earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   After the close, the biggest maker of Internet equipment
reported earnings that were better than consensus estimates. The
company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, which has risen sharply in the last week, fell 3/8, to
124 13/16 during regular trading. But the stock jumped following
the announcement, and traded as high as 131 5/8 in after-hours
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, another technology belwether, had a good day. The
stock gained 3 5/16, to 109 15/16. And IBM, another Dow component,
climbed 4 5/8, to 118 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Among retailing stocks, Wal-Mart rose 2 5/8 to 59 1/4 after an
analyst at Lehman Brothers raised his priced target on the shares
to 100.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers also rose. Home Depot was up 1 7/8, to 61 3/8,
and Costco Wholesale advanced 1 13/16, to 53 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some big insurance companies, financial
service stocks did well.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan gained 5/8 to 119 1/2. American Express was up 9/16
to 163. Citigroup rose 1 5/8 to 55 3/4. And Merrill Lynch closed at
97 1/16, up 5 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a bad day for the beleaguered tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations in a lawsuit that the companies conspired to fix
cigarette prices sent the stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris fell 1 1/16, to 19 1/2, a record low. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco declined 3/8, to 18 1/4. And British American
Tobacco, a holding company for Brown &AMP; Williamson, fell 3/4, to 8
1/2.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They stood Michael Grant and Lennox Lewis between a
scale model of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building
on the left and the twin towers of the World Trade Center on the
right. They're calling their April 29 bout at Madison Square Garden
``13 Feet and 500 Pounds of Fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bout between Grant, at 6 foot 7, and Lewis, at 6-5,
will involve two of the tallest heavyweights ever to fight for the
undisputed heavyweight championship. And the way that both fighters
were talking Tuesday, one of them is going to be stretched _ as in
horizontal on the canvas _ before the bout is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, brother, you ain't got to be scared,'' Grant said to
Lewis. ``But I had a vision. You're going to get knocked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you don't say you're going to knock me out in the
third round, it's OK,'' Lewis said, referring to a failed prefight
prediction by Evander Holyfield when Holyfield fought Lewis in the
first of their two bouts. Holyfield is Grant's friend and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   It is an intriguing bout for both Lewis and Grant. Lewis
(35-1-1) is at the pinnacle of his career, having defeated
Holyfield for the undisputed heavyweight championship last Nov. 13.
Grant (31-0) is trying to reach the top. They are both strong,
athletic heavyweights with good jabs and powerful right hands.
Grant, 27, didn't start boxing until he was 20 years old and has a
limited amateur background. The conventional wisdom is that Lewis,
33, is trying to catch Grant on the rise. Lewis agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather get him now before he gets better,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lewis has sidestepped the mandatory challenges from the
three sanctioning organizations that he represents to fight Grant,
who is ranked No. 2 by the International Boxing Federation, he
isn't worried about being stripped of any of his championship
belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be making a grave mistake if they did that, because
who else better to represent the belts than me?'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the horizon could be Mike Tyson, who recently took
Lewis' home country of England by storm. Tyson's European tour
could continue. An Italian promoter has made an offer to have
Tyson's next bout, against Lou Savarese, in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had been asked to do television commentary for Tyson's
bout against Julius Francis, the British heavyweight champion, but
Lewis passed on the offer and instead spent his time on the beach
in Jamaica. Lewis said that he isn't surprised at the tumultuous
reception that Tyson received in London and Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that Tyson has never fought in England,''
Lewis said. ``People only know Tyson from TV and the papers. All of
a sudden when he's in Britain, people went to see who is this guy
who was on TV, who is this guy who bit people, who is this guy who
has been in jail. That's how British people are. They're excited to
see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis didn't have much of an opinion of Tyson's fight against
Francis, whom Lewis sparred with before his second fight against
Oliver McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you make an opinion of that fight?'' Lewis said.
``There was only one guy fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he wants to fight Riddick Bowe, whom he said he heard
is back in the gym, and Tyson, because it will close the book on
fighters from his era who avoided him early in his career. He said
he believes that a fight against Tyson will happen by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to whip him _ let's just leave it at that,'' Lewis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he wanted to take on Tyson before Grant, but said the
bout could not be made because of ``politricks.'' Tyson has an
exclusive contract with Showtime, while Lewis has an exclusive
contract with Home Box Office, and neither cable company wants to
see their man fighting on the other network. TVKO, the pay-per-view
arm of HBO, will broadcast Lewis' bout against Grant ($44.95).
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said that once he fights Tyson, he would consider
retirement.

SOME HOTELS OFFERING A DAILY FEE FOR TELEPHONE SERVICE, OTHER
AMENITIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Want to really annoy a weary business traveler who's looking
forward to refuge in a nice, well-appointed hotel room that will
serve as an on-the-road office? Stick a laminated card on the night
stand announcing that it costs a dollar to pick up the phone to
make a credit card or toll-free call.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward tacking on charges for necessities like the
telephone has been accelerating recently as hotels try to bolster
profits with fees that many guests don't notice until check-out
time. Many hotels say the phone surcharges cover huge demands on
telephone systems as more laptop-toting guests spend hours on the
phone checking e-mail or going online. But many business travelers
complain that they are being pickpocketed nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels, aware of the customer irritation, are offering
guests an option: a flat daily fee that covers phone access and
other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I encountered the flat-fee system during a four-night
stay at the sprawling Pointe Hilton South Mountain Resort in
Phoenix. Beside the bedside phone was a card announcing a daily $8
``Resort Services Fee'' for unlimited toll-free and credit card
calls, unlimited local calls, a daily ``in-suite pot of coffee,''
fitness-center, tennis and volleyball court time, incoming and
outgoing faxes, and ``delivery of USA Today newspaper .''
</P>
<P>
   My initial reaction was annoyance at being banged $8 a day
involuntarily, since I wasn't planning to visit the health club,
play tennis, use the fax, peruse USA Today or even make more than a
couple of daily phone calls. But after I got home, I phoned the
hotel to ask about the fee. Jim Austin, the public relations
director, said that the desk clerk who checked me in should have
explained what the $8 fee covered, and that it could be declined.
(The clerk hadn't done this.) An optional fee changes the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The South Mountain Hilton and two sister Hilton hotels in
Phoenix, Squaw Peak and Tapatio Cliffs, instituted the flat fee
about 18 months ago after polling guests and finding that phone
surcharges and fees for things like in-room coffee ``really
bothered them,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were giving them vouchers for four complimentary cocktails
when they arrived, but people were saying, `We'd rather have free
coffee than free drinks,''' he said. ``We also charged a dollar for
every outgoing local call. They were kind of feeling like they were
getting nickel-and-dimed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 80 percent of the customers accept the $8 fee when it is
explained to them as they check in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And no, the $8 fee doesn't cover amenities that used to be free,
Austin said. For those who decline the fee, using the phone is $1;
admission to the well-equipped fitness center is $15 a day; tennis
courts are $16 for 90 minutes; coffee is $3 a package; outgoing
faxes are $3 for the first page and $1 for subsequent pages, and
USA Today is 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a $1 charge for a phone call to turn their
experience with us into a negative one,'' Austin said. ``We get a
great deal of return business from business travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``At some hotels, you can go down to check out at the
front desk and really be surprised: `Whaddya mean I got $27 in
phone calls in just one day?' That can be kind of a shock. That's
exactly what we don't want to happen. We want our guests to be in
control. We don't want them to be surprised with a lot of little
charges that all of a sudden add up to a budget breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis on Comfort
</P>
<P>
   For the growing numbers of business travelers who fly steerage
in the back of the plane, there are some indications that the
industry, eager to grab more business-travel fares, may be starting
to pay attention to the howls about the lack of comfort in coach.
Last week, AMR's American Airlines stunned the industry by
announcing that it is refitting its fleet, about 700 planes, to add
more legroom in coach _ a move that will reduce the airline's
overall coach capacity by 6.4 percent. American is adding three to
five extra inches between rows.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue Airways, the well-financed new low-fare airline that
starts operations Friday with flights between Kennedy International
Airport and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., also is stressing comfort in its
inaugural ads. One billboard says: ``A new airline that's cheap and
comfortable? Sure, and I'm dating the tooth fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue says all its seats are 18.5 inches wide, compared with
the standard 17 inches in most airline coach sections. The distance
between rows is also slightly greater than the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is rolling out new destinations: Buffalo, starting
Feb. 17, and Tampa, Fla., starting March 16. By the end of this
year, JetBlue says it will have 10 destinations, and expects to add
20 more cities within three years.

A TIP LEADS DETECTIVES TO $100 MILLION IN DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (nk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOTOWA, N.J. _ Acting on a tip, state police detectives seized
an estimated $100 million worth of cocaine and marijuana on Sunday
that had been brought to New Jersey in two tractor-trailers loaded
with rotting yellow peppers, the authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Carson J. Dunbar Jr., the head of the state police, said
the wholesale value of the cache _ $24.5 million _ equaled nearly
half of the wholesale worth of all narcotics that the state police
seized in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big, big seizure,'' Dunbar said during a news
conference at a state police troop headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cache included 1,870 pounds of cocaine with an
estimated street value of about $85 million and about 1,900 pounds
of marijuana with an estimated street value of about $15 million.
Five New York City residents and an Arizona man were arrested and
charged with conspiracy and possession of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   All have been ordered held without bail, said John Hagerty, a
spokesman for the state police. Detectives also confiscated $86,464
in cash from one of the trailer trucks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the shipment remains under investigation, Dunbar
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state police learned about the shipments on Friday and began
a stakeout at a leased warehouse in Fairview in southern Bergen
County, he said. One of the two trailer trucks was already parked
inside, and the second arrived about 3 p.m. on Sunday, he said.
Shortly afterward, he said, the trucks went to a rest area on the
New Jersey Turnpike a few miles south of Fairview.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, a van left the warehouse, loaded with the
packages of cocaine. Detectives stopped the vehicle and arrested
its occupants, identified as Francisco Reyes, 25, and Carlos
Torres, 32, both of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   At the rest area, detectives seized the two trucks and arrested
four other suspects. They included two Bronx men, William
Caraballo, 43, and Anthony Manzanet, 30; Jacqueline Nunez, 35, of
Manhattan, and Edgar Gracia, 26, of Nogales, Ariz., the authorities
said.

SCOTTSDALE CANDIDATE AWASH IN LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANA BALAZS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - A Scottsdale City Council candidate is
being investigated for fabricating his past, including the claim he
was quitting the race because he has leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Tredway, 51, an apart ment hotel owner, is not talking. But
Scottsdale police and city elections officials want to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway, who was involved two years ago in the passage of a
statewide ballot measure aimed at curbing political corruption, was
making his first run for public office and had caught the attention
of the slow-growth fac tion in Scottsdale. He cam paigned against
using public money to fund private develop ments such as the Los
Arcos arena for the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted this week that he made up parts of his resume _
including his college background, his birthplace and his family
background _ after questions were raised by reporters. Then, he
admitted making up the leuke mia diagnosis that had triggered an
outpouring of sympathy in Scottsdale on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters are angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen him active as can be in the community and (as)
someone that we trusted. Obvi ously, he has betrayed that trust to
us and the public,'' said Bob Vairo, vice president of the Coali
tion of Pinnacle Peak, which endorsed Tredway for the March 14
election.
</P>
<P>
   The group interviewed Tred way in depth and did a public-re
cords check on him before issuing the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally asked him before we chose him, I asked him, `Is
there anything in your back ground that would be an embar rassment?
Is there anything in your background that the news papers could
pick up and be an embarrassment to you and to us who are supporting
you?' He said, `No,' '' coalition member Darlene Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale police launched an investigation Tuesday into whether
Tredway misrepre sented himself and violated cam paign laws. At the
least, he could be charged with perjury for providing false
information on election documents.
</P>
<P>
   Although he announced his withdrawal from the race in an e-mail
addressed to the media and residents of Scottsdale, elec tion
officials say he hasn't talked to them and his name is on the
ballot, printed this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people withdraw from a race before, but I've never
had someone come for ward with this remarkable of a situation, if
you will,'' said Karen Osborne, Maricopa County elec tions
director, whose department counts ballots for city elections.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if he had been elected and then it was learned
that he had lied about his past, any votes for him would have been
declared null and he would not have been allowed to take office.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by a reporter Tues day, Tredway said, ``I have no
comment,'' without even waiting for a question.
</P>
<P>
   He told his apartment hotel tenant, Bill Gilbert, 48, that he
would not be returning home for a couple of days. Tredway lives at
the 12-unit Abode Apartment Hotel, 3635 N. 68th St., which he
operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is a straight-up guy,'' said Gilbert, a cabdriver. ``He
runs a nice place. He helps a lot of people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Tredway said he is a tireless worker who serves
his community well and volunteers his services to a vari ety of
causes. On Tuesday, he resigned by telephone as treas urer and
board member of the Clean Elections Institute Inc., which he helped
found.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Strong, general manager of the Gentle Strength Coopera tive
in Tempe, said Tredway has been a member of the natural-foods store
since 1984 and serves as a board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have known this guy for years, and now we don't even know
who he is,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   On his election resume, Tred way said he attended Franconia
College in Franconia, N.H., from 1966 to 1969. New Hampshire's Post
Secondary Education Com mission has no record of Tred way,
Administrative Assistant Patricia Edes said.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway has been a vocal opponent of a Coyotes arena at Los
Arcos Mall and a prolific newspaper letter writer.
</P>
<P>
   He campaigned against city incumbents, calling the current
council ``dysfunctional,'' and used a bulldog as a symbol on his
campaign brochure, over the statement: ``I want to be your
watchdog!'' In the same piece, he referred to himself as having
``experience, integrity, commit ment, leadership.'' &QL;
