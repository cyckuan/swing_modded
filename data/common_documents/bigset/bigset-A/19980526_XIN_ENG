<HEADLINE> Support Rate for Single Currency Rises in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Support rate in Britain for the
Single European currency, named euro, has risen sharply over the
last month, according to the latest Guardian/ICM opinion poll
published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which polled 1,101 British adults earlier this
month, showed although Euro-scepticism still commands substantial
backing in Britain, it has fallen below a majority of 50 percent
for the first time after dropping 13 points in the last month.
</P>
<P>
The support for the euro, due to be launched in January 1999,
has risen by eight points to 34 percent, its highest level in
three years, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian report explained that the change of heart appears
to have been influenced by the announcement by the 11 other
European Union (EU) countries that they are definitely joining the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll also revealed that as the rest of
15-nation bloc travels further down the road of European Monetary
Union (EMU), opposition to the EMU project may well weaken as
British people accept the inevitability of the new currency.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labor government has made it clear that Britain would
not join the single currency in the first wave, but would consider
joining the euro club later.

<HEADLINE> UK Costs of Fraud Cases Rise 27 pct in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- There was a large increase in the
cost of big fraud cases in Britain last year, and although the
total number of such cases fell, the cost rose by 27 percent,
according to the Financial Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by the accountant KPMG, the newspaper said that
there were 55 cases of fraud involving sums of more than 100,000
pounds (163,000 US dollars) last year, down from the 74 cases
recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the cost of the frauds rose by 27 percent from 95
million pounds (155 million US dollars) in 1996 to 120 million
pounds (196 million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the banking and financial sector suffered
the most frauds last year, with 18 cases worth more than 100,000
pounds and the total cost rising dramatically from four million
pounds (6.5 million US dollars) in 1996 to 73 million pounds (119
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It showed that in the past decade, a total number of 616 big
fraud cases were recorded by the accountant, with the cost at 3.6
billion pounds (6 billion US dollars), and 1995 saw the highest
cost at 1.2 billion pounds (2 billion US dollars).

LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A British government official said

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Council to Ease Tension in Coal Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Security Council Monday
adopted a program to normalize economic and social conditions in
the country's coal mining regions, according to the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The council noted in a meeting in the Kremlin that the
situation in the industry has deteriorated to an extent that needs
to be considered by the country's top security agency and the
president.
</P>
<P>
The move came after coal miners blocked two lines on the
Trans-Siberian railway last week in protest over 8.7 billion
rubles (1.45 billion U.S. dollars) unpaid wages. The government
and miners leaders later agreed on a program to pay the backlog.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, presidential press secretary Sergei
Yastrzhembsky told reporters that the failure of the preceding
government to do much for the industry was one of the causes of
the troubles.
</P>
<P>
The council pledged to take measures to stabilize the economic
and social situation in the country's coal mining regions and to
reform the industry, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed to the need to toughen penalties for disturbing
transport and to punish enterprise managers for deliberately
failing to pay wages.

<HEADLINE> International Loans to Asia Fall in 2nd Half of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Lending by banks in major industrial
countries to Asia fell by 4.8 billion US dollars to 381 billion US
dollars in the second half of 1997, the Financial Times reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing new debt figures out Monday from the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), the newspaper said that marked
drops in international bank lending to South Korea and Thailand
were offset by an increase in loans to China.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures showed that international bank lending to
both Latin America and eastern Europe rose at the same time, with
lending to the former increasing by 23.8 billion US dollars to 283
billion US dollars while loans to the latter rising by 8.3 billion
US dollars to 123 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BIS said this indicated that the financial crises which
swept the Asian region had only a limited effect on bank financing
to the above two regions.
</P>
<P>
"The further increases in the claims on Latin America and
eastern European countries point to limited contagion outside
Asia," the BIS said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the BIS is planning to produce quarterly
figures, instead of the current twice-a-year publication, and to
expand the number of countries from which it collects loan data.

Wang Shubin was arrested earlier by the local procuratorate

In December 1996, Wang Shubin received 50,000 yuan from a local

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
Monday urged African countries to struggle for the continent's
economic freedom through their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chiluba when speaking at the State
House here to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of
the Organization of African Unity and the African Freedom Day
which fall on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a one-hour-long speech, the Zambian president pointed out
that there is no political independence without economic freedom
and that Africa, thereforest launch a new struggle to gain
economic freedom after most of the African countries became
independent politically 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba said that "the struggle will be long and
hazardous, but it must be fought with the same zeal,
determination and tenacity that characterized the fight for
political freedom."
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Chiluba placed special emphasis on Africa's
self-reliance in the struggle for economic freedom.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that the world does not owe Africa a living.
We owe it to ourselves. We should struggle to develop this
continent through our own effort, sweat and toil, for only sweat
and toil will give us and our children a better life," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian leader also urged the African countries to unite
on the economic front. He said no single African country has the
capacity to fight poverty and foreign debt which has exceeded 200
billion U.S. Dollars for the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
Africa should unite and speak with one voice and act as one on
the matters important to them, said Chiluba, adding that "there
is no problem in Africa that is too big for Africa to solve."
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people including all the ambassadors to Lusaka
and the government ministers were invited to participate in the
grand celebrations.

undermined the public trust in the atomic industry that was
difficult to restore in short term.
</P>
<P>
In a nation with a powerful environmental movement, the
nuclear-waste leaks have sparked a public outcry recently and
prompted the government to order the suspension of all nuclear
waste shipments both within the country and to abroad.
</P>
<P>
At the request of opposition parties, which have already
demanded resignation of Merkel, the German parliament is due to
hold a special session on Wednesday to clarify whether the
environment ministry had be informed of the contaminated shipments
earlier but failed to stop them in time.
</P>
<P>
Transportation of nuclear waste has been a major issue in
Germany for years with the government having to deploy large
troops of police along railway lines every year in protection
against widespread anti-nuclear protests.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists has long called on the government to shut
down the country's 19 nuclear power plants which provide about 34
percent of the country's energy supply.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament Speaker Criticizes Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis Monday criticized neighboring Turkey for its
"aggressive" position towards Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes,
Kaklamanis said that Turkey had since 1973 been gradually
developing a specific aggressive strategy against Greece.
</P>
<P>
Despite Greece's constructive stance on a number of issues,
Turkey has continued its aggressive stance with gradually raising
its claims from the sea area, to air space and more recently to
territorial claims in the Aegean Sea against Greece's sovereign
rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent statements by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
the speaker stressed that Clinton had disappointed Greeks.
</P>
<P>
While urging both Greece and Turkey to make difficult decisions
to settle their problems, Clinton said in London recently that he
did not think they could solve one problem in isolation from the
others. He thought they had to move forward on all these problems,
Cyprus, the Aegean jurisdictional disputes and the role of Turkey
in Europe's future.
</P>
<P>
Greece has firmly rejected Clinton's such proposal, saying that
there could be no issue of a package solution to the differences
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
and the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Greek-Turkish relations have been worsening for
Turkey's claims over Greece's four uninhabited islands in the
eastern Aegean Sea.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Salutes Reinforcement of African Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said in Harare Monday that there has been reinforcement of
African unity through efforts to solve the many conflicts that
afflict the continent, according to Pan-Africa News Agency PANA.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in the capital of Zimbabwe to mark
Africa Freedom Day which falls on Monday, Mugabe said the new
African unity has been reflected in the common resolve to
maintain democratic governments as well as independence and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"What is important and significant, though rather than render
us divided and helpless, these conflicts have seen Africa
galvanized and spurred in efforts to resolve them," said Mugabe,
current Chairman of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
He added that the reinforcement of African unity will render
the continent in good stead as it prepared for political and
economic changes and opportunities of the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe cited the military coup against the elected government
of Sierra Leone last year, saying that the OAU, using the
military leverage of the economic community of west African
states, mounted a successful military campaign in March last year
which saw the restoration of the government of President Ahmad
Tedjan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding on May 25, 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
the OAU's main challenge has been military governments and the
problems they posed.
</P>
<P>
These have distracted the attention from the economic problems
faced by a continent rated as the world's poorest.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Mugabe noted that there has also been a
concerted effort to wring Africa from the economic problems it
faces, particularly in reference to its trade relations with the
western developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"Meetings such as those of ministers of trade and industry
held in Harare in last April to prepare for this month's World
Trade Organizaiton's Ministerial Conference and of the OAU
Economic and Social Council in Cairo in late April have helped
coordinate our positions on international economic policy
issues," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He described the developments as encouraging and welcome,
saying they will enhance Africa's position in the emerging global
village in terms of economic, political, defense and security
issues.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Slovenia Agree to Cooperate in Joining EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Slovenia agreed on
Monday to cooperate in their efforts to win the membership of the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"We have decided ... to cooperate closely, exchange experience
and information, and join forces to achieve this common goal,"
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said after a meeting
with visiting Slovenian Foreign Minister Boris Frlec.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides hailed Slovenia as a new modern state on the basis
of the western European model, preparing itself for a free market
economy.
</P>
<P>
He termed the two countries as having "common objectives."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, Slovenia and four other countries started accession
talks with the EU in March.
</P>
<P>
Frlec said that his visit covers bilateral and multilateral
issues.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that since both countries share the values and
objectives, "it would be non-practical if we did not cooperate
closely."
</P>
<P>
"We (have) decided to intensify political contacts in the
future to help each other, and in this respect, Slovenia will
always support Cyprus: one country to join the EU," Frlec said.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian official met with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides early Monday. During the meeting, Clerides briefed Frlec
on the latest developments of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Frlec said that Slovenia, currently a non-permanent member of
the United Nations Security Council, is willing to help solve the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island to protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities after a failed
coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The world community is making efforts to help reunify the
island under a U.N.-sponsored bizonal and bicommunal formula. But
so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
During Frlec's visit, the two countries signed an agreement on
mutual exemption of visas.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Dismisses His Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday
surprisingly announced the dismissal of his spokesman, Peter
Hausmann, in a move which German media said was apparently
intended to improve his government's public relation management in
the runup to the September general elections.
</P>
<P>
Hausmann would be replaced by Otto Hauser, a parliament member
of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Kohl said in a
statement on Monday without giving any explanation.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Kohl also named a former
editor-in-chief of the German mass-circulation newspaper Bild
Zeitung, as his election campaign adviser.
</P>
<P>
Hausmann, who had been in office as the government spokesman
since 1995, had never developed a comfortable relationship with
the media and appeared to be kept out of Kohl's inner circle, the
German news agency DPA said.
</P>
<P>
Oskar Lafontaine, leader the main opposition Social Democratic
party (SPD), meanwhile said that Hausmann's dismissal reflected
the "helplessness" of Kohl's government due to its major backstand
in opinion polls and would also offer little help to improve the
situation.

HANOI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A national no-smoking week began in
Vietnam on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that half of the people under 20 and 90 percent
of the people aged at 40-45 in Vietnam are smokers.
</P>
<P>
About 98,000 pneumonia patients and 99,000 acute bronchitis
patients are reported in Vietnam each year. The two diseases are
ranked as the second and third killer diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 30,000 people suffer from pulmonary
tuberculosis each year.
</P>
<P>
There are 21 cigarette factories operating in the country. They
produced 1,970 million packages in 1996, a per capita share of 518
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
This does not include the cigarettes illegally smuggled into
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has banned smoking in creches,
hospitals, meetings and other public places, and listed cigarettes
as goods subject to special sales tax.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Minister Describes Economy as Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou on Monday described Cyprus' economy as
"robust," with an average annual growth rate of 4 percent, higher
than that of the European Union (EU) average.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day conference to promote Cyprus' role as a
business and financial hub, Christodoulou said his country's per
capita gross domestic product (GDP) is 20,500 U.S. dollars in
terms of purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The figure issued by the World Bank's "World Development
Indicators 1998" puts Cyprus "in a higher position than seven of
the 15 EU member-states and in the 16th position worldwide," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for further liberalization of
Cyprus' economy, as full EU membership will inevitably also lead
to European Monetary Unit membership. The EU started accession
negotiations with Cyprus on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the conference on Cyprus in view of its EU
membership and the economic globalization, governor of the Cyprus
Central Bank, Afxentis Afxentiou, stressed the need for financial
adjustments on the island.
</P>
<P>
This adjustment process which aims at "deregulating and
modernizing Cyprus' institutional structure," will "not only align
our financial sector with the European Union norms, but also
enhance its competitiveness and efficiency," Afxentiou said.
</P>
<P>
This will undoubtedly greatly encourage the promotion of Cyprus
as a major regional and international center for business and
financial activities, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people from home and abroad participated in the
the conference, which opened here Monday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Coalition Foils No-Confidence Motions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli coalition government
foiled two no-confidence motions on Monday after its Knesset
(parliament) members boycotted the voting.
</P>
<P>
Coalition Knesset members said they did not participate in the
voting because the opposition has violated a tradition not to put
forward no-confidence motion when the prime minister is out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently visiting
China.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli laws, the opposition must have 61 votes to win a
no-confidence motion in the Knesset. But the coalition has 61
members in the 120-seat Knesset. The boycott of its Knesset
members has left no chance for the opposition to win the voting.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motions were presented respectively by the
Labor party, and the leftwing Meretz party and Hadash party.
</P>
<P>
The Labor party has blamed the government for the stalemate in
the peace process, and the Meretz party and Hadash party have
accused Netanyahu of failing to reach an agreement with the
Palestinians on troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The coalition has asked the opposition parties to postpone the
motions to next week when Netanyahu returns.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parties went ahead with the vote for the
reason that Netanyahu has never answered any no-confidence motions
in the past two years after he came to power.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Waters Opened to Foreign Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola has opened its waters to
three foreign petroleum corporations including Esso Exploration
and Production Angola Limited, of the United States, for deep-sea
oil tapping.
</P>
<P>
A news communique issued by the Angola state petroleum company
revealed Monday that the No. 24 water area which newly opened to
foreign companies is 335 km south of the capital Luanda, and
covers 4,778 square kilometers, with a depth of 488 to 1,798
meters.
</P>
<P>
Angola state petroleum company will have 20 percent of right
to the area's exploitation, Esso enjoys 50 percent, whereas the
other two companies have 15 percent each, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Angola state petroleum company is negotiating with
the other three partners on the allocation percentage of oil to
be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Angola has rich oil reserves in its waters which
has drawn the attention of many world renowned petroleum
companies.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, foreign companies have
discovered three off-shore oil fields in the waters near Luanda.
One of them discovered by Esso has already started production
with 6,800 barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
Another oil field tapped by Esso in the same area now yields
10,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Elf Exploration Angola, a French oil company's subsidiary, has
tapped an oil field 200 km northwest of Luanda, which now
produces 12,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
In addition to off-shore petroleum, Angola is now undertaking
research on on-shore oil exploitation. Angola state petroleum
company will join hands with foreign oil corporations which have
won public tender to work toward this goal.

Syria is located on the forefront against Israel and the Muslim
states should develop economic cooperation with it, he said.

Another agreement was on conducting joint studies in the field

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's record high unemployment has
costed the country 166 billion marks (93 billion U.S. dollars) in
1997, the highest level since the 1990 German reunification, a
government job market research institute said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Institute for Job Market and Occupation
Research, about 55 percent of the unemployment costs resulted from
direct payments by the government to the country's 4.4 million
jobless people last year and about 45 percent were due to lost tax
revenues and social contributions.
</P>
<P>
On average, every jobless in Germany could get 21,000 mark
(about 12,000 dollars) in government help last year, the institute
said in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Court Throws out Case Against Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Federal High Court of Nigeria
Monday dismissed the suit by lawyer Gani Fawehinmi against the
adoption of the head of state, General Sani Abacha, as a
consensus candidate for the August 1 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ruling on the preliminary objection by the federal government
to the court's jurisdiction in the matter, Chief Judge Justice
Babatunde Belgore said the court had no powers to entertain the
case.
</P>
<P>
Belgore explained that the court could not entertain the
matter unless it involved the administrative or executive
functions of the government or actions performed by the
government or any of its agencies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Abacha, who was listed as the first defendant in
the case, "is not the federal government but an individual."
</P>
<P>
"Abacha is not the federal government, although he is the
head, but he is not the whole and there is no evidence to show
that he performed any executive or administrative role in the
adoption, which was only the parties' affair," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the five political parties, which were listed as
the second to the sixth respondents, were not agents of the
federal government but corporate entities which could sue or be
sued in their independent capacities.
</P>
<P>
Belgore also said that the seventh defendant, the National
Electoral Committee of Nigeria (NICON), was a corporate entity
like the political parties.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the eighth defendant, the Attorney-General of
the Federation, "is definitely an agent of the the federal
government," adding "there was no allegation against him."
</P>
<P>
Fawehinmi filed the case early this month, seeking the court
to declare illegal the adoption of Abacha's consensus candidacy
by the five parties last month.

here Monday that he is optimistic about his country's once-sourced
ties with Kuwait in the future.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Osman Ismail, on the last day of his three-day visit,
said his country is keen on overcoming the period of alienation
caused by the deep wound left by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We are certain that the Kuwaiti leadership ... would respond
positively to what would boost the sought Arab solidarity and with
our sincere efforts to overcome the period of alienation," the
Kuwaiti News Agency quoted Ismail as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is Ismail's second visit to Kuwait in less than a year.
During his previous visit in July, he expressed Khartoum's wish to
normalize relations with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations soured after the Gulf War in 1991
during which Sudan sided with Iraq. Kuwait is represented in
Sudan by a Charge D'Affaires while Sudanese Embassy in Kuwait has
been closed for more than six years.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is normalizing ties with what it described as "enemy
countries" including Sudan, Yemen, Jordan and the Palestinian
National Authority which supported Iraq during the Gulf War that
liberated Kuwait from the seven-month Iraqi occupation.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Urged to Tell Truths About Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada skims off the best and
brightest people from the developing world without cautioning them
about the hard realities immigrants might face here, reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government has an obligation to tell would-be immigrants
about the difficulties they might encounter once they are in
Canada, according to community leaders.
</P>
<P>
It's easy for highly skilled doctors, engineers and scientists
to immigrate, "but very difficult for them to find jobs in their
respective areas," said G. Nabi Chaudhary, president of the
National Federation of Pakistani Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"Some people sell everything to come to Canada, and they should
be given some prospects beforehand of what they could be facing,"
Chaudhary was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
For many newcomers unfamiliar with the cost of living or the
realities of the job market in Canada, the consequences of
immigrating here have been grim.
</P>
<P>
Savings are quickly depleted and people find that they can't
break into the Canadian market without extensive retraining. "I
personally know people with PhDs working as security guards," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If they had been properly counseled and cautioned, these
people might have thought twice about coming, or come first to
explore job opportunities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Baljinder Gill, president of the National Association of
Canadians of Origins in India, noted that many immigrants from
India "don't know what they are getting into."
</P>
<P>
The problem is especially severe among immigrants from Eastern
Europe, said Aris Babikian, president of the Armenian National
Federation of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Babikian suggested that Canada's oversea embassy staff be
trained so that a person applying to come to Canada gets the whole
picture.

<HEADLINE> More Phone Lines Demanded in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is facing a deficit of up
to 133,171 telephone lines across the country, a study by the
Geneva-based International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has
said.
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the Ugandan government, showed that
there is a demand of 184,000 fixed lines while only 51,829 lines
have so far been installed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will need some 380,000 lines by the year 2006 and the
demand can be satisfied only if the line service grows by 25
percent each year, the Nairobi-based East African weekly
newspaper Monday quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is among the countries with the lowest telephone
service penetration in the world although it has recorded an
annual economic growth rate of seven percent over the past years,
the highest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The low telephone density has been severely criticized by
foreign investors here as affecting the performance of their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
To satisfy a growing demand for telephone lines, the
government, among other measures, liberalized the
telecommunication sector.
</P>
<P>
A South African telecommunications company was licensed in
Uganda last month to compete with the Uganda Telecommunications
Limited, the sole provider of telephone service in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The newcomer plans to install 98,000 telephone lines in the
next five years, bringing the total number of lines in the
country up to more than 150,000.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Claims No Precondition for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash stated Monday that Turkish Cypriots have not put forward
any preconditions for resuming stalled Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in northern Cyprus, Denktash
called it a reality that there are two equal states respectively
ruled by Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities on the divided
island.
</P>
<P>
Such a demand by the Turkish Cypriot side can not be called by
Greek Cypriot side a precondition for the negotiations, Denktash
quoted by Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over northern Cyprus in a response to an abortive
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally established in 1983 the so-called
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was recognized only
by Turkey, a staunch supporter of Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus exists and this has
been emphasized by Turkey and us. If the Greek Cypriot side wishes
to reunite Cyprus, then we can hold negotiations with them upon
the principle of two states," said Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that the Cypriot government's plan to
deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles in the south has caused great
troubles for restarting peace talks between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader also criticized the Cypriot
government for starting membership negotiations with the European
Union last March, saying that it has no right to represent Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
With regard to his Tuesday meeting in northern Cyprus with
U.S. State Department Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas
Miller, Denktash said that he will reiterate Turkish Cypriots'
stance on this problem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. presidential emissary Richard Holbrooke failed to bring
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash to the conference
table despite his three-day diplomatic efforts on the island.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, spokesman with the U.S. State Department, had
said that the Turkish side should be held responsible for the
failure of the resumption of the stalled Cyprus peace talks.
However, Turkey and Turkish Cypriots denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have made
energetic efforts for the reunification of Cyprus but this aim
has not been achieved due to serious differences of the two rival
communities.
</P>
<P>
At present, Greece and Turkey, respective supporters of Greek
and Turkish Cypriots, both station massive troops on the small
eastern Mediterranean island.

<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kazakhstan
signed an agreement on economic cooperation here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the UAE will increase investments in oil,
mining, agriculture, industry and other sectors in Kazakhstan, a
Central Asian country which has opened 80 percent of the
state-owned enterprises to foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The UAE will employ more Kazakh workers and a joint committee
will be set up to supervise the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The UAE has imported an average of 250 million
U.S. dollars worth of perfumes and cosmetics annually between 1991
and 1996, according to the latest estimates of the Dubai Chamber
of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Dubai's imports of perfumes and cosmetics rose from 21,000
tonnes worth 464 million dirhams (126.43 million dollars) in 1991
to 30,600 tonnes worth 916 million dirhams (249.59 million
dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
That is a 46 percent increase in weight and 98 percent increase
in value over the five years.
</P>
<P>
France is the largest exporter of perfumes and cosmetics to
Dubai. It is followed by Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Commercial exploitation of a gold mine in Egypt's
Eastern Desert will be offered in June, the latest issue of the

<HEADLINE> Road Network Vital to Regional Links: E. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- East African leaders have
reached a consensus that a sound road network is crucial to
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international conference which opened in north
Tanzania's Arusha Monday, Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi said
east Africa is giving top priority to the development of a
reliable regional road network, which is vital for tightening
economic links of countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the newly formed East African
Cooperation (EAC) secretariat linking Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania,
and co-sponsored by the European Union and the World Bank, is
focusing on seeking financial assistance from international
donors to come up with a 4.2 billion U.S. Dollars plan to repair
and restore roads in the region.
</P>
<P>
EAC said in a statement that the regional network is critical
to the facilitation of regional integration. It involves five
major road corridors with their feeder links -- in all 6,605 km
of paved roads and 8,688 km of unpaved roads.
</P>
<P>
East African leaders say heavy rains blamed on the El Nino
weather phenomenon from late 1997 to January this year have
heavily damaged their already neglected roads. The cost of repair
is huge, threatening economic development.
</P>
<P>
Moi said road development will enhance trade and investment
within the region, as well as improve the competitiveness of the
products of the EAC members in the international market,
according to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to road, the three east African governments will
also work seriously to develop telecommunications, information,
technology, port facilities and power in the region, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged private investors to participate in the
development of the infrastructure in the region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Tanzanian President Mkapa said absence of a
sound regional infrastructure will only make EAC a dream.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the road network will also facilitate the
integration of east Africa market with that of other neighboring
countries and economic groupings such as Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also urged the three partner states to develop economic
infrastructure and services, including roads and railways,
maritime and inland water transport, posts and
telecommunications, as well as energy and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni appealed for urgent
integration of the roads network of the three countries. He said
the EAC goal of setting up a common market cannot be attained
without good roads, because poor roads are a barrier to trade.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also said the three east African countries, which
have a population of about 80 million, are an important area for
investors.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president challenged the EAC to build a modern
railway transport system with speedy trains using electric power.
</P>
<P>
Moi and Yoweri left for their countries respectively Monday.
The conference, attended by 130 delegates, will end Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said Monday he is not worried that using U.S. Secret
Service will jeopardize his privacy.
</P>
<P>
Chretien dismissed a report in Newsweek magazine, which
suggested his office had expressed privacy concerns to the Secret
Service over the possibility that security agents might be forced
to testify in court.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problem with that with any country in the
world," Chretien said. "I take whatever security that they give to
me."
</P>
<P>
Chretien denied that he nor his aides have made any complaints
to Secret Service director Lewis Merletti.
</P>
<P>
An affidavit Merletti filed in special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair said
unsolicited concerns about privacy had been raised by a foreign
leader.
</P>
<P>
He would not identify the leader except to say that he is the
"head of a G-7 country," referring to the Group of Seven
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Newsweek identified Chretien as the leader and said a top aide
to Chretien had relayed the concerns to Merletti in January.

BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Monday he did not expect that Turkey would be admitted into
the European Union "in foreseeable future".
</P>

"The decisive factors are not the cultural ones, but the human
rights situation, the conflict with the Kurds, the country's
economic problems and its relations with Greece," said Kinkel at a

<P>
Despite the EU membership dispute with Turkey, Kinkel stressed
Germany wanted to strengthen relations with the country in all
areas.
</P>

The relations between Turkey and EU have been soured after EU
leaders decided last December not to accept Turkey as an official
new member candidate, though they did not rule out its candidacy
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Celebrates Sphinx's 4,600th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's renowned recumbent beast-man
giant, the Sphinx, looked anew and stood glistening as a gala was
staged Monday night to mark its 4,600th birthday and completion of
a 10-year plastic surgery that cost 2.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) chief
Fedrico Mayor were the leading guests among international
luminaries at the feet of the Sphinx on the Pyramids plateau, west
of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Known as the world's most famous invalid, the Sphinx, 20 meters
tall and 57 meters long, was sculpted during the Fourth Dynasty
(2620-2500 BC) and often described as an ancient symbol of mystery.
</P>
<P>
Time and nature have taken their toll on the monument, which
represents King Khafre and shows him with a lion's body and a
pharaoh's head, facing eastward and guarding the Giza necropolis.
</P>
<P>
Termed by officials as "100 percent Egyptian," the latest round
of repairs was carried out by the Supreme Council of Antiquities
(SCA), with the participation of several UNESCO archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Mission Impossible was assigned to a team of
archaeologists, restorers and sculptors in 1988, in order to
restore the Sphinx to its former glory using 12,478 stones.
</P>
<P>
The statue had lost its royal headdress bearing a cobra and its
false beard, a sign of virility among the pharaohs and gods. Its
limestone structure has been severely damaged by acid rain,
erosion and elements of nature, and a large chunk of the shoulder
fell off in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Previous attempts at restoration dating back to the 18th
Dynasty (1400 BC), in which faulty techniques and materials were
used, not only ended in fiasco but caused more damages.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's ceremony, the UNESCO chief was honored for his
contribution to the restoration process. A 10-minute documentary
was then screened on the stages of repair work done on the
beast-man relic of ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Two Egyptian artists and a foreman of the project were the
others that were rewarded for their work. It was the first time
that sculptors were included in restoration work on the Sphinx.
</P>
<P>
A mock priest clad in Pharaonic garments, assisted by 30
soldiers also in white Pharaonic battle gear, then removed a white
Pharaonic star-spangled curtain draping the statue.
</P>
<P>
There came the renovated Sphinx, free from wooden scaffoldings,
looking deep into the endless desert under the starlit sky.
</P>
<P>
The repairs, mostly done on the left side, the chest and the
neck, have been completed. However controversy over restoration
techniques lingers on.
</P>
<P>
An Italian Egyptologist recently suggested that the base of the
Sphinx be sawn off so that glass chips can be inserted underneath
the statue to protect it against subterranean water.
</P>
<P>
But Gaballah Ali Gaballah, SCA secretary-general, refused even
to weigh the idea, declaring that a monument such as the Sphinx
was not to be experimented with.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the results of the restoration work as "a major
achievement which will make the Sphinx survive for thousands of
years."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of tourism and culture dignitaries from around the
world as well as foreign diplomats in Cairo took part in the
celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Welfare Hiring on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- As the economy booms and welfare
changes take hold, most of the large companies in the United
States have no program in place to hire people off the rolls, and
many of the existing programs are quite modest, according to an
Associated Press survey.
</P>
<P>
However, three times as many firms have programs today than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the nation's 100 largest companies, 34 say they have
welfare-to-work programs. Thirteen say they are planning programs.
The rest have no plans, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The interest is up from last year, when just eight companies
had programs and 16 were considering them.
</P>
<P>
"A year ago we were just an idea. In fact there was some
skepticism this idea was going to translate into reality," said
Eli Segal, president of the Welfare to Work Partnership, inspired
by President Bill Clinton to prod the private sector into hiring
recipients. It now has 5,000 member companies, each committed to
hiring at least one person.
</P>
<P>
A partnership survey shows that in the last year, 135,000
welfare recipients have been hired by U.S. companies, many of them
small companies. Seventy percent have health benefits and 70
percent are full-time. About 3.6 million adults were on welfare as
of last September, down from nearly 5 million at the time Clinton
took office, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the president has regularly called on the
private sector to hire those on welfare.
</P>
<P>
While the welfare rolls have dropped across the country, no one
knows for sure where people have landed. Many fear the fate of the
poor when economic times turn bad.
</P>
<P>
Corporate hiring offers the hope that people will find good
jobs during good times -- learning skills and developing good
habits -- and fare better if the economy turns sour.
</P>
<P>
But the AP survey found even many companies with programs have
started slowly.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on telephone interviews with every company,
also found:
</P>
<P>
-- Large companies are slightly more likely to participate in
welfare hiring programs;
</P>
<P>
-- Many firms without programs say they need high-tech
expertise not found in the typical welfare recipient;
</P>
<P>
-- Last year, 16 companies told the AP they planned programs.
Half of them have programs today. Five have nothing. Three still
plan them;
</P>
<P>
-- Most companies rely on third parties to prepare welfare
recipients for work. Programs range from two-week job readiness
classes to longer training for specific skills;
</P>
<P>
-- Several companies join with government agencies to solve
problems that welfare recipients often face.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Runs Into Controversy During Israeli Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich enraged the Palestinians and triggered an open quarrel
with them Monday by touring some of the sensitive spots concerning
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, Gingrich took a
bus in the morning to tour the holy city, whose status is one of
the most important issues in the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Matching his remarks that Israel should have full sovereignty
over the city, he visited the controversial site of Har Homa in
East Jerusalem, where Israel began to build a Jewish settlement
over a year ago and thus help block the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the U.S. administration, the speaker had
announced before he arrived in Israel last Saturday that he would
cancel a plan to visit the site of the proposed U.S. embassy in
Jerusalem. In a way to balance his attitude and the
U.S. government request, he peeped from windows while his bus was
passing by the site.
</P>
<P>
In a much clearer show of his stance in the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, he toured the West Bank on late
Monday afternoon. This time he was accompanied by Israeli National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, the leading hawk in the
Israeli coalition government who opposed to any further
redeployment in the West Bank larger than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eager to enlist support of the influential Jewish community in
the U.S. for what some people say his bid to run for the next
presidency in the year 2000, Gingrich had no intention to hide his
pro-Israel bias.
</P>
<P>
Siding with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he has
openly accused the U.S. government of pressuring Israel on the
further redeployment and repeated his views during the visit that
the security needs of Israel can only be defined by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has urged Gingrich to
show restraint during his visit to Israel and avoid provocative
actions. On his part, however, Gingrich saw the moderate appeals
as a threat from the Palestinians, saying they were "deliberate
and systematic provocations which...were despicable" and "should be
condemned.
</P>
<P>
Enraged by Gingrich's remarks and actions, the PNA threatened
Monday to cancel his scheduled meeting Wednesday with PNA
President Yasser Arafat. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
said Gingrich is "absolutely ignorant." "It seems to me that
Mr. Gingrich doesn't know ABC of the region, the people and the
conflict," he said.

achievements in economic construction and other fields under the
guidance of the theory of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>

improving investment environment, and a gradual opening of the
country's financial market.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Church Explosion Caused by Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The explosion that injured 33
worshippers at a church at Danville, eastern Illinois, Sunday was
caused by a bomb and it was the second attack on a church in
Vermilion County within six months, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A bomb killed a volunteer on December 30 at a church in
Oakwood, another east-central Illinois town about 16 kilometers
west of Danville.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were working to determine if there was any
connection between the two explosions in Vermilion County.
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) said
Monday that the next step for the investigators was to determine
who did the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The ATF laboratory in Rockville, Maryland, will examine the
Danville explosives for any resemblance to the Oakwood bomb and
others throughout the country, special agent Jerry Singer was
quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was placed outside the church between the wall and a
free-standing air conditioning unit and exploded during
worshipping.
</P>
<P>
Only six to eight teens were sitting near the blast Sunday,
fewer than normal because of the holiday weekend. Two girls were
in serious but stable condition Monday with head lacerations at a
hospital in Urbana. Four were in fair condition in a Danville
hospital, the news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Carrier Cut will not Weaken U.S. Firepower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Monday that U.S. firepower in the Gulf would not be
reduced because of one of two U.S. aircraft carriers withdrawn
from the region.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a very vigorous presence there, somewhere
between 17 and 20 thousand troops" Cohen told NBC's "Today"
program this morning. "There's a great deal of firepower
remaining and a lot of prepositioned equipment and the ability
to augment the size of that force within about 48 hours."
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Independent and its battle group went
through the Strait of Hormuz early on Sunday, heading toward its
home port in Japan in a regularly scheduled ship rotation.
Another carrier, the Stennis, remains in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who made the interview From Santiago, Chile, said U.S.
forces in the region "give us great capability, so Saddam
Hussein should not take any comfort. In fact, all of our allies
are really on board with trying to have a vigorous and viable
force in the region which can be quickly expanded."
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Eisenhower, scheduled to leave U.S. East
Coast for the Mediterranean next month, also could be sent to
the Gulf if the situation with Iraq heats up and another carrier
is required, the Pentagon has said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has maintained two carriers in the Gulf
since last November to bolster threats of a possible U.S.
military strike on Iraq if Iraq refuses full access to U.N.
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, refused to let the
United States mount air strikes from bases on their territory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forces Training Troops in Colombia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Forces troops have
been conducting extensive training exercises with Colombian
soldiers fighting drug traffickers and guerrillas, a U.S.
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The training was conducted under a program that avoids
restrictions imposed on military aid to Colombia by the Clinton
administration, The Washington Post said.
</P>
<P>
While not forbidden, the training involving hundreds of
American troops each year has allowed the U.S. military to play a
more direct and autonomous role in Colombia than officials
publicly have indicated, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The story in Monday's editions said the training was authorized
under a 1991 law, known as JCET (Joint Combined Exchange Training)
that permits U.S. Special Forces to train on foreign soil if the
training is designed primarily to benefit the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
"We consider JCET an important program because it allows us to
train in different areas of the world and to learn how other
militaries operate," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It also allows us to learn important skills. We did this under
the terms of the law. It was totally legal and reported to
Congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been sensitive enough that few in Congress are
aware of it and the exercises have been suspended this month as
Colombia holds presidential elections, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The same program was invoked for U.S. troops to conduct 41
training exercises with Indonesia over the past seven years even
though many members of Congress believed they had curtailed
military ties with that country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesia program was suspended two weeks ago because of
turmoil in the country.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Tehran Mayor
Gholamhossein Karbaschi will start on June 7, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Justice Department announced that the open trial
will be carried out by the special judicial complex in charge of
cases related to government employees.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a close ally of President Mohammad Khatami, was held
in detention for 11 days last month by the conservative judiciary
on charges of embezzlement. This sparked fierce quarrels between
the moderates and the conservatives in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The moderates accused the conservatives of undermining the
government while the conservatives lashed out at their rivals for
abusing the freedom advocated by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
To bring the quarrels under control, Iranian Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei intervened and the Tehran mayor was
released.

<HEADLINE> China Donates Equipment to Kenya News Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency, the state news
agency of China, Tuesday donated various equipment to Kenya News
Agency (KNA) in a bid to help KNA's computerization program and
promote their mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The move, as part of long-term Chinese assistance to Kenya,
will be very helpful for the modern development of the east
African state's media industry, Kenyan Minister of Information
and Broadcasting Joseph Nyagah said at the donation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Kenya "highly appreciated your (Xinhua) donation and the
technical assistance which will go a long way to enable the KNA
to compete favorably with other media houses in information
dissemination," he told Guo Chaoren, President of Xinhua News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The donation, including four computers, three printers, two
fax machines and photographic equipment, is worth more than one
million Kenyan Shillings (some 17,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
In response, Guo said that Xinhua attaches great importance to
developing its relations with local media in the Third World
countries.
</P>
<P>
Although the political and economic strength of the South is
rising in today's world moving toward multi-polarization, its
voice is quite weak in the field of international coverage which
is relatively dominated by the West, Guo noted.
</P>
<P>
He called for further cooperation and joint efforts by all
Third World medias including Xinhua and KNA to enhance their
competitiveness and thus break the "monopoly" of the West in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi during his
talks with Guo criticized some western media which have been
bossing around and interfering with the internal affairs of
African countries including Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president also showed his appreciation over
Xinhua's donation, saying that he is happy with the constructive
cooperation between Xinhua and the Kenyan media and hoped such
cooperation would be further enhanced. Guo arrived here Monday
for a three-day visit to the east African Country.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Renews Call for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat reiterated his call here Tuesday for an
urgent Arab summit to discuss the stalled Middle East peace
process, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"(An) Arab summit has become a must in order to protect rights
and interests of the Arab nation," Arafat told a gathering
organized by the Arab League to mark the 50th anniversary of
Palestinians' loss of homeland with the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here Monday night after a visit to Saudi Arabia,
where he conferred with Saudi King Fahd on the deadlocked peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat praised the efforts exerted by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Secretary General of the Arab League Ahmed Esmat
Abdel-Meguid to convene such an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
"It will help realize inter-Arab reconciliation, achieve Arab
solidarity and boost common action in order to confront all
dangers threatening the Arab nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a summit will afford a chance to Arab leaders
to exchange views in a bid to reach a unified stance on any
possible collapse of the ailing peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has forgone original position of disagreeing to an Arab
summit, saying "the possibility is standing." But it maintained
that a summit depends on the outcome of Arab consultations and
contacts between the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
left here in the day for Amman with a message from Mubarak to
Jordan's King Hussein on Arab coordination and the possibility of
holding an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
"Such a contingency is being considered by everyone as a way to
achieve high-level coordination and consultation among Arab states
in the light of the present tense climate that is full of bad
expectations," Moussa told reporters upon his arrival in the
Jordanian capital, according to MENA.

<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), Tuesday met with Rene Monory, president of
the Senate (upper house of parliament) of France.
</P>
<P>
Li invited Monory and other French parliament deputies to visit
China to increase mutual understanding and push forward the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that both China and France have a tradition of
safeguarding national independence and share common or close views
on many important international issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries were complementary in economic
cooperation and had great potential in economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was beneficial not only to the interests of the
people of the two countries, but also to world peace and stability
as well as the development of China and France to build a
comprehensive partnership oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the multiparty cooperation and political
consultative system under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party was the fundamental political system of China, and the CPPCC
was the organizational form to realize this system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CPPCC, which was formed by the Communist
Party, eight other political parties and major social groups, and
representatives of all ethnic and social groups, was widely
representative and played an important role in China's political
life.
</P>
<P>
As relations between the CPPCC and the French parliament were
an important component of bilateral links, Li believed his visit
would push forward friendly cooperation between the two countries
and between the two institutions.
</P>
<P>
Monory said that he personally had a good feeling toward China
which he accumulated during his past visits.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for the achievements made by China in
its reforms and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Monory said that as the French Senate and the CPPCC had
established good cooperative relations, relations between France
and China would attain new heights.
</P>
<P>
Li on Tuesday also met with Villiam Chervy, chairman of the
Senate France-China Friendship Group, and other members of the
group.
</P>
<P>
Chervy said that the objective of the group was to stimulate
the development of friendly relations between the peoples of
France and China, and to consolidate existing friendly relations
between the CPPCC and the French Senate.
</P>
<P>
Chervy said that his group is willing to make an effort in seeking
new ways of cooperating with China.

<HEADLINE> Over 10 Million People Cured of Leprosy, WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 10 million people around
the world have been cured of leprosy by the combination of drugs
known as multidrug therapy (MDT), said the World Health
Organization (WHO) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
WHO stated that universal coverage of all known cases of the
disease with MDT drugs had already been achieved by the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
It said that almost all of the registered patients were
receiving these drugs free of charge and over 90 percent of them
through WHO.
</P>
<P>
MDT, usually a combination of three drugs, rifampicin, dapsone
and clofazimine, continues to be highly effective in curing
leprosy completely with very low relapse rates of around 0.3 per
1,000 cases per year.
</P>
<P>
Possibly more important, WHO noted, is the fact that no
resistance to all three drugs together has been detected anywhere
in the world in the bacillus that causes the disease,
Mycobacterium leprae.
</P>
<P>
However, Director of WHO's Action Program for the Elimination
of Leprosy Dr S. K. Noordeen warned that many challenges remain to
be tackled if WHO and its partners are to achieve the goal of
eliminating this disease as a public healthy problem.
</P>
<P>
The goal of eliminating leprosy is to reduce the prevalence to
less than one case per 10,000 population worldwide. The present
global prevalence rate stands at 1.39 cases per 10,000 population.
</P>
<P>
Noordeen estimated that some 1.5 million cases still remain to
be detected and treated, the great majority of them in the 32
countries with prevalence rates above that figure, down from 122
in 1985.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Drop in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. existing home sales
fell in April, slipping 2.5 percent from a record level in March,
the National Association of Realtors reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide homes resales were at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 4.77 million units, down from a rate of 4.89
million in March, the most since the association began tracking
sales in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the decline, April tied February for the
second-highest sales rate in three decades.
</P>
<P>
Driving sales in April were low mortgage rates, averaging 7.14
percent in April, a full percentage point lower than a year ago,
and the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
The low unemployment give consumers the confidence and income
they need to invest in a house and low mortgage rates make monthly
payments more affordable.
</P>
<P>
By region, sales fell 4.2 percent in the South to an annual
rate of 1.81 million units; 4.1 percent in the Northeast to a rate
of 710,000, and 2.4 percent in the Midwest to a rate of 1.21
million. Sales rose 1 percent in the West to a rate of 1.03
million.
</P>
<P>

dollars, up 6.2 percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Norway to Cooperate in Regional Nuclear Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Norway agreed Tuesday to
enhance their cooperation in dismantling Russia's old nuclear
submarines in a bid to prevent pollution in the Barents Sea region.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed here by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and visiting Norwegian King Harald V.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Norway will earmark more than 30 million
U.S. dollars over three to four years for projects including
disposal of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste from those
submarines.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, Russia
has lacked funds for scrapping the rusting nuclear submarines of
the Soviet Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
During talks at the Kremlin, Yeltsin told the Norwegian king
that Russia was ready to dismantle its submarines in the Arctic
north if Norway provided credits for the work.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need any old submarines, especially nuclear,"
Yeltsin said. "We can remove them from the entire Barents region
and declare it a safety zone."
</P>
<P>
Russia's north is saturated with nuclear matter which concerned
Norway, he said, adding that Russia would immediately start
dismantling the submarines if Norway provided funds.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian president also said that certain technical
preparations were needed before starting the operation.
</P>
<P>
King Harald, who arrived in Moscow on Monday, said there were
no differences between the two sides over the agreement.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Russia and Norway also signed agreements on
scientific cooperation and crime-prevention.

<HEADLINE> China Dealing With Copyright Violations (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past, China handled copyright violations in accordance
with the civil law, but the new law makes it a criminal offense,
Qi explained, and said that it shows that China places great
importance on protecting intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
China adopted its first Copyright Law in 1991 and the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress reached a decision on
copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
Piracy infringes on the rights of copyright holders and
disrupts the market, says Chen Xingliang, a law professor at
People's University.
</P>
<P>
When China joined the international treaty on intellectual
property protection, it had to fight piracy, Chen says.
</P>
<P>
China is planning to make people more aware of the need to
protect intellectual property rights, Qi says, and has tried to do
more in recent years. It raided more than 60 illegal VCD
production lines and 5 more recently in the southern coastal
province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin told a summit meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in November that China will do
more to improve its laws and regulations protecting domestic and
worldwide intellectual property rights.

<HEADLINE> Update: Israeli Police Beat Palestinian Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Several Palestinian legislators
were beaten by Israeli police with clubs and rifle butts Tuesday
as they protested Jewish settlement expansion in the Muslim
quarter of the Old City of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
About 20 Palestinian legislators rushed from the West Bank city
of Ramallah in the morning to protest against the temporary
shelters erected by Jewish settlers overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Abu Ala, who led
the protest, told the gathering at the site that "we hope the
Israeli government and the co-sponsors of the peace process should
know our people's patience will not remain for ever."
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinians "will not accept a peace that means the
taking over of our lands and rights."
</P>
<P>
"If the issue is so," he warned, "let all the agreements go to
hell."
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians will not let the Jewish settlers to
continue in this aggressive way (building tin shacks in the Old
City), and this settlement shelter will not exist and the
Palestinians will remove it whatever the cost will be.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlers built the tin shacks during the night in
the densely-populated Muslim quarter of East Jerusalem, captured
by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, and several
families planned to move in later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police and security forces there cut in to prevent the
Palestinian lawmakers and their followers from tearing down the
shelters.
</P>
<P>
The police beat Palestinians with clubs and rifle butts,
injuring Abu Ala, two other legislators and several other
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The clash worsened the situation in East Jerusalem as
confrontation atmosphere was still prevailing in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials pointed out the beating of Palestinian
legislators was a new crime against the Palestinian people, which
can not be tolerated.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- An article in the June issue of the
voice of the Association For Relations Across the Taiwan Strait,
"Relations Across the Taiwan Straits" magazine, says that that
regulations on civil judgments issued by the Supreme People's
Court today are an important step by the mainland to protect the
rights and interests of Chinese across the strait.
</P>
<P>
The author, Wang Meiqiong, urges the Taiwanese to consider the
various issues that could be resolved during routine talks from
broader perspective.
</P>
<P>
These regulations have solved the problem of judgments in the
mainland and local courts in Taiwan, concerning civil rights or
the legal relations of the people in Taiwan and on the mainland,
Wang says.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is separated from the mainland because of problems in
the past and has a legal system that is different from the
mainland's, and that this has been a major legal problem, he says,
pointing out that the regulations were formulated under the "One
China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Before the country is united, routine talks are not enough to
handle the many issues of Taiwan and the mainland, Wang says, and
a larger space is needed to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the mainland's laws have protected investors from
Taiwan and the two sides have extradited hijackers in a
cooperative way, Wang says, calling for negotiations and a formal
end to hostilities, under the "One China" principle.

BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A man who pirated copies of some
best-selling Chinese dictionaries has been sentenced to six years
in prison and fined 300,000 yuan (36,000 U.S. dollars) by the
People's Court of Beijing's Haidian District.
</P>
<P>
Yin Pinghua was found guilty of pirating more than 200,000
copies of the Xinhua Dictionary, the Modern Chinese Dictionary,
and the Classical Chinese Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old Yin, who is from east China's Jiangsu
Province, was given the harshest sentence for a copyright
violation in China, according to Qi Zhiguo, a public procurator
with the People's Procuratorate of the Haidian District.
</P>
<P>
The case is one of the largest to be handled by Beijing's
judiciary since the revised Criminal Law took effect on October 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The new law added an intellectual property clause and a maximum
penalty of seven years in prison and fines.
</P>
<P>
Yin earned at least 250,000 yuan from 2.3 million yuan worth of
illegal sales and caused the Commercial Press to lose nearly
600,000 yuan and damaged the company's reputation, according to Xu
Liang, an official in charge of copyright affairs for the

dictionaries. It sells 200,000 copies of the Xinhua Dictionary
annually.

<P>
MADRID, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Assembly (NAA),
the parliamentary body of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), on Tuesday condemned India's recent series of nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear tests were aggravating instability in south and
central Asia, a backward move against international efforts to
stop the nuclear arms race, NAA Chairman William Roth said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued in Barcelona, Spain, where the NAA
concluded a four-day spring session on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
India conducted a series of nuclear tests, its first in 24
years, on May 11 and 13, which shocked the world and sparked
condemnation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The NAA statement also denounced violent acts by Serbian armed
forces against ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's southern province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, since February in
the wake of clashes between Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
who are seeking independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The NAA statement noted that India's nuclear capability and
Kosovo issue posed a security challenge to NATO in the post-Cold
War period.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, in a meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen here
this afternoon, said that his country welcomes China to play a
bigger role in Middle Eastern affairs and that the Israeli
government will adhere to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China is concerned about the stalemate in he
Mideast peace process and believes that the Israeli and
Palestinian people should have countries of their own.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Israel and the other nations of the Middle East
are concerned about their security is understandable, Qian said,
but the conflicts between the Arab nations and Israel have shown
that peace is a prerequisite of security and without peace there
will be no security.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process made some progress several years
ago through joint efforts and China hopes that the parties
concerned will value that outcome and move forward, Qian said,
pointing to the United Nations resolution, the land-for-peace
principle, and the agreements already reached as the crucial means
for breaking the deadlock in the Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
China has noticed that Israel and Palestine are discussing the
proposal put forward by the U.S. and that the Palestinians have
agreed to accept the proposal, Qian said, and China supports the
Middle East peace process and the various efforts which serve to
develop it.
</P>
<P>
The two parties need to have long-term goals and a flexible
manner to break the deadlock, move the peace process forward, and
have a comprehensive and long-term peace in the Middle East, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
He told Netanyahu that China will continue to work with the
international community and contribute to the development of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Israel has been the victim of aggression
and oppression and it understands the value of peace and that it
will strive for peace with Palestine and will find solutions to
the current problems to get the peace process out of the
deadlock.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Sets Guidelines For Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
China's central bank, has established areas that should be given
priority for bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises,
medium-sized and small enterprises, infrastructure, residential
housing, science and technology, market development, and foreign
trade are all priority areas for loans, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the central government encouraged
development in these areas, which are expected to contribute to
the national economy this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that all commercial banks need to improve
financial service and provide market information, enterprise
listing, personnel training, international cooperation, and other
help.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks also need to improve capital management and
efficiency, PBOC says. They should be responsible for recovering
loans in accordance with laws and regulations, and that loans to
unqualified borrowers should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
PBOC asked all financial institutions to comply with this as
well.
</P>
<P>
A PBOC spokesman said that the central bank wants to improve
financial service, adjust credit, correct the relationship between
financial service and credit supervision, and avoid financial
risks to increase loans for the macro-economic growth target.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Requests WB to Defer Implementing Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government decided on
Tuesday to ask the World Bank (WB) to defer for one year
implementing an agreement on identifying bank loan defaulters.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge your problems and we will request the World
Bank to defer implementation of the agreement for a year," Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria told the country's business leaders
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed recently between the World
Bank and Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, under the
financial sector reform project, a businessman will be identified
as a defaulter in line with the international standard if he fails
to refund his loans within three months of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is due to be implemented in October this year.
Bangladeshi banks have at present default loans totaling about 140
billion taka (about 3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kibria's comments came after an appeal from the business
leaders to take up the matter with the World Bank in view of the
existing infrastructure problems of the business and industrial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
They said the entrepreneurs and businessmen often cannot follow
the schedules despite their sincerity, because of hindrances in
their business and production due to disruptions in power and gas
supplies and political reasons like road blockade and strikes.
</P>
<P>
The government, while taking up the matter considering the
problems of the entrepreneurs, is determined to realize all
outstanding loans, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing system, a debtor of commercial loans gets
seven months, including a one-month grace period, to avoid the
defaulters list after the expiry of the original deadline of
repayment.
</P>
<P>
And long-term or industrial loans get a nine-month period,
including a three-month grace period, to escape the list.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said that debtors would be informed one month ahead if
being listed as bank loan defaulters. "We have taken the decision
so that they can escape the defaulters list by repaying their
credits," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best to support the private sector but the
businessmen also must ensure their honesty," Commerce and
Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed also stressed at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Keep Kids Fit With Setting-Up Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China is actively promoting a special kind of
setting-up exercises among the urban children, in a bid to control the
surging incidence of child obesity mainly resulting from surplus of nutrition
and lack of physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in today's Chinese cities, many children under the
age of six years are fatter than normal. In the Capital Beijing, the
proportion of children with the problem of obesity rose remarkably to nearly
20 percent in 1997 from 7.05 percent in 1983.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest city, the number of overweight children
increased by more than five times over the past decade, with three out of
every 100 local kids younger than six years suffering obesity.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that since an overwhelming majority of the kids living in
the Chinese cities now are the only child of a family, they are usually
indulged by their parents and grandparents during their growth. Meanwhile,
many parents stress their children's intellectual development but fail to
provide them with adequate outdoor physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
The setting-up exercises, which are said to be the outcome of two years of
hard work by relevant experts and professors, were developed by the China

<P>
With six different categories and 15 series, the exercises are reportedly
conformed to the psychological and physical characteristics of children aged
between three and six years, and are interesting and easy to learn.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Beijing Municipal Children's Palace,
which is the site for local kids' spare-time activities, there are more than
100,000 children in several hundred kindergartens across the country that have
learned this kind of exercises.
</P>
<P>
At this weekend, he said, some 2,300 children from all over the country
will gather at the Tiananmen Square in downtown Beijing and make a group
display of the exercises, to mark the forthcoming June 1 Children's Day and
add more impetus to the promotion of the exercises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Israeli Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in an
hour-long meeting today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, voiced the hope that Israel's leaders will be
farsighted and work with the international community to break the
deadlock in the Mideast peace talks in a positive and practical
manner.
</P>
<P>
He said that peace and stability in the Middle East are the
common aspiration of people around the world and that it serves
the fundamental interests of people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he appreciates the efforts made by different Israeli
governments to promote Sino-Israeli ties and that Netanyahu's
China trip will help enhance mutual understanding and relations
between China and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Jiang that he is very pleased to visit China and
discuss issues of common concern with the Chinese leaders and that
his visit will advance Israel-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Sino-Israeli cooperative relations have had
some favorable results since the two countries opened diplomatic
ties six years ago. China's foreign policy is one of fostering
friendly and cooperative ties with other nations on the basis of
the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence and should not be
affected by different social systems and ideologies, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the growth of Sino-Israeli friendly and
cooperative ties based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual
benefit is in the fundamental interest of the two peoples and
serves regional and world peace and development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Israel will try to get along with its Arab
neighbors peacefully, and although might be an arduous process,
Israel is convinced that this goal can be reached.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Middle East is a flash-point of the world
and that all parties involved are concerned about the deadlock of
the Middle East peace process. Peace and development have become
the main stream of the times in the current world and China hopes
that the parties concerned in the Middle East region would cherish
the historic opportunity emerged in the region, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that where there is a will there is a way and that
China hopes that the parties in the Middle East will make a great
effort to remove the current man-made obstacles and push the peace
process forward to bring peace in the region as early as possible
and allow the Jewish and Arab people to live with each other
peacefully forever.

<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen Chinese nature reserves
have joined the World Biosphere Network, since China got involved
in the Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB) 20 years ago, the
Chinese National MAB Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
China has reserves in the Changbai Mountains in Jilin, Dinghu
Mountain in Guangdong, Wolong Area in Sichuan, Wuyi Mountain in
Fujian, Xilin Gol Grassland in Inner Mongolia, Bogeda in Xinjiang,
Shennongjia in Hubei, Yancheng in Jiangsu, Xishuangbanna in
Yunnan, Maolan in Guizhou, Tianmu Mountain in Zhejiang, Fenglin in

</P>
<P>
The MAB program was begun by UNESCO in 1971 to help
international cooperation for improving relations of people and
the environment. It has a network of 352 biosphere reserves in 87

International Agenda for the 21st Century, conventions on
Biological Diversity, Desertification Control, and Climate
Changes, said Xu.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand Agree to Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Countries in the
Indonesia-Malaysia- Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) agreed
Tuesday to extend the use of local currencies for trade in the
regional tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
The countries in the IMT-GT agreed at the Fifth IMT-GT Working
Group Meeting on Tourism to quote tourism packages in their
respective currencies in a move to make the area more competitive
in attracting tourists, Shahril Saat, head of the Malaysian
delegation to the meeting, was quoted as saying Tuesday after the
opening of the two-day meeting in east coastal state of
Terengganu.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Thailand had agreed to implement the move
immediately while Indonesia had given an assurance to do so once
its currency stabilized, the Malaysian official was quoted by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism should act as a catalyst for the economic growth of
the three countries during the current currency depreciation faced
by them," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Leaders in the region have called for the use of local
currencies in all dealings instead of a third country's currency
following the currency depreciation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shahril, who is under-secretary of the Tourism Division of the
Culture, Arts and Tourism Ministry, said that the currency
depreciation should be regarded as a newly found competitive edge
as goods and services in the region were now relatively cheap
compared with other regions.
</P>
<P>
A meeting would be held soon between Malaysia, Indonesia and
Thailand Tourist Association Bhd (MITTAS) and airline operators,
hoteliers and tour operators of the three countries to seek their
cooperation in providing an attractive package, Bernama quoted
MITTAS Chairman Syed Mohamed Aidid as saying on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The IMT-GT tour package to be introduced soon for visits to the
three countries would include airfare, accommodation and ground
transportation, the MITTAS chairman said, adding that each country
had contributed 70,000 U.S. dollars to MITTAS for promotion and
marketing of the regional tourism.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Import 2 Million More Tons of Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to import another 2 million tons of rice to increase
stocks, according to Minister of Food and Horticulture A. M.
Saefuddin.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the decision after formally taking over ministerial
duties from his predecessor here on Monday, Saefuddin said the
protracted drought, the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon
and other factors have reduced rice production in the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that finding the solution for the food crisis in
society would become the focus of his ministry's attention. To
overcome the problems, he would improve the food distribution
system which had been damaged due to communication problems
resulting from recent fuel price hikes.
</P>
<P>
There would be a food crisis center to monitor the crisis,
Saefuddin was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesia had imported about 1 million tons of rice
from China, Vietnam and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Grave Concern over Japanese Official Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China expressed "grave concern" on
the remarks made by a Japanese official that virtually put China's
Taiwan into the Japan-U.S. defense framework, according to Zhu
Bangzao, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the director-general of the North American
Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, when answering
the inquiry by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of the
Representatives, indicated that the scope of the surrounding
situation in the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guideline is
limited to the "Far East" and "Far Eastern surrounding areas" as
defined in the Japanese-U.S. security pact. This in fact has
included Taiwan of China into the pact.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the situation, Zhu said," We express
our grave concern over the remarks made by the official and our
strong indignation at the move made by the Japanese side that
wantonly interferes in China's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the Chinese government has made solemn
representations with the Japanese side and asked the Japanese
government to "make an explicit clarification and explanation."
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the position of the Chinese side on the question
of Japan-U.S. security cooperation is "clear and consistent." "We
have asked, in a solemn and serious manner on several occassions,
that the Japanese side will act with caution when handling
Japan-U.S. security cooperation and refrain from interfering in
China's internal affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note that the Japanese government and leaders
have assured the Chinese side on many occassions that the scope of
the Japan-U.S. security cooperation had not expanded," Zhu said,
adding that the Japanese side affirmed such cooperation is not
targeted against any third country and that the so-called
surrounding areas is not a geographical concept.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Japan has reiterated time and again that it is
willing to approach the Taiwan question in continued observance of
the principles as set forth in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement
and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
"However, the remarks made by the official from the Japanese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs this time is not only in contradiction
with the commitments and the explanations the Japanese government
has made to the Chinese side, but also in obvious violation of the
principles of the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to reiterate once again that China is firm and
unshakable in its position of the question of Taiwan and that any
move aimed at interfering in China's internal affairs will be
resolutely opposed by the Chinese side and is absolutely
unacceptable to the Chinese government and people," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Joint Venture Expands Expo Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Miller Freeman, the world's
leading exhibition organizer, and Shanghai SinoExpo International
announced here Tuesday the formation of a joint-venture firm to
organize high-quality exhibitions in China.
</P>
<P>
The new company, MF SinoExpo, "combines Shanghai SinoExpo
International's local network and expertise with Miller Freeman's
global strength and experience," Gary Marshall, president and
Chief Executive Officer of Miller Freeman Asia, told a press
conference held here.
</P>
<P>
It will organize large-scale international events in the
rapidly growing Chinese mainland market, covering computers,
furniture, industrial machinery, construction and communications,
said Marshall, who is also an MF SinoExpo director.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture between the Shanghai company that has
organized over 60 international trade shows in the Chinese
mainland since 1992, and Miller Freeman is "a merger of mutual
advantage," said Wang Mingliang, general manager of Shanghai
SinoExpo International and managing director of MF SinoExpo.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the joint venture company would make its expos
the best trade shows in China and would narrow the existing gap
between exhibitions on the Chinese mainland and those in Europe or
Hong Kong, in terms of scale, quality and service.
</P>
<P>
China's international exhibition industry is a product of
China's open policy, Wang said. It was first started in
Guangzhou and Shanghai in the early 1980's and now the number of
international exhibitions has reached several hundred a year.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Retail Sales Fall in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The sluggish retail market in
Hong Kong continued to record a double-digit decline in March as
fewer tourists came and locals spent less.
</P>
<P>
The value of retail sales in March 1998, estimated at 16.4
billion HK dollars (2.1 billion U.S. dollars), dropped by 12
percent from the previous year, the government released the latest
figures here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After discounting inflation, total retail sales decreased by 13
percent in volume during the month. A government spokesman blamed
the protracted weakness in inbound tourism and subdued local
consumer demand for the slack sales.
</P>
<P>
Department stores were hit hardest in March, with sales
plunging 30 percent in value and 32 percent in volume compared
with the same month last year. Supermarkets recorded a 7-percent
rise in sales value, but saw almost no change in volume.
</P>
<P>
Sales of clothing and footwear, jewelry, watches and clocks,
and valuable gifts all fell significantly. However, sales of motor
vehicles picked up in March, rising 2 percent in value and 6
percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
Total retail sales in the first quarter this year fell by 13
percent in value or 14 percent in volume compared with the same
period of 1997.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records 0.7 Percent Growth in the First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's economic
growth limped along at 0.7 percent in the first quarter of this
year, falling well short of the levels needed to reach the
government target of 2.5 percent for the year, local newspapers
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This quarter-on-quarter annualized gross domestic product
(GDP) growth was up from the 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of
last year, mainly due to a substantial increase in the
agricultural sector, the Central Statistical Service (CSS) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the agricultural sector accelerated from -0.2
percent in the fourth quarter last year to 6.2 percent in the
first quarter, the service said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest disappointment was the mining sector, in which
gold production dropped strongly. Growth in the sector fell from
1.4 percent in the fourth quarter to -4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Year on year, real growth fell from 1.6 percent in the
previous quarter to 1 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The lackluster performance prompted economists to call for
interest rate cuts. They warned that 2 percent growth in the
calendar year might already be out of reach.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that exceptional growth would be needed in the
second half of the year to push growth for the year to 2 percent.
But some believed that growth would more likely pick up later,
from the middle of the year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Lower as Japanese Yen Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar continued
its downward trek Tuesday as the Japanese yen fell to seven-year
lows against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 62.43 U.S. cents, from 62.70 at
Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
"It has struggled all day once again," said Colonial State Bank
foreign exchange manager Peter Whitley.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar climbed to a seven-year high against the yen,
reaching 137.63 yen.
</P>
<P>
"The weakness in the yen is continuing to give direction, but
that is on a relentless grind as well," Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
The local market and local banks remained sidelined, while the
speculative end of the market continued to look for reasons to
sell the Australian dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Most local participants are sitting on the fence," Whitley
said.
"It can't rally, and people don't see it as being a sell
proposition at these sorts of levels, not after the Reserve Bank
intervened last week."
</P>
<P>
Aggressive selling by U.S. fund managers last week saw the
Australian dollar plunge to a 12-year low of 61.73 U.S. cents. The
Reserve Bank of Australia intervened in the local market on May
19, buying an estimated 300 million dollars of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed at 85.75 from
85.85 against the Japanese yen, and at 1.1026 from 1.1046 against
the German mark.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese salvage workers say they
believe that a metal object at the bottom of Dianchi Lake in
Yunnan Province is part of an aircraft and may be wreckage from an
American fighter plane from the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
According to Yan Jiangzhen, head of the salvage operation,
sonar detected two metal objects in the mud five meters down, one
about three meters long and the other about two meter long. Yan
and his 20-member team began retriving the plane wreckage earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Han Wenbin, curator of the Chinese Space Museum, and other
aircraft specialists said that the metal objects are probably from
an aircraft wreckage, perhaps the fuselage and wings.
</P>
<P>
Yan has been looking for a plane from the "Flying Tigers", the
famous U.S. fighter pilots who were sent to help China fight the
Japanese army during World War II. The Americans were based in
Kunming, Yunnan's capital, and were said to have downed at least
300 Japanese planes. In May 1942, one of the aircraft went down in
Dianchi Lake during a routine training flight.
</P>
<P>
Yan Jiangzhen, chairman of the Chinese Explorers Association,
said it is still too early to claim that they have found the
American fighter plane, because some of the objects are covered by
mud about half a meter deep, but that divers will soon have a
closer look.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Launches Urgent Appeal for Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued an urgent appeal for funds,
warning that the organization may not be able to continue caring
for the world's refugees if contributions remain scarce and
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
Contributions to UNHCR's programs so far this year comprise
only about half of its budget of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars,
according to a UNHCR press release issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The warning coincided with the publication of a compilation of
UNHCR's 1998 programs.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled "1998 Global Appeal," details UNHCR's
activities worldwide and is intended to replace the traditional
practice of issuing separate appeals for the funding of individual
programs, except in the case of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
"UNHCR depends almost entirely on voluntary contributions to
finance its activities, but the resources available to us have
become increasingly scarce and unpredictable," High Commissioner
Sadako Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
"I am very worried about the effect on refugees if we are
forced to continue to cut back our programs," Ogata
added. "Predictable funding is essential for our work."

<HEADLINE> HK Business Leader on HK's Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- In the new electronic business
world, small companies can retain the advantages of an innovative,
entrepreneurial and multi-national culture far more easily than
larger companies, a Hong Kong business leader said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech to the Export Supply Chain
Management Conference, which was held Tuesday at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center, Victor Fung, chairman of the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council said that he believed that in
the future it will be a case of "small is beautiful."
</P>
<P>
"And we are lucky because our economy is still based on
hundreds of thousands of small flexible businesses -- not a few
massive conglomerates -- which are well placed to adapt to
whatever demands the business environment of the future throws
up," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
"It was because of these companies, and their adaptability
that we were able to establish our competitive advantages," Fung
said, adding "it is through them that our economy will retain its
competitive strength."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy has not been as badly affected by the
recent Asian financial turmoil as other economies in the region,
Fung said.
</P>
<P>
"Our Gross Domestic Product is still growing, inflation is
falling, and our currency reserves have actually risen," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the strengths that shield Hong Kong is the currency. The
HK dollar is backed by a currency board system, which, thanks to
the resolute approach of the financial officials, has resisted all
attempts to destabilize it, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors involved in shaping Hong Kong's favorable
business environment include its world-class regulatory framework,
its traditions of transparency, rule of law, openness, and free
flows of trade, information, capital and people, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
Together these elements come together to produce
predictability, reduce risk, and encourage confidence, Fung
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's source of competitive advantages comes from its
relationship with China's mainland, the strength of services in
its own economy and its dispersed manufacturing network, Fung
said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was the first Export Supply Chain Management
Conference of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the conference, which was jointly organized by
the Hong Kong Article Numbering Association and the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council, was to promote awareness of the
benefits of supply chain management.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A retail shop in Zanzibar
has been burnt down following an electric fault and delay of
arrival by fire brigade due to lack of telephone, a Dar es
Salaam-based newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Daily Mail said that the fire resulted from an electricity
wire outside the building at around 6:30 on Monday morning. As
the fire brigade delayed to come to the rescue, the flame slowly
entered the shop at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
The Urban West Regional Police Commander Mussa Msheba
confirmed the incident, saying that police are still evaluating
the loss of the items burnt in the shops, including shoes,
clothes and electric equipment. Msheba said that people failed
to rescue any items as the shop was not open at that time.
</P>
<P>
However, the urban west residents have urged the government to
improve fire extinguishing services by installing modern
communication system.
</P>
<P>
They said that when a fire incident happens, they are forced
to ride bicycles to inform the fire brigade.
</P>
<P>
In January, a fish processing and exporting company in Dar es
Salaam also blamed the inefficiency of the city's fire brigade,
which failed to put out a fire that destroyed property worth
80,000 U.S. Dollars, due to lack of equipment, water and foam.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Promises Breakthrough in Macao Civil Service Localization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A Portuguese official of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) said here on Tuesday
that there will be "breakthrough" in the localization of senior
civil servants in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Moitinho de Almeida, chief of the Portuguese side in charge of
the working group of the three leading issues (the localization of
civil service, the localization of law and the use of Chinese as
an official language), made these remarks after a three-hour
meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
Almeida briefed the Chinese side on the progress the Macao
Government has made regarding the three issues at the meeting,
and said that the Portuguese side is looking for proper persons to
fill the positions of directors of government departments.
</P>
<P>
"Although the question is bit complicated, we are looking
forward to fulfilling our promise to have all directors of
government departments basically localized by the end of 1998,"
he said, adding "We are now looking for the suitable persons to
fill those positions."
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese side made that promise late last year. There was
only one local Chinese director of among 56 government departments
by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side expressed appreciation for the efforts of
the Portuguese side in the localization and in its promise to
actively cooperate with the Preparatory Committee of the Macao
Special Administrative Region, which was established earlier this
month in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Portuguese side would put its key efforts on the
localization of directors of government in the coming months so
that an evident progress will be made in the latter half of the
year," said Wang Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wang reminded his Portuguese counterpart that the
proportion of Chinese-speaking residents should be expanded among
the directors of departments in the localization process so that
certain stipulation of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration will
be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Leading positions of the Macao SAR must be held by Chinese
nationals among Macao residents, according to the stipulation.

BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a national optic
cable network will be completed next month.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korean Government to Be Tough on Labor Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government will take
tough measures against a nationwide strike to be organized by the
Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If the KCTU pushes ahead with the strike, we will mobilize
full police force to break them up," said Jin Hyong-koo, a senior
prosecutor at the Prosecutor-General's Office.
</P>
<P>
Describing the strike scheduled to start at 1 p.m. Wednesday as
"illegal," Jin warned that "stern punishments will also be imposed
on the masterminds and the leaders."
</P>
<P>
The government is very concerned that such a strike might spark
social unrest and blow a fatal blow to the international
credibility of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
It has repeatedly stressed that labor strikes will damage its
efforts to attract foreign capital needed to help the nation out
of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the 620,000-member KCTU said on Tuesday it would stage a
nationwide strike unless the government and companies agreed not
to lay off workers en masse.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kap-yong, head of the KCTU, said if the government cracks
down on Wednesday's strike, his group will not join the second
labor-management-government commission desperately wanted by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The first labor-management-government commission reached an
agreement in sharing of the burden of the financial crisis last
February, after which layoffs were legalized.
</P>
<P>
The KCTU has criticized the government and companies for
forcing only workers to make sacrifices, arguing that the massive
firing of workers is in violation of the February accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the labor union at Hyundai Motors Co., the nation's
largest auto maker and flagship of the giant Hyundai Group,
decided to join the KCTU-led strike in a vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the 49,000 unionists voted and 89.4 percent
were in favor of the strike.

ROTENBURG, Germany, May 26 (Xinhua) -- "Just a little too cold"
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Brazil was the first team to arrive in
Munster, the venue of preliminary group D. The players have been
staying in the dome-city since Friday. Obviously, the
South-Americans feel at home. On the schedule for the weekend
was, among other activities, a walk through the city. On this
occasion, everyone in the team was longing for Brazilian
weather-conditions. 24-year-old guard Leila de Souza Sobral
complained: "At home we're in midst of Summer right now with
extremely hot temperatures. Compared to that, it's really, really
cold here."
</P>
<P>
The chilly weather, however, should be no obstacle for the
high-flying plans of the Brazilians. "We will win our games
here. The stadium and the wooden floor are in a magnificent
condition," explained De Souza Sobral, a competitive height
herself at 1.86 meters.
</P>
<P>
"Heads down for warm-up"
</P>
<P>
South Koreans were half an hour early for morning practice on
Monday, so they had to kill thirty minutes waiting at "berg Fidel
Stadium". But no problem for the coach Jae Woong Kim. He turned
the narrow floors of the stadium's locker-room section into a
warm-up track.
</P>
<P>
With everyone in the same rhythm, the Korean Players used their
waiting-period for a warm-up joging. The tall center-players had
to be careful and watch their heads to avoid hitting the low
roof. Although they are only the underdogs in the opening game of
the 13th women's world championship Tuesday night against reigning
champions Brazil, the Koreans plan to keep their heads up high
again.
</P>
<P>
"Hungary's youngsters"
</P>
<P>
With an average age of 25.4 years, Hungary is one of the
youngest teams at the current tournament in Germany. After the
1997 European championship, coach Lazio Ratgeber turned his squad
line-up upside down and invited several young players to join the
team. Consequently, the failure to qualify for the 1999 European
championship in Poland didn't come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
26-year-old center Dora Kalmar-Nagy is Hungary's most
experienced player with 94 previous appearnces on the National
team. To qualify for the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Hungary would
have to come in at least 6th at this championship.

<HEADLINE> WHO Singles out TB as Biggest Killer of Young Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (TB) is now the single
biggest infectious killer of women in the world, said the World
Health Organization (WHO) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 900 million women and girls around the world are infected
with TB, 2.5 million will get sick and one million will die this
year, said the United Nations specialized agency.
</P>
<P>
At an international research meeting on TB and gender in
Gothenburg, Sweden, WHO presented data showing that the disease is
the single leading cause of deaths among women of reproductive age.
</P>
<P>
Of all causes of death among women aged between 15-44
worldwide, TB accounts for 9 percent, compared with war, 4
percent; HIV, 3 percent; and heart disease, 3 percent, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Women of reproductive age are more susceptible to fall sick
once infected with TB, as well as the AIDS-causing human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, than men of the same age.
</P>
<P>
"Wives, mothers and wage earners are being cut down in their
prime and the world isn't noticing," said Dr. Paul Dolin, of WHO's
Global Tuberculosis Program.
</P>
<P>
"Yet the ripple effect on families, communities and economies
will be felt long after a woman has died," Dolin said.
</P>
<P>
At the Gothenburg meeting, TB and gender experts tried to draw
up an agenda for research into biological, epidemiological, social
and cultural differences in the occurrence of TB in men and
women.

<HEADLINE> HK Closes Last Detention Center for Vietnamese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong closed the last
detention center for Vietnamese migrants Tuesday, putting to
a close end the Vietnamese boat people problem that has daunted
the city for two decades.
</P>
<P>
The High Island Detention Center (HIDC) was shut down here
Tuesday after a group of 267 Vietnamese departed for Hanoi on two
flights under the Orderly Repatriation Program (ORP).
</P>
<P>
Sally Wong, deputy Secretary for Security, said Tuesday: "The
closing of HIDC is a landmark achievement in the final chapter of
the whole Vietnamese boat people saga."
</P>
<P>
The problem emerged in 1975 when over 200,000 Vietnamese
arrived in Hong Kong. Later when things were at their worst in
October 1991, Hong Kong had to accommodate more than 64,300
Vietnamese people in 14 camps in this densely populated city.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has made vigorous efforts to solve the problem. Some
143,500 Vietnamese refugees have been resettled overseas, and
about 70,000 Vietnamese migrants and illegal immigrants have been
repatriated to their homes. Now the Vietnamese population in Hong
Kong has dropped to 2,160.
</P>
<P>
Wong added: "The government will continue with its best effort
to bring the residual problem of Vietnamese refugees, migrants and
illegal immigrants in Hong Kong to a full and satisfactory
conclusion."
</P>
<P>
The HIDC will be mothballed to cater for any unexpected upsurge
of new arrivals, said the official. The closure of the center will
save Hong Kong 60 million HK dollars (7.7 million U.S. dollars) a
year.

<HEADLINE> Italian Unions Plan National Demonstration for More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy's three big union federations,
meeting on Monday, called for a national demonstration in Rome on
June 20 to push for higher employment.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Cgil, Cisl and Uil, Italy's three big unions, said
they appreciated the government's efforts to combat unemployment
and improve the economy, but the pace of development was slow,
especially in the country's south.
</P>
<P>
This would not be the first time the unions have organized a
national demonstration as a form of protest instead of a general
strike. The last demonstration was held on March 22, 1997 to
demand more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three unions said this demonstration was "not
against anyone," but was for more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Tiziano Treu said the national demonstration was
clearly aimed at speeding up job creation and development.

<HEADLINE> Nine Suspected White Supremacists Arrested in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian police detained nine
suspected members of the white supremacist movement `Hammer
Skinheads Italia' in Rome Monday on charges of acts of violence
and racial intolerance.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also identified another 150 people suspected of
belonging to the extreme right-wing movement during 90 searches,
said Domenico Vulpiani, chief of Digos special branch police,
which carried out the arrests.
</P>
<P>
Police also found truncheons, Nazi Paraphernalia, portraits of
Hitler and Mussolini and arm bands bearing the Nazi German
swastika, said Vulpiani.
</P>
<P>
The investigation on the Hammer Skinheads Italia started in
January 1997 following the profanation of Jewish tombs in Prima
Porta cemetery, on the northern outskirts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since then, police have also investigated other profanations
and acts of violence to individuals which are traceable to the
organization, said Vulpiani.
</P>
<P>
Vulpiani said the movement, which has adopted as a slogan the
words of American white supremacist David lane: "We have to ensure
the existence of our people and the future of white children," has
offices in 16 Italian cities and elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The movement is thought to have been financed from London by
Roberto Fiore, 39, an Italian who allegedly founded the right-wing
Terza Posizione (Third Position) organization.
</P>
<P>
Fiore fled the country in October 1980, two months after the
bologna railway station bombing, which was attributed to the
subversive right.
</P>
<P>
The bombing killed 85 and injured more than 100 and still ranks
as post-war Italy's worst terrorist massacre.
</P>
<P>
An Italian request for Fiore's extradition in 1982 was rejected
for lack of evidence; a similar request was dismissed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
He was tried in Italy in abstentia in 1985 and was sentenced to
nine years in prison for his part in Terza Posizione.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to double its annual
natural gas production capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by
2005, as one of its important strategies for developing energy
resources amid declining oil production and prices.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the reorganized China
National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), natural gas is a form of clean
energy which has huge potential for civilian and industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to verify additional gas reserves of 1
trillion cubic meters by the end of the century, with the
cumulative total hitting 2 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's gas production capacity will be
increased by another 10 billion cubic meters, with the total
topping 25 billion.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source said that through further exploration, major
breakthroughs are forecast in the expansion of proven gas reserves
and the production capacity in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region,
the Tarim Basin and Sichuan province. And the annual output is
expected to reach 30 billion cubic meters by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC official said enormous potential exists for the
country's gas production. Following years of vigorous development,
three large-scale gas production areas have taken shape.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, total
gas reserves of 230 billion cubic meters have been verified. Total
gas reserves of 200 billion cubic meters have been confirmed in
the eastern part of Sichuan province. In the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, total gas reserves of 160 billion cubic meters
have been verified, in addition to the discovery of a group of new
gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
In the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai province, a
large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion cubic meters
has been found.
</P>
<P>
In addition to domestic gas exploration, active efforts are
being made to utilize gas resources of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In central Asia, China has joined an international gas
exploration project which will involve the construction of a
long-distance gas pipeline running through China and the Korean
Peninsula to Japan, providing China with a gas supply of 25
billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia will pipe to China 25 billion cubic meters of gas
annually.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces Committed to Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) are
committed to reform, but a program of reforms would need a careful
and thorough plan of action, ABRI Chief of Socio-Political Affairs
 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told local reporters here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Fundamental reform is the answer to all crises which have hit
the country," Susilo was quoted Tuesday by some local leading
newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the new government has put the fundamental
reform on the agenda to restore the country's economy and regain
the confidence of the general public.
</P>
<P>
Reform would succeed only with strong backing from the
government, he said, adding that what sort of reforms are required
by the nation must be definitely spelt out.
</P>
<P>
"The most important prerequisite to reform is efficient and
capable national leadership. I'd like to stress (the importance)
of state leadership because it is of paramount importance to the
campaign for reform," Susilo said.
</P>
<P>
He supported the government stand to limit the terms of future
presidency, saying the ABRI, the strongest force in the country,
is in favor of a two-term limit on the future president.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first meeting of the new cabinet here on
Monday, President B. J. Habibie said his government proposed a
two-term limit on future president.
</P>
<P>
Former President Soeharto was serving his seventh term before
announcing his resignation last Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Moroccans Aim Beyond the First Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Morocco's head coach Henri Michel
said on Monday that his sides will try every endeavor to enter the
last 16 in this summer's soccer World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The French-born coach made the remarks in an interview with the
Morocco News Agency in the Ifrane training camp.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is the only realistic aim for us. During the
month-long World Cup finals my side will leave no stones unturned
to reach the second round, and every match could have surprise."
</P>
<P>
Michel, who had also coached the French national team, said the
Moroccans have to present its best form in its opening game
against Norway on June 10 in Montpellier if they want to secure a
berth in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman said he would not give the final list of 22
players until next weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I called a total of 27 players for a group training just in
case that some may suffer injuries on the eve of the finals. "
</P>
<P>
Morocco will host an international event which features such
teams like France, England and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Michel stressed that the international competition is the last
chance for his side to warm up for the finals and he would
concentrate on the performance rather than the results.
</P>
<P>
The coach predicted that every team will be undergoing some
further changes following the tune-up matches.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our sides will analyze the strengths and weakness
following the match with England, because we will meet Scotland
and Norway in the finals which are heavily tainted by the English
playing style."
</P>
<P>
Morocco will play its final tune-up match against Chile in
Avignon, France.
</P>
<P>
In the first round Morocco will play Norway on June 10, Brazil
on June 16 and Scotland on June 23.

<HEADLINE> Hemorrhaging Biggest Killer of Chinese Women in Childbirth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hemorrhaging remains the biggest
threat to pregnant women in China, more deadly than complications,
hypertension and puerperal infection, according to the Ministry of
Health.
</P>
<P>
A statistical report released by the ministry showed that
hemorrhaging was the cause in 54.5 percent of the deaths among
pregnant women, compared with 22.2 percent from complications,
11.5 percent from hypertension and 5.1 percent by infection.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested that women in childbirth, who live in
western China's Tibet and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions and
Qinghai province, run much higher risks than those in eastern
metropolises, such as Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"In Shanghai, about 22 women out of every 100,000 die of
childbirth, the lowest rate of the nation," the report
stated. "However, the mortality rate in Tibet is 387 women out of
every 100,000, six times the national level."
</P>
<P>
The current mortality of Chinese pregnant women is 63 out of
every 100,000.
</P>
<P>
"Such a gap reflects a great disparity of maternity services in
different parts of the country, since some proper measures, if
doctors take in time, will bring the incidence down sharply," said
Xiang Xiaoying, an official with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
To narrow the service gap, the ministry early this month
launched a national project named "Safe Motherhood."
</P>
<P>
The project aims to increase the proportion of hospital births
among pregnant women. In some poor areas lacking medical
facilities, midwives will be trained and asked to provide cleaner
and safer services to women in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to a 50 percent decline in the current death
rate of pregnant women by the year 2000," Xiang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China will take active and
responsible measures to withstand pressures exerted by the
financial crisis in Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaosong, president of the China Council for the Promotion
of International Trade (CCPIT), made this remark on Monday while
speaking at the forum of the Economic Council of the Pacific Basin
(PBEC), which is holding its 31st annual meeting here.
</P>
<P>
He said China is facing serious challenges as the financial
crises in Southeast Asian countries made China's exports, and the
use of foreign investment, much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
But China will strive hard to support the crisis countries in
surmounting their difficulties, although it will take a long time
for China itself to overcome and eliminate the harmful influences
wrought by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
China has already offered four billion U.S. dollars to the
countries and regions seriously harmed by the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the hard pressure of maintaining its exports, China will
promote the requirements of its domestic market, and cultivate new
economic growth points, the CCPIT president said.
</P>
<P>
Heading a Chinese delegation of more than 60 businessmen, Yu
arrived here on Saturday to attend the annual meeting of PBEC.
</P>
<P>
The PBEC was founded in May 1967. As a non-governmental
economics forum, it aims at promoting trade and investment,
reducing tariff barriers and stimulating economic cooperation in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Boost Gas Export to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is promoting one of its
natural gas projects to boost its gas export to Thailand in the
year 2000 from the Yedagun natural gas field off the country's
Tanintharyi coast.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper The Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday
that three of the eight test wells in the field are being drilled
and the new export target of gas will be increased to 400 million
cubic feet (7.24 million cubic meters) from 200 million cubic
feet (3.62 million cubic meters) per day.
</P>
<P>
The drilling of the present three test wells, down to a depth
of 2.7 kilometers, is scheduled to be completed in June.
</P>
<P>
The other five are expected to be completed by May 1999, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Yedagun gas project has been jointly operated on a
profit-sharing basis since 1990 by the State Myanmar Oil and Gas
Enterprise, Britain's Premier Petroleum Ltd., Malaysia's Petronas,
Japan's Nippon Oil Co. and Thailand's Petroleum Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Yedagun gas is to be sold to Thailand according to a second
 contract reached in March last year between the PTT Exploration
and Production of Thailand and the developers.
</P>
<P>
The first contract on sale of gas from Myanmar's another
offshore gas field, the Yadana, in the gulf of Mottama was signed
earlier in January 1995. The field has been developed by another
foreign oil group comprising France's TOTAL, the U.S. UNOCAL and
Thailand's Petroleum Authority, and the gas from the field is due
to be sold to Thailand in July this year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has signed more than
20 production-sharing contracts with oil companies from about 10
countries including Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Thailand and the United States, exploring oil and gas in
different offshore and onshore areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the sector reached 2.29 billion U.S.
dollars in 45 permitted projects at the end of 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Office of the Narcotics
Control Board decided to upgrade itself to a national level so as
to better revamp its anti-narcotics measures, The Bangkok Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart was quoted by the
newspaper as saying Monday that the decision would lead to the
establishment of a national narcotics control board chaired by the
prime minister and staffed by representatives of all the
ministries and provinces.
</P>
<P>
The board would start improving anti-narcotics measures soon,
said Sanan, who is also a board member.
</P>
<P>
The board's move followed an intelligence report that illicit
drug problems are still widespread in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The board was informed Monday that the production of and
trading in amphetamines are "gaining momentum," while heroin is
regaining popularity among drug addicts in the country, the
newspaper quoted a source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence report said the production of amphetamines in
Thailand has increased, especially in border areas opposite the
northern province of Chiang Rai.
</P>
<P>
Many amphetamine production sites are located on Myanmar soil
near the Thai-Myanmar border. More than 1 million amphetamine
pills were produced in March alone, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Declares Pollution Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City will declare a
pollution emergency on Tuesday and order cars off the roads and
factories to work at reduced capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Environment Commission of Mexico City made the
decision Monday for the first time this year, as ozone levels went
above the air-pollution alarm index.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the phase one pollution emergency, half of
the city's vehicles must be pulled from the road, while factories
are only allowed to work at 30-40 percent capacity. One-fifth of
the gas stations are closed and all outdoor sports activities are
cancelled in schools.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Index of Air Quality, which measures ozone
levels, reached 251 in the southwest of the city on Monday, one
point higher than the alarm index of 250. Meanwhile, ozone levels
in the center and north of city surpassed 200.
</P>
<P>
A reading of 250 on the scale is considered hazardous.
Readings above 100 are considered dangerous to humans by the World
Health Organization. Official statistics showed the average daily
index of air quality in Mexico City was 170 last year.
</P>
<P>
Air quality was recently aggravated by smoke from scores of
wildfires across Mexico and a lack of wind and rain which usually
scour the atmosphere this time of the year, said the Metropolitan
Environment Commission.
</P>
<P>
Mexico City, at the bottom of a mountain basin, is one of the
most polluted cities in the world. Sun and smog produce a toxic
blanket that often smothers the city.
</P>
<P>
Ozone is a pollutant created when car fumes mix with solar
radiation. There are an estimated three million cars on the roads
of Mexico City.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Gets 14 Billion Dollars Aid Since Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has received more than 650
billion taka (about 14 billion U.S. dollars) in foreign aid since
its independence in 1971, said Lutfar Rahman Sarker, governor of
the country's central bank, Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The major portion of the aid, however, did not reach the poor.
And some urban people benefited from the aid which resulted in the
widening of rich-poor," Sarker told a seminar here Monday on "the
importance of improving the abilities of existing institutions or
developing new ones for alleviating poverty."
</P>
<P>
Press reports here Tuesday quoted him as saying that despite
efforts by government and non-government organizations and
different social and financial bodies, the country could not
attain its desired goal of poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
A major cause of poverty is the banks' discriminatory attitudes
in disbursing loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the existing institutions be made more active
and dynamic in eradicating poverty, as "there is no need to set up
new institutions in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Participants from Bangladesh Bank, various nationalized and
specialized banks and other financial institutions agreed that
loans are not the only solution to poverty alleviation in the
country, but could play a vital role in the effort poverty if they
reach the grassroots levels.
</P>
<P>
"The poor people, if getting loans, can turn their skill into
social capital," according to former secretary and ex-member of
the Planning Commission Sheikh Maksud Ali.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has about 127 million people and nearly half of them
live below the poverty line.

This means that around 1 million foreign laborers will be
deported, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by a government committee Monday, will also
affect rice mills, quarries and rubber farms, which rely mostly on
thousands of foreign workers. These firms were granted one-month
grace period on May 1, when the government ordered factories to
stop employing illegal immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Owners of fisheries businesses in 22 coastal provinces still
enjoy indefinite exemptions, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Department of Employment chief Som Supanakhon, a member of the
committee, said the foreign workers would be replaced by
unemployed Thais, who may receive higher pay and better welfare
benefits if their prospective employers comply with the requests
from local employment offices.
</P>
<P>
Som said 160,000 immigrant laborers have applied to return to
their countries voluntarily, bringing the total number of those to
be sent home to 209,600.
</P>
<P>
Thailand faces mounting pressure of unemployment due to the
economic meltdown, with the number of jobless Thais estimated at 2
million this year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Recruit More Police: Home Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has decided
to recruit 5,000 more policemen to increase the efficiency of
policing in the country, Home Minister Rafiqul Islam said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there were only 98,033 policemen in the country and
the police-people ratio in Bangladesh is 1:1274, compared with
1:728 in India, 1:625 in Pakistan and 1:295 in Singapore, the
Independent daily on Tuesday quoted the minister as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
To deal more effectively with the law and order situation in
the country, the Home Ministry is planning reforms for a more
specialized police force, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as part the reform plan to be worked out within
two to three months, a permanent data bank would be set up to
maintain information about different kinds of crimes and
criminals.
</P>
<P>
There would be some qualitative change in policing, including
specialization of police forces in different fields, such as
maintenance of law and order, collection of information and
investigation, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a specialized service sector of police would be
opened to provide special service to the public, particularly to
entrepreneurs, he added.

foreign currency ratings of nine Indian entities from stable to

<P>
XINING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A large natural gas field has been
found in the Qaidam Basin of northwest China's Qinghai province,
with 75 billion cubic meters of gas reserves already proven or
under control.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Oil Field's total gas reserves proven or under
control have doubled to 150 billion cubic meters after the latest
verification, which was hailed by petroleum geologists as one of
the country's major breakthroughs in natural gas prospecting
during the past decades, said Zhang Sansheng, an oil field
official.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a billion yuan has been spent exploring oil and gas
during the last three years to collect an average increase of 40
million tons in reserves annually. And, in the basin alone, 22 oil
and gas fields have been found with more than 200 million tons of
oil reserves and 134 billion cubic meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas prospecting began in the basin in 1954 and, by now,
15 million tons of crude oil has been recovered. Plans call for
increasing the oil and gas output to three million tons at the end
of the century and 10 million tons in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Related departments have decided to set up projects to annually
produce 120,000 tons of polyvinyl chloride, 100,000 tons of
caustic soda, 200,000 tons of synthetic ammonia, and 300,000 tons
of urea, Zhang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's earnings from the
garment industry increased by 25 percent in the first quarter this
year as compared with the same period last year, sources of the
Ministry of Industrial Development said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The textile and apparel industry earned 546.8 million U.S.
dollars in the January-March period of 1998, up from the 437.5
million dollars during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the industry has helped offset a decrease in
the country's income from other industrial products such as
leather and rubber goods, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the apparel industry is poised this year
to repeat last year's performance as the leading foreign exchange
earner. This year's earnings are expected to exceed last year's
2.143 billion dollars due to incentives offered to the industry.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has taken a series of measures in the last three
years to strengthen the textile industry to meet the challenges of
a quota-free textile trade in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
With stable markets for Sri Lanka's quality products, there are
no fears of the industry being affected due to the devaluation of
the currencies in other Asian garment-producing countries, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
In preparation to meet the challenges expected after the year
2000 the government has been encouraging local industrialists to
produce fabric and other raw materials in order to minimize
imports, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The garment industry has provided direct employment to more
than 350,000 persons in Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today in a meeting with visiting Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar that China will, as always, develop friendly
and cooperative relations with Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Saying that China and Sri Lanka enjoy a traditional friendship
with a history of more than 1,000 years, Zhu said that they have
always understood and supported each other and closely cooperated,
adding that such a friendship has stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the Sri Lankan government's unreserved
support on issues of human rights, Taiwan and Tibet, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it is a set policy of the Chinese
government to develop bilateral friendship and cooperation on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, a policy
which is an important part of China's efforts to forge a
good-neighbor friendship and reciprocal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he is convinced that with efforts from the two sides,
Sino-Sri Lankan friendly relations will make even greater progress
as the new century approaches.
</P>
<P>
Conveying Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike's
greetings to Zhu, Kadirgamar said that China, as a responsible
country, is an important force in promoting stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar told Zhu that he had had fruitful talks with his
Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has valued its traditional friendship
with China, Kadirgamar said, and his country will extend further
exchanges and cooperation with China, and expand bilateral
cooperation to raise bilateral political, economic and trade
relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Zhu asked Kadirgamar to pass on his regards to Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, and Prime Minister
Bandaranaike.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Bank Lowers Forecast for Economy Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Reserve Bank has
lowered its forecast for the economic growth of fiscal 1998/99 in
the face of the Asian economic crisis and declining domestic
business confidence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the bank's monetary policy on Tuesday, Bank
Governor Don Brash brought down the economic growth forecast to
2.2 percent for the fiscal year to March 1999, from an earlier
forecast of 3.6 percent made in March.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure contradicts the projection made by the
Treasury in May that the economy would grow 2.7 percent in the
year to March 1999, before rebounding to 3.9 percent the following
year.
</P>
<P>
Brash pointed out that the Asian crisis continues to hold back
the New Zealand economy with the growth forecast in Japan, the
second biggest buyer of New Zealand exports, substantially
downgraded.
</P>
<P>
As the other Asian countries tell a similar story, demand for
New Zealand products is expected to be weak, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Brash said the bank hopes the tax cuts scheduled for July this
year will provide a boost to the economy. He expected the economy
to pick up next year, with a growth up to 4.4 percent by the year
2000.

JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police arrested the deputy mayor of the Arab
Israeli city of Umm Elfahm and four businessmen from eastern
Jerusalem on Monday. The police suspected that the investment
company run by them was serving as a financial arm of the
militant group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A top official of the European Commission has told Haaretz
that political dialog between Europe and Israel no longer
exists. He said that Israel under the leadership of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was extracting all the benefits of
relations with the European Union while interfering with the
economic progress of its neighbors, refusing to take part in
regional cooperation and blocking every chance for progress in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai made it
unequivocally clear for the first time on Monday that he
favors a double-digit second pullback of Israeli troops from the
West Bank. But he added that the Palestinians should fulfill
their commitment to fight terrorism before the further
redeployment was carried out.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Company Profits From Trademark Registration Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Relevant Chinese departments have
expressed grave concern to a Shenzhen company making profits by
deliberately registering trademarks of other companies and then
selling the rights back to the original owners.
</P>
<P>
Information from Trademark Affairs Division of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce disclosed that China
(Shenzhen) Foreign Trade Center Co. Ltd. has submitted
applications for registering 240 trademarks of other companies
through normal procedures since December of 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, applications for the registration of 201 trademarks
have passed initial assessment, which mainly involves insurance,
investment, financial information, commodities and other
services. Some trademarks the Shenzhen company hopes to register
are identical with trademarks of dozens of well-known commodities,
while some other trademarks it prepared for registration are the
same as simplified names of listed companies.
</P>
<P>
After it has finished registration, the Shenzhen company has
tried all possible ways to get the companies to buy back their own
trademarks, an act that has aroused strong resentment among the
affected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jinqi, Chief Judge of the Intellectual Property Rights
Court of the Supreme People's Court, said though "Trademark Law"
stipulates that one owns the exclusive right to use a trademark if
he successfully beats others in first sending applications for
trademark registration, the "Civil Law" advocates the principle of
trustworthiness and credibility and operators will be stopped if
their acts violate such a principle.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen company has outstripped others to first register
trademarks of other companies and has attempted to make profits by
selling them back, said the chief judge, adding that such
practices should be punished to safeguard a normal market order.
</P>
<P>
Liu Peizhi, deputy head of the Trademark Division of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce, said the Shenzhen
company deliberately outstrips others to first send in
applications for registering trademarks of other companies. Such
registrations should be canceled, he said, whether trademark
holders complain or not.

<HEADLINE> Lower Turnout Rate Expected for S. Korea's Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's June 4 local elections
are likely to see a record low turnout rate as voters are cynical
to politics due to the country's ongoing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 days to go, public response is indifferent to some
15,000 contenders competing the positions of nine governors, seven
major city mayors, 232 district heads and 4,181 councillors.
</P>
<P>
Last week, two nationwide televised debates among candidates
running for Seoul mayor and the governor of Kyonggi Province drew
less than 10 percent of all viewers, according to a latest survey.
</P>
<P>
Finding it hard to get public attention, many candidates have
reportedly canceled their plans to give speeches at public areas
and turned to local computer networks and internet for campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the voter turnout rate might be below
60 percent, lower than the 68.4 percent in the 1995 elections.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the public indifference to the current economic
hardships and the abnormal weather phenomena known as El Nino,
which is believed to have sapped voters' political enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
"Who on earth pays attention to the polls at a time when voters
are plagued by fears of layoffs caused by corporate bankruptcies
and economic restructuring ?" said a Yonhap reporter.
</P>
<P>
Election analysts forecast that regionalism will play a key
role in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
In Seoul and regions surrounding the capital city, polls showed
that candidates of the ruling coalition of the National Congress
for New Politics and the United Liberal Democrats are more popular
than those from the major opposition Grand National Party, which
has 161 seats of the 299-member National Assembly, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
The local elections are seen as a chance for President Kim
Dae-jung in seeking political realignment and changing the
opposition-controlled parliament.
</P>
<P>
Although trailed significantly by well-known hopefuls from the
ruling camp in Seoul and other regions, the Grand National Party
campaigners are expected to win in the southeastern part of the
nation, which is traditionally a political base for the opposition
party.

<HEADLINE> China To Find More Ways To Use Overseas Investment, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official has said
that China has listed the utilization of overseas funds in its
outlines for national economic development and will adopt more
forms for using foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Li Rongrong, deputy minister of the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), made his remarks at Sunday's closing meeting of
an SDPC work conference on foreign capital held in Wuhan, capital
of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
China encourages local enterprises of various kinds of
ownership to attract overseas investment, Li said, and the use of
foreign capital will continue to be an effective way to
restructure state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Private companies also will be allowed to use overseas funds,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to experiment with setting up
foreign-funded joint stock companies, allowing more overseas
companies to enter fields that need special permission from the
government, and selling more operating rights on infrastructure
projects to foreign investors, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
More foreign capital will be introduced into the country
through the international stock market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will encourage local companies to invest
overseas, especially in such fields as petroleum and natural gas
industries, as well as farming and forestry.

<HEADLINE> Company Trying To be More Open to Stock-Holders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- While many local investors have
complained of difficulties in learning about the real story of
nearly 800 joint-stock firms in China, a Shanghai-based company is
doing something to keep them more informed.
</P>
<P>
The United Business Co. Ltd. has set up a special department,
the Letter Box of Stockholders, to receive complaints, comments
and proposals from investors.
</P>
<P>
It is the first such "letter box" opened by a publicly held
Chinese firm, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
"The setting-up of the department is aimed at better protecting
the investors' rights to learn about and comment on major issues
of the company," said General Manager Lu Mingfang.
</P>
<P>
Officers with the new body will be responsible for receiving
visits and letters from stockholders. Written replies must be sent
to inquiring stockholders within 30 days, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company will also organize stockholders'
visits to the firm's factories under the company and arrange talks
between investors and company leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The company has brought itself under the supervision of the
stockholders by opening the letter-box department," said Gong
Quanrong, one of the firm's stockholders, "and it shows that the
company is making an effort to standardize its operation and make
it more open."
</P>
<P>
One local economist said that the opening of the letter box
department shows that the country's stock market is becoming more
mature as locally listed companies try to be more standardized and
open.
</P>
<P>
Local investors are turning their eyes from the secondary
market, as it was in the past decade, to the listed companies
themselves, the economist said.
</P>
<P>
United Business is the first Sino-overseas joint venture in
Shanghai. It was founded in 1981 by local textile industries and a
Hong Kong entrepreneur, and turned into a joint stock firm in 1991
to become the first listed Sino-overseas joint venture in the city.
</P>
<P>
The company is also one of the first publicly held companies in
Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Philippine President Fidel
Ramos, "president-elect" Joseph Estrada and House Speaker Jose de
Venecia Tuesday forged an agreement in principle to form a
government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace Tuesday for the first time described
Estrada as "president-elect" in the May 11 elections despite the
fact that Congress just began canvassing the presidential votes
late Tuesday and could proclaim the winner only several days
later.
</P>
<P>
A quick count conducted by a private organization accredited by
the Commission on Elections has shown that Estrada, the
presidential bet of the opposition Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino (Lammp, Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) and currently
the vice president of the country, had won a landslide victory in
the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in a press release that the
agreement was reached during a four-hour breakfast meeting among
the three leaders to enable the country to move forward
confidently and perform successfully in the arena of international
competition.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia is the secretary general and presidential candidate
of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party. He was anointed by Ramos but was
reportedly defeated in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Except de Venecia, all the other seven presidential candidates
in the race have conceded defeat to Estrada.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Ramos urged the incoming president
to use the gains of the country during the last six years to
address the present economic and social challenges facing the
Filipino people.
</P>
<P>
"Each succeeding government must be able to build and, if
possible, improve upon its predecessor for the good of the whole
nation," the outgoing president said.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the support of Ramos, Estrada said: "We need to put
the atmosphere of political rivalry behind us now, so that we can
maximize the benefits of a working democracy such as what we have
in the country today."
</P>
<P>
The three leaders further stressed that adversaries in the May
polls must look upon themselves not as political enemies but as
friends and allies working for the common good of the Filipino
people.
</P>
<P>
One of the immediate areas of cooperation being studied is the
forging of a working coalition in Congress between the current
ruling party and Estrada's Lammp.
</P>
<P>
Such a coalition in both the House and the Senate is
contemplated to spur and facilitate the enactment of laws that
will respond to the needs of economic recovery and development and
social equity, the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, banned by law to seek a second term, is to step down
when his term expires on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders expressed optimism that the president-elect
will be proclaimed in time for the country's centennial
celebration on June 12.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
has called for more efforts by the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) to put an end to the civil war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with OIC Secretary-General Ezzidine Laraki,
Khatami said that the most important problem facing the Islamic
world is the issue of Afghanistan, although it can not be ruled
out that the Palestinian issue is far more serious, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president, also current OIC chairman, appreciated
the peace initiatives of the OIC secretary general and OIC
special envoy in Afghan affairs Abu Bakr in the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a matter of great regret that bloodletting
and flames of war were continuing in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that with the assistance, cooperation and efforts
of Muslim nations, particularly the regional countries, the
regional crises must be able to be defused. The crisis in
Afghanistan needs to be resolved through mutual understanding and
negotiation among all factions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Laraki briefed Khatami on the issues of the OIC, saying
that the concept of dialog between civilizations needs to be
worked out within the OIC framework after attaining a
consensus among the 55 member states.
</P>
<P>
Laraki is currently in Iran for the three-day session of
the OIC Committee on Coordination of Joint Islamic Action,
which was opened on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Growth in COMESA Peaks at 4.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern African (COMESA) hit 4.5 percent
last year, the highest recorded over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the region has been at about four percent for two
years, more than two percentage points higher than the trend in
the preceding decade, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Martin Ogang, President of the Eastern and Southern Africa
Trade and Development (PTA) Bank, says that inflation in the
region have also fallen significantly, while trade and current
account deficits have declined in proportion to the gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
He says that projections for COMESA growth are encouraging,
with significant improvements made in macro-economic management
and increased widening of production bases, which reduce exposure
and vulnerability to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
As of December 1997, the members of the PTA Bank were Burundi,
Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the African Development
Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
According to the PTA annual report for 1997, the bank's
project financing activities continued to increase as in the
previous years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Clears Minefields on Border with Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese soldiers in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have cleared another 8 million square
meters of ground in 31 minefields along the Sino-Vietnamese border
in its first six-month, dry-season work of the second operation.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Daxiong, deputy commander of the Guangxi Military Area
Command, said today that one soldier died and two others were
injured in the operation during which 63,800 mines of more than 20
kinds have been removed or exploded.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops handed over another 1 million square meters
of land, which can now be used peacefully, to local governments.
</P>
<P>
The operation started Nov. 28. The first began in 1993 after
China and Vietnam restored relations.
</P>
<P>
The military official said that, as of June, the troops will
start their rainy-season operation. By the end of this year, a
total of 56 minefields of 10 million square meters is expected to
be cleared.
</P>
<P>
The mine-sweeping operation has rejuvenated border trade
between the two countries, statistics show. At the state-level
port in Longzhou County, the daily trade volume has gone up from
60,000 yuan (7,200 U.S. dollars) before the ongoing operation to
more than 130,000 yuan (15,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Raid Police Station in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Heavily-armed gunmen raided a
police station in Kenya's Indian Ocean port city Mombasa Monday,
killed one, wounded two, released 42 remand prisoners and fled
with two guns.
</P>
<P>
The two police officers who were going to report for duty were
shot by the raiders in jungle uniform and seriously wounded in
front of the Changamwe Police Station at about 5:00 a.m Monday,
press here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The raiders later shot dead a security guard at the Kenya Oil
Refinery gate while he was fleeing from the station.
</P>
<P>
Coast Provincial Police Officer Japhet Mwania said the
security personnel were pursuing the gunmen and combing the areas
around the station.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said at the beginning of the lightning attack,
some gunmen walked into the police station's reception and
ordered the police officer on duty to open door to the cell.
</P>
<P>
Before the officer realized what was going on, the gunmen
opened the fire and he had to dive into the cell to seek refuge
and evade the bullets.
</P>
<P>
As the gunmen in the reception continued firing and ordering
the suspects to get out, the officer who had taken refuge quickly
removed his uniform and also left the cell as one of the remand
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the gunmen might have gone to the station to
release some suspected robbers who were arrested by the police
over the weekend and were being detained there.

<HEADLINE> Modern Enterprise System Effective to State Sector's Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Pilot projects in the state sector
to adopt a modern enterprise system in northwest China's Gansu
Province have begun to yield results, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, by last year, 23 state-owned enterprises
had been transformed into companies closely following the standard
practices of a modern business system, with total assets growing
by 68 percent and more compared to three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 23 businesses have set up a system of state capital
investors, stating investors' responsibilities, rights and
interests as well as clarifying property rights.
</P>
<P>
Related enterprises made the most of the "legal person"
property rights to restructure interior assets and buy into other
firms in a bid to raise the awareness of raising capital.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Sanmao Woollen Group, for an example, acquired a
mill, and then took over another bankrupt wool factory to expand
its production capacity by more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 23 enterprises have cut 3.7 percentage points off their
asset-liability ratio on average. And they have also formed a
management structure of a shareholders' congress, a board of
directors, a board of supervisors and managers in an effort to
seek democratic and scientific decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises have relocated more than 10,000 workers by
developing diversified economies, new production projects and
launching retraining classes.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover China's Earliest Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists, geologists,
and historians have discovered a 736-kilometer road built
over 2,000 years ago during the reign of Qinshihuang, China's
first emperor.
</P>
<P>
One archaeologist, Lu Sixian, says that they made the discovery
during a map and topographical study in Inner Mongolia and
Shaanxi, which also showed that the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.) had
precise topographical maps, river maps, and instruments for
measuring slopes and straight lines.
</P>
<P>
Part of the road in the Mu Us Desert in Inner Mongolia is now
some 10 meters above the surrounding surface and looks like a dam.
</P>
<P>
Lu explains that this military communications project started
in 212 B.C. during Qinshihuang's tour of the northern part of
China and study of the defensive capacity of the Great Wall. The
project was finished in two and a half years by more than 100,000
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The road joined up with what are now Shaanxi and Gansu
provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and passed through
deserts and and crossed mountains and plateaus. Its width varies
from 9 to 50 meters. It was built with local soil.
</P>
<P>
Its headquarters were in modern-day Jingbian County in Shaanxi
Province and there were 16 imperial resorts along it.
</P>
<P>
History books make only a brief mention of it.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Denies Report on Restriction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi has denied reports that he had been banned from leaving
the country, the English-language daily Tehran Times reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"No such order was notified to me by the court," Karbaschi
told the daily, adding that "I do not have a plan to visit any
country."
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Qods reported on Monday that judiciary
authorities have banned Karbaschi from leaving Iran to attend a
conference on urban administration in Tokyo, which will start on
Tuesday. It said that the mayor was also to visit several other
countries after the four-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Karbaschi was detained on embezzlement
charges by the conservative judiciary, but was released after 12
days of detention when Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei stepped in to prevent an escalation of factional
struggle over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives and the coalition of the moderates and the
leftists lined up against each other following the victory of
President Mohammad Khatami in the presidential elections in May
last year, who gained strong support from Karbaschi and his
followers.
</P>
<P>
The moderates accused the conservatives, who still control the
country's important organs such as the Majlis or parliament, the
judiciary and armed forces, of undermining Khatami's government
and creating hurdles for the government.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives lashed out at the moderates for abusing
freedom proposed by Khatami and some commanders of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) even warned to crack down the
rival factions.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Threatened by Desertification: UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The problem of
desertification is threatening 17 million people in Tanzanian,
more than half of the country's population, a United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) officer has warned.
</P>
<P>
Areas to be mostly affected are the country's dry regions with
arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, which will lead to
increased poverty of local residents, UNDP officer Gemma Aliti,
was quoted by Tuesday's Daily News as saying.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper at a national forum for the setting up of
desertification and environment control fund in Dar es Salaam
Monday, Aliti said the threat was largely man-made and can be
easily contained through joint local and international
strategies.
</P>
<P>
She named some of the highly affected regions as, Dodoma,
Singida and Morogoro in central part of the country, Mwanza,
Shinyanga, Tabora and Mara in the lakes zone, Iringa, Mbeya in
the southern highlands, Arusha, Kilimanjaro in the north, and
Mtwara and Lindi in the south.
</P>
<P>
Aliti said that some of the factors contributing to the the
increase of desertification rate in the regions are poverty, lack
of land management policies, ineffective bylaws on environmental
matters, uncontrolled bush fires, among others.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicated that Tanzanian, which has 44
million hectares of forests, is losing between 300,000 and
400,000 hectares per year as a result of tree felling.
</P>
<P>
The existing laws on environment were formulated in 1950s and
therefore the penalties are too lenient.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State in the Vice President's Office, Bakari
Mbonde, said at the forum that the government is dedicated to
improving the environment in the country, saying the
environmental fund will be used by the target groups at grassroot
levels.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said with international support, national plans
to motivate villagers to curb the menace of deserts are underway.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin William Mkapa at a conference in
February said that the war against environmental destruction
should start from every household. He warned that people must
realize that their survival is depending on the nature.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Israeli Premiers Hold Talks in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China will, as always, join the
international community to make its due efforts and contribution
to promoting the Middle East peace process, Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In talks with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Zhu said the China-Israel cooperative ties have been
developing smoothly since establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to collaborate with Israel to further promote
bilateral relations on the basis of mutual benefit," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he has seen with his owns eyes the progress
China has made, and that he believes people of the whole world
would like to see China succeed in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped his ongoing visit would serve to further
advance relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two premiers had an extensive and
in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and regional and
international issues of shared interest.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Zhu said his government is
very concerned about the process and the situation in this region,
and is uneasy about the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
China deems that so long as the peace talks continue to be
stalled, it will negatively affect peace and stability in the
region and in the world as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said, "It is the demand of the times to settle, as soon as
possible, the Middle East issue, which is the longest unresolved
problem in this century."
</P>
<P>
The settlement of this issue is in the practical and long-term
interests of both the Arab countries and Israel, Zhu said, adding
that all Arab and Israeli leaders with courage and insight should
be far-sighted and treasure this hard-won achievement of peace.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations' resolutions on the Middle East
issue and the land-for-peace principle set at the Madrid peace
conference should serve as the basis of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The key to breaking the current peace talks deadlock and the
basic condition to guarantee all countries' security and stability
lies in all relevant parties' earnest implementation of the agreed
resolutions and understanding, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Jewish people had bitter historical experiences and
their arduous efforts to set up their own country have gained the
sympathy of the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that, similarly, the unremitting efforts of the
Palestinian people to restore their legal national rights,
including a return to their motherland and establishment of an
independent state, has also won sympathy and support of people in
the world.
</P>
<P>
"Israel and the Palestinians should achieve a reconciliation
and live in peace," he said, adding "China supports the
Palestinian people's just cause and reasonable demand, support and
encourage the Palestinian side to resolve the Palestine-Israel
conflict through peaceful talks."

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
expressed here Tuesday his thanks for China's Xinhua News
Agency's contributions to the fair and just coverage of Kenya
over the years.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Guo Chaoren, President of Xinhua News
Agency#,Moi said Xinhua has helped voice the need of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Moi also criticized some western media which have been
bossing around interfering with the internal affairs of African
countries including Kenya, saying "it reminds me of the colonial
times."
</P>
<P>
He noted that while the world is facing problems regarding
population control, environment protection and unbalanced
development, Kenya has its own difficulties in developing its
ecomony, which needs a positive coverage by the media.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has rich economic resources, but it lacks the means to
develop them. He believed that with the assistance of
well-wishing countries, Kenya will soon catch up with the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president also showed his appreciation over
Xinhua's donation of computers and other communications
facilities as well as photograpic equipment to Kenya News Ageny,
saying he is happy with the constructive cooperation between
Xinhua and the Kenyan media and hoped such cooperation would be
further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Kenya An Yongyu, and Kenyan Information
and Broadcasting Minister Joseph Nyaga were present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua set up its Africa Regional Bureau here in Nairobi in
1986 to cover the development of sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
Guo arrived in Nairobi Monday for a three-day working visit.

<HEADLINE> China's Mainland To Accept Civil Judgments by Taiwan Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court
today issued regulations on the acceptance of civil judgments
granted by courts in Taiwan. The regulations are effective today.
</P>
<P>
Tang Dehua, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, told
a press conference here today that the regulations will also be
applicable to arbitration awards by relevant Taiwan institutions.
</P>
<P>
With applications from interested parties and confirmation by
the people's courts in the mainland, civil judgments and
arbitration awards made in Taiwan will have the same validity of
law in the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To accept civil judgments given by courts in Taiwan means that
persons concerned from both sides, especially civil interests of
our compatriots in Taiwan, will be put under legal protection
timely, fairly and effectively in the mainland," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, legal obligations in Taiwan can apply to
relevant people's courts in the mainland for enforcement.
</P>
<P>
However, Tang said, in certain situations the people's courts
will not accept civil judgments granted by courts in Taiwan, for
example, in a situation when the validity of the civil judgment is
not clear.
</P>
<P>
"The acceptance of civil judgments by courts in Taiwan should
be viewed as legal cooperation between Taiwan and other Chinese
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, which completely
differs from the mutual acceptance of judgments between
countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that conforming to the 'one China' principle is an
important pre-condition for accepting applications.
</P>
<P>
Such acceptance also doesn't mean the mainland accepts Taiwan's
legal system, nor does it mean giving up the legal administration
power over the Taiwan area, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1992, civil cases involving Taiwan
residents conducted by people's courts in the mainland areas of
China have been increased by 7 percent every year, and the figure
for economic disputes is 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Courts issued regulations on how to handle
cases involving Taiwan residents about marriage, debts and other
disputes in 1988.
</P>
<P>
At today's news conference, the Supreme People's Court official
also urged Taiwan to take a cooperative attitude to better protect
the interests of those concerned.

<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The fifth national census in 2000

China also understands all relevant parties' concern for their

Zhu said he hoped that the Israeli side would understand the
circumstances of the Palestinian side, adopt a flexible and
practical attitude and continue the peace talks in a bid to help
the stalled process out of its present difficulty.

<HEADLINE> Night Snack Street in Xi'an Feeds Tourist Hordes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- When night falls, the snack market on
Dongxin Street of the ancient capital of Xi'an begins bustling.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of fatigue, Chinese and foreign tourists who have
visited the world-renowned archeological site of terra cotta
soldiers during the day, swarm to the Dongxin Street night market
to have a taste of delicacies that have been talked about so much.
</P>
<P>
Visitors can choose among more than 120 varieties of snacks
from different localities in China.
</P>
<P>
Since its opening in 1985, the 1-kilometer-long food street has
grown to 200 stalls, with half selling Muslim snacks.
</P>
<P>
Open from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m., the market attracts an average of
10,000 hungry tourists every day. Ma Weiyun, who runs a stall
selling steamed stuffed buns, said that her shop feeds as many as
1,000 clients daily.
</P>
<P>
To protect her family-run business which has been going on for
five generations, Ma has registered the name of the shop --
"Fushunzhai" -- as a trademark.
</P>
<P>
The market also draws folk artists to display their talent and
makes some money. Spending 3-to-5 yuan (8.3 yuan equals 1
U.S. dollar), the guest can get a folk or a pop singer to perform
a favorite song. "Most of the artists are actually from the
countryside," said Wang Huimin, a Xi'an resident. "Their
performance is full of local flavor."
</P>
<P>
Since the market is a major tourist attraction, its management
has been a concern to Xi'an authorities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, money has been spent on paving the road,
making illuminated signboards and building a dinner-ware
sterilizing center.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the business volume of the market reached 16.52
million yuan (1.99 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Australian Women to be Watched out: FIBA President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROTHENBURG, Germany, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia, who finished
fourth at the last women's basketball championship in Sydney four
years ago, was a team to watch out, the FIBA president said here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"When you have two players like Michele Timms and Sandy
Brondello, together with a good number of very complete and
competitive players, you have the obligaion of having great
championship aspirations," said George Killian, who heads the
world basketball governing body.
</P>
<P>
Killian also told a press conference here that many Australian
players were well known to the German fans, who could offer vocal
supports during this championship to start on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australians, spearheaded by WNBA's Phoenix Mercury star
Timms, grabbed the silver medal at the Atlanta Olympic Games in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The team recently won a four-nation double round-robin
tournament by registering a 5-1 record in Japan, where the United
States, Japan and China also competed.
</P>
<P>
Killian, an American who will end his eight-year term of office
as the president in August, said the Olympic champion United
States has a very good team, but it would be simply unrealistic to
believe that the gold medal cannot have another holder.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Russia and Lithuania,
among others, have very strong and solid rosters which will come
to Berlin with only one thought in their minds: the gold medal,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
The championship will be held from May 26 to June 7 in seven
cities across Germany, drawing criticisms from the media for
staging such an important event in so many venues.
</P>
<P>
Killian said he thought in the future the FIBA should select
the host from bidders which offer no more than three venues for
the event.

<HEADLINE> Rural Demand for Electrical Appliances Expected to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The demand for electrical
appliances in China's vast rural areas is expected to rise
dramatically this year as the market has entered the fast lane of
growth, according to a just-concluded survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the State Information Center,
projected that color TVs, washing machines and refrigerators would
be major consumer items in rural households this year.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge is attributable to improved living standards and
the availability of electrical power in the countryside as well as
lower prices of major electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
About three of every 10 rural households intend to buy TVs,
while 23.32 percent and 20 percent of rural families wish to
purchase washing machines and refrigerators, respectively. The
percentages are all higher than in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 30 percent of rural Chinese households have
color TVs, while the ratios for refrigerators and washing machines
stand at 10 and 25 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Global Tropical Fruits Exports Increase in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The world's exports of tropical
fruits in 1997 registered an 11-percent increase to about 2
million tons, an on-going seminar on tropical fruits organized by
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar being held in Thailand's coastal
resort of Pattaya said the export value of fresh tropical fruits
in 1997 exceeded 1.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 56 million tons of tropical fruits
were produced in 1997, which consist of 40 percent of mangoes, 23
percent pineapple, 9 percent papayas, 4 percent avocados and 24
percent of other tropical fruits, such as lychee, rambutan and
durian.
</P>
<P>
The seminar said more than 95 percent of the world production
and exports of tropical fruits originate in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, developed countries account for about 80 percent of
the world's imports of fresh tropical fruits.
</P>
<P>
T.C. Ti, senior marketing and trade economist from the FAO
Bangkok office said at the seminar that Europe will remain the
largest regional market for tropical fruits with France being the
largest importing country.
</P>
<P>
North America is the second largest market and Japan, Singapore
and Hong Kong are also main importers of fresh tropical fruits, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, known as the first session of the FAO sub-group on
tropical fruits, opened on Monday and ends on Thursday.
Seventy-five delegates from 33 member countries and 21 observers
are participating in the session.
</P>
<P>
The delegates are expected to assess the current market
situation and short-term outlook, which will help governments and
market operators make investment decisions.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Telephone Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's telephone companies are
exploring new markets by providing more services for customers.
</P>
<P>
A China Telecom official said that in July his company will
open free call services in all provincial capitals except Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He said that new value-added services such as telephone cards,
mass calling, virtual private network (VPN), universal personal
telecommunications (UPT) and vote on telephone (VOT) are fledging
markets in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Telecom saw the number of its customers multiply since
it opened the 800 free call service at the end of 1995. During the
first three months of this year, the company signed up as many
free-call users as it did in all of 1997. It expects to increase
the number of its free-call users by 400-to-500 this year.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises, private businesses, government
institutions and media are major subscribers of the free-call
service.
</P>
<P>
Sources from China Telecom said that revenue from these new
value-added telephone services is still a negligible part of the
company's total earnings.
</P>
<P>
Though China has had almost every kind of telephone service
that the United States has at present, these services are still in
the early stage of an expanding market.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications experts said that a major obstacle for
market expansion of these services is the consumers' concept.
</P>
<P>
When the 800 free-call service was first introduced into the
cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in 1995, more than 90
percent of the subscribers were foreign companies operating in
China. By the end of this April, local subscribers had accounted
for more than 60 percent of the users.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom has already extended its computer-controlled
intelligent telephone network to all county-level cities in the
country, enabling it to provide dozens of new services for
customers.

<P>
LANZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A military hospital has
successfully reattached 10 severed and crushed fingers for a male
worker in Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said Zhao Changzhu, a worker at a paper factory in
Lanzhou, has become only the 12th person in the world to have all
10 severed fingers survive after reattachment.
</P>
<P>
He has full use of his 10 fingers four months after
post-operative treatment and rehabilitation, doctors said. His
fingers are of healthy red color and he can easily hold a bowl or
a cup.
</P>
<P>
Zhao had his fingers severed by a paper cutter on last December
31. He was rushed to the hospital of the Lanzhou Military Area
Command.
</P>
<P>
In 18 hours of surgery, doctors linked 16 arteries and 46
veins, plus all of the nerves, muscles and tendons.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Five Lebanese have been wounded in
south Lebanon in clashes between guerrillas and Israeli forces
since late Monday night, Lebanon's Voice of the People radio
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Israeli allied South Lebanese Army (SLA) was
wounded by a roadside bomb blast early Tuesday when he and some
other militiamen passed by a road in the predominantly Christian
town of Jezzine in the central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Four Lebanese civilians were wounded late Monday night in an
Israeli shelling at the village of Mashgara and its surrounding
areas in the western part of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came in a retaliation for an earlier
Hezbollah military offensive against its posts inside the Israeli
security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer zone in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its northern areas from Lebanese
guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in a bid to drive the
2,000 Israeli forces and its ally SLA militiamen out of south
Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Security Council Monday
adopted a program to normalize economic and social conditions in
the country's coal mining regions, according to the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The council noted in a meeting in the Kremlin that the
situation in the industry has deteriorated to an extent that needs
to be considered by the country's top security agency and the
president.
</P>
<P>
The move came after coal miners blocked two lines on the
Trans-Siberian railway last week in protest over 8.7 billion
rubles (1.45 billion U.S. dollars) unpaid wages. The government
and miners leaders later agreed on a program to pay the backlog.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, presidential press secretary Sergei
Yastrzhembsky told reporters that the failure of the preceding
government to do much for the industry was one of the causes of
the troubles.
</P>
<P>
The council pledged to take measures to stabilize the economic
and social situation in the country's coal mining regions and to
reform the industry, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed to the need to toughen penalties for disturbing
transport and to punish enterprise managers for deliberately
failing to pay wages.

<HEADLINE> International Loans to Asia Fall in 2nd Half of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Lending by banks in major industrial
countries to Asia fell by 4.8 billion US dollars to 381 billion US
dollars in the second half of 1997, the Financial Times reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing new debt figures out Monday from the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), the newspaper said that marked
drops in international bank lending to South Korea and Thailand
were offset by an increase in loans to China.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures showed that international bank lending to
both Latin America and eastern Europe rose at the same time, with
lending to the former increasing by 23.8 billion US dollars to 283
billion US dollars while loans to the latter rising by 8.3 billion
US dollars to 123 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BIS said this indicated that the financial crises which
swept the Asian region had only a limited effect on bank financing
to the above two regions.
</P>
<P>
"The further increases in the claims on Latin America and
eastern European countries point to limited contagion outside
Asia," the BIS said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the BIS is planning to produce quarterly
figures, instead of the current twice-a-year publication, and to
expand the number of countries from which it collects loan data.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
Monday urged African countries to struggle for the continent's
economic freedom through their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chiluba when speaking at the State
House here to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of
the Organization of African Unity and the African Freedom Day
which fall on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a one-hour-long speech, the Zambian president pointed out
that there is no political independence without economic freedom
and that Africa, thereforest launch a new struggle to gain
economic freedom after most of the African countries became
independent politically 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba said that "the struggle will be long and
hazardous, but it must be fought with the same zeal,
determination and tenacity that characterized the fight for
political freedom."
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Chiluba placed special emphasis on Africa's
self-reliance in the struggle for economic freedom.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that the world does not owe Africa a living.
We owe it to ourselves. We should struggle to develop this
continent through our own effort, sweat and toil, for only sweat
and toil will give us and our children a better life," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian leader also urged the African countries to unite
on the economic front. He said no single African country has the
capacity to fight poverty and foreign debt which has exceeded 200
billion U.S. Dollars for the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
Africa should unite and speak with one voice and act as one on
the matters important to them, said Chiluba, adding that "there
is no problem in Africa that is too big for Africa to solve."
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people including all the ambassadors to Lusaka
and the government ministers were invited to participate in the
grand celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Vows to Tight Control after Nuclear Waste Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- German Environment Minister Angela
Merkel Monday pledged more control over the country's atomic
industry after the recent disclosure that some of Germany's
nuclear-waste shipments had leaked more radiation than official
standards permitted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Bonn, Merkel admitted that
there had been 16 known cases of radioactive contaminations in
railway shipments of nuclear waste to a French reprocessing plant
in 1997 and another one or two cases in similar shipments to
Britain.
</P>
<P>
She also admitted that the latest disclosure had considerably
undermined the public trust in the atomic industry that was
difficult to restore in short term.
</P>
<P>
In a nation with a powerful environmental movement, the
nuclear-waste leaks have sparked a public outcry recently and
prompted the government to order the suspension of all nuclear
waste shipments both within the country and to abroad.
</P>
<P>
At the request of opposition parties, which have already
demanded resignation of Merkel, the German parliament is due to
hold a special session on Wednesday to clarify whether the
environment ministry had be informed of the contaminated shipments
earlier but failed to stop them in time.
</P>
<P>
Transportation of nuclear waste has been a major issue in
Germany for years with the government having to deploy large
troops of police along railway lines every year in protection
against widespread anti-nuclear protests.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists has long called on the government to shut
down the country's 19 nuclear power plants which provide about 34
percent of the country's energy supply.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament Speaker Criticizes Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis Monday criticized neighboring Turkey for its
"aggressive" position towards Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes,
Kaklamanis said that Turkey had since 1973 been gradually
developing a specific aggressive strategy against Greece.
</P>
<P>
Despite Greece's constructive stance on a number of issues,
Turkey has continued its aggressive stance with gradually raising
its claims from the sea area, to air space and more recently to
territorial claims in the Aegean Sea against Greece's sovereign
rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent statements by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
the speaker stressed that Clinton had disappointed Greeks.
</P>
<P>
While urging both Greece and Turkey to make difficult decisions
to settle their problems, Clinton said in London recently that he
did not think they could solve one problem in isolation from the
others. He thought they had to move forward on all these problems,
Cyprus, the Aegean jurisdictional disputes and the role of Turkey
in Europe's future.
</P>
<P>
Greece has firmly rejected Clinton's such proposal, saying that
there could be no issue of a package solution to the differences
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
and the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Greek-Turkish relations have been worsening for
Turkey's claims over Greece's four uninhabited islands in the
eastern Aegean Sea.

maintain democratic governments as well as independence and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"What is important and significant, though rather than render
us divided and helpless, these conflicts have seen Africa
galvanized and spurred in efforts to resolve them," said Mugabe,
current Chairman of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
He added that the reinforcement of African unity will render
the continent in good stead as it prepared for political and
economic changes and opportunities of the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe cited the military coup against the elected government
of Sierra Leone last year, saying that the OAU, using the
military leverage of the economic community of west African
states, mounted a successful military campaign in March last year
which saw the restoration of the government of President Ahmad
Tedjan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding on May 25, 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
the OAU's main challenge has been military governments and the
problems they posed.
</P>
<P>
These have distracted the attention from the economic problems
faced by a continent rated as the world's poorest.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Mugabe noted that there has also been a
concerted effort to wring Africa from the economic problems it
faces, particularly in reference to its trade relations with the
western developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"Meetings such as those of ministers of trade and industry
held in Harare in last April to prepare for this month's World
Trade Organizaiton's Ministerial Conference and of the OAU
Economic and Social Council in Cairo in late April have helped
coordinate our positions on international economic policy
issues," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He described the developments as encouraging and welcome,
saying they will enhance Africa's position in the emerging global
village in terms of economic, political, defense and security
issues.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Slovenia Agree to Cooperate in Joining EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Slovenia agreed on
Monday to cooperate in their efforts to win the membership of the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"We have decided ... to cooperate closely, exchange experience
and information, and join forces to achieve this common goal,"
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said after a meeting
with visiting Slovenian Foreign Minister Boris Frlec.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides hailed Slovenia as a new modern state on the basis
of the western European model, preparing itself for a free market
economy.
</P>
<P>
He termed the two countries as having "common objectives."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, Slovenia and four other countries started accession
talks with the EU in March.
</P>
<P>
Frlec said that his visit covers bilateral and multilateral
issues.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that since both countries share the values and
objectives, "it would be non-practical if we did not cooperate
closely."
</P>
<P>
"We (have) decided to intensify political contacts in the
future to help each other, and in this respect, Slovenia will
always support Cyprus: one country to join the EU," Frlec said.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian official met with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides early Monday. During the meeting, Clerides briefed Frlec
on the latest developments of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Frlec said that Slovenia, currently a non-permanent member of
the United Nations Security Council, is willing to help solve the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island to protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities after a failed
coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The world community is making efforts to help reunify the
island under a U.N.-sponsored bizonal and bicommunal formula. But
so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
During Frlec's visit, the two countries signed an agreement on
mutual exemption of visas.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Dismisses His Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday
surprisingly announced the dismissal of his spokesman, Peter
Hausmann, in a move which German media said was apparently
intended to improve his government's public relation management in
the runup to the September general elections.
</P>
<P>
Hausmann would be replaced by Otto Hauser, a parliament member
of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Kohl said in a
statement on Monday without giving any explanation.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Kohl also named a former
editor-in-chief of the German mass-circulation newspaper Bild
Zeitung, as his election campaign adviser.
</P>
<P>
Hausmann, who had been in office as the government spokesman
since 1995, had never developed a comfortable relationship with
the media and appeared to be kept out of Kohl's inner circle, the
German news agency DPA said.
</P>
<P>
Oskar Lafontaine, leader the main opposition Social Democratic
party (SPD), meanwhile said that Hausmann's dismissal reflected
the "helplessness" of Kohl's government due to its major backstand
in opinion polls and would also offer little help to improve the
situation.

HANOI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A national no-smoking week began in
Vietnam on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that half of the people under 20 and 90 percent
of the people aged at 40-45 in Vietnam are smokers.
</P>
<P>
About 98,000 pneumonia patients and 99,000 acute bronchitis
patients are reported in Vietnam each year. The two diseases are
ranked as the second and third killer diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 30,000 people suffer from pulmonary
tuberculosis each year.
</P>
<P>
There are 21 cigarette factories operating in the country. They
produced 1,970 million packages in 1996, a per capita share of 518
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
This does not include the cigarettes illegally smuggled into
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has banned smoking in creches,
hospitals, meetings and other public places, and listed cigarettes
as goods subject to special sales tax.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Minister Describes Economy as Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou on Monday described Cyprus' economy as
"robust," with an average annual growth rate of 4 percent, higher
than that of the European Union (EU) average.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day conference to promote Cyprus' role as a
business and financial hub, Christodoulou said his country's per
capita gross domestic product (GDP) is 20,500 U.S. dollars in
terms of purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The figure issued by the World Bank's "World Development
Indicators 1998" puts Cyprus "in a higher position than seven of
the 15 EU member-states and in the 16th position worldwide," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for further liberalization of
Cyprus' economy, as full EU membership will inevitably also lead
to European Monetary Unit membership. The EU started accession
negotiations with Cyprus on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the conference on Cyprus in view of its EU
membership and the economic globalization, governor of the Cyprus
Central Bank, Afxentis Afxentiou, stressed the need for financial
adjustments on the island.
</P>
<P>
This adjustment process which aims at "deregulating and
modernizing Cyprus' institutional structure," will "not only align
our financial sector with the European Union norms, but also
enhance its competitiveness and efficiency," Afxentiou said.
</P>
<P>
This will undoubtedly greatly encourage the promotion of Cyprus
as a major regional and international center for business and
financial activities, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people from home and abroad participated in the
the conference, which opened here Monday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Coalition Foils No-Confidence Motions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli coalition government
foiled two no-confidence motions on Monday after its Knesset
(parliament) members boycotted the voting.
</P>
<P>
Coalition Knesset members said they did not participate in the
voting because the opposition has violated a tradition not to put
forward no-confidence motion when the prime minister is out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently visiting
China.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli laws, the opposition must have 61 votes to win a
no-confidence motion in the Knesset. But the coalition has 61
members in the 120-seat Knesset. The boycott of its Knesset
members has left no chance for the opposition to win the voting.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motions were presented respectively by the
Labor party, and the leftwing Meretz party and Hadash party.
</P>
<P>
The Labor party has blamed the government for the stalemate in
the peace process, and the Meretz party and Hadash party have
accused Netanyahu of failing to reach an agreement with the
Palestinians on troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The coalition has asked the opposition parties to postpone the
motions to next week when Netanyahu returns.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parties went ahead with the vote for the
reason that Netanyahu has never answered any no-confidence motions
in the past two years after he came to power.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Waters Opened to Foreign Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola has opened its waters to
three foreign petroleum corporations including Esso Exploration
and Production Angola Limited, of the United States, for deep-sea
oil tapping.
</P>
<P>
A news communique issued by the Angola state petroleum company
revealed Monday that the No. 24 water area which newly opened to
foreign companies is 335 km south of the capital Luanda, and
covers 4,778 square kilometers, with a depth of 488 to 1,798
meters.
</P>
<P>
Angola state petroleum company will have 20 percent of right
to the area's exploitation, Esso enjoys 50 percent, whereas the
other two companies have 15 percent each, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Angola state petroleum company is negotiating with
the other three partners on the allocation percentage of oil to
be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Angola has rich oil reserves in its waters which
has drawn the attention of many world renowned petroleum
companies.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, foreign companies have
discovered three off-shore oil fields in the waters near Luanda.
One of them discovered by Esso has already started production
with 6,800 barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
Another oil field tapped by Esso in the same area now yields
10,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Elf Exploration Angola, a French oil company's subsidiary, has
tapped an oil field 200 km northwest of Luanda, which now
produces 12,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
In addition to off-shore petroleum, Angola is now undertaking
research on on-shore oil exploitation. Angola state petroleum
company will join hands with foreign oil corporations which have
won public tender to work toward this goal.

TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Syria signed two agreements
here Monday to beef up their mining cooperation, Iran's official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The first accord was on cooperation in developing Syria's

Iranian Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq Jahangiri, who was

and Syria can serve as a model for the Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
Syria is located on the forefront against Israel and the Muslim
states should develop economic cooperation with it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement was on conducting joint studies in the field
of geochemistry and geophysics, and drawing up geological maps.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's record high unemployment has
costed the country 166 billion marks (93 billion U.S. dollars) in
1997, the highest level since the 1990 German reunification, a
government job market research institute said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Institute for Job Market and Occupation
Research, about 55 percent of the unemployment costs resulted from
direct payments by the government to the country's 4.4 million
jobless people last year and about 45 percent were due to lost tax
revenues and social contributions.
</P>
<P>
On average, every jobless in Germany could get 21,000 mark
(about 12,000 dollars) in government help last year, the institute

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Court Throws out Case Against Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Federal High Court of Nigeria
Monday dismissed the suit by lawyer Gani Fawehinmi against the
adoption of the head of state, General Sani Abacha, as a
consensus candidate for the August 1 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ruling on the preliminary objection by the federal government
to the court's jurisdiction in the matter, Chief Judge Justice
Babatunde Belgore said the court had no powers to entertain the
case.
</P>
<P>
Belgore explained that the court could not entertain the
matter unless it involved the administrative or executive
functions of the government or actions performed by the
government or any of its agencies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Abacha, who was listed as the first defendant in
the case, "is not the federal government but an individual."
</P>
<P>
"Abacha is not the federal government, although he is the
head, but he is not the whole and there is no evidence to show
that he performed any executive or administrative role in the
adoption, which was only the parties' affair," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the five political parties, which were listed as
the second to the sixth respondents, were not agents of the
federal government but corporate entities which could sue or be
sued in their independent capacities.
</P>
<P>
Belgore also said that the seventh defendant, the National
Electoral Committee of Nigeria (NICON), was a corporate entity
like the political parties.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the eighth defendant, the Attorney-General of
the Federation, "is definitely an agent of the the federal
government," adding "there was no allegation against him."
</P>
<P>
Fawehinmi filed the case early this month, seeking the court
to declare illegal the adoption of Abacha's consensus candidacy
by the five parties last month.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese FM Says Ties With Kuwait to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister said
here Monday that he is optimistic about his country's once-sourced
ties with Kuwait in the future.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Osman Ismail, on the last day of his three-day visit,
said his country is keen on overcoming the period of alienation
caused by the deep wound left by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We are certain that the Kuwaiti leadership ... would respond
positively to what would boost the sought Arab solidarity and with
our sincere efforts to overcome the period of alienation," the
Kuwaiti News Agency quoted Ismail as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is Ismail's second visit to Kuwait in less than a year.
During his previous visit in July, he expressed Khartoum's wish to
normalize relations with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations soured after the Gulf War in 1991
during which Sudan sided with Iraq. Kuwait is represented in
Sudan by a Charge D'Affaires while Sudanese Embassy in Kuwait has
been closed for more than six years.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is normalizing ties with what it described as "enemy
countries" including Sudan, Yemen, Jordan and the Palestinian
National Authority which supported Iraq during the Gulf War that
liberated Kuwait from the seven-month Iraqi occupation.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Urged to Tell Truths About Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada skims off the best and
brightest people from the developing world without cautioning them
about the hard realities immigrants might face here, reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government has an obligation to tell would-be immigrants
about the difficulties they might encounter once they are in
Canada, according to community leaders.
</P>
<P>
It's easy for highly skilled doctors, engineers and scientists
to immigrate, "but very difficult for them to find jobs in their
respective areas," said G. Nabi Chaudhary, president of the
National Federation of Pakistani Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"Some people sell everything to come to Canada, and they should
be given some prospects beforehand of what they could be facing,"
Chaudhary was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
For many newcomers unfamiliar with the cost of living or the
realities of the job market in Canada, the consequences of
immigrating here have been grim.
</P>
<P>
Savings are quickly depleted and people find that they can't
break into the Canadian market without extensive retraining. "I
personally know people with PhDs working as security guards," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If they had been properly counseled and cautioned, these
people might have thought twice about coming, or come first to
explore job opportunities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Baljinder Gill, president of the National Association of
Canadians of Origins in India, noted that many immigrants from
India "don't know what they are getting into."
</P>
<P>
The problem is especially severe among immigrants from Eastern
Europe, said Aris Babikian, president of the Armenian National
Federation of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Babikian suggested that Canada's oversea embassy staff be
trained so that a person applying to come to Canada gets the whole
picture.

KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is facing a deficit of up
to 133,171 telephone lines across the country, a study by the
Geneva-based International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has
said.
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the Ugandan government, showed that
there is a demand of 184,000 fixed lines while only 51,829 lines
have so far been installed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will need some 380,000 lines by the year 2006 and the
demand can be satisfied only if the line service grows by 25
percent each year, the Nairobi-based East African weekly
newspaper Monday quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is among the countries with the lowest telephone
service penetration in the world although it has recorded an
annual economic growth rate of seven percent over the past years,
the highest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The low telephone density has been severely criticized by
foreign investors here as affecting the performance of their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
To satisfy a growing demand for telephone lines, the
government, among other measures, liberalized the
telecommunication sector.
</P>
<P>
A South African telecommunications company was licensed in
Uganda last month to compete with the Uganda Telecommunications
Limited, the sole provider of telephone service in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The newcomer plans to install 98,000 telephone lines in the
next five years, bringing the total number of lines in the
country up to more than 150,000.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Claims No Precondition for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash stated Monday that Turkish Cypriots have not put forward
any preconditions for resuming stalled Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in northern Cyprus, Denktash
called it a reality that there are two equal states respectively
ruled by Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities on the divided
island.
</P>
<P>
Such a demand by the Turkish Cypriot side can not be called by
Greek Cypriot side a precondition for the negotiations, Denktash
quoted by Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over northern Cyprus in a response to an abortive
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally established in 1983 the so-called
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was recognized only
by Turkey, a staunch supporter of Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus exists and this has
been emphasized by Turkey and us. If the Greek Cypriot side wishes
to reunite Cyprus, then we can hold negotiations with them upon
the principle of two states," said Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that the Cypriot government's plan to
deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles in the south has caused great
troubles for restarting peace talks between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader also criticized the Cypriot
government for starting membership negotiations with the European
Union last March, saying that it has no right to represent Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
With regard to his Tuesday meeting in northern Cyprus with
U.S. State Department Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas
Miller, Denktash said that he will reiterate Turkish Cypriots'
stance on this problem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. presidential emissary Richard Holbrooke failed to bring
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash to the conference
table despite his three-day diplomatic efforts on the island.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, spokesman with the U.S. State Department, had
said that the Turkish side should be held responsible for the
failure of the resumption of the stalled Cyprus peace talks.
However, Turkey and Turkish Cypriots denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have made
energetic efforts for the reunification of Cyprus but this aim
has not been achieved due to serious differences of the two rival
communities.
</P>
<P>
At present, Greece and Turkey, respective supporters of Greek
and Turkish Cypriots, both station massive troops on the small
eastern Mediterranean island.

</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kazakhstan
signed an agreement on economic cooperation here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the UAE will increase investments in oil,
mining, agriculture, industry and other sectors in Kazakhstan, a
Central Asian country which has opened 80 percent of the
state-owned enterprises to foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The UAE will employ more Kazakh workers and a joint committee
will be set up to supervise the implementation of the agreement.

Dubai's imports of perfumes and cosmetics rose from 21,000
tonnes worth 464 million dirhams (126.43 million dollars) in 1991
to 30,600 tonnes worth 916 million dirhams (249.59 million
dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
That is a 46 percent increase in weight and 98 percent increase
in value over the five years.
</P>
<P>
France is the largest exporter of perfumes and cosmetics to
Dubai. It is followed by Britain and the United States.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Road Network Vital to Regional Links: E. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- East African leaders have
reached a consensus that a sound road network is crucial to
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international conference which opened in north
Tanzania's Arusha Monday, Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi said
east Africa is giving top priority to the development of a
reliable regional road network, which is vital for tightening
economic links of countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the newly formed East African
Cooperation (EAC) secretariat linking Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania,
and co-sponsored by the European Union and the World Bank, is
focusing on seeking financial assistance from international
donors to come up with a 4.2 billion U.S. Dollars plan to repair
and restore roads in the region.
</P>
<P>
EAC said in a statement that the regional network is critical
to the facilitation of regional integration. It involves five
major road corridors with their feeder links -- in all 6,605 km
of paved roads and 8,688 km of unpaved roads.
</P>
<P>
East African leaders say heavy rains blamed on the El Nino
weather phenomenon from late 1997 to January this year have
heavily damaged their already neglected roads. The cost of repair
is huge, threatening economic development.
</P>
<P>
Moi said road development will enhance trade and investment
within the region, as well as improve the competitiveness of the
products of the EAC members in the international market,
according to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to road, the three east African governments will
also work seriously to develop telecommunications, information,
technology, port facilities and power in the region, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged private investors to participate in the
development of the infrastructure in the region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Tanzanian President Mkapa said absence of a
sound regional infrastructure will only make EAC a dream.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the road network will also facilitate the
integration of east Africa market with that of other neighboring
countries and economic groupings such as Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also urged the three partner states to develop economic
infrastructure and services, including roads and railways,
maritime and inland water transport, posts and
telecommunications, as well as energy and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni appealed for urgent
integration of the roads network of the three countries. He said
the EAC goal of setting up a common market cannot be attained
without good roads, because poor roads are a barrier to trade.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also said the three east African countries, which
have a population of about 80 million, are an important area for
investors.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president challenged the EAC to build a modern
railway transport system with speedy trains using electric power.
</P>
<P>
Moi and Yoweri left for their countries respectively Monday.
The conference, attended by 130 delegates, will end Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said Monday he is not worried that using U.S. Secret
Service will jeopardize his privacy.
</P>
<P>
Chretien dismissed a report in Newsweek magazine, which
suggested his office had expressed privacy concerns to the Secret
Service over the possibility that security agents might be forced
to testify in court.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problem with that with any country in the
world," Chretien said. "I take whatever security that they give to
me."
</P>
<P>
Chretien denied that he nor his aides have made any complaints
to Secret Service director Lewis Merletti.
</P>
<P>
An affidavit Merletti filed in special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair said
unsolicited concerns about privacy had been raised by a foreign
leader.
</P>
<P>
He would not identify the leader except to say that he is the
"head of a G-7 country," referring to the Group of Seven
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Newsweek identified Chretien as the leader and said a top aide
to Chretien had relayed the concerns to Merletti in January.

BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Monday he did not expect that Turkey would be admitted into
the European Union "in foreseeable future".
</P>
<P>
"The decisive factors are not the cultural ones, but the human
rights situation, the conflict with the Kurds, the country's
economic problems and its relations with Greece," said Kinkel at a
conference on the subject of "Islam and Europe" in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Despite the EU membership dispute with Turkey, Kinkel stressed
Germany wanted to strengthen relations with the country in all
areas.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Turkey and EU have been soured after EU
leaders decided last December not to accept Turkey as an official
new member candidate, though they did not rule out its candidacy
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has blamed German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for blocking Turkey's entry into the EU due
to its Islamic background.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Celebrates Sphinx's 4,600th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's renowned recumbent beast-man
giant, the Sphinx, looked anew and stood glistening as a gala was
staged Monday night to mark its 4,600th birthday and completion of
a 10-year plastic surgery that cost 2.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) chief
Fedrico Mayor were the leading guests among international
luminaries at the feet of the Sphinx on the Pyramids plateau, west
of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Known as the world's most famous invalid, the Sphinx, 20 meters
tall and 57 meters long, was sculpted during the Fourth Dynasty
(2620-2500 BC) and often described as an ancient symbol of mystery.
</P>
<P>
Time and nature have taken their toll on the monument, which
represents King Khafre and shows him with a lion's body and a
pharaoh's head, facing eastward and guarding the Giza necropolis.
</P>
<P>
Termed by officials as "100 percent Egyptian," the latest round
of repairs was carried out by the Supreme Council of Antiquities
(SCA), with the participation of several UNESCO archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Mission Impossible was assigned to a team of
archaeologists, restorers and sculptors in 1988, in order to
restore the Sphinx to its former glory using 12,478 stones.
</P>
<P>
The statue had lost its royal headdress bearing a cobra and its
false beard, a sign of virility among the pharaohs and gods. Its
limestone structure has been severely damaged by acid rain,
erosion and elements of nature, and a large chunk of the shoulder
fell off in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Previous attempts at restoration dating back to the 18th
Dynasty (1400 BC), in which faulty techniques and materials were
used, not only ended in fiasco but caused more damages.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's ceremony, the UNESCO chief was honored for his
contribution to the restoration process. A 10-minute documentary
was then screened on the stages of repair work done on the
beast-man relic of ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Two Egyptian artists and a foreman of the project were the
others that were rewarded for their work. It was the first time
that sculptors were included in restoration work on the Sphinx.
</P>
<P>
A mock priest clad in Pharaonic garments, assisted by 30
soldiers also in white Pharaonic battle gear, then removed a white
Pharaonic star-spangled curtain draping the statue.
</P>
<P>
There came the renovated Sphinx, free from wooden scaffoldings,
looking deep into the endless desert under the starlit sky.
</P>
<P>
The repairs, mostly done on the left side, the chest and the
neck, have been completed. However controversy over restoration
techniques lingers on.
</P>
<P>
An Italian Egyptologist recently suggested that the base of the
Sphinx be sawn off so that glass chips can be inserted underneath
the statue to protect it against subterranean water.
</P>
<P>
But Gaballah Ali Gaballah, SCA secretary-general, refused even
to weigh the idea, declaring that a monument such as the Sphinx
was not to be experimented with.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the results of the restoration work as "a major
achievement which will make the Sphinx survive for thousands of
years."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of tourism and culture dignitaries from around the
world as well as foreign diplomats in Cairo took part in the
celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Welfare Hiring on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- As the economy booms and welfare
changes take hold, most of the large companies in the United
States have no program in place to hire people off the rolls, and
many of the existing programs are quite modest, according to an
Associated Press survey.
</P>
<P>
However, three times as many firms have programs today than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the nation's 100 largest companies, 34 say they have
welfare-to-work programs. Thirteen say they are planning programs.
The rest have no plans, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The interest is up from last year, when just eight companies
had programs and 16 were considering them.
</P>
<P>
"A year ago we were just an idea. In fact there was some
skepticism this idea was going to translate into reality," said
Eli Segal, president of the Welfare to Work Partnership, inspired
by President Bill Clinton to prod the private sector into hiring
recipients. It now has 5,000 member companies, each committed to
hiring at least one person.
</P>
<P>
A partnership survey shows that in the last year, 135,000
welfare recipients have been hired by U.S. companies, many of them
small companies. Seventy percent have health benefits and 70
percent are full-time. About 3.6 million adults were on welfare as
of last September, down from nearly 5 million at the time Clinton
took office, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the president has regularly called on the
private sector to hire those on welfare.
</P>
<P>
While the welfare rolls have dropped across the country, no one
knows for sure where people have landed. Many fear the fate of the
poor when economic times turn bad.
</P>
<P>
Corporate hiring offers the hope that people will find good
jobs during good times -- learning skills and developing good
habits -- and fare better if the economy turns sour.
</P>
<P>
But the AP survey found even many companies with programs have
started slowly.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on telephone interviews with every company,
also found:
</P>
<P>
-- Large companies are slightly more likely to participate in
welfare hiring programs;
</P>
<P>
-- Many firms without programs say they need high-tech
expertise not found in the typical welfare recipient;
</P>
<P>
-- Last year, 16 companies told the AP they planned programs.
Half of them have programs today. Five have nothing. Three still
plan them;
</P>
<P>
-- Most companies rely on third parties to prepare welfare
recipients for work. Programs range from two-week job readiness
classes to longer training for specific skills;
</P>
<P>
-- Several companies join with government agencies to solve
problems that welfare recipients often face.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Runs Into Controversy During Israeli Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich enraged the Palestinians and triggered an open quarrel
with them Monday by touring some of the sensitive spots concerning
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, Gingrich took a
bus in the morning to tour the holy city, whose status is one of
the most important issues in the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Matching his remarks that Israel should have full sovereignty
over the city, he visited the controversial site of Har Homa in
East Jerusalem, where Israel began to build a Jewish settlement
over a year ago and thus help block the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the U.S. administration, the speaker had
announced before he arrived in Israel last Saturday that he would
cancel a plan to visit the site of the proposed U.S. embassy in
Jerusalem. In a way to balance his attitude and the
U.S. government request, he peeped from windows while his bus was
passing by the site.
</P>
<P>
In a much clearer show of his stance in the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, he toured the West Bank on late
Monday afternoon. This time he was accompanied by Israeli National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, the leading hawk in the
Israeli coalition government who opposed to any further
redeployment in the West Bank larger than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eager to enlist support of the influential Jewish community in
the U.S. for what some people say his bid to run for the next
presidency in the year 2000, Gingrich had no intention to hide his
pro-Israel bias.
</P>
<P>
Siding with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he has
openly accused the U.S. government of pressuring Israel on the
further redeployment and repeated his views during the visit that
the security needs of Israel can only be defined by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has urged Gingrich to
show restraint during his visit to Israel and avoid provocative
actions. On his part, however, Gingrich saw the moderate appeals
as a threat from the Palestinians, saying they were "deliberate
and systematic provocations which...were despicable" and "should be
condemned.
</P>
<P>
Enraged by Gingrich's remarks and actions, the PNA threatened
Monday to cancel his scheduled meeting Wednesday with PNA
President Yasser Arafat. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
said Gingrich is "absolutely ignorant." "It seems to me that
Mr. Gingrich doesn't know ABC of the region, the people and the
conflict," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Confident in Attaining Goals: CPPCC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said here Monday that China is fully confident
in attaining its goals of economic development.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the French employers' association CNPF, Li said
that over the past 20 years, the Chinese people have made great
achievements in economic construction and other fields under the
guidance of the theory of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has also made great achievements in opening
to the outside world, as is shown by a rapid growth in foreign
trade, an expansion of the use of foreign capital, an ever
improving investment environment, and a gradual opening of the
country's financial market.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman said that China is completing its Ninth
Five-Year Plan and is trying to attain the plans of economic
construction designed for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident about achieving these goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in its process of modernization, China needs to
develop more foreign economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to the policy of reform and opening to the
world, and will move toward the outside world with a more active
posture," he said.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Church Explosion Caused by Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The explosion that injured 33
worshippers at a church at Danville, eastern Illinois, Sunday was
caused by a bomb and it was the second attack on a church in
Vermilion County within six months, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A bomb killed a volunteer on December 30 at a church in
Oakwood, another east-central Illinois town about 16 kilometers
west of Danville.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were working to determine if there was any
connection between the two explosions in Vermilion County.
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) said
Monday that the next step for the investigators was to determine
who did the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The ATF laboratory in Rockville, Maryland, will examine the
Danville explosives for any resemblance to the Oakwood bomb and
others throughout the country, special agent Jerry Singer was
quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was placed outside the church between the wall and a
free-standing air conditioning unit and exploded during
worshipping.
</P>
<P>
Only six to eight teens were sitting near the blast Sunday,
fewer than normal because of the holiday weekend. Two girls were
in serious but stable condition Monday with head lacerations at a
hospital in Urbana. Four were in fair condition in a Danville
hospital, the news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Carrier Cut will not Weaken U.S. Firepower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Monday that U.S. firepower in the Gulf would not be
reduced because of one of two U.S. aircraft carriers withdrawn
from the region.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a very vigorous presence there, somewhere
between 17 and 20 thousand troops" Cohen told NBC's "Today"
program this morning. "There's a great deal of firepower
remaining and a lot of prepositioned equipment and the ability
to augment the size of that force within about 48 hours."
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Independent and its battle group went
through the Strait of Hormuz early on Sunday, heading toward its
home port in Japan in a regularly scheduled ship rotation.
Another carrier, the Stennis, remains in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who made the interview From Santiago, Chile, said U.S.
forces in the region "give us great capability, so Saddam
Hussein should not take any comfort. In fact, all of our allies
are really on board with trying to have a vigorous and viable
force in the region which can be quickly expanded."
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Eisenhower, scheduled to leave U.S. East
Coast for the Mediterranean next month, also could be sent to
the Gulf if the situation with Iraq heats up and another carrier
is required, the Pentagon has said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has maintained two carriers in the Gulf
since last November to bolster threats of a possible U.S.
military strike on Iraq if Iraq refuses full access to U.N.
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, refused to let the
United States mount air strikes from bases on their territory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forces Training Troops in Colombia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Forces troops have
been conducting extensive training exercises with Colombian
soldiers fighting drug traffickers and guerrillas, a U.S.
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The training was conducted under a program that avoids
restrictions imposed on military aid to Colombia by the Clinton
administration, The Washington Post said.
</P>
<P>
While not forbidden, the training involving hundreds of
American troops each year has allowed the U.S. military to play a
more direct and autonomous role in Colombia than officials
publicly have indicated, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The story in Monday's editions said the training was authorized
under a 1991 law, known as JCET (Joint Combined Exchange Training)
that permits U.S. Special Forces to train on foreign soil if the
training is designed primarily to benefit the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
"We consider JCET an important program because it allows us to
train in different areas of the world and to learn how other
militaries operate," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It also allows us to learn important skills. We did this under
the terms of the law. It was totally legal and reported to
Congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been sensitive enough that few in Congress are
aware of it and the exercises have been suspended this month as
Colombia holds presidential elections, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The same program was invoked for U.S. troops to conduct 41
training exercises with Indonesia over the past seven years even
though many members of Congress believed they had curtailed
military ties with that country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesia program was suspended two weeks ago because of
turmoil in the country.

BUCHAREST, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chief of the Romanian Army's
General Staff Gen. Constantin Degeratu and his Bulgarian
counterpart Col. Gen. Miho Dimitar Mihov discussed here on Monday
the bilateral military cooperation and partnership for peace.
</P>
<P>
Mihov said in a statement after the talks that they appreciated
the actions taken by the two armies to integrate with the European
and Euro-Atlantic security structures, and to create a climate of
stability and peace in the Balkan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, the defensive character of the defense policy
pursued by the two countries gives once again the guarantee of
full integration of those with the Peace-keeping Multinational
Forces in the South-East of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Degeratu said that the meeting allowed the two General Staff
chiefs to make a swap of information on the stage of reform,

states.

<HEADLINE> Ranking IRS Official Investigated for Travel Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The No. 2 official at the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States, who last fall
apologized to senators for abuses at his agency, recently was
investigated for a 12,000-dollar advance for moving expenses that
he hadn't fully accounted for, according to documents and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
IRS deputy commissioner Michael Dolan said he cooperated with
the Treasury Department inspector general's probe and provided
receipts to verify he spent more on moving expenses than the
12,000-dollar advance he received more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The IRS does not require its employees to immediately account
for moving advances, giving them six years to do so.
</P>
<P>
Dolan said he had filed a report accounting for some of the
advances years ago, and now accounted for all of them.
</P>
<P>
Now congressional investigators want to know whether the Dolan
inquiry may have been retaliatory or abusive.
</P>
<P>
News of the Dolan inquiry comes amid allegations that the IRS,
under fire for conducting armed raids on nonviolent taxpayers and
other questionable tactics, has not done enough to correct
employee misconduct and punish wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
In Senate hearings last month, Harry Patsalides, deputy
assistant inspector general for investigations at the Treasury
Department, said the IRS had been slow to take action against IRS
employees and meted out weak punishments in some cases.
</P>
<P>
A memo obtained by The Associated Press shows that last fall
Patsalides pressed an IRS agent to open an investigation of Dolan
and look into whether he avoided paying taxes on the advance.
</P>
<P>
Patsalides did not return two calls to his office seeking
comment, and Coleman declined comment, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Romania on Hungarian Elections Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Chamber of Deputies
and the ruling Christian Democratic National Peasant Party hope
the political changes in Hungary will not affect the relations
between Romania and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Ion Diaconescu, speaker of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies and
president of the National Peasant Party, made the statement at a
press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing opposition Federation of Young
Democrats-Hungarian Civic Party has won victory in a run-off
election Sunday against the ruling Socialist Party, according to
the national electoral committee of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The National Peasant Party considers no change is necessary in
Romania's policy regarding minorities because a center-right party
won the elections in Hungary, even though this party is known for
its exaggerations in backing the interests of the Hungarians who
live outside Hungary, said Ion Diaconescu.
</P>
<P>
Statistics data show that the Hungarians, the largest minority
in Romania, account for over 7 percent of the total population of
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance is clear: we fully observe provisions in
international documents concerning minorities and try to give a
positive answer to all the claims of the Hungarian Democratic
Union of Romania. All points of dispute will be solved. What we
need is patience," Ion Diaconescu stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The country and the people need
acceleration of economic reforms, improvement of the social
situation, order and stability, Moldovan President Petre Luchinsky
said in his regular weekly radio speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Moldovan news agency INTERLIK, the speech was
fully dedicated to the tasks of a new government, which last week
received a vote of confidence in parliament and swore to the head
of state.
</P>
<P>
Luchinsky said that after a long and difficult process of
forming the Cabinet of Ministers and its approval on the basis of
compromise between the ruling coalition Alliance for Democracy and
Reforms and Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc, the time has come to act
concretely.
</P>
<P>
The president said he expects that the government will assume
the maximum responsibility to put the interests of the state
higher than politics, will show the maximum professionalism and
will coordinate its work.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that the reforms and work on the whole
have been stopped lately. He emphasized the importance of
cooperation of a new government with the president of the country
and the parliamentary majority as well as a constructive dialogue
with the opposition and the whole society.

<P>
BRUSSELS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Argentina beat New Zealand 2-1 on
Monday to become the first women's team to secure a semi-final
berth at the current World Cup Field Hockey Tournament in Utrecht,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Argentines were later joined in the day by hosts the
Netherlands that blanked India with five goals.
</P>
<P>
The top two teams from the six-team round-robin preliminary
tourney enter the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the men's action, Spain was the day's surprise when it
downed World Cup holders Pakistan 2-1.
</P>
<P>
England got its first win after four rounds of play, beating
Poland 5-2.
</P>
<P>
The goals were scored by five different players in a game that
saw the Poles led for some time before the English turned the tide.
</P>
<P>
Jason Lee levelled the scoring for England before Russell
Garcia, Jon Wyatt, Mark Pearn and Calum Giles each scored once to
seal the game away.
</P>
<P>
Slawomir Lukaszewski grabbed a consolation for Poland later on
in the game.
</P>
<P>
The English women, however, suffered a 3-2 defeat at the hands
of Olympic silver medalists South Korea. Both teams ended the
first three rounds of the group prelimiaries with one win against
two defeats but the South Koreans perched higher on team standing
on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday will be a decisive day for Olympic and World Cup
winners Australia when it meets Germany in the women's group A
contest.
</P>
<P>
A win will send the Aussies through to the semi-finals whereas
a defeat will send their opponents through. But either way, the
Australians will qualify for the medal round since they have an
easy job to do in their last group outing facing up South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In other games of the day, the Australian men entertained
themselves with eight unanswered goals against the Malaysians.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia Monday freed two of its most celebrated prisoners
and citizens have been promised early parliamentary election in
the first sign of a bid by President B.J. Habibie to improve his
nation's tarnished international standing.
</P>
<P>
-- East Asia's troubled economies will recover their previous
strength, but New Zealand and Vietnam have all the right
ingredients to become the next victims of the current financial
crisis, a respected forecaster at the Australian National
University warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government Monday night withdrew its
redundancy offer of access to 157 million U.S. dollars to dock
workers after creditors of the workers' employer Patrick forced a
15-day delay on any decision on the future of the insolvent
Patrick company, whose attempts to fire all its unionized dock
workers last month attracted international attention.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian government would narrowly lose to the
Australian Labor party if an election were to be held now, and its
fortunes remain captive to deep uncertainty about the government's
yet-to-be-revealed goods and services tax.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's new leadership Monday bowed to pressure for
political reform, clearing the way for fresh elections, beginning
the dismantling of Soeharto family business interests and freeing
prominent political prisoners.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Severe Typhoons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's coastal areas, which
contribute about half of China's GDP, face a severe threat from
typhoons this year and their typhoon defences leave something to
be desired, according to Zhou Wenzhi, vice-minister of Water
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predict that five to seven typhoons will hit
China's coastal areas during a certain period of time this year,
but there are embankments on only 13,000 km of the 19,000-km
coastline, and only 44 percent of these are up to standard.
</P>
<P>
Last year, typhoons caused 30 billion yuan worth of damages to
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhou says that these areas have been building embankments
faster but that it is just not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
China built 933 km of standard embankments last year, the
largest number in any single year.
</P>
<P>
Chai Songyue, governor of Zhejiang province, says that they
will have their share of coastline protected by standard
embankments in three to four years.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, Zhejiang has been building embankments on
350 km of coastline and they are expected to be strong enough to
withstand the worst typhoons that occur every 50 years.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to import another 2 million tons of rice to increase
stocks, according to Minister of Food and Horticulture A. M.
Saefuddin.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the decision after formally taking over ministerial
duties from his predecessor here on Monday, Saefuddin said the
protracted drought, the impact of El Nino and other factors have
reduced rice production in the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that finding the solution for the food crisis in
society would become the focus of his ministry's attention. To
overcome the problems, he would improve the food distribution
system which had been damaged due to communication problems
resulting from recent fuel price hikes.
</P>
<P>
There would be a food crisis center to monitor the crisis,
Saefuddin was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesia has imported about 1 million tons of rice
from China, Vietnam and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Single Currency Proposed for Andean Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A banking association in
Colombia has proposed that a single currency be created within the
Andean Group, which would be similar to the European Union's euro,
Radio Cadena Nacional reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Institution and Banking Association of Colombia
(ASOBANCARIA) said the Andean Group, consisting of Colombia,
Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, "should follow the example
of the European Union, which united its currency when the euro was
created to broaden their financial horizons and reduce financing
costs."
</P>
<P>
The ASOBANCARIA said that with the absence of a single
currency, "it is required that compensation mechanisms are
established which permit the countries within the region to reduce
the costs of the regional trade produced by the difference between
the value of its currencies and the value of the currencies of the
nations trading with the group."
</P>
<P>
Although companies of the Andean countries are able to trade
with currencies of other member nations, the lack of compensatory
mechanisms makes this process highly risky and bears high
transaction costs, said the ASOBANCARIA.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that no integration system can be truly successful
without a currency unification or effective compensatory
mechanisms which eliminate the implicit transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Andean Group to learn from the European experience
to make sure commercial agreements are escorted by economic
policies and general commitments in order to stabilize the
regional economy.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Prostate Cancer Tests Cuts Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A massive study over eight years
provides the first evidence that prostate blood screening could
reduce deaths from prostate cancer by 69 percent, says the
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by researchers from Laval University in
Quebec, Canada, and presented recently at the annual scientific
meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology.
</P>
<P>
The researchers predicted that if men started testing at the
age of 50, when their risk of advanced disease is still small, it
could practically eliminate the development of prostate cancer
before it reaches the deadly spreading stage.
</P>
<P>
The test looks for elevated levels in the blood of
prostate-specific antigen or PSA, a protein that rises in prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study concludes that routine use of the PSA test could
prevent 27,000 of the 39,000 prostate cancer deaths in the United
States each year.

<HEADLINE> Three Cities Honored For Addition to Unesco List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A grand ceremony was held yesterday
to award certificates and plaques to the three Chinese cities
recently added to the Unesco World Heritage List, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Ancient City of Pingyao in Shanxi province, Lijiang Old
Town in Yunnan province, and Suzhou Classical Gardens in Jiangsu
province were added to the Heritage List in December 1997 during
the 21st Session of Unesco's World Heritage Committee.
</P>
<P>
First built in the Western Zhou Dynasty (1100-770 BC) and
rebuilt in 1370 in the Ming Dynasty, Pingyao has one of the
best-preserved city walls in China.
</P>
<P>
The town was also an important financial center during the Ming
and Qing Dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Lijiang Old Town is the seat of the Naxi Autonomous County
government in Yunnan Province. The town is known for the unique
traditions of the local people including Dongba culture, Naxi
ancient music and Baisha murals. The town is also known for its
construction which reflects the Naxi ethnic style with outside
influences.
</P>
<P>
While the above two sites pride themselves on their ancient
constructions, the Suzhou Classical Gardens are a typical example
of Chinese garden, achieving a sense of serenity by a unique
combination of art, nature and ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
Before this additions, 16 sites in China of cultural or natural
value had been placed on the list. They include the Great Wall,
the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes in
Gansu Province and the Potala Palace in Lhasa.

<HEADLINE> Loss of State Assets to be Prevented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese government official
has warned against random selling of equity shares by small
state-owned enterprises, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Shareholding is not a panacea for the myriad of smaller
firms," the paper quoted Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Smaller firms account for 99 percent of China's registered
firms and employ 75 percent of the nation's workers. Of the 8.5
million smaller industrial firms, 75,000 are state-owned.
</P>
<P>
"The most worrying aspect is that smaller firms will not really
be weaned away from government connections in the current
corporate reform," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, "shareholders" get dividends if profits are
good, but turn to the government for help if things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
In other words, firms involved in the reform are still a long
way from standing on their own feet as required by a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We should not blindly follow shareholding or joint-stock
partnerships. The key to the reform is to make all emplyees share
losses as well as profits. The iron rice bowl must be smashed,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Three principles must be observed in reforming smaller firms:
</P>
<P>
-- Publicly-owned assets in any firm must be preserved;
</P>
<P>
-- The gap between large and small shareholders should be kept
at a proper level, otherwise some people would feel as if they
were working for others;
</P>
<P>
-- A one-man-one-vote system should prevail rather than one
share one vote.
</P>
<P>
The state has decided to slant its support to larger
enterprises. But we are not adandoning the smaller ones, although
we must prevent the loss of state assets, chen said.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to selling the assets of smaller firms, the
government must consider how much fresh funding input and how many
jobs can be guaranteed after the sale.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against the random hiking of employees' wages
and welfare as most smaller firms have a high debt-asset ratio.

<HEADLINE> Rural Demand for Electrical Appliances Expected to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The demand for electrical
appliances in China's vast rural areas is expected to rise
dramatically this year as the market has entered the fast lane of
growth, according to a just-concluded survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the State Information Center,
projected that color TVs, washing machines and refrigerators would
be major consumer items in rural households this year.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge is attributable to improved living standards and
the availability of electrical power in the countryside as well as
lower prices of major electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
About three of every 10 rural households intend to buy TVs,
while 23.32 percent and 20 percent of rural families wish to
purchase washing machines and refrigerators, respectively. The
percentages are all higher than in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 30 percent of rural Chinese households have
color TVs, while the ratios for refrigerators and washing machines
stand at 10 and 25 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Global Tropical Fruits Exports Increase in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The world's exports of tropical
fruits in 1997 registered an 11-percent increase to about 2
million tons, an on-going seminar on tropical fruits organized by
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar being held in Thailand's coastal
resort of Pattaya said the export value of fresh tropical fruits
in 1997 exceeded 1.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 56 million tons of tropical fruits
were produced in 1997, which consist of 40 percent of mangoes, 23
percent pineapple, 9 percent papayas, 4 percent avocados and 24
percent of other tropical fruits, such as lychee, rambutan and
durian.
</P>
<P>
The seminar said more than 95 percent of the world production
and exports of tropical fruits originate in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, developed countries account for about 80 percent of
the world's imports of fresh tropical fruits.
</P>
<P>
T.C. Ti, senior marketing and trade economist from the FAO
Bangkok office said at the seminar that Europe will remain the
largest regional market for tropical fruits with France being the
largest importing country.
</P>
<P>
North America is the second largest market and Japan, Singapore
and Hong Kong are also main importers of fresh tropical fruits, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, known as the first session of the FAO sub-group on
tropical fruits, opened on Monday and ends on Thursday.
Seventy-five delegates from 33 member countries and 21 observers
are participating in the session.
</P>
<P>
The delegates are expected to assess the current market
situation and short-term outlook, which will help governments and
market operators make investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss sanitary and phytosanitary measures and
technical developments in fresh fruits shipments.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Telephone Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's telephone companies are
exploring new markets by providing more services for customers.
</P>
<P>
A China Telecom official said that in July his company will
open free call services in all provincial capitals except Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He said that new value-added services such as telephone cards,
mass calling, virtual private network (VPN), universal personal
telecommunications (UPT) and vote on telephone (VOT) are fledging
markets in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Telecom saw the number of its customers multiply since
it opened the 800 free call service at the end of 1995. During the
first three months of this year, the company signed up as many
free-call users as it did in all of 1997. It expects to increase
the number of its free-call users by 400-to-500 this year.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises, private businesses, government
institutions and media are major subscribers of the free-call
service.
</P>
<P>
Sources from China Telecom said that revenue from these new
value-added telephone services is still a negligible part of the
company's total earnings.
</P>
<P>
Though China has had almost every kind of telephone service
that the United States has at present, these services are still in
the early stage of an expanding market.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications experts said that a major obstacle for
market expansion of these services is the consumers' concept.
</P>
<P>
When the 800 free-call service was first introduced into the
cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in 1995, more than 90
percent of the subscribers were foreign companies operating in
China. By the end of this April, local subscribers had accounted
for more than 60 percent of the users.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom has already extended its computer-controlled
intelligent telephone network to all county-level cities in the
country, enabling it to provide dozens of new services for
customers.

BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Five Lebanese have been wounded in
south Lebanon in clashes between guerrillas and Israeli forces
since late Monday night, Lebanon's Voice of the People radio
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Israeli allied South Lebanese Army (SLA) was
wounded by a roadside bomb blast early Tuesday when he and some
other militiamen passed by a road in the predominantly Christian
town of Jezzine in the central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Four Lebanese civilians were wounded late Monday night in an
Israeli shelling at the village of Mashgara and its surrounding
areas in the western part of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came in a retaliation for an earlier
Hezbollah military offensive against its posts inside the Israeli
security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer zone in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its northern areas from Lebanese
guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in a bid to drive the
2,000 Israeli forces and its ally SLA militiamen out of south
Lebanon.

NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
expressed here Tuesday his thanks for China's Xinhua News
Agency's contributions to the fair and just coverage of Kenya
over the years.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Guo Chaoren, President of Xinhua News

</P>
<P>
Moi also criticized some western media which have been
bossing around interfering with the internal affairs of African
countries including Kenya, saying "it reminds me of the colonial
times."
</P>
<P>
He noted that while the world is facing problems regarding
population control, environment protection and unbalanced
development, Kenya has its own difficulties in developing its
ecomony, which needs a positive coverage by the media.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has rich economic resources, but it lacks the means to
develop them. He believed that with the assistance of
well-wishing countries, Kenya will soon catch up with the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president also showed his appreciation over
Xinhua's donation of computers and other communications
facilities as well as photograpic equipment to Kenya News Ageny,
saying he is happy with the constructive cooperation between
Xinhua and the Kenyan media and hoped such cooperation would be
further enhanced.

<HEADLINE> China's Mainland To Accept Civil Judgments by Taiwan Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court
today issued regulations on the acceptance of civil judgments
granted by courts in Taiwan. The regulations are effective today.
</P>
<P>
Tang Dehua, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, told
a press conference here today that the regulations will also be
applicable to arbitration awards by relevant Taiwan institutions.
</P>
<P>
With applications from interested parties and confirmation by
the people's courts in the mainland, civil judgments and
arbitration awards made in Taiwan will have the same validity of
law in the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To accept civil judgments given by courts in Taiwan means that
persons concerned from both sides, especially civil interests of
our compatriots in Taiwan, will be put under legal protection
timely, fairly and effectively in the mainland," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, legal obligations in Taiwan can apply to
relevant people's courts in the mainland for enforcement.
</P>
<P>
However, Tang said, in certain situations the people's courts
will not accept civil judgments granted by courts in Taiwan, for
example, in a situation when the validity of the civil judgment is
not clear.
</P>
<P>
"The acceptance of civil judgments by courts in Taiwan should
be viewed as legal cooperation between Taiwan and other Chinese
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, which completely
differs from the mutual acceptance of judgments between
countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that conforming to the 'one China' principle is an
important pre-condition for accepting applications.
</P>
<P>
Such acceptance also doesn't mean the mainland accepts Taiwan's
legal system, nor does it mean giving up the legal administration
power over the Taiwan area, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1992, civil cases involving Taiwan
residents conducted by people's courts in the mainland areas of
China have been increased by 7 percent every year, and the figure
for economic disputes is 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Courts issued regulations on how to handle
cases involving Taiwan residents about marriage, debts and other
disputes in 1988.
</P>
<P>
At today's news conference, the Supreme People's Court official
also urged Taiwan to take a cooperative attitude to better protect
the interests of those concerned.

<TEXT>
<P>
China also understands all relevant parties' concern for their
security interests, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he hoped that the Israeli side would understand the
circumstances of the Palestinian side, adopt a flexible and
practical attitude and continue the peace talks in a bid to help
the stalled process out of its present difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as a positive act for Israel to accept U.N.
Resolution 425 to withdraw from south Lebanon, Zhu said China
wishes to see the unconditional implementation of this resolution
at an early date.
</P>
<P>
China would also like to see Israel restore talks with Syria

<P>
Only by doing this, Zhu continued, can the peace and stability
in this region be guaranteed in the long run.
</P>
<P>

peace process and the international community's efforts to break
the current peace deadlock, including the recent proposal by Egypt
and France for an international conference on the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that, at present, various countries in the world
are striving to develop themselves and the urgent requirement for
them to realize their prosperity and development is to have peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel knows that it has no other choice except peace, thus it
is joining all other relevant nations to work for peace, he said.

<P>
Netanyahu said he believed that the problems between Israel and
the Arab countries will eventually find a way of settlement and
his country will make every effort to this end.

Israel has high praise for China's role in promoting the Middle
East peace process, Netanyahu said, adding that he hoped China
would play an even greater role in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Night Snack Street in Xi'an Feeds Tourist Hordes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- When night falls, the snack market on
Dongxin Street of the ancient capital of Xi'an begins bustling.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of fatigue, Chinese and foreign tourists who have
visited the world-renowned archeological site of terra cotta
soldiers during the day, swarm to the Dongxin Street night market
to have a taste of delicacies that have been talked about so much.
</P>
<P>
Visitors can choose among more than 120 varieties of snacks
from different localities in China.
</P>
<P>
Since its opening in 1985, the 1-kilometer-long food street has
grown to 200 stalls, with half selling Muslim snacks.
</P>
<P>
Open from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m., the market attracts an average of
10,000 hungry tourists every day. Ma Weiyun, who runs a stall
selling steamed stuffed buns, said that her shop feeds as many as
1,000 clients daily.
</P>
<P>
To protect her family-run business which has been going on for
five generations, Ma has registered the name of the shop --
"Fushunzhai" -- as a trademark.
</P>
<P>
The market also draws folk artists to display their talent and
makes some money. Spending 3-to-5 yuan (8.3 yuan equals 1
U.S. dollar), the guest can get a folk or a pop singer to perform
a favorite song. "Most of the artists are actually from the
countryside," said Wang Huimin, a Xi'an resident. "Their
performance is full of local flavor."
</P>
<P>
Since the market is a major tourist attraction, its management
has been a concern to Xi'an authorities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, money has been spent on paving the road,
making illuminated signboards and building a dinner-ware
sterilizing center.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the business volume of the market reached 16.52
million yuan (1.99 million U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese soldiers in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have cleared another 8 million square
meters of ground in 31 minefields along the Sino-Vietnamese border
in its first six-month, dry-season work of the second operation.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Daxiong, deputy commander of the Guangxi Military Area
Command, said today that one soldier died and two others were
injured in the operation during which 63,800 mines of more than 20
kinds have been removed or exploded.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops handed over another 1 million square meters
of land, which can now be used peacefully, to local governments.
</P>
<P>
The operation started Nov. 28. The first began in 1993 after
China and Vietnam restored relations.
</P>
<P>
The military official said that, as of June, the troops will
start their rainy-season operation. By the end of this year, a
total of 56 minefields of 10 million square meters is expected to
be cleared.
</P>
<P>
The mine-sweeping operation has rejuvenated border trade
between the two countries, statistics show. At the state-level
port in Longzhou County, the daily trade volume has gone up from
60,000 yuan (7,200 U.S. dollars) before the ongoing operation to
more than 130,000 yuan (15,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 million square meters of minefields will be
cleared during the ongoing operation that is scheduled to be
completed by the end of 1999, officials said.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Heavily-armed gunmen raided a
police station in Kenya's Indian Ocean port city Mombasa Monday,
killed one, wounded two, released 42 remand prisoners and fled
with two guns.
</P>
<P>
The two police officers who were going to report for duty were
shot by the raiders in jungle uniform and seriously wounded in
front of the Changamwe Police Station at about 5:00 a.m Monday,
press here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The raiders later shot dead a security guard at the Kenya Oil
Refinery gate while he was fleeing from the station.
</P>
<P>
Coast Provincial Police Officer Japhet Mwania said the
security personnel were pursuing the gunmen and combing the areas
around the station.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said at the beginning of the lightning attack,
some gunmen walked into the police station's reception and
ordered the police officer on duty to open door to the cell.
</P>
<P>
Before the officer realized what was going on, the gunmen
opened the fire and he had to dive into the cell to seek refuge
and evade the bullets.
</P>
<P>
As the gunmen in the reception continued firing and ordering
the suspects to get out, the officer who had taken refuge quickly
removed his uniform and also left the cell as one of the remand
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the gunmen might have gone to the station to
release some suspected robbers who were arrested by the police
over the weekend and were being detained there.

<HEADLINE> Modern Enterprise System Effective to State Sector's Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Pilot projects in the state sector
to adopt a modern enterprise system in northwest China's Gansu
Province have begun to yield results, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, by last year, 23 state-owned enterprises
had been transformed into companies closely following the standard
practices of a modern business system, with total assets growing
by 68 percent and more compared to three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 23 businesses have set up a system of state capital
investors, stating investors' responsibilities, rights and
interests as well as clarifying property rights.
</P>
<P>
Related enterprises made the most of the "legal person"
property rights to restructure interior assets and buy into other
firms in a bid to raise the awareness of raising capital.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Sanmao Woollen Group, for an example, acquired a
mill, and then took over another bankrupt wool factory to expand
its production capacity by more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 23 enterprises have cut 3.7 percentage points off their
asset-liability ratio on average. And they have also formed a
management structure of a shareholders' congress, a board of
directors, a board of supervisors and managers in an effort to
seek democratic and scientific decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises have relocated more than 10,000 workers by
developing diversified economies, new production projects and
launching retraining classes.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover China's Earliest Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists, geologists,
and historians have discovered a 736-kilometer road built
over 2,000 years ago during the reign of Qinshihuang, China's
first emperor.
</P>
<P>
One archaeologist, Lu Sixian, says that they made the discovery
during a map and topographical study in Inner Mongolia and
Shaanxi, which also showed that the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.) had
precise topographical maps, river maps, and instruments for
measuring slopes and straight lines.
</P>
<P>
Part of the road in the Mu Us Desert in Inner Mongolia is now
some 10 meters above the surrounding surface and looks like a dam.
</P>
<P>
Lu explains that this military communications project started
in 212 B.C. during Qinshihuang's tour of the northern part of
China and study of the defensive capacity of the Great Wall. The
project was finished in two and a half years by more than 100,000
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The road joined up with what are now Shaanxi and Gansu
provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and passed through
deserts and and crossed mountains and plateaus. Its width varies
from 9 to 50 meters. It was built with local soil.
</P>
<P>
Its headquarters were in modern-day Jingbian County in Shaanxi
Province and there were 16 imperial resorts along it.
</P>
<P>
History books make only a brief mention of it.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Denies Report on Restriction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi has denied reports that he had been banned from leaving
the country, the English-language daily Tehran Times reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"No such order was notified to me by the court," Karbaschi
told the daily, adding that "I do not have a plan to visit any
country."
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Qods reported on Monday that judiciary
authorities have banned Karbaschi from leaving Iran to attend a
conference on urban administration in Tokyo, which will start on
Tuesday. It said that the mayor was also to visit several other
countries after the four-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Karbaschi was detained on embezzlement
charges by the conservative judiciary, but was released after 12
days of detention when Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei stepped in to prevent an escalation of factional
struggle over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives and the coalition of the moderates and the
leftists lined up against each other following the victory of
President Mohammad Khatami in the presidential elections in May
last year, who gained strong support from Karbaschi and his
followers.
</P>
<P>
The moderates accused the conservatives, who still control the
country's important organs such as the Majlis or parliament, the
judiciary and armed forces, of undermining Khatami's government
and creating hurdles for the government.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives lashed out at the moderates for abusing
freedom proposed by Khatami and some commanders of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) even warned to crack down the
rival factions.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Threatened by Desertification: UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The problem of
desertification is threatening 17 million people in Tanzanian,
more than half of the country's population, a United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) officer has warned.
</P>
<P>
Areas to be mostly affected are the country's dry regions with
arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, which will lead to
increased poverty of local residents, UNDP officer Gemma Aliti,
was quoted by Tuesday's Daily News as saying.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper at a national forum for the setting up of
desertification and environment control fund in Dar es Salaam
Monday, Aliti said the threat was largely man-made and can be
easily contained through joint local and international
strategies.
</P>
<P>
She named some of the highly affected regions as, Dodoma,
Singida and Morogoro in central part of the country, Mwanza,
Shinyanga, Tabora and Mara in the lakes zone, Iringa, Mbeya in
the southern highlands, Arusha, Kilimanjaro in the north, and
Mtwara and Lindi in the south.
</P>
<P>
Aliti said that some of the factors contributing to the the
increase of desertification rate in the regions are poverty, lack
of land management policies, ineffective bylaws on environmental
matters, uncontrolled bush fires, among others.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicated that Tanzanian, which has 44
million hectares of forests, is losing between 300,000 and
400,000 hectares per year as a result of tree felling.
</P>
<P>
The existing laws on environment were formulated in 1950s and
therefore the penalties are too lenient.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State in the Vice President's Office, Bakari
Mbonde, said at the forum that the government is dedicated to
improving the environment in the country, saying the
environmental fund will be used by the target groups at grassroot
levels.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said with international support, national plans
to motivate villagers to curb the menace of deserts are underway.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin William Mkapa at a conference in
February said that the war against environmental destruction
should start from every household. He warned that people must
realize that their survival is depending on the nature.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Israeli Premiers Hold Talks in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China will, as always, join the
international community to make its due efforts and contribution
to promoting the Middle East peace process, Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In talks with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Zhu said the China-Israel cooperative ties have been
developing smoothly since establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to collaborate with Israel to further promote
bilateral relations on the basis of mutual benefit," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he has seen with his owns eyes the progress
China has made, and that he believes people of the whole world
would like to see China succeed in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped his ongoing visit would serve to further
advance relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two premiers had an extensive and
in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and regional and
international issues of shared interest.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Zhu said his government is
very concerned about the process and the situation in this region,
and is uneasy about the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
China deems that so long as the peace talks continue to be
stalled, it will negatively affect peace and stability in the
region and in the world as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said, "It is the demand of the times to settle, as soon as
possible, the Middle East issue, which is the longest unresolved
problem in this century."
</P>
<P>
The settlement of this issue is in the practical and long-term
interests of both the Arab countries and Israel, Zhu said, adding
that all Arab and Israeli leaders with courage and insight should
be far-sighted and treasure this hard-won achievement of peace.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations' resolutions on the Middle East
issue and the land-for-peace principle set at the Madrid peace
conference should serve as the basis of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The key to breaking the current peace talks deadlock and the
basic condition to guarantee all countries' security and stability
lies in all relevant parties' earnest implementation of the agreed
resolutions and understanding, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Jewish people had bitter historical experiences and
their arduous efforts to set up their own country have gained the
sympathy of the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that, similarly, the unremitting efforts of the
Palestinian people to restore their legal national rights,
including a return to their motherland and establishment of an
independent state, has also won sympathy and support of people in
the world.
</P>
<P>
"Israel and the Palestinians should achieve a reconciliation
and live in peace," he said, adding "China supports the
Palestinian people's just cause and reasonable demand, support and
encourage the Palestinian side to resolve the Palestine-Israel
conflict through peaceful talks."

<HEADLINE> Lower Turnout Rate Expected for S. Korea's Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's June 4 local elections
are likely to see a record low turnout rate as voters are cynical
to politics due to the country's ongoing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 days to go, public response is indifferent to some
15,000 contenders competing the positions of nine governors, seven
major city mayors, 232 district heads and 4,181 councillors.
</P>
<P>
Last week, two nationwide televised debates among candidates
running for Seoul mayor and the governor of Kyonggi Province drew
less than 10 percent of all viewers, according to a latest survey.
</P>
<P>
Finding it hard to get public attention, many candidates have
reportedly canceled their plans to give speeches at public areas
and turned to local computer networks and internet for campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the voter turnout rate might be below
60 percent, lower than the 68.4 percent in the 1995 elections.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the public indifference to the current economic
hardships and the abnormal weather phenomena known as El Nino,
which is believed to have sapped voters' political enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
"Who on earth pays attention to the polls at a time when voters
are plagued by fears of layoffs caused by corporate bankruptcies
and economic restructuring ?" said a Yonhap reporter.
</P>
<P>
Election analysts forecast that regionalism will play a key
role in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
In Seoul and regions surrounding the capital city, polls showed
that candidates of the ruling coalition of the National Congress
for New Politics and the United Liberal Democrats are more popular
than those from the major opposition Grand National Party, which
has 161 seats of the 299-member National Assembly, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
The local elections are seen as a chance for President Kim
Dae-jung in seeking political realignment and changing the
opposition-controlled parliament.
</P>
<P>
Although trailed significantly by well-known hopefuls from the
ruling camp in Seoul and other regions, the Grand National Party
campaigners are expected to win in the southeastern part of the
nation, which is traditionally a political base for the opposition
party.

<HEADLINE> China To Find More Ways To Use Overseas Investment, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official has said
that China has listed the utilization of overseas funds in its
outlines for national economic development and will adopt more
forms for using foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Li Rongrong, deputy minister of the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), made his remarks at Sunday's closing meeting of
an SDPC work conference on foreign capital held in Wuhan, capital
of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
China encourages local enterprises of various kinds of
ownership to attract overseas investment, Li said, and the use of
foreign capital will continue to be an effective way to
restructure state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Private companies also will be allowed to use overseas funds,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to experiment with setting up
foreign-funded joint stock companies, allowing more overseas
companies to enter fields that need special permission from the
government, and selling more operating rights on infrastructure
projects to foreign investors, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
More foreign capital will be introduced into the country
through the international stock market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will encourage local companies to invest
overseas, especially in such fields as petroleum and natural gas
industries, as well as farming and forestry.

<HEADLINE> Company Trying To be More Open to Stock-Holders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- While many local investors have
complained of difficulties in learning about the real story of
nearly 800 joint-stock firms in China, a Shanghai-based company is
doing something to keep them more informed.
</P>
<P>
The United Business Co. Ltd. has set up a special department,
the Letter Box of Stockholders, to receive complaints, comments
and proposals from investors.
</P>
<P>
It is the first such "letter box" opened by a publicly held
Chinese firm, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
"The setting-up of the department is aimed at better protecting
the investors' rights to learn about and comment on major issues
of the company," said General Manager Lu Mingfang.
</P>
<P>
Officers with the new body will be responsible for receiving
visits and letters from stockholders. Written replies must be sent
to inquiring stockholders within 30 days, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company will also organize stockholders'
visits to the firm's factories under the company and arrange talks
between investors and company leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The company has brought itself under the supervision of the
stockholders by opening the letter-box department," said Gong
Quanrong, one of the firm's stockholders, "and it shows that the
company is making an effort to standardize its operation and make
it more open."
</P>
<P>
One local economist said that the opening of the letter box
department shows that the country's stock market is becoming more
mature as locally listed companies try to be more standardized and
open.
</P>
<P>
Local investors are turning their eyes from the secondary
market, as it was in the past decade, to the listed companies
themselves, the economist said.
</P>
<P>
United Business is the first Sino-overseas joint venture in
Shanghai. It was founded in 1981 by local textile industries and a
Hong Kong entrepreneur, and turned into a joint stock firm in 1991
to become the first listed Sino-overseas joint venture in the city.
</P>
<P>
The company is also one of the first publicly held companies in
Shanghai.

Shanghai, the country's industrial and commercial center,

A first group of 50 garbage-collecting depots have been set up

about 5,000 households, replacing nearly 40 rusty iron dustbins,

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Philippine President Fidel
Ramos, "president-elect" Joseph Estrada and House Speaker Jose de
Venecia Tuesday forged an agreement in principle to form a
government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace Tuesday for the first time described
Estrada as "president-elect" in the May 11 elections despite the
fact that Congress just began canvassing the presidential votes
late Tuesday and could proclaim the winner only several days
later.
</P>
<P>
A quick count conducted by a private organization accredited by
the Commission on Elections has shown that Estrada, the
presidential bet of the opposition Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino (Lammp, Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) and currently
the vice president of the country, had won a landslide victory in
the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in a press release that the
agreement was reached during a four-hour breakfast meeting among
the three leaders to enable the country to move forward
confidently and perform successfully in the arena of international
competition.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia is the secretary general and presidential candidate
of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party. He was anointed by Ramos but was
reportedly defeated in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Except de Venecia, all the other seven presidential candidates
in the race have conceded defeat to Estrada.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Ramos urged the incoming president
to use the gains of the country during the last six years to
address the present economic and social challenges facing the
Filipino people.
</P>
<P>
"Each succeeding government must be able to build and, if
possible, improve upon its predecessor for the good of the whole
nation," the outgoing president said.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the support of Ramos, Estrada said: "We need to put
the atmosphere of political rivalry behind us now, so that we can
maximize the benefits of a working democracy such as what we have
in the country today."
</P>
<P>
The three leaders further stressed that adversaries in the May
polls must look upon themselves not as political enemies but as
friends and allies working for the common good of the Filipino
people.
</P>
<P>
One of the immediate areas of cooperation being studied is the
forging of a working coalition in Congress between the current
ruling party and Estrada's Lammp.
</P>
<P>
Such a coalition in both the House and the Senate is
contemplated to spur and facilitate the enactment of laws that
will respond to the needs of economic recovery and development and
social equity, the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, banned by law to seek a second term, is to step down
when his term expires on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders expressed optimism that the president-elect
will be proclaimed in time for the country's centennial
celebration on June 12.

In a meeting with OIC Secretary-General Ezzidine Laraki,
Khatami said that the most important problem facing the Islamic
world is the issue of Afghanistan, although it can not be ruled
out that the Palestinian issue is far more serious, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president, also current OIC chairman, appreciated
the peace initiatives of the OIC secretary general and OIC
special envoy in Afghan affairs Abu Bakr in the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a matter of great regret that bloodletting
and flames of war were continuing in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that with the assistance, cooperation and efforts
of Muslim nations, particularly the regional countries, the
regional crises must be able to be defused. The crisis in
Afghanistan needs to be resolved through mutual understanding and
negotiation among all factions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Laraki briefed Khatami on the issues of the OIC, saying
that the concept of dialog between civilizations needs to be
worked out within the OIC framework after attaining a
consensus among the 55 member states.
</P>
<P>
Laraki is currently in Iran for the three-day session of
the OIC Committee on Coordination of Joint Islamic Action,
which was opened on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Growth in COMESA Peaks at 4.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern African (COMESA) hit 4.5 percent
last year, the highest recorded over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the region has been at about four percent for two
years, more than two percentage points higher than the trend in
the preceding decade, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Martin Ogang, President of the Eastern and Southern Africa
Trade and Development (PTA) Bank, says that inflation in the
region have also fallen significantly, while trade and current
account deficits have declined in proportion to the gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
He says that projections for COMESA growth are encouraging,
with significant improvements made in macro-economic management
and increased widening of production bases, which reduce exposure
and vulnerability to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
As of December 1997, the members of the PTA Bank were Burundi,
Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the African Development
Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
According to the PTA annual report for 1997, the bank's
project financing activities continued to increase as in the
previous years.
</P>
<P>
The highest exposure was to manufacturing which constituted
38.7 percent of the bank's projects portfolio in support of eight
projects.
</P>
<P>
Currently 10 out of 15 member states of COMESA have benefited
from the bank's facilities.
</P>
<P>
The treaty establishing the PTA Bank was signed in December
1981 as a first step towards the creation of a common market.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA, whose treaty was signed in November 1993 in
Kampala, Ugandan capital, went into force in December 1994,
thereby repealing the PTA Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of COMESA are the promotion of cooperation
and development in all fields of economic activities,
particularly in trade, customs, industry, transport,
communications, agriculture, natural resources and monetary
affairs.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Bank Lowers Forecast for Economy Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Reserve Bank has
lowered its forecast for the economic growth of fiscal 1998/99 in
the face of the Asian economic crisis and declining domestic
business confidence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the bank's monetary policy on Tuesday, Bank
Governor Don Brash brought down the economic growth forecast to
2.2 percent for the fiscal year to March 1999, from an earlier
forecast of 3.6 percent made in March.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure contradicts the projection made by the
Treasury in May that the economy would grow 2.7 percent in the
year to March 1999, before rebounding to 3.9 percent the following
year.
</P>
<P>
Brash pointed out that the Asian crisis continues to hold back
the New Zealand economy with the growth forecast in Japan, the
second biggest buyer of New Zealand exports, substantially
downgraded.
</P>
<P>
As the other Asian countries tell a similar story, demand for
New Zealand products is expected to be weak, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Brash said the bank hopes the tax cuts scheduled for July this
year will provide a boost to the economy. He expected the economy
to pick up next year, with a growth up to 4.4 percent by the year
2000.

JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police arrested the deputy mayor of the Arab
Israeli city of Umm Elfahm and four businessmen from eastern
Jerusalem on Monday. The police suspected that the investment
company run by them was serving as a financial arm of the
militant group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A top official of the European Commission has told Haaretz
that political dialog between Europe and Israel no longer
exists. He said that Israel under the leadership of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was extracting all the benefits of
relations with the European Union while interfering with the
economic progress of its neighbors, refusing to take part in
regional cooperation and blocking every chance for progress in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:

<P>

unequivocally clear for the first time on Monday that he

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Company Profits From Trademark Registration Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Relevant Chinese departments have
expressed grave concern to a Shenzhen company making profits by
deliberately registering trademarks of other companies and then
selling the rights back to the original owners.
</P>
<P>
Information from Trademark Affairs Division of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce disclosed that China
(Shenzhen) Foreign Trade Center Co. Ltd. has submitted
applications for registering 240 trademarks of other companies
through normal procedures since December of 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, applications for the registration of 201 trademarks
have passed initial assessment, which mainly involves insurance,
investment, financial information, commodities and other
services. Some trademarks the Shenzhen company hopes to register
are identical with trademarks of dozens of well-known commodities,
while some other trademarks it prepared for registration are the
same as simplified names of listed companies.
</P>
<P>
After it has finished registration, the Shenzhen company has
tried all possible ways to get the companies to buy back their own
trademarks, an act that has aroused strong resentment among the
affected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jinqi, Chief Judge of the Intellectual Property Rights
Court of the Supreme People's Court, said though "Trademark Law"
stipulates that one owns the exclusive right to use a trademark if
he successfully beats others in first sending applications for
trademark registration, the "Civil Law" advocates the principle of
trustworthiness and credibility and operators will be stopped if
their acts violate such a principle.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen company has outstripped others to first register
trademarks of other companies and has attempted to make profits by
selling them back, said the chief judge, adding that such
practices should be punished to safeguard a normal market order.
</P>
<P>
Liu Peizhi, deputy head of the Trademark Division of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce, said the Shenzhen
company deliberately outstrips others to first send in
applications for registering trademarks of other companies. Such
registrations should be canceled, he said, whether trademark
holders complain or not.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Garment Industry Earnings Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's earnings from the
garment industry increased by 25 percent in the first quarter this
year as compared with the same period last year, sources of the
Ministry of Industrial Development said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The textile and apparel industry earned 546.8 million U.S.
dollars in the January-March period of 1998, up from the 437.5
million dollars during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the industry has helped offset a decrease in
the country's income from other industrial products such as
leather and rubber goods, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the apparel industry is poised this year
to repeat last year's performance as the leading foreign exchange
earner. This year's earnings are expected to exceed last year's
2.143 billion dollars due to incentives offered to the industry.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has taken a series of measures in the last three
years to strengthen the textile industry to meet the challenges of
a quota-free textile trade in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
With stable markets for Sri Lanka's quality products, there are
no fears of the industry being affected due to the devaluation of
the currencies in other Asian garment-producing countries, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
In preparation to meet the challenges expected after the year
2000 the government has been encouraging local industrialists to
produce fabric and other raw materials in order to minimize
imports, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The garment industry has provided direct employment to more
than 350,000 persons in Sri Lanka.

BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today in a meeting with visiting Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar that China will, as always, develop friendly
and cooperative relations with Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Saying that China and Sri Lanka enjoy a traditional friendship
with a history of more than 1,000 years, Zhu said that they have

<P>
He went on to say that it is a set policy of the Chinese
government to develop bilateral friendship and cooperation on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, a policy
which is an important part of China's efforts to forge a
good-neighbor friendship and reciprocal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he is convinced that with efforts from the two sides,
Sino-Sri Lankan friendly relations will make even greater progress
as the new century approaches.
</P>
<P>
Conveying Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike's
greetings to Zhu, Kadirgamar said that China, as a responsible
country, is an important force in promoting stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar told Zhu that he had had fruitful talks with his
Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan on bilateral relations.
</P>

The Sri Lankan government has valued its traditional friendship
with China, Kadirgamar said, and his country will extend further
exchanges and cooperation with China, and expand bilateral
cooperation to raise bilateral political, economic and trade

NEW DELHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee declined sharply
Monday against the U.S. dollar as Standard &AMP; Poor's (S&AMP;P) lowered
foreign currency ratings of nine Indian entities from stable to
negative, newspaper reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rating agency downgraded the Indian entities including
three banking institutions in view of New Delhi's reduced access

the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
As S&AMP;P decision reached the foreign exchange market in Mumbai,
the depreciation of the rupee was sharp and swift with the U.S.
dollar at one stage quoted at 41.19 rupees, the newspaper The
Statesman said.
</P>
<P>
The rupee later recovered a bit and was closed at 40.96 against
the U.S. dollar after intervention by the State Bank of India,
which sold about 50 to 100 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Large Natural Gas Field Found in Qaidam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A large natural gas field has been
found in the Qaidam Basin of northwest China's Qinghai province,
with 75 billion cubic meters of gas reserves already proven or
under control.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Oil Field's total gas reserves proven or under
control have doubled to 150 billion cubic meters after the latest
verification, which was hailed by petroleum geologists as one of
the country's major breakthroughs in natural gas prospecting
during the past decades, said Zhang Sansheng, an oil field
official.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a billion yuan has been spent exploring oil and gas
during the last three years to collect an average increase of 40
million tons in reserves annually. And, in the basin alone, 22 oil
and gas fields have been found with more than 200 million tons of
oil reserves and 134 billion cubic meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas prospecting began in the basin in 1954 and, by now,
15 million tons of crude oil has been recovered. Plans call for
increasing the oil and gas output to three million tons at the end
of the century and 10 million tons in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Related departments have decided to set up projects to annually
produce 120,000 tons of polyvinyl chloride, 100,000 tons of
caustic soda, 200,000 tons of synthetic ammonia, and 300,000 tons
of urea, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Declares Pollution Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City will declare a
pollution emergency on Tuesday and order cars off the roads and
factories to work at reduced capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Environment Commission of Mexico City made the
decision Monday for the first time this year, as ozone levels went
above the air-pollution alarm index.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the phase one pollution emergency, half of
the city's vehicles must be pulled from the road, while factories
are only allowed to work at 30-40 percent capacity. One-fifth of
the gas stations are closed and all outdoor sports activities are
cancelled in schools.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Index of Air Quality, which measures ozone
levels, reached 251 in the southwest of the city on Monday, one
point higher than the alarm index of 250. Meanwhile, ozone levels
in the center and north of city surpassed 200.
</P>
<P>
A reading of 250 on the scale is considered hazardous.
Readings above 100 are considered dangerous to humans by the World
Health Organization. Official statistics showed the average daily
index of air quality in Mexico City was 170 last year.
</P>
<P>
Air quality was recently aggravated by smoke from scores of
wildfires across Mexico and a lack of wind and rain which usually
scour the atmosphere this time of the year, said the Metropolitan
Environment Commission.
</P>
<P>
Mexico City, at the bottom of a mountain basin, is one of the
most polluted cities in the world. Sun and smog produce a toxic
blanket that often smothers the city.
</P>
<P>
Ozone is a pollutant created when car fumes mix with solar
radiation. There are an estimated three million cars on the roads
of Mexico City.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Gets 14 Billion Dollars Aid Since Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has received more than 650
billion taka (about 14 billion U.S. dollars) in foreign aid since
its independence in 1971, said Lutfar Rahman Sarker, governor of
the country's central bank, Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The major portion of the aid, however, did not reach the poor.
And some urban people benefited from the aid which resulted in the
widening of rich-poor," Sarker told a seminar here Monday on "the
importance of improving the abilities of existing institutions or
developing new ones for alleviating poverty."
</P>
<P>
Press reports here Tuesday quoted him as saying that despite
efforts by government and non-government organizations and
different social and financial bodies, the country could not
attain its desired goal of poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
A major cause of poverty is the banks' discriminatory attitudes
in disbursing loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the existing institutions be made more active
and dynamic in eradicating poverty, as "there is no need to set up
new institutions in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Participants from Bangladesh Bank, various nationalized and
specialized banks and other financial institutions agreed that
loans are not the only solution to poverty alleviation in the
country, but could play a vital role in the effort poverty if they
reach the grassroots levels.
</P>
<P>

The decision, made by a government committee Monday, will also

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has decided
to recruit 5,000 more policemen to increase the efficiency of
policing in the country, Home Minister Rafiqul Islam said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there were only 98,033 policemen in the country and

Independent daily on Tuesday quoted the minister as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
To deal more effectively with the law and order situation in
the country, the Home Ministry is planning reforms for a more
specialized police force, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as part the reform plan to be worked out within
two to three months, a permanent data bank would be set up to
maintain information about different kinds of crimes and
criminals.
</P>
<P>
There would be some qualitative change in policing, including
specialization of police forces in different fields, such as
maintenance of law and order, collection of information and
investigation, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a specialized service sector of police would be
opened to provide special service to the public, particularly to
entrepreneurs, he added.

TOKYO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government adopted a
five-year anti-drug plan at a meeting Tuesday that will step up
cooperation with countries in Asia and elsewhere to combat
increasing drug-related crimes at home.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Office of the Narcotics
Control Board decided to upgrade itself to a national level so as
to better revamp its anti-narcotics measures, The Bangkok Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart was quoted by the

<HEADLINE> Nine Suspected White Supremacists Arrested in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian police detained nine
suspected members of the white supremacist movement `Hammer
Skinheads Italia' in Rome Monday on charges of acts of violence
and racial intolerance.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also identified another 150 people suspected of
belonging to the extreme right-wing movement during 90 searches,
said Domenico Vulpiani, chief of Digos special branch police,
which carried out the arrests.
</P>
<P>
Police also found truncheons, Nazi Paraphernalia, portraits of
Hitler and Mussolini and arm bands bearing the Nazi German
swastika, said Vulpiani.
</P>
<P>
The investigation on the Hammer Skinheads Italia started in
January 1997 following the profanation of Jewish tombs in Prima
Porta cemetery, on the northern outskirts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since then, police have also investigated other profanations
and acts of violence to individuals which are traceable to the
organization, said Vulpiani.
</P>
<P>
Vulpiani said the movement, which has adopted as a slogan the
words of American white supremacist David lane: "We have to ensure
the existence of our people and the future of white children," has
offices in 16 Italian cities and elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The movement is thought to have been financed from London by
Roberto Fiore, 39, an Italian who allegedly founded the right-wing
Terza Posizione (Third Position) organization.
</P>
<P>
Fiore fled the country in October 1980, two months after the
bologna railway station bombing, which was attributed to the
subversive right.
</P>
<P>
The bombing killed 85 and injured more than 100 and still ranks
as post-war Italy's worst terrorist massacre.
</P>
<P>
An Italian request for Fiore's extradition in 1982 was rejected
for lack of evidence; a similar request was dismissed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
He was tried in Italy in abstentia in 1985 and was sentenced to
nine years in prison for his part in Terza Posizione.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to double its annual
natural gas production capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by
2005, as one of its important strategies for developing energy
resources amid declining oil production and prices.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the reorganized China
National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), natural gas is a form of clean
energy which has huge potential for civilian and industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to verify additional gas reserves of 1
trillion cubic meters by the end of the century, with the
cumulative total hitting 2 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's gas production capacity will be
increased by another 10 billion cubic meters, with the total
topping 25 billion.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source said that through further exploration, major
breakthroughs are forecast in the expansion of proven gas reserves
and the production capacity in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region,
the Tarim Basin and Sichuan province. And the annual output is
expected to reach 30 billion cubic meters by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC official said enormous potential exists for the
country's gas production. Following years of vigorous development,
three large-scale gas production areas have taken shape.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, total
gas reserves of 230 billion cubic meters have been verified. Total
gas reserves of 200 billion cubic meters have been confirmed in
the eastern part of Sichuan province. In the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, total gas reserves of 160 billion cubic meters
have been verified, in addition to the discovery of a group of new
gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
In the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai province, a
large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion cubic meters
has been found.
</P>
<P>
In addition to domestic gas exploration, active efforts are
being made to utilize gas resources of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In central Asia, China has joined an international gas
exploration project which will involve the construction of a
long-distance gas pipeline running through China and the Korean
Peninsula to Japan, providing China with a gas supply of 25
billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia will pipe to China 25 billion cubic meters of gas
annually.

JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) are

by the nation must be definitely spelt out.
</P>
<P>
"The most important prerequisite to reform is efficient and
capable national leadership. I'd like to stress (the importance)
of state leadership because it is of paramount importance to the
campaign for reform," Susilo said.
</P>
<P>
He supported the government stand to limit the terms of future
presidency, saying the ABRI, the strongest force in the country,
is in favor of a two-term limit on the future president.

<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Morocco's head coach Henri Michel
said on Monday that his sides will try every endeavor to enter the
last 16 in this summer's soccer World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The French-born coach made the remarks in an interview with the
Morocco News Agency in the Ifrane training camp.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is the only realistic aim for us. During the
month-long World Cup finals my side will leave no stones unturned
to reach the second round, and every match could have surprise."
</P>
<P>
Michel, who had also coached the French national team, said the
Moroccans have to present its best form in its opening game
against Norway on June 10 in Montpellier if they want to secure a
berth in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman said he would not give the final list of 22
players until next weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I called a total of 27 players for a group training just in
case that some may suffer injuries on the eve of the finals. "
</P>
<P>
Morocco will host an international event which features such
teams like France, England and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Michel stressed that the international competition is the last
chance for his side to warm up for the finals and he would
concentrate on the performance rather than the results.
</P>
<P>
The coach predicted that every team will be undergoing some
further changes following the tune-up matches.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our sides will analyze the strengths and weakness
following the match with England, because we will meet Scotland
and Norway in the finals which are heavily tainted by the English
playing style."
</P>
<P>
Morocco will play its final tune-up match against Chile in
Avignon, France.
</P>
<P>
In the first round Morocco will play Norway on June 10, Brazil

<HEADLINE> Hemorrhaging Biggest Killer of Chinese Women in Childbirth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hemorrhaging remains the biggest
threat to pregnant women in China, more deadly than complications,
hypertension and puerperal infection, according to the Ministry of
Health.
</P>
<P>
A statistical report released by the ministry showed that
hemorrhaging was the cause in 54.5 percent of the deaths among
pregnant women, compared with 22.2 percent from complications,
11.5 percent from hypertension and 5.1 percent by infection.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested that women in childbirth, who live in
western China's Tibet and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions and
Qinghai province, run much higher risks than those in eastern
metropolises, such as Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"In Shanghai, about 22 women out of every 100,000 die of
childbirth, the lowest rate of the nation," the report
stated. "However, the mortality rate in Tibet is 387 women out of
every 100,000, six times the national level."
</P>
<P>
The current mortality of Chinese pregnant women is 63 out of
every 100,000.
</P>
<P>
"Such a gap reflects a great disparity of maternity services in
different parts of the country, since some proper measures, if
doctors take in time, will bring the incidence down sharply," said
Xiang Xiaoying, an official with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
To narrow the service gap, the ministry early this month
launched a national project named "Safe Motherhood."
</P>
<P>
The project aims to increase the proportion of hospital births
among pregnant women. In some poor areas lacking medical
facilities, midwives will be trained and asked to provide cleaner
and safer services to women in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to a 50 percent decline in the current death
rate of pregnant women by the year 2000," Xiang said.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Measures to Withstand Crisis Pressures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China will take active and
responsible measures to withstand pressures exerted by the
financial crisis in Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaosong, president of the China Council for the Promotion
of International Trade (CCPIT), made this remark on Monday while
speaking at the forum of the Economic Council of the Pacific Basin
(PBEC), which is holding its 31st annual meeting here.
</P>
<P>
He said China is facing serious challenges as the financial
crises in Southeast Asian countries made China's exports, and the
use of foreign investment, much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
But China will strive hard to support the crisis countries in
surmounting their difficulties, although it will take a long time
for China itself to overcome and eliminate the harmful influences
wrought by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
China has already offered four billion U.S. dollars to the
countries and regions seriously harmed by the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the hard pressure of maintaining its exports, China will
promote the requirements of its domestic market, and cultivate new
economic growth points, the CCPIT president said.
</P>
<P>
Heading a Chinese delegation of more than 60 businessmen, Yu
arrived here on Saturday to attend the annual meeting of PBEC.
</P>
<P>
The PBEC was founded in May 1967. As a non-governmental
economics forum, it aims at promoting trade and investment,
reducing tariff barriers and stimulating economic cooperation in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Boost Gas Export to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is promoting one of its
natural gas projects to boost its gas export to Thailand in the
year 2000 from the Yedagun natural gas field off the country's
Tanintharyi coast.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper The Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday
that three of the eight test wells in the field are being drilled
and the new export target of gas will be increased to 400 million
cubic feet (7.24 million cubic meters) from 200 million cubic
feet (3.62 million cubic meters) per day.
</P>
<P>
The drilling of the present three test wells, down to a depth
of 2.7 kilometers, is scheduled to be completed in June.
</P>
<P>
The other five are expected to be completed by May 1999, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Yedagun gas project has been jointly operated on a
profit-sharing basis since 1990 by the State Myanmar Oil and Gas
Enterprise, Britain's Premier Petroleum Ltd., Malaysia's Petronas,
Japan's Nippon Oil Co. and Thailand's Petroleum Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Yedagun gas is to be sold to Thailand according to a second
 contract reached in March last year between the PTT Exploration
and Production of Thailand and the developers.
</P>
<P>
The first contract on sale of gas from Myanmar's another
offshore gas field, the Yadana, in the gulf of Mottama was signed
earlier in January 1995. The field has been developed by another
foreign oil group comprising France's TOTAL, the U.S. UNOCAL and
Thailand's Petroleum Authority, and the gas from the field is due
to be sold to Thailand in July this year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has signed more than
20 production-sharing contracts with oil companies from about 10
countries including Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Thailand and the United States, exploring oil and gas in
different offshore and onshore areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the sector reached 2.29 billion U.S.
dollars in 45 permitted projects at the end of 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand expects to issue up to 2
billion U.S. dollars in global bonds by the end of the year, with
the first issue to be completed by July, according to the Thai
Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
About 9 billion baht (236 million dollars) raised from the bond
issue would be used as fresh capital for the Export-Import Bank,
the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives and the
Government Housing Bank, an official from the ministry was quoted
Tuesday by The Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
This would allow the three state-owned banks to increase
lending to rural sectors, exporters and low-in-come housing
buyers, priorities for the government to help alleviate the social
impact of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
One of the executive decrees approved by the parliament Monday
allows the government to issue up to 5 billion dollars in global
bonds up to the end of 2000.

ROME, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy's three big union federations,
meeting on Monday, called for a national demonstration in Rome on
June 20 to push for higher employment.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Cgil, Cisl and Uil, Italy's three big unions, said
they appreciated the government's efforts to combat unemployment
and improve the economy, but the pace of development was slow,
especially in the country's south.
</P>
<P>
This would not be the first time the unions have organized a
national demonstration as a form of protest instead of a general
strike. The last demonstration was held on March 22, 1997 to
demand more jobs.

Leaders of the three unions said this demonstration was "not
against anyone," but was for more jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A grand ceremony was held yesterday
to award certificates and plaques to the three Chinese cities
recently added to the Unesco World Heritage List, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Ancient City of Pingyao in Shanxi province, Lijiang Old
Town in Yunnan province, and Suzhou Classical Gardens in Jiangsu
province were added to the Heritage List in December 1997 during
the 21st Session of Unesco's World Heritage Committee.
</P>
<P>
First built in the Western Zhou Dynasty (1100-770 BC) and
rebuilt in 1370 in the Ming Dynasty, Pingyao has one of the
best-preserved city walls in China.
</P>
<P>
The town was also an important financial center during the Ming
and Qing Dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Lijiang Old Town is the seat of the Naxi Autonomous County
government in Yunnan Province. The town is known for the unique
traditions of the local people including Dongba culture, Naxi
ancient music and Baisha murals. The town is also known for its
construction which reflects the Naxi ethnic style with outside
influences.
</P>
<P>
While the above two sites pride themselves on their ancient
constructions, the Suzhou Classical Gardens are a typical example
of Chinese garden, achieving a sense of serenity by a unique
combination of art, nature and ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
Before this additions, 16 sites in China of cultural or natural
value had been placed on the list. They include the Great Wall,
the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes in
Gansu Province and the Potala Palace in Lhasa.

<HEADLINE> Loss of State Assets to be Prevented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese government official
has warned against random selling of equity shares by small
state-owned enterprises, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Shareholding is not a panacea for the myriad of smaller
firms," the paper quoted Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Smaller firms account for 99 percent of China's registered
firms and employ 75 percent of the nation's workers. Of the 8.5
million smaller industrial firms, 75,000 are state-owned.
</P>
<P>
"The most worrying aspect is that smaller firms will not really
be weaned away from government connections in the current
corporate reform," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, "shareholders" get dividends if profits are
good, but turn to the government for help if things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
In other words, firms involved in the reform are still a long
way from standing on their own feet as required by a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We should not blindly follow shareholding or joint-stock
partnerships. The key to the reform is to make all emplyees share
losses as well as profits. The iron rice bowl must be smashed,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Three principles must be observed in reforming smaller firms:
</P>
<P>
-- Publicly-owned assets in any firm must be preserved;
</P>
<P>
-- The gap between large and small shareholders should be kept
at a proper level, otherwise some people would feel as if they
were working for others;
</P>
<P>
-- A one-man-one-vote system should prevail rather than one
share one vote.
</P>
<P>
The state has decided to slant its support to larger
enterprises. But we are not adandoning the smaller ones, although
we must prevent the loss of state assets, chen said.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to selling the assets of smaller firms, the
government must consider how much fresh funding input and how many
jobs can be guaranteed after the sale.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against the random hiking of employees' wages
and welfare as most smaller firms have a high debt-asset ratio.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to import another 2 million tons of rice to increase
stocks, according to Minister of Food and Horticulture A. M.
Saefuddin.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the decision after formally taking over ministerial
duties from his predecessor here on Monday, Saefuddin said the
protracted drought, the impact of El Nino and other factors have
reduced rice production in the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that finding the solution for the food crisis in
society would become the focus of his ministry's attention. To
overcome the problems, he would improve the food distribution
system which had been damaged due to communication problems
resulting from recent fuel price hikes.
</P>
<P>
There would be a food crisis center to monitor the crisis,
Saefuddin was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesia has imported about 1 million tons of rice
from China, Vietnam and Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A banking association in
Colombia has proposed that a single currency be created within the
Andean Group, which would be similar to the European Union's euro,
Radio Cadena Nacional reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Institution and Banking Association of Colombia
(ASOBANCARIA) said the Andean Group, consisting of Colombia,
Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, "should follow the example
of the European Union, which united its currency when the euro was
created to broaden their financial horizons and reduce financing
costs."
</P>
<P>
The ASOBANCARIA said that with the absence of a single
currency, "it is required that compensation mechanisms are
established which permit the countries within the region to reduce
the costs of the regional trade produced by the difference between
the value of its currencies and the value of the currencies of the
nations trading with the group."
</P>
<P>
Although companies of the Andean countries are able to trade
with currencies of other member nations, the lack of compensatory
mechanisms makes this process highly risky and bears high
transaction costs, said the ASOBANCARIA.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that no integration system can be truly successful
without a currency unification or effective compensatory
mechanisms which eliminate the implicit transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Andean Group to learn from the European experience
to make sure commercial agreements are escorted by economic
policies and general commitments in order to stabilize the
regional economy.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Prostate Cancer Tests Cuts Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A massive study over eight years
provides the first evidence that prostate blood screening could
reduce deaths from prostate cancer by 69 percent, says the
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by researchers from Laval University in
Quebec, Canada, and presented recently at the annual scientific
meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology.
</P>
<P>
The researchers predicted that if men started testing at the
age of 50, when their risk of advanced disease is still small, it
could practically eliminate the development of prostate cancer
before it reaches the deadly spreading stage.
</P>
<P>
The test looks for elevated levels in the blood of
prostate-specific antigen or PSA, a protein that rises in prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study concludes that routine use of the PSA test could
prevent 27,000 of the 39,000 prostate cancer deaths in the United
States each year.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Severe Typhoons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's coastal areas, which
contribute about half of China's GDP, face a severe threat from
typhoons this year and their typhoon defences leave something to
be desired, according to Zhou Wenzhi, vice-minister of Water
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predict that five to seven typhoons will hit
China's coastal areas during a certain period of time this year,
but there are embankments on only 13,000 km of the 19,000-km
coastline, and only 44 percent of these are up to standard.
</P>
<P>
Last year, typhoons caused 30 billion yuan worth of damages to
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhou says that these areas have been building embankments
faster but that it is just not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
China built 933 km of standard embankments last year, the
largest number in any single year.
</P>
<P>
Chai Songyue, governor of Zhejiang province, says that they
will have their share of coastline protected by standard
embankments in three to four years.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, Zhejiang has been building embankments on
350 km of coastline and they are expected to be strong enough to
withstand the worst typhoons that occur every 50 years.

</P>
<P>
-- East Asia's troubled economies will recover their previous
strength, but New Zealand and Vietnam have all the right
ingredients to become the next victims of the current financial
crisis, a respected forecaster at the Australian National
University warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government Monday night withdrew its
redundancy offer of access to 157 million U.S. dollars to dock
workers after creditors of the workers' employer Patrick forced a
15-day delay on any decision on the future of the insolvent
Patrick company, whose attempts to fire all its unionized dock
workers last month attracted international attention.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian government would narrowly lose to the
Australian Labor party if an election were to be held now, and its
fortunes remain captive to deep uncertainty about the government's
yet-to-be-revealed goods and services tax.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's new leadership Monday bowed to pressure for
political reform, clearing the way for fresh elections, beginning
the dismantling of Soeharto family business interests and freeing
prominent political prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Netherlands Enter Hockey Semi-Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Argentina beat New Zealand 2-1 on
Monday to become the first women's team to secure a semi-final
berth at the current World Cup Field Hockey Tournament in Utrecht,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Argentines were later joined in the day by hosts the
Netherlands that blanked India with five goals.
</P>
<P>
The top two teams from the six-team round-robin preliminary
tourney enter the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the men's action, Spain was the day's surprise when it
downed World Cup holders Pakistan 2-1.
</P>
<P>
England got its first win after four rounds of play, beating
Poland 5-2.
</P>
<P>
The goals were scored by five different players in a game that
saw the Poles led for some time before the English turned the tide.
</P>
<P>
Jason Lee levelled the scoring for England before Russell
Garcia, Jon Wyatt, Mark Pearn and Calum Giles each scored once to
seal the game away.
</P>
<P>
Slawomir Lukaszewski grabbed a consolation for Poland later on
in the game.
</P>
<P>
The English women, however, suffered a 3-2 defeat at the hands
of Olympic silver medalists South Korea. Both teams ended the
first three rounds of the group prelimiaries with one win against
two defeats but the South Koreans perched higher on team standing
on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday will be a decisive day for Olympic and World Cup
winners Australia when it meets Germany in the women's group A
contest.
</P>
<P>
A win will send the Aussies through to the semi-finals whereas
a defeat will send their opponents through. But either way, the
Australians will qualify for the medal round since they have an
easy job to do in their last group outing facing up South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In other games of the day, the Australian men entertained
themselves with eight unanswered goals against the Malaysians.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan President Speaks on New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The country and the people need
acceleration of economic reforms, improvement of the social
situation, order and stability, Moldovan President Petre Luchinsky
said in his regular weekly radio speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Moldovan news agency INTERLIK, the speech was
fully dedicated to the tasks of a new government, which last week
received a vote of confidence in parliament and swore to the head
of state.
</P>
<P>
Luchinsky said that after a long and difficult process of
forming the Cabinet of Ministers and its approval on the basis of
compromise between the ruling coalition Alliance for Democracy and
Reforms and Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc, the time has come to act
concretely.
</P>
<P>
The president said he expects that the government will assume
the maximum responsibility to put the interests of the state
higher than politics, will show the maximum professionalism and
will coordinate its work.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that the reforms and work on the whole
have been stopped lately. He emphasized the importance of
cooperation of a new government with the president of the country
and the parliamentary majority as well as a constructive dialogue
with the opposition and the whole society.

<HEADLINE> Romania on Hungarian Elections Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Chamber of Deputies
and the ruling Christian Democratic National Peasant Party hope
the political changes in Hungary will not affect the relations
between Romania and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Ion Diaconescu, speaker of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies and
president of the National Peasant Party, made the statement at a
press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing opposition Federation of Young
Democrats-Hungarian Civic Party has won victory in a run-off
election Sunday against the ruling Socialist Party, according to
the national electoral committee of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The National Peasant Party considers no change is necessary in
Romania's policy regarding minorities because a center-right party
won the elections in Hungary, even though this party is known for
its exaggerations in backing the interests of the Hungarians who
live outside Hungary, said Ion Diaconescu.
</P>
<P>
Statistics data show that the Hungarians, the largest minority
in Romania, account for over 7 percent of the total population of
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance is clear: we fully observe provisions in
international documents concerning minorities and try to give a
positive answer to all the claims of the Hungarian Democratic
Union of Romania. All points of dispute will be solved. What we
need is patience," Ion Diaconescu stressed.

<HEADLINE> Ranking IRS Official Investigated for Travel Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The No. 2 official at the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States, who last fall
apologized to senators for abuses at his agency, recently was
investigated for a 12,000-dollar advance for moving expenses that
he hadn't fully accounted for, according to documents and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
IRS deputy commissioner Michael Dolan said he cooperated with
the Treasury Department inspector general's probe and provided
receipts to verify he spent more on moving expenses than the
12,000-dollar advance he received more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The IRS does not require its employees to immediately account
for moving advances, giving them six years to do so.
</P>
<P>
Dolan said he had filed a report accounting for some of the
advances years ago, and now accounted for all of them.
</P>
<P>
Now congressional investigators want to know whether the Dolan
inquiry may have been retaliatory or abusive.
</P>
<P>
News of the Dolan inquiry comes amid allegations that the IRS,
under fire for conducting armed raids on nonviolent taxpayers and
other questionable tactics, has not done enough to correct
employee misconduct and punish wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
In Senate hearings last month, Harry Patsalides, deputy
assistant inspector general for investigations at the Treasury
Department, said the IRS had been slow to take action against IRS
employees and meted out weak punishments in some cases.
</P>
<P>
A memo obtained by The Associated Press shows that last fall
Patsalides pressed an IRS agent to open an investigation of Dolan
and look into whether he avoided paying taxes on the advance.
</P>
<P>
Patsalides did not return two calls to his office seeking
comment, and Coleman declined comment, according to the report.
