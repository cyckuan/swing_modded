<HEADLINE> U.S. to Harvest More Wheat This Year, Government Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) --The United States, the world's
largest wheat exporter, will harvest 2.26 billion bushels of wheat
this year, the Agriculture Department's report estimated today.
</P>
<P>
The government's report came out as nation-wide food prices
were climbing up due to grain shortage and stockpiles dropping to
the lowest level in last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
record production of spring-planted wheat and a better winter
wheat crop than expected.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic forecast is made in part based on the record
production of spring-planted wheat and a better winter wheat crop
than expected.
</P>
<P>
If the department's forecast realized, it would put this year's
production 4 percent higher than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department slightly lowered its projection for
the autumn-harvested corn crop to 9.1 billion bushels because of
dry weather that were expected to hurt crops in some parts of
major agricultural states. In the U.S., a bushel of corn is about
25.42 kilograms and a bushel of wheat is equivalent to 27.24
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
With the harvest more than halfway complete, winter wheat
production was put at 1.48 billion bushels, up 8 percent from the
June 1 forecast. As a result, the harvest will be the lowest since
1989 instead of 1978 as previously expected.

DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina this afternoon called on President Abdul Rahman Biswas and
informed him of her just-concluded visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the prime minister returned home this noon after a
four day visit to the kingdom at the invitation of Saudi King Fahd
Bin Abdul Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the prime minister has decided to
uphold constitutional obligations and democratic norms.
</P>
<P>
In the parliamentary system it is the constitutional
requirement for the prime minister to inform the president of all
about her foreign visit after returning home, the sources noted,
adding that during the past years such norms and constitutional
process were not followed.
</P>
<P>
During the 35 minute meeting, the prime minister apprised the
president of her trip and especially mentioned the matters
relating to Bangladeshis working in Saudi Arabia and the
arrangements made for the Bangladeshi haj pilgrims.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: West Cautious on Turkey's Islamic-led </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's pro-Islamic new coalition
government led by Welfare Party (RP) Chairman Necmettin Erbakan
has officially started working, but the West is very cautious on
its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The RP's past anti-Western and anti-secular rhetoric has been
so strong that its low profile immediately became suspect.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign last December, Erbakan spoke of
his plans to set up "an Islamic United Nations, an Islamic NATO
and an Islamic version of the EU. We will create an Islamic
currency."
</P>
<P>
However, Erbakan has softened his attitude toward the West and
said that the new coalition government between the RP and
center-right True Path Party (DYP) would maintain close links
with the Western countries and further strengthen its relations
with the Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
To try to correct in a hurry the impression that Washington has
been a bit too soft on Turkey's new government, U.S. State
Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said: "The actions are going
to be very important. The words are also important. The words
have meaning. The rhetoric has meaning. We are listening to the
rhetoric as well as watching the actions."
</P>
<P>
DYP leader Tansu Ciller's decision for the formation of
coalition with the RP shocked French President Jacques Chirac,
who was promised to prevent Erbakan from taking power during
Ciller's visit to Paris.
</P>
<P>
But, after the new coalition government won the vote of
confidence, Chirac sent a message of congratulation to Erbakan,
saying that he "sincerely" wishes the Turkish prime minister
success in his "new and high duties."

<TEXT>
<P>
Ciller, as deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Tuesday
summoned the ambassadors of the EU countries, the united States,
Canada, Russia, Japan and Norway to a lunch and "defended her
decision for partnership with the RP," according to a Western
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Ciller also provided guarantees that Turkey would not deviate
from its foreign policy orientations and international
commitments, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Turkish parliament's vote of confidence in
the government, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad said: "We are
looking forward to joint actions to enhance the relations of
friendship and cooperation between our two countries which are
bound by bonds of religion, neighborhood and history.
</P>
<P>
So, Erbakan first met with the Syrian ambassador to Turkey
Tuesday and discussed the improvement of the worsening bilateral
ties between the two neighboring countries. His meeting with the
Syrian ambassador caused the worry of the Western countries over
the foreign policy of Turkey's new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
During the debate on the government program in the parliament,
Erbakan stressed the improvement of the relations with Iran, Syria
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington is mainly worried about the fact that Turkey is
freeing itself from the U.S. policy of "double containment"
against Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Erbakan held talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who paid a one-day working visit to Turkey, and said
that he and Mubarak had agreed on the issues for the
establishment of the real neighborhood among Egypt, Syria, Iran,
Iraq and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel told Mubarak that
Syria is the country which supports the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) and Syria should first give up its support to the
PKK, then Turkey and Syria will hold talks for the settlement of
the water issue.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has planned to pay her first visit as foreign minister
to Ireland, the current EU term president, and this goes against
Erbakan's plan to visit the troublesome neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here hold that the struggle between Erbakan and
Ciller will embody the foreign policy of the new coalition
government.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Bank Calls for New Law on Sabotage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)
today said Zimbabwe should come up with a national policy to
counter the high incidence of illegal economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a one-day symposium on organized economic
crime in Harare, RBZ Deputy Governor Charles Chikaura said the
government should put in place an adequate legal framework that
imposes heavy penalties on people convicted of financial fraud
and other white-collar crimes.
</P>
<P>
"We should put in place an adequate legal framework which
criminalizes launderers and financial fraud and imposes heavy
penalties on those involved as well as making it mandatory to
report suspicious crimes involving large cash transactions to
competent authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe should move with speed to come up with the
necessary legislation as international crime syndicates are now
increasingly targeting the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Education campaigns, he noted, are of paramount importance in
this regard as they will help to educate the public about the
dangers of cooperating with economic criminals.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the opening up of Zimbabwe's economy
did not only attract foreign investors but also attracted the
international criminal fraternity.
</P>
<P>
He said the unimpeded flow of illicit money will drive out
legitimate capital and undermine investors' confidence in the
country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, organized by the central bank, was meant to
enlighten the participants on the current trends in organized
economic crime and the measures to combat that type of crime.

<HEADLINE> French Army to Cut 38 Regiments in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The French Army will cut 38
regiments from a total of 180 in the next three years and the Air
Force will close five bases next year, said the French daily Le
Monde today.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Minister Charles Million is to announce next
Wednesday a package of "measures for adaptation" to reform the
country's defense system as was announced by President Jacques
Chirac earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said in its Friday edition that among the regiments to
be cut are the military academy regiments, the instruction school
of armoured ground force and the cavalry at Saumur.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the 2000-2002 period, the commanding
structures and support systems of the French armed forces will
also put under restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
The reduction will decrease France's army deployment in Germany
from 20,000 to 3,000, and throw doubts over the future of the
Eurocorps, said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1997, the air force will close five of
its 44 bases, including those in Chartres of Eure-et-Loir, Cenon
in Gironde. Toul in Meurthe-et-Moselle, Limoges in Haute-Vienne
and the plateau of Albion in Vaucluse which shelters strategic
nuclear missiles now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Navy will also be reorganized along with
the restructuring of its arsenals, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to a law on military programing, the country's
defense system will cut 24 percent of its forces. That will bring
about a 35 percent reduction of the ground force, a 24 percent cut
of the air force and a 20 percent cut of the navy.

Should the program succeed in Malawi and Zambia, it will be
expanded to Botswana and Mozambique, the coordinator said.
</P>
<P>
"After its success in Zimbabwe, we decided to expand the
program to other countries in the region. A new feature is that it

<HEADLINE> Egypt Restarting Efforts to Save Peace Process: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
one-day visit to Turkey Thursday signaled a restart of Egypt's
diplomatic efforts aiming at salvaging the Middle East peace
process and adjusting the tempo of regional development, Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA),
Moussa said, "The grounds on which the peace process was based are
in no need of reconsideration,"
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, reconsideration of such principles may
negatively affect, or endanger, the peace process itself," he
added.
</P>
<P>
As a second step, the Egyptian foreign minister said, the
foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration member states will
discuss, during their Saturday meeting in Muscat, Oman, the
current Arab situation as well as cooperation between the member
states.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration groups the Gulf Cooperation Council --
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and
Qatar -- as well as Syria and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
They will also probe the possibility of submitting an Arab
joint action plan to the Arab League (AL) to be adopted by all the
AL members according to the provisions of the Arab summit which
was recently held in Cairo, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
A third step will be a trip by himself to Moscow starting
Monday, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that on his two-day visit he expects Russian
support for pressing Israel to respect the land-for-peace principle
drawn up five years ago in the landmark Madrid peace conference, as
the basis for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian efforts come after Israel's new right-wing prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, threatened to change the
long-established rules for peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu outlined his views earlier this week at a press
conference with U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House,
making it clear that he does not plan to withdraw from all
occupied Arab land, even in return for peace.

TOKYO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The world's oldest buffalo at
Tokyo's Tama Zoo, Mitake, died Wednesday at the age of nearly 35
years, Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Most buffalos live only 16 or 17 years, but the female buffalo,
a mother of five calves, lived 34 years and 11 months, which was
the human equivalent of about 90 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The previous record for a buffalo housed in a zoo was 28 years
and 3 months, Kyodo quoted zoo officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that unlike many buffalos who tend to be
cantankerous, Mitake was unhurried and friendly and had been a
good mother to her offspring.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Trade with Germany Needs More Efforts: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral trade between Pakistan
and Germany needs to be improved as Germany is the world's second
biggest importer and the third biggest trading partner of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion of a study conducted by Pakistan-Germany
Business Cooperation Project (PGBCP), Jamil A. Naz, chairman of
PGBCP, told local reporters in the Punjab provincial capital of
Lahore today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, German imports from Pakistan decreased
3.9 percent in 1995 compared with 1994 and fell to a volume of 908
million DM (about 600 million US dollar).
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive year of decrease and total loss
of market share was 6.4 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
Exports from Germany to Pakistan showed the same negative
tendency and a slight upward trend, however, was noticed in German
investment in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 and 1995 German investors transferred 19 million DM (13
million dollar) to Pakistan, said PGBCP chairman.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of PGBCP said that it was a big challenge for the
government and business community to promote exports to Germany
and to enhance German investment in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistani Ambassador to Germany Asad Durrani has
also identified the absence of Pakistani business community from
the German scene, which was one of the main reasons of the bad
performance.
</P>
<P>
Jamil Naz said that according to the ambassador, all important
Asian countries have much better representation in Germany than
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that the German side has reduced their
activities in Pakistan by closing the commercial section of German
Consulate General in Karachi a few years ago and recently the post
of correspondent of the German Foreign Trade Information Office
was abolished.
</P>
<P>
Jamil Naz said that the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of
Commerce and Industry has also planned to hold three trade and
investment promotion conferences in Germany in collaboration with
German Federation of Commerce and Industry, Pakistan Embassy and
the PGBCP.

said that the two side had "full discussions of the issues that we
raised and requested for consultations".
</P>
<P>
"At the time we have not agreed on another date or whether
we'll have further consultations. We've agreed to be in contact on
that question," he said after the talks at the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The talks are the first step in the WTO's dispute settlement
procedure. If no agreement could be reached within 60 days. The
U.S. can ask the WTO to set up an independent panel to rule over
the issue, as now seems highly likely.
</P>
<P>
U.S. negotiators on Wednesday expressed confidence that
Washington would win the the case if it went to a WTO panel.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Stoler, deputy chief of of the U.S. Trade
Representative's office in Geneva, told a news conference that the
U.S. decision to bring the case to the WTO "reflect the fact that
we believe very strongly that we have a very strong case to make".
</P>
<P>
Yokota, however, insisted that Japan had firm reasons to reject
the U.S. charges.
</P>
<P>
"Our market is open," he said on Wednesday, "We import about
130 million of photographic goods and paper into Japan, and the
U.S. has about 10 percent of the Japanese market."
</P>
<P>
Washington took the case to the WTO after an 11-month
investigation into U.S. Film maker Eastman Kodak Co's petition
charging that Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co. and the Japanese
government have been collaborating to block access to the Japanese
market.
</P>
<P>
Kodak argues that barriers in the Japanese market have cost it
at least 5.6 billion in lost revenues since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Japan counters that Japanese companies face similar problems in
the U.S. market, where Kodak's market share surpassing 70
percent.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Not to Open Trade Office in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad
bin Jassem bin Jaber al-Thani has announced that Qatar will not
open a trade office in Israel as planned, according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad was quoted by today's Qatari newspaper Al-Watan as
saying that Qatar would evaluate the new Israeli government's
political stance before taking any steps to open the trade office
in Israel,
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to reconsider its hardline policy toward the
peace process, saying that his country would study how to deal
with the new situation in the Middle East region in cooperation
with other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Qatar agreed last year to exchange trade missions with
Israel. This Arab Gulf state had also been discussing a natural
gas deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, newly elected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is opposed to the creation of an independent Palestinian
state, and insists that Israel will retain sovereignty in
Jerusalem and will not withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights,
which represented a marked change from the liberal policies of
former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres' government.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders said in a final communique issued last month in
Cairo at the end of a Pan-Arab summit meeting that they would
reconsider their relations with Israel if the Jewish state
rejected the land-for-peace principle.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa To Export 2.55 Million Tonnes of Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will export a
total of 2.55 million tonnes of maize and maize products during
the 1996/97 season, Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Derek
Hanekom said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, Hanekom said his decision
on the tonnage had been influenced by several factors including
the latest estimate of the local crop, available stocks and the
anticipated local demand.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is expected to produce a bumper maize crop this
year due to the enough rainfall throughout the country during the
planting season.
</P>
<P>
Hanekom said he will review the export figure once the maize
advisory committee and the maize board discussed the issue at its
next meeting later this year.
</P>
<P>
As a leading agriculture producer in southern Africa, South
Africa is also a major exporter of agriculture produce in the
region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa exported an estimated half a million tons of
yellow maize last year.

<HEADLINE> President Mandela Raps British Colonialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African President
Nelson Mandela today launched verbal attacks upon British
colonialism, but stressed he has come to make friends.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint session of the British parliament earlier
today, President Mandela severely criticized the old British
colonists by saying that it was their colonization in the 18th
century that sowed the seeds of white supremacy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here Tuesday for his first state visit to
Britain, pointed out that his predecessors had come to London to
appeal in vain to the former colonial power for Africans to be
treated equally as with whites.
</P>
<P>
"Despite that rebuff and terrible cost we had to bear as a
consequence, we return to this honored place neither with pikes
nor a desire for revenge nor, even, a plea to your distinguished
selves to assuage our hunger for bread," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela stressed that he had come to Britain to make
friends and he also paid tribute to "millions of ordinary Britons
who stood up to say no to apartheid."
</P>
<P>
"Our emancipation is their reward. We know that the freedom we
enjoy is a richly textured gift hand-crafted by ordinary folk who
would not allow that their dignity as human beings should be
insulted," he added.
</P>
<P>
The black president also noted that the ordinary people had
realized the real nature of the regime and refused to hang their
hands in shame.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela is the first foreign statesman to be accorded
the honor of speaking to the British parliament at the Westminster
Hall since French President Charles de Gaulle in 1960.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Up by 0.2 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The biggest surge in food costs
in more than six years pushed U.S. wholesale prices up by 0.2
percent in June, U.S. Labor Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that its Producer Price Index (PPI), which
measures price pressures before they reach the consumer, turned up
again in June after having fallen by 0.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The increase of PPI in June resulted mainly from the food
prices which jumped by 1.6 percent in June, the biggest gain since
January 1990.
</P>
<P>
For June, the big rise in food prices reflected a 5.6 percent
jump in beef costs, an increase of 3.2 percent in pork prices and
a 22.6 percent rise in fruit prices. The rise in food costs was
slowed down a bit by vegetable prices which actually fell by 5.4
percent last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, energy costs, which had been soaring this year,
retreated quickly in June by 2.1 percent, the biggest decrease
since December 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 2.1 percent drop in energy prices reflected a 7.4 percent
decrease in gasoline costs. A decline at the wholesale level
should be quickly passed through to pump prices.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the
so-called core rate of inflation was up 0.2 percent in June, a
moderate increase that followed no increase at all in May.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 0.2 percent rise of PPI in June rise
left wholesale inflation running at an annual rate of 2.2 percent
so far this year. This actually marked a slowdown from a 3 percent
annual rate turned in during the last half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that fears of inflation in U.S. are
overstated although the June's unemployment rate declined to the
lowest level in the year and the prices pressure are remaining
well checked.

<HEADLINE> 4-year-old Boy Killed In F-16 Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A 4-year-old boy has been
killed and his mother badly burnt when a U.S. Air Force jet
slammed into a house, Air Force officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The accident, according to the officials, took place Thursday
afternoon during an emergency landing by the F-16 fighter about 30
kilometers north of Pensacola, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Frederik Hartwig, who was flying solo, ejected safely
after trying in vain to reach Pensacola Regional Airport with his
plane, whose single engine had failed.
</P>
<P>
The pilot was supposed to be flying to Eglin Air Force Base,
about 80 kilometers east of Pensacola. And officials said they
did not know why he was so close to the residential area.
</P>
<P>
The F-16 was one of the 50 military planes being moved from
Shaw Air Force Base in South Caroline to Eglin because of the
incoming Hurricane Bertha.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said the crash was the fourth in 1996 for the
F-16, one of the most heavily used U.S. military planes. The most
recent accident happened on June 7 in Sioux Falls, S.D.
</P>
<P>
It was also the 15th crash for F-15 since October 1994. Of the
14 previous crashes, only one resulted in a death in Aviano
military base, Italy.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Invest 1.7 Bln Pounds in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean industrial
conglomerate Lucky Goldstar (LG) is to invest 1.7 billion pounds
(2.6 billion US dollars) to build an electronics complex in south
Wales, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The project, hailed as the largest inward investment ever made
in Europe, is expected to create directly 6,100 jobs and a further
15,000 jobs in supplier and support industries.
</P>
<P>
Two factories, a semiconductor production facility and a
consumer electronics plant producing television parts, will be
built over the next five years on a 250-acre site at Imperial
Park, Newport, Gwent, one of Britain's worst unemployment black
spots.
</P>
<P>
Wales has secured the investment after 10 months of tough
negotiations in the face of intense competition from other
countries and other British regions, notably from the North East
of England and from Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The investment will underline Britain's position as the most
powerful magnet for foreign investment in the European Union and
will reinforce Britain's position as the semi-conductor capital of
Europe with more fabrication plants than any other country.
</P>
<P>
The UK now boasts half of all the investment in Europe by South
Korean companies, and Britain attracts 40 percent of all inward
investment into Europe.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major, in welcoming the LG
announcement, said: "Wales won against fierce competition in
Europe. It is a tribute to the Welsh workforce and a vote of
confidence in the UK economy."
</P>
<P>
The project by LG, South Korea's second-largest industrial
conglomerate which employs 126,000 people worldwide, will more
than double South Korean industrial investments in the UK to 2.6
billion pounds (4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the project is part of the company's plan
to locate more plants abroad to escape high wages in South Korea
and avoid possible trade barriers in overseas markets.

<P>
WARSAW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Polish Deputy Prime Minister
Grzegorz Kovodko formally signed an accord to join the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in
Paris today.
</P>
<P>
The accord will make Poland the 28th member state of the OECD
after it is approved by the Polish parliament and President
Aleksander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said the signing of the agreement, which is of
historic significance, has paved the way for Warsaw to enter the
European Union more easily.
</P>
<P>
The entry into the OECD is an acknowledgement of Poland's
economic achievement and "a special certificate" which can help
the country gain more loans from developed countries, Prime
Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers urged more consultations between the two
sides over economic policies and more rapid reforms in Poland's
economic sectors so as to make them more competitive
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Poland applied for OECD membership in February 1994 and entered
into talks with the OECD in November the same year. The
negotiations ended on June 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based OECD, founded in 1961, holds over 200
committees covering almost all economic fields. Its decisions have

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Orders Lawsuit Against Okinawa Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today ordered a lawsuit seeking a court ruling to force
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota to take legal steps for the
continued use of land for a U.S. Navy facility in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Justice Ministry and the Defense
Facilities Administration Agency will file the suit with the Naha
branch of the Fukuoka High Court later in the day, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The suit takes issue with Ota's refusal to comply with a
request by Hashimoto that he make public papers detailing a
government request for the expropriation of a plot of land within
the Sobe communications facility in the village of Yomitan on the
southwestern island prefecture, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Ota has said he could not comply with the request before a
final ruling by the Supreme Court on his appeal against a lower
court decision ordering him to sign documents needed for continued
rental of land plots owned by Okinawa residents for use by the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
He also has expressed disappointment at the contents of an
interim report by a Japan-U.S. governmental panel on how to reduce
U.S. bases in Okinawa, saying the report is not satisfactory to
the people of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The lease on the 236-square-meter plot owned by Okinawa shop
owner Shoichi Chibana expired at the end of March, but the
government has continued to use the plot for the U.S. Navy
facility with no clear legal basis.
</P>
<P>
The central government says the use of the plot can be
warranted for national security reasons to abide by the
Japan-U.S. security pact.
</P>
<P>
The Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court is expected to make a
decision on the latest case in November.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Police on Alert following High Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Jerusalem police have
decided to deploy large numbers of policemen along the Bar-Ilan
Street this weekend to ensure that traffic can pass through and
prevent disturbances, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Justice this afternoon issued a temporary
injuction against preventing the closure of the thoroughfare during
prayer time on Sabbath (the Jewish day of rest that starts sundown
Friday and ends Saturday night) and on holiday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was given during a hearing of two petitions against
the decision made Wednesday by Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy to
partially close the street. The three justices of the panel gave
the state 15 days to explain why the traffic commissioner has
changed his recommendation on whether or not to close the street.
</P>
<P>
According to Levy's decision, the Bar-Ilan Street will be
closed on Sabbath and holidays during prayer times beginning this
evening. The partial closure will remain in effect for four
months, and then will be reevaluated.
</P>
<P>
This was a compromise advised by President Ezer Weizmann, who
had tried to mediate between the Orthodox Jewish residents of the
street, who want the road closed, and secular representatives,
who insist it remain open.
</P>
<P>
The petitions were filed by Lior Horev, an activist with Labor
Party's Young Guard, and Labor member of Knesset Ophir Pines
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The petitions argued that the transportation minister had no
right to make such decision without consulting either
representatives of Jerusalem secular neighborhoods or Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
The petitioners also argued that the decision would have been
invalid anyway, because the traffic commissioner is not allowed
to consider factors such as the religious sensibilities of the
haredim (Orthodox Jews) who live along Bar-Ilan -- he is only
allowed to weigh factors related to traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
Pines said that while major arteries have been closed before,
there were always reasonable alternative routes. However, he said,
there is no alternative to Bar-Ilan. Horev added that because of
this, the closure would hinder ambulances and security vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Pines also noted that the decision changes the religious
status quo, and is therefore a violation of the Likud coalition
guidelines promising to preserve the status quo.
</P>
<P>
Following the court decision, the haredim neighborhoods called
on the Orthodox Jewish residents to demonstrate and prevent
vehicles from passing through during the coming Sabbath. During
last week's Sabbath, violent haredim demonstrators clashed with
police who tried to keep the traffic passing. Two policemen were
injured and a dozen rioters were detained.

<HEADLINE> EU Dismisses UK Application Against Beef Export Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC) was
informed this morning that the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg has dismissed the United Kingdom application for
interim relief in the form of suspension of the EC's ban on Uk
beef export.
</P>
<P>
The UK brought an action against the EC before the Court of
Justice on 24 May in which it claims that the EC Decision of 27
March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine
spongiform encephalopathy(BSE) should be annulled in whole or in
part.
</P>
<P>
But the Court said today in a press release that it considered,
contrary to the UK's arguments, that the EC had regard above all to
protecting public health when it adopted the contested Decision.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of the scientific uncertainties regarding the
mode of transmission of BSE and the lack of controls on the origin
and movements of cattle, the EC's decision was essential to the
achievement of the protection of public health," the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The EC said it was satisfied that "the Court has recognised the
paramount importance to be accorded to the protection of health
which outweights other considerations such as economic and social
difficulties".

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Oppositions Call for Boycott of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese three Christian
opposition leaders called here today for a boycott of the coming
parliamentary election, describing it as "the most dangerous
process to abolish the Lebanese nation."
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, former President Amin Jemayel, former
Army Commander Michel Aoun and Chairman of the National Liberal
Party Dory Shamoun warned against nomination and polling in the
election, which will be held throughout the country in a span of
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Jemayel and Aoun were the last president and the last army
commander during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war, who left the country
on the eve of the end of the fightings and have been living in
exile in France since then.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government published in an official gazette today
a new election law adopted by the government on June 24 and
approved by the Lebanese parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The half-Moslem-half-Christian house passed the law by a
marjority vote of 80 against 22. Five members of the parliament
abstained and 21 were absent. Once approved, the law was swiftly
endorsed by President Elias Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic.
</P>
<P>
"We are warning you, the Lebanese, against the participation,
by either nomination or polling, in the most dangerous process to
abolish the Lebanese nation," Dory Shamoun stressed in a press
conference in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow's parliament will be uglier than the yesterday one,
its law will be counterfeited and imposed and its election is to
be held in the compulsory absence of the national leaders."
Shamoun argued.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the next parliament would be installed "on the
illegal administrative bases supervised by a non-Lebanese
administration, a political and security master, pressing for its
direct interests at the cost of our crucial and viable
interests."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question of whether he expected all followers of
the oppositions to comply with the call for boycott, he said, "I
hope at least a large part of them even if not all will do so."
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference, Shamoun held a meeting with
Cardinal Nasrallah Butros Sfeir, the patriarch of the Lebanese
Maronite community.
</P>
<P>
Shamoun said that he and the Maronite spiritual leader had
"identified opinions" on the parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
The Christian mainstream Phalange Party Wednesday announced 13
candidates to run for the election.
</P>
<P>
Most Christians and some Moslems boycotted the last
parliamentary election in 1992, the first after the civil war
which produced the present parliament based on a equal proportion
between the Moslems and Christians.
</P>
<P>
The boycotters argued that no just elections could be held in
Lebanon with the presence of foreign troops on its lands, a
reference to the 35,000-strong Syrian forces in eastern Beqaa
Valley and Beirut and some 1,000 Israeli troops patrolling an
Israeli self-styled "security zone" in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UK Disappointed over EU Court Ruling on Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain has expressed
disappointment over the European Court's dismissal of the a
British bid to suspend a global ban on British beef products
exports, but vowed to continue its legal fight against the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the European Court of Justice rejected
earlier today the British appeal, saying "they have rejected
Britain's case in its entirety" because of the "paramount
importance" of protecting public health.
</P>
<P>
Reponding to the Court ruling, British Prime Minister John
Major is quoted as saying this afternoon that the dismissal of
Britain's bid to end the beef ban "is very disappointing and
frankly rather surprising."
</P>
<P>
"We need to continue to restore confidence in British beef. I
think there is no reason not to have confidence in British beef,"
Major said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lynell has made it
clear that the British government intends to pursue its appeal
against the ban at the European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue with our main court action, arguing
strenuously that the ban is unlawful and should be lifted in its
entirety, "Lynell said.
</P>
<P>
Britain had earlier asked the Luxembourg-based Court to lift
all or part of the ban on exports o British beef products and
cattle exports, arguing that the ban was illegal, particularly as
it also concerned exports to non-European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the world-wide ban on British beef products in
March when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between BSE or mad cow disease and its human
equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jocob Disease.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Sees Significant Rise in Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's exports rose 21.7
percent in June against May and 17.5 percent over the same month
of last year, according to the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
The increase was coupled with a drop in the foreign trade
deficit, positive changes in the structure of exports and a
redirection of exports from transition countries to countries of
the European Union, Miroljun Hadzic from the Serbian government's
economics task force has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Belgrade daily Politika which was
published today, Hadzic said the value of exports for June stood
at 163 million U.S. dollars, covering nearly two-thirds of the
imports for the same month.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the foreign-trade deficit had been cut by 50
percent in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The economist told Politika that another positive trend was
that raw materials and semi-manufactures were no longer the sole
exports and that the export of finished products was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials and semi-manufactures account for two-thirds of
the imports, so that domestic producers are well supplied, which
will help increase production, Hadzic said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's economic development began to move forward slowly
since the U.S. economic sanctions against Belgrade was suspended
in December of last year.

<HEADLINE> Santer Appeals to Clinton over Helms Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- European Commission(EC) President
Jacques Santer yesterday wrote to President Bill Clinton asking
him to exercise the discretion available to the US President to
grant a waiver under the Helms Burton legislation, a EC spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton can decide by 15 July to grant such a waiver
for a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Mr Santer reminded the US President
of the "widespread concern" in Europe over the potential
application of this legislation to European companies, as
expressed in June at the EU/US Summit in Washington and during the
G7 meeting in Lyons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the European Council in Florence in June "expressed
its deep concern over the extraterritorial effects of the Helms
Burton Act and believes that such action taken against partners
and allies does nothing to advance our common cause in Cuba".
</P>
<P>
In a separate aid-memoir delivered to the US authorities this
week, the EC stated that the EU Council of Ministers has already
started to work on the identification of possible retaliatory
measures to be applied should the Helms Burton Act come into force
unaltered.

<HEADLINE> South Africa, Zambia to Run Joint Gemstone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The local Kalanga Gemstones
Company and South African investors have earmarked about two
billion Kwacha (nearly two million US Dollars) for a joint
gemstone project in Ndola, northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be operational from early next week
after all equipment arrives at the site, according to today's
Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
An exploration team from South Africa is already in Zambia to
launch the project, which was abandoned last year because of lack
of enough funds.
</P>
<P>
It may take at least three months before tangible results can
be produced, the newspaper quoted Managing Director of the
project Paul Wellings as saying in Ndola on Thrusday.
</P>
<P>
Equipment such as earth movers, tractors, water pumps and
vehicles have been made available by the South African partners.
</P>
<P>
If the project proves a success, high quality stones will be
exported to the world market, where there is a high demand for
Zamiban emeralds.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles, Princess Diana Agree to Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Britrain's Prince Charles and
Princess Diana will start divorce proceedings on Monday, to end
their 15-year marriage in six weeks, Buckingham Palace announced
in a statement this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The princess would no longer be addressed as Her Royal Highness
and would in future be known as Diana, Princess of Wales,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
After the divorce Diana will no longer be a member of the royal
family. But she will be "regarded" as such by Queen Elizabeth and
Charles, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A question mark hangs over how the royal divorce settlement
will be funded. As Duke of Cornwall, Prince Charles receives more
than 1 million pounds (1.5 million US dollars) a year from the
duchy's estate.
</P>
<P>
But the divorce package runs into millions of pounds --
together with an annual income in the region of 400000 pounds
(600000 US dollars) for running her private office.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, the precise figures should
not be revealed, but is said to be worth at least 15 million
pounds (22.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The BBC interview with the Princess in which she admitted
adultery was clearly the deciding factor in influencing the Queen
to press for a divorce. Earlier in the year, on national TV, the
Prince had also confessed to infidelity.

<HEADLINE> France Remains Much Behind in Cutting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- France remains too much behind its
allies in reducing military spendings, and in order to be in line
with them, France needs to cut its annual military budget by 40 to
80 billion more francs (8 to 16 billion U.S. dollars), said a
study published by the Finances Publiques periodical in its latest
issue.
</P>
<P>
The study, written by Marc Aufrant, director of the National
Institute of Statistics and Economic Study (INSEE) in Paris, said
that in contrast with its allies, France did not start to cut its
conventional military force from 1985, when the East-West
relations began to experience a detente.
</P>
<P>
"If in the year 2002 France has a professional army of 250,000
men, it will have realized a reduction of military personnel
identical with that of its allies but eight more years late,"
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, other big military powers of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) began to scale down their defense spendings by
closing military bases, cutting armament projects in public
enterprises and military research projects, and reducing
paramilitary forces, said Aufrant.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1994, the United States cut its military
spendings by 17 percent, Britain by 20 percent and Germany by 21
percent, while France increased its military spending by 2
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aufrant said the although President Jacques Chirac has decided
to scale down France's military spending to 185 billion francs (37
billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, this still represents 3.1 percent
of the country's GDP, and is above 2.8 percent of Britain and 1.8
percent of Germany.
</P>
<P>
This means that each Frenchman or Frenchwoman will still spend
4,240 francs (765 U.S. dollars) annually on military spending, as
is compared with 590 dollars in Britain and 438 dollars in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the total military spending of France in
1994 was 246 billion francs (49 billion U.S. dollars), and the
country's army was the largest among European Union members with
506,000 men that year, representing 0.9 percent of the country's
population.
</P>
<P>
The military force personnel represent only 0.4 percent of the
population in Britain and Germany, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"If one agrees that the surplus (military) cost has been
financed by public debts with a mean interest rate of 8 percent
since 1985, one can estimate the accumulated amount of the total
debts to be 400 billion francs (80 billion U.S. dollars) in early
1996,"said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that France's spending in conventional military
armaments increased by 10 percent from 1985 to 1994, while its
spending in nuclear armament dropped by 40 percent in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that spending in military equipments increased
by 2 percent between 1985 and 1994 in France, while it fell by 49
percent in the United States, by 30 percent in Britain and 50
percent in Germany.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Plunged in New Wave of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland has plunged into a
further wave of violence as 1300 protestants were allowed to march
through a Roman Catholic area of Londonderry today, according to
reports reaching here from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The march is an annual event by protestants when they celebrate
the "glorious 12th of July" to mark a 300-year-old victory over an
invading Catholic King.
</P>
<P>
The reversed-decision by police triggered a new wave of
violence. During several hours of rioting, police said 41
civilians and 11 officers were hurt in clashes in which over 900
petrol bombs rained down on police lines and shops were torched.
</P>
<P>
Lines of riot police threw a security cordon around the lower
Ormeau Road near the center of Belfast to keep Catholic
residents off the street as one group of Protestants paraded
through the area.
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholic residents, some of whom were hemmed into their
homes by armoured police vehicles, screamed taunts at police and
marchers, who want to maintain the province's links with Britain,
as the parade went through.
</P>
<P>
Martin Mcguiness of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, said today the police decision to allow the
marches left little expectations of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, Britain's partner in efforts
to find a peace deal, has also told British Prime Minister John
Major the decision was mistaken.

<HEADLINE> Greek Export Boom to Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Though Greek trade is supposed to
be mainly oriented towards the European Union, its exports to the
neighboring Balkan countries have rocketed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the panhellenic association of exporters
showed that in 1995 there was a sharp increase in exports to such
countries as Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Slovenia and
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
These countries absorbed Greek exports totaling 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars, which gives these countries some of the top
positions, in some cases supplanting even European countries and
the U.S. as the leading importers of Greek products.
</P>
<P>
The association disclosed that exports to non-EU member
countries increased by 36 percent in dollars terms. Topping the
list for the first nine months of 1995 was Bulgaria with 326
million dollars, followed by Albania with a surprising 250
million. The figures make Bulgaria the fifth largest importer of
Greek goods, for the first time supplanting the U.S. from that
position.
</P>
<P>
Other major regional importers are Turkey with 154 million
dollars, Romania with 109 million, the republics of former
Yugoslavia with 64 million and the Ukraine with 41 million.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Growth Strongest Since 1990 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's retailers are enjoying
their best trading conditions for more than six years as stronger
consumer confidence prompts a rush to the shops, according to the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) today.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's distributive trades survey, published today, showed
that in June, almost two-thirds of retailers were seeing higher
sales than a year ago, the strongest month for retailers since
January 1990.
</P>
<P>
Companies across all retailing sectors except specialist food
shops reported a rise in sales compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The employers' organization said it was the ninth successive
month in which retail activity had risen, and business is set to
remain well above average in July.
</P>
<P>
This should be good news for the government, which is pinning
its election hopes on a revival of the feelgood factor among
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The figures provide some of the strongest and timely support
for the upbeat consumer spending predictions made by the
Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, in his summer economic forecast
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that tax cuts, lower interest rates and rising
personal incomes mean that spending will be growing at a healthy
annual rate of 4.25 percent by next year.

<HEADLINE> UN Extends Mandate of Observer Mission in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) for an additional period
terminating on January 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously, the council decided that
the extension is subject to a review by the council of the mandate
of the UNOMIG in the event of any changes that may be made in the
mandate of the Collective Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS peacekeeping force).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council noted with deep concern the continued
failure by the Georgian government and the Abkhaz side to resolve
their differences due to the uncompromising position taken by the
Abkhaz side.
</P>
<P>
It underlined the necessity for them to intensify without delay
their efforts, under the auspices of the United Nations and with
the assistance of the Russian Federation as facilitator, to
achieve an early and comprehensive political settlement of the
conflict, including on the political status of Abkhazia within the
State of Georgia, which fully respects the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The council demanded that the Abkhaz side accelerate
significantly the process of voluntary return of refugees and
displaced persons without delay or preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The council condemned ethnically motivated killings and other
ethnically related acts of violence, condemned the laying of mines
in the Gali region, and called upon the parties to take all
measures in their power to prevent mine laying and to cooperate
fully with the UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang Xuexian, Chinese acting permanent
representative to the United Nations, said at the Security Council
that it was the crux of the political settlement of the Georgia
question that whether or not this newly-independent member state
would continue to maintain its sovereignty and territorial
integrity or be dismembered.
</P>
<P>
"The position of the council on this question is a clear-cut
one, i.e. the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia
must be respected and a comprehensive political settlement of the
Georgia question must proceed within this framework," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties concerned, particularly the Abkhaz
authorities, to take concrete actions in a realistic approach and
focus on settling the political status of Abkhazia so as to
advance the peace process in Georgia and enable the Georgian
people of all ethnic groups to live and work in peace and
contentment at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The Abkhaz authorities attempted to separate from Georgia
though Abkhaz accounted for less than 20 percent of the local
population in this multi-ethnic northwestern region of Georgia in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The conflict escalated into a series of armed confrontations in
mid-1992 when the Georgian government deployed troops there to
protect railway and certain communication links in Abkhazia,
strategically located on the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire agreement was reached on September 3, 1992, in
Moscow by Georgia, the leadership of Abkhazia and the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to establish the UNOMIG in August
1993 to monitor the cease-fire, to investigate cease-fire
violations and to attempt to resolve such incidents with the
parties involved. The UNOMIG consists of 125 persons at present.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Private Meeting With Assad Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said today that he would not rule out having a private
meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad if there was such an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether there exists the possibility of
any private meeting with the Syrian leader, asked by a New York TV
program in an interview, Netanyahu said, "I would not rule them
out at all if we had the opportunity."
</P>
<P>
He was also reported to tell the U.S. Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee that the starting point for peace talks with Syria was
each side's demand that it keep the strategic Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"We want the heights to stay in our hands in order to ensure
the security of the valley. You say it is all yours and we say it
is all ours. That is the starting point for the beginning of
negotiations," he was quoted by Israel's Maariy Daily in Jerusalem
as saying to the U.S. Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights, Syria's territory, was captured by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war, and Syria has even since demanded return
of the land. And the return of the land has been the basis for
peace talks over nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is on his second day of a three-day visit to New
York -- the center of the American Jewish community -- where he
has met with political and business leaders and American Jewish
organizations.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today urged
Cuban exiles to observe U.S. law and stay out of Cuban waters
during a planned flotilla protest near the island nation.
</P>
<P>
A flotilla of privately owned vessels from Florida, accompanied
by aircraft, intends to conduct a protest in international waters,
close to Cuban territorial seas and airspace, Saturday. The
demonstration is reportedly organized by the Cuban exile group
Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
"We urged the Democracy Movement and all the participants in
Saturday's flotilla to observe U.S. law and refrain from entering
Cuban territorial waters during this event," White House spokesman
Mike McCurry said at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made after the organizers of the
demonstration said that they did not rule out going into Cuban
waters.
</P>
<P>
During a press briefing later in the day, U.S. State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns repeated the statement by the White House
and called on the participants of the demonstration not to enter
into Cuba's territorial waters.

"give a precise statement on France's Africa policy," French
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said today.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will pay a visit to Gabon and Congo on July 16-18, his

<HEADLINE> US Military Target Underground Weapon Plants in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military hope soon to
accomplish what they dared not attempt in the Gulf war -- to blow
up underground weapons plants in the region, according to the
latest U.S. weekly newspaper Defense News report.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by their inability to destroy suspected nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons plants in Iraq for fear of deadly
emissions, the U.S. military are investigating some 45 million
U.S. dollars in an attempt to culminate in the destruction of mock
weapon plants being built in the New Mexico desert, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials are developing a host of new munitions,
sensors and planting systems that will be tested against mock-ups
of real-world facilities in exercises planned for late next year.
</P>
<P>
The development and testing of this array of new systems is
being carried out by the Pentagon's counter-proliferation
Advanced Concept and Technology Demonstration program.
</P>
<P>
The program began earlier this year and will end in late 1997
or early 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
To test the effectiveness of the new systems being tested, two
facilities are being constructed at the U.S. Air Force's White
Sands Missile range in New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Perry: US Troops in Bosnia May Further Be Adjusted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry announced today that the Pentagon may further adjust the
16,000-strong American contingent in Bosnia while keeping its
present level of the military strength to deal with any threat in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops are the main part of the 60,000 NATO-led
multinational force to help implement the peace agreement in the
war-torn former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Perry said last week that he will replace two U.S. armored
units in Bosnia with military police battalions which are believed
to be more effective in the post-war reconstruction and in helping
keep order during the September elections.
</P>
<P>
"Other adjustments for the force may follow in the weeks
ahead," the Pentagon chief said in a speech to the U.S. military
Women Officers' Professional Association. "But we still have
enough tanks, helicopters and other firepower to take on any
threat that we could expect."
</P>
<P>
Perry stressed that there will be no reduction in the U.S.
force size until after the Bosnian elections are held on September
14.
</P>
<P>
"We will maintain a highly capable force until the
(peacekeeping) mission is over," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the American troops,
which entered Bosnia late last year, will stay in the Balkan
nation for no longer than 12 months.

NICOSIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has expressed welcome to an
agreement on monitoring cease-fire in Lebanon, reached Friday by
representatives of the U.S., France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon at
a meeting at the U.S. State Department in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides described the
agreement as "a move forward," Cyprus News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good development for the whole region. If the peace
process continues and concludes it will create a new climate
conducive to political and economic cooperation... and a positive
climate for achieving a solution to the Cyprus problem,"
Michaelides said.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation monitoring group will check compliance with
the April 27 cease-fire, which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz
against Hezbollah guerillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The five nations agreed that the United States and France
would be the rotating co-chairmen of the monitoring group, with
Washington holding the post for the first five-month period.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was selected as the venue of the co-chairmen's office,
but the five-nation truce monitoring group will be based in the
southern Lebanese border town of Naquora.
</P>
<P>
The chairmen's office in Cyprus will operate 24 hours to
receive complaints of cease-fire violations.
</P>
<P>
It will also organize meetings of the monitoring group
composed of military representatives to decide within 72 hours
how to handle the complaints.

<HEADLINE> Former Militia Leader Acquitted of Church Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Samir Geagea, a former Christian
militia leader in Lebanon's civil war, was acquitted today by a
Beirut supreme court of a bloody blast in a Maronite Catholic
church near the Lebanese capital two and half years ago.
</P>
<P>
The verdict, which capped a procrastinated judicial procedure on
the case which opened in October, 1994, will contribute to easing
a grieving mood in the Lebanese Christian community when the
parliamentary elections are approaching, political observers here
noted.
</P>
<P>
On grounds of "lack of sufficient evidences," the Judicial
Council pronounced Geagea's innocence of the charges on
masterminding the bombing in the Saideh Najat (the Lady of
Salvation) Church at Zouk Mkail, 15 kilometers north of Beirut,
and of attempting to overthrow the present regime.
</P>
<P>
Geagea, former head of the outlawed "Lebanese Forces"
which took part in the civil war on behalf of the Lebanese
Christians, was arrested one month after the blast occurred on
February 27, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The blast resulted in the killing of nine people and the
wounding of over 50.
</P>
<P>
An announcer of the Sawt Ash-Shaab (Voice of the People) radio,
which broadcast the trial live, described the verdict as
"surprising, contrary to all the expectations and anticipations
in advance of today's session."
</P>
<P>
However, Philipe Khairallah, judge of the Judicial Council,
passed upon the former warlord a 10-year sentence for
"establishing, training and arming military facilities after a
government ban on militia."
</P>
<P>
It took the judge four and half hours to read the
118-page verdict.
</P>
<P>
Besides the church blast, Geagea had been sentenced twice to
life imprisonment with hard labor for committing cold-blooded
killings of his political rivals when the Lebanese civil war was
ending.
</P>
<P>
Police had tightened security measures throughout the capital
before today's session, held in the Justice Palace in central Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Many Christian leaders, including Cardinal Nasrallah Butros
Sfeir, the Maronite Catholic patriarch, complained that the
trial was unfair since it was politically motivated in order
to humiliate the Christians, whose dominant position had been
badly weakened as a result of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Geagea, 44, a graduate in medicine, joined the Lebanese
Forces when the para-military organization was founded at the
beginning of the civil war and became its Commander-in-Chief
in 1986. The Lebanese Forces were disbanned by the government
in March, 1994.
</P>
<P>
He was the first warlord put on trial since the end of
the war in 1990. The 15-year civil war left up to 200,000
dead, 300,000 wounded, forced around a million people to
depart the country and caused losses estimated at 25 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The results of trial have drawn concerns of the Lebanese,
and major Beirut newspapers unanimously decided to cancel their
weekend closeup and printed an extra issue on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Bertha Lashes U.S. East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Bertha downgraded to
a tropical storm when it moved through southeastern Virginia early
today after strafing North and South Carolina coasts with winds of
168 kilometers per hour, dumping heavy rain and spawning tornados.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane's winds had diminished to 120 kilometers per hour
by midnight when it approached Norfolk, southeastern Virginia.
But Virginia officials counted "four or five" unconfirmed reports
of tornados and a twister in Smithfield area and Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
High winds prompted authorities to close the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge-Tunnel Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Bertha's gales weakened, but they uprooted trees, overturned
roofs, knocked over road signs and shredded power lines in North
and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
In New Hanover County, North Carolina, 70,000 residents were
left without power and it would not be restored until Sunday or on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Wilmington, roads were blocked by fallen trees. Ocean piers
crumbled under a ferocious surge of water pushed ashore by the
storm, while the wind ripped roofs off buildings and toppled the
ferris wheel at Jubilee Park in nearby Carolina Beach.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane had intensified as it moved over the warm waters
of the Gulf Stream close to shore. Sustained winds climbed from
128 kilometers per hour on Friday to 170 kilometers per hour as it
made landfall at a Carolina coastline, where tens of thousands of
residents and vacationers fled to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
The storm claimed at least six lives during its trek this week
through the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Leeward Islands and Puerto
Rico in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Winds of 48 to 64 kilometers per hour were expected in the
Washington area today with as much as 15 centimeters of rain
possible in parts of the Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts closed five state coastal beaches on Friday and
campers in at least 27 inland parks were warned about the dangers
of flash floods and falling trees, local media reports said.

<P>
SARAJEVO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has promised
millions of dollars in aid for the reconstruction of the war-torn
Bosnia regions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, who visited Sarajevo
early Friday, said that the money will be used for road and
railway projects, and air traffic personnel training in Bosnia and
neighboring Croatia.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about peace and prosperity of the regions,
saying that economic growth "can provide the commercial
underpinnings for peace."
</P>
<P>
Kantor's trip was seen as an emotional tribute to his
predecessor, Ron Brown, who was killed in a plane crash at
Dubrovnik with 33 others in April after their plane overshot the
airport during a storm.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he was to "carry through the Commerce
Department mission begun by Secretary Brown and those who were
lost with him."
</P>
<P>
He also went to Tuzla, the northern Bosnian city serving as
the main base for the U.S. troops in the NATO-led Bosnian peace
mission later Friday.

<HEADLINE> EU Court Rejects Second British Bid on Beef Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Court of Justice
rejected today a second British bid to lift an European Union (EU)
global ban on Britain's beef exports, saying it concerns the
responsibility to protect public health.
</P>
<P>
The court denied a request by the British National Farmers'
Union to lift the ban or at least lift that part of it relating to
exports of British beef to non-EU countries.
</P>
<P>
But president of the Luxembourg-based EU Court of First
Instance, Antonio Saggio, acting on behalf of the full court,
rejected the request, saying that the European Commission had not
overreached its jurisdiction in imposing the ban.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the ban on exports to non-EU countries, Saggio
said there was a significant danger that British beef could be
re-exported into the 15-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
The full case will be heard later in the year, with a decision
some months afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The ban on British beef was imposed in March after reports of a
possible link between mad cow disease, formally known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and a fatal human equivalent.
</P>
<P>
Consumer fear following the report led to a sharp drop in beef
sales across Europe.

<HEADLINE> Quake Mother Says Thank-You 20 Years On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A mother who gave birth to
twin sons as an earthquake wiped her city off the face of the
earth has finally met the doctors who saved their lives.
</P>
<P>
The mother was suffering complications during the delivery of
her twins 20 years ago when a massive earthquake destroyed the
Chinese city of Tangshan on July 28, 1976.
</P>
<P>
She feared that she and her newly born sons would die. But
their lives were saved by a team of Shanghai doctors who raced to
the devastated city where over 240,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The 17 lifesaving doctors were among a group of 40 Shanghai
medics to visit the newly built Tangshan today, twenty years after
the quake.
</P>
<P>
And one of the first to greet them in the city's Tangshan
Monument Square was the thankful mother -- accompanied by her
grown-up twins, Bu Shuangsheng and Bu Shuanglai.
</P>
<P>
"For the past 20 years, it has been my biggest wish to see the
Shanghai doctors who saved both my two sons and myself," said the
grateful mother.
</P>
<P>
A slim girl and her father also visited Tangshan Monument
Square, looking for the doctor who helped them twenty years ago.
</P>
<P>
"My baby was only 1.7 kg when she was born, and everybody
believes that she would not have survived without the doctors, and
the nurses who fed her every two hours," noted the father.
</P>
<P>
"We encouraged her to apply to the Shanghai Medical University
during the recent nationwide Entrance Collage Examination, just
because we think this is the best way for our whole family to
thank the doctors who helped us," said the father.
</P>
<P>
During their poignant return visit to Tangshan the doctors
offered medical advice to the people of the city. In July 1976
Tangshan became known to everybody in the world as reports of the
devastating quake were made.
</P>
<P>
Among the 40 visiting doctors, 17 of them dashed to the rescue
when the city was hit by the quake in 1976. They are in the new
Tangshan at the invitation of the municipal government on the eve
of the 20th anniversary of the quake.
</P>
<P>
In the busy square today the doctors offered free medical
advice and help. But many of the people who visited the square
just wanted to say hello, and a thank you from the bottom of their
hearts.

<HEADLINE> Two Drug Smugglers Killed in Clash with Police in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Two drug traffickers were killed
today in a clash with armed policemen in Iran's northeastern
Khorassan province bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that the smugglers were
encountered by local law enforcement agents patrolling along the
road linking Kalatteh Menar village to Mashhad.
</P>
<P>
An Ak-47 assault rifle and a hand grenade were captured from
the smugglers who carried some 550 kilograms of opium on board a
pick-up truck.
</P>
<P>
In another development, IRNA said that eight drug smugglers
were nabbed Friday in Iran's Central province in the Mamuniyeh
township, on the outskirts of Saveh city, about 120 kilometers
southwest of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
A hand gun and 86 kilograms of hashish were seized from the
culprits, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced late June that it confiscated 170 tons of
narcotics in the last Iranian calendar year which ended on March
19.
</P>
<P>
Drug is regarded as one of the main social problems of Iran
since it is one of the best transit for drug to go to Europe and
is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area between
Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest drug-producing
center in the world.

BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic envoys from over 30
countries were given a spectacular view of the Great Wall of
China's new 2.7 million yuan floodlights.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall - one of the Seven Wonders of the World - is
even more wonderful at night when hundreds of high power

</P>
<P>
The diplomats, accompanied by their wives, were impressed as
they view the wall, lit up as far as the eye could see.
</P>
<P>
They climbed the Badaling section of the Great Wall, to the
north of Beijing, and while taking in the grandeur of the wall,
zigzaging across the mountains, they also enjoyed Russian and
Chinese songs and dance, as well as songs and dance from ancient
China's capitals.
</P>
<P>
Some of the visitors sat on the Great Wall to watch the sun
set, as they viewed grand performances, originally given as
rewards by ancient Chinese emperors to their victorious frontier
armies.
</P>
<P>
Some of the envoys went to watch the historic changes and folk
customs of the Great Wall at a nearby circular-screened cinema.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Hold Parliamentary Elections in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon will hold parliamentary
elections in August, the second in four years, the Interior
Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
Electors aged 21 or above will go to the polls in Mount Lebanon
on August 18 and in other governorates on the following four
successive Sundays to choose members of the next 128-seat house,
according to the announcement of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
This announcement came after President Elias Hrawi endorsed the
timetable despite protests from some Christians, who fear they
might lose more power bases if changes prove inevitable regarding
the election law.
</P>
<P>
The parliament Thursday gave a green light to the controversial
election law, which defines Beirut, south Lebanon, north Lebanon
and eastern Beqaa as four constituencies. The move dismayed many
Christians.
</P>
<P>
Three Christian opposition leaders, former President Amin
Jemayel, former Army Commander Michel Aoun and Dory Shamoun,
chairman of the National Liberal Party, have called for a boycott
of the election.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Friday after a meeting of the three leaders
in France, where Jemayel and Aoun are living in exile, said that
the next parliament would be installed "on the illegal
administrative bases supervised by a non-Lebanese administration
pressing for its direct interests at the cost of our crucial and
viable interests."
</P>
<P>
Most Christians and some Moslems boycotted the last
parliamentary election in 1992 on grounds that no just elections
could be held in Lebanon with the presence of the 35,000-strong
Syrian forces in Beqaa and Beirut and some 1,000 Israeli troops in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the call for boycott, George Saade, Chairman of the
Christian mainstream Phalange (Kataeb) Party, said today that the
obstacles and fears leading to the 1992 election were "nothing but
misperceptions."
</P>
<P>
Saade called on all the Lebanese to participate in the
election, saying that boycotting the election "means nothing for
the Phalange Party," which announced Wednesday that 13 candidates
would run in the race.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to predict the turnout since no census has been
conducted for years. The country's population was estimated at
ranging from three million to four million.

<P>
HARARE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- An association to promote studies
and research into Zimbabwe's history was formed here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Led by professor of history, Ngwabi Bhebe of the University of
Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Historical Association (ZIHA), will also
promote and encourage the teaching of history at different levels
of education.
</P>
<P>
''Because of the absence of a strong and dynamic historical
association, the historical profession and the study and writing
of history have been sadly neglected in independent Zimbabwe,''
Bhebe told a meeting to launch ZIHA held at the University of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Because they were not organised, historians in the country had
displayed an unusual timidity or intellectual quietness even in
the face of provocation, and rarely intervened in public debate,
he said.
</P>
<P>
ZIHA membership intends to penetrate and permeate all
Zimbabwe's universities, teacher training colleges, high schools
and primary schools, he added.

<HEADLINE> Taihu Lake Threatened by Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Taihu Lake is under
the threat of flood because of prolonged downpours during the
rainy-season.
</P>
<P>
The water level in the lake, in southern Jiangsu Province, has
surpassed the warning level, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The rain has been caused by cold and warm air currents above
the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, due to a
sub-tropical high-pressure belt moving north.
</P>
<P>
According to meteorological departments in Suzhou, Wuxi and
Changzhou -- three major cities around the lake, the rainfall has
averaged about 70 mm since July 10. Since the beginning of the
rainy season in early June, the rainfall in southern Jiangsu has
surpassed 400 mm, doubling the amount in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
By yesterday morning, the average water level in the lake had
reached 4.18 meters, nearing the danger level of 4.2 m. Sluices
have been opened to release a flow of 200 cubic meters a second.
</P>
<P>
Because there is no end in sight over the coming days to the
rain, officials say, the situation for the lake is increasingly
severe.
</P>
<P>
The three cities have sent patrols to monitor the dams around
the clock.

<HEADLINE> Proposal for Formation of HK SAR Selection Committee Agreed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee members can first propose a list of
candidates for the Selection Committee according to the
nomination. After that the directors' meeting of the Preparatory
Committee can put forward candidates, after fully considering the
opinions of the preparatory Committee members.
</P>
<P>
On the method of the election, it has been suggested that all
members of the Preparatory Committee can cast votes for members of
every sector of the Selection Committee. The election will be
conducted by secret ballot. Those who win the most votes will be
elected.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six Hong Kong deputies to the National People's
Congress, who are permanent Hong Kong residents, will be members
of the Selection Committee without election.
</P>
<P>
The number of members of the Selection Committee from the
original political personages will be 40. There will be 34
representatives of the Hong Kong members of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, those belonging to the fourth
sector, who intend to take part in the Selection Committee, can
enter their names to the organization of their own sector, or
organizations of other sectors. They can be nominated to the
Preparatory Committee after their personal capacities are
testified by relevant organizations. They can also be nominated
jointly by five Preparatory Committee members.
</P>
<P>
However, the total number of nominated Selection Committee
members by every Preparatory Committee member cannot exceed
three. The method for raising the names of candidates from the
fourth sector, and for the election, will be the same as in the
first three sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Panel members held that those belonging to multi-sectors
can take part in the election in only one sector. Any candidate
can be elected only by one sector.
</P>
<P>
Those candidates from the first three sectors, and candidates
in the capacity of members of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, cannot take
part in the fourth sector's election or consultations.
</P>
<P>
The panel decided to submit this specific method for the
formation of the Selection Committee to the Fourth plenary Session
of the preparatory Committee to be held on August 9 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The work for the formation of the Selection Committee will
begin after this method is approved by the Preparatory Committee
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Kipketer Rejects Kenyan Olympic Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- World 800-meter champion Wilson
Kipketer on Saturday turned down an offer by the IOC to run for
Kenya at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The refusal of Kipketer, Kenyan-born but who runs for Denmark,
has come after great efforts by the IOC to have him included.
</P>
<P>
International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) rules permit
Kipketer to run for Denmark, but Olympic qualification is more
stringent.
</P>
<P>
The IOC would only let him run for Denmark in the Olympics once
he attained full nationality or if Kenya renounced its claim on
him.
</P>
<P>
However, at Friday's meeting the national Olympic Committees of
Kenya and Denmark surprisingly ruled to allow him to run under
Kenya's flag.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were being made to contact Kipketer who was reportedly
somewhere in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Government Soon To Respond to Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's President Sylveste
Ntibantunganya has ordered a special team to respond to the
peacekeeping proposal made by the June 25 Great Lakes summit
before July 15.
</P>
<P>
intended to halt ethnic killings in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a state radio broadcast monitored here today, President
Ntibantunganya urged a technical committee to report up to July
15 to the powerful National Security Council which will then
report to presidents of the Great Lakes Region by July 20.
</P>
<P>
On the tasks of the technical committee, the Burundian
president said that the first obejctive of the commitee is to
protect the entire people against anything that could jeopardise
their security. And the second is to protect the country's
socio-economic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee's focus would be implementation of the
"Arusha summit conclusions on Burundi".
</P>
<P>
The president's order followed mediator Julius Nyerere's
speech on situation in Burundi. Former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere warned yesterday that Burundi risked "peace enforcement"
by powerful heighbours if parties in Burundi failed to agreed on
the Arusha conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said Africa must not allow Burundi to degenerate into
genocidal killings as happened in neighbouring Rwanda where up to
a million people died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people have died over the past three years
in Burundi in fighting between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi army.
The ethnic killings are claiming some 1,000 lives each month
there.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's crisis has worsened since its Hutu president and
Tutsi prime minsiter requested regional security assistance at
the summit of Great Lakes region held on June 25 in Arusha of
Tanzania. The regional peacekeeping plan calls for the sending of
troops from Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia into Burundi in order
to halt the ethnic killing in the country. But the plan has been
opposed by hardliners in the army, dominated by the Tutsi
minority, and the largest exiled rebel group of the majority
Hutus as well as the main party representing the powerful Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Proposal for Formation of HK SAR Selection Committee Agreed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A formula has been reached on the
way the first government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) will be selected, once China regains sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Selection Committee panel of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR have reached a consensus on a
proposal about the specific method for the formation of the
Selection Committee of the first government of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The result came after full discussions during the fifth
Selection Committee panel meeting, which was held in Beijing
between July 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
According to the stipulation of a relevant decision made by the
National People's Congress, the Selection Committee should be
composed of 400 permanent Hong Kong residents from four
sectors: industrial, commercial and financial; professionals;
labor, social services, religious and other sectors; and original
political personages, Hong Kong deputies to the National People's
Congress, as well as Hong Kong members of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Each
sector will comprise 100 Selection Committee members.
</P>
<P>
Under the formula the 300 members of the Selection Committee
from the first three sectors will be elected by all members of the
Preparatory Committee, by using a calculation on the number of
candidates, rather than that of seats. The proportion between the
number of candidates and seats will be 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Those from the first three sectors who want to be involved in
the election must first enter their names to their own
organizations (except political organizations) or their sectors
and professions. After their personal capacities are testified by
the relevant organizations, they can be nominated to the
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The name list of nominations will be edited by the Secretariat
of the Preparatory Committee after the closing date for names. The
list will then be given to all members of the Preparatory
Committee to solicit opinions.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
appealed to the Sudanese government to allow it to air-drop food
aid in southern rebel held areas of Sudan, a report reaching here
today said.
</P>
<P>
WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini told a press
confernece at the United Nations headquarters that half a million
people are now seriously hungry in Sudan's southern provice Bahr
El-Ghazal and 200,000 people are also affected outside that
province in the rebel held south.
</P>
<P>
According to Bertini, Sudan has stopped the flights, claiming
that the WFP had been involved in arms deliveries to rebels in
the area. He said that Sudan's decision is a clear violation of
the 1989 accord which has allowed WFP and the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF ) to cross battle lines and reach an
estimated one million people in both rebel and government
controlled areas in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The WFP urgently appeals to the government of the Sudan to
allow the flights to resume without preconditions that would
compromise our neutrality," Bertini stressed.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Hold Parliamentary Elections in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is to hold parliamentary
elections in August, the Lebanese Interior Ministry announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Electors will go to the polls in Mount Lebanon on April 18
and in other governorates on the following four successive
Sundays to elect members of the next parliament, according to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Parliament Thursday approved a election law, which
defines Beirut, south Lebanon, north Lebanon and eastern Beqaa as
four constituencies. The Christian-predominated governorate of
Mount Lebanon will hold the election on the basis of the six
districts under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Three Christian opposition leaders, former President Amin
Jemayel, former Army Commander Michel Aoun and Dory Shamoun,
chairman of the National Liberal Party, have called for a boycott
of the parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
They said in a statement issued Friday after a meeting of the
three leaders in France, where Jemayel and Aoun are living in
exile, that the next parliament would be installed "on the
illegal administrative bases supervised by a non-Lebanese
administration pressing for its direct interests at the cost of
our crucial and viable interests."
</P>
<P>
Most Christians and some Muslims boycotted the last
parliamentary election in 1992 on grounds that no just elections
could be held in Lebanon with the presence of 35,000-strong Syrian
forces in Beqaa and Beirut and some 1,000 Israeli troops in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the call for boycott, George Saade, Chairman of the
Christian mainstream Phalange (Kataeb) Party, said today that the
obstacles and fears leading to the 1992 election were "nothing but
misperceptions."
</P>
<P>
Saade called on all the Lebanese to participate in the
election, saying that boycotting the election "mean nothing for
the Phalange Party," which announced Wednesday 13 candidates will
run the race.

<HEADLINE> National Defence Policy Committee Established in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State Sani Abacha
yesterday announced the establishment of the national defence
policy committee in a bid to strengthen the defence system of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of recent events and developments in the
strategic global environment, therefore, the government is, by
this move, aiming at an improved defence policy.
</P>
<P>
Besides strengthening the system, Abacha also approved an
enhanced welfare package for the armed forces. The measures were
announced at the graduation ceremony of the National War College
course four in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Membership of the committee will be drawn from the military
and the academia.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the establishment of the committee, Abacha
said Nigeria's defence policy should be comprehensive enough to
address all the determining factors that have to be aggregated to
ensure ''not only our survival but also our continued
socio-economic development''.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigeria has continuously pursued a policy of
accommodation, good neighborliness and non-expansionism and that
Nigeria's defece policy has been one of deterrence of potential
agressors.
</P>
<P>
But ''it is not enough to deter a potential agressor,
deterrence must be accompanied by the capacity to repel and
attack, '' said the Nigerian head of state.
</P>
<P>
He urged the plugging of holes in the system so as to
effectively ward off foreign attacks.
</P>
<P>
''It is for this reason that i wish to darw attention to one
area of inherrent weakness in our defence strategy. that is the
fact that much of our military hardware is purchased abroad. This
point becomes even more painful today given the hostile global
environment vis-a-vis our relations with key players in the
current unipolar global system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the governament has decided to establish a petroleum
trust fund to specifically afford the welfare needs of the armed
forces and the police with effect from January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Abacha did not deliborate the welfare package, but said ''We
are convinced that a demoralised military cannot be motivated to
peak performance. Here lies the importance of the issues of
welfare.''

<HEADLINE> South African President Arrives in Paris for State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela arrived here this morning for a four-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will discuss with his French counterpart, Jacques
Chirac, and French enterprise leaders about strengthening economic
cooperation between the two countries, which leg much behind that
existing between other industrialized countries and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He will also attend the French National Day military parade on
the Champs-Elysees Sunday and join a garden party for the occasion
afterwards, which is held annually in the Elysee Palace.
</P>
<P>
According to Agence France Presse (AFP), one of Mandela's
objectives here is to draw more investment from France to South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South African president will meet Monday and Tuesday some
French entrepreneurs, including the country's "boss of bosses"
Jean Gandois, who is president of the National Center of French
Employers.
</P>
<P>
France did not show much eagerness to invest in South Africa
during the past few years because it was uncertain about the
post-apartheid era in the country, doubting its political
stability in the future due to Mandela's expected departure in
1999, said an AFP report.
</P>
<P>
The rising crime rate in South Africa is another reason for
French enterprises to be hesitant to go there, the report added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Exports of Petroleum Products Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports of petroleum
products rose by about 47 percent on a value basis in the first
half of this year over the same period last year, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The jump was attributed by ministry officials to the increase
of volume shipments and price rises in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Rises both in shipment volume and unit export prices jacked up
the country's oil product exports by 46.6 percent to 1.49 billion
U.S. dollars, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The export amount soared by 27.3 percent, while the unit
shipment price climbed 14.1 percent from 19.1 dollars to 21.8
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
By product type, South Korea shipped out high-sulphur diesel
and jet oil for which the domestic demand is slow.
</P>
<P>
The capacity buildup to be completed in the second half of the
year will help maintain the brisk pace of export growth, a
ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's petroleum product exports will amount to 3.2
billion dollars for the whole of this year, up 36 percent over
last year, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Softened Tone Fails to Calm down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's reported commitment to the agreements signed by the
Labor Party failed to calm down the anger of the Arab world caused
by his harsh remarks at the U.S. congress Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Israel Television Friday night that his
government intends to honor all official agreements signed by the
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Although the Likud Party does not like the Oslo peace accord,
its government will keep to every clause in them, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged the Palestinian Authority to stop diplomatic
activities in the Orient House, east Jerusalem, to avoid
confrontations with the Israeli government. This has offset his
softened tone and failed to satisfy the worrying Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of America Friday night,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said the fresh conditions laid
down by Netanyahu for the resumption of the peace process on the
Palestinians, Syrian and Lebanese tracks constitute an
interference in the internal affairs of the Palestinians and the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
"peace is not only a Palestinian or Arab need, but also a need
for Israel and the whole world in the light of the strategic
position of the Middle East," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
On the Orient House, Arafat said that Netanyahu failed to
remember it was opened when the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) went to attend the Madrid conference co-sponsored by the
U.S. and Russia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Arafat noted that Netanyahu should understand that Israel's peace
with the Palestinians is linked to its peace with the Arab nations
and is the base of the whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Palestinian-Israeli agreements are not
bilateral deals, but international accords under the supervision
of the peace process sponsors and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is
Israel's closest Arab friend, Friday also described Netanyahu's
hardline stances as a "deviation from terms of the Middle East
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said that
Jordan would convey concern over Netanyahu's "tough positions"
when he visits Jordan next week.
</P>
<P>
"While we agree with Netanyahu there could be no peace without
security, this security cannot be attained without attaining just
and comprehensive peace," said Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, believed to be frustrated by Netanyahu's repeated
adherence to an uncompromising position, fears that his policies
could destablize the region.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels' Operation Center in Colombo Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police has confirmed
that the rebel's cache of weapons found on Friday was a highly
sophisticated operational center of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Deputy Inspector General of Police B. Dissanayake said that
this operational center at Wellawatte, a residential area in
Colombo, had been functioning for the last three years. The cache
house was equipped with a fax machine, telephones, computers and
an underground facility.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the owner of the house was presently based
in the Middle East, the police will investigate whether there was
any Middle East connection with the latest rebel operation in
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The police head pointed out that a disaster had been averted by
Friday's successful raids on the rebel operational center with the
arrest of 7 men and a woman and the seizure of weapons including
100 kilograms of dynamite, a T-56 automatic rifle, 550 rounds of
ammunition, a car and a jeep.
</P>
<P>
This strongly indicated that the Tamil rebels had planned to
bomb some targets in Colombo by remote control, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 12 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The unbelievable Earvin
Magic Johnson led his Magic All-stars to defeat the Chinese
Olympic team 112-88 on Friday when he scored 25 points, eight
assists and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
China, who lost the U.S. Dream Team by 61 points Wednesday in
Phoenix, began with a 13-11 advantage on Zheng Wu's jump five
minutes into the game before Jim Farmer's three-pointer shot,
which gave the Magic's team a 14-13 lead, and never came back
through the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
This is the Chinese team's second of three warm-up matches in
the United States before the Atlanta Olympics. China will play the
Lakers here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Magic is still unbelievable," said the Chinese coach Gong
Luming. "He is getting old and is not as good as his past
physically but his experiences and skills are still existion,
which are really deserved to be learn by us. If there was no Magic
in his team, maybe we had chance to win."
</P>
<P>
Johnson score 15 points, including a dunk on his third field
goal in the first half when the All-star built a 59-42 edge.
</P>
<P>
Johnson also had several no-look passes before he left the
court with four minutes left when his team led the score at
102-76.
</P>
<P>
Former NBA player Farmer lead the Magic All-star with 26 points
including six three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Four Chinese players scored double-figure, compared to the game
against the Dream Team Wednesday. Hu Weidong scored 23 points for
China, including five of 10 in the three-pointer line. He was
followed by Su Jun, 14 and Zheng Wu, 11.
</P>
<P>
19-year-old center Wang Zhizhi, who led the visitors Wednesday
with 12 points, seven rebounds and the Chinese only one blocked
shot, contributed 10 points, six rebounds and two blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
"We were better in the defense than we did in the last game
with the Dream Team," Gong said. "Also we produced some very good
chance to score and make it."
</P>
<P>
Magic's team, which travels and plays in other countries on a
regular basis, also includes former NBA players Mike McGee, Larry
Spriggs, La Salle Thompson and John Williams and

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Operation Launched in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- About 350 police officers on
Friday launched a one-day anti-drug operation on Hong Kong Island,
arresting 14 people and seizing 28 grams of heroin, a spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
The operation, starting from 5:00 a.m. Friday to 1:30 a.m.
today, resulted in the arrest of 14 people, aged between 16 and
48, and the seizure of 28 grams of heroin, 1,042 tablets of
ROCHE15 and one bottle of part one poison.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said these people were arrested for possessing
and trafficking in dangerous drugs, illegally selling part one
poison, breaching liquor license condition and possessing dutiable
goods.
</P>
<P>
The operation screened 1,636 people at amusement games centers,
karaokes, snooker halls, ice rinks, discos, bars and other usual
hangouts of youths in 93 locations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the operation is the first of a series of
regional anti-drugs and juvenile crimes operations during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
Lionel Lam Kin, the regional police commander, urged young
people to turn away from illicit drugs and triad-related
activities.
</P>
<P>
He warned young people of the danger of being used by triads to
traffic in illicit drugs or being lured to abuse them.
</P>
<P>
He said parents and youths should be watchful especially during
the school summer vacation when young people are always targeted
for criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five radio shows will be staged at Hong Kong's
public housing estates in the coming summer holidays to
disseminate the anti-drug message to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Through the anti-drug shows which target at youngsters and
families, the audience will learn about the harmful effects of
drug abuse, the misconception about drug abuse.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Koreans Shocked About Teenage Rapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government is
reportedly mapping out a comprehensive plan to cope with the ever
increasing number of sexual crimes which has stirred up a public
roar.
</P>
<P>
The reported rape victims are either primary school girls or
middle school students, one of whom gave birth to a child after
starting labor at school in Seoul a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old girl became pregnant after she was raped on her
way home from school in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that she might be expelled from school, the girl was
said to have kept her pregnancy a secret from her teachers,
parents and friends.
</P>
<P>
Another case involved an 11-year-old primary schoolgirl who was
allegedly raped more than 20 times by 14 men, all of whom lived in
her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The case was made public when police launched an investigation
following the girl's attempted suicide by drinking herbicide at
her home in a rural village in Asan, South Chungchong Province.
</P>
<P>
Before the attempted suicide, she wrote a note which contained
the names of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The case caused a shock not only because of the alleged rapes
themselves but because of the indifference of neighbors to her
hardships.
</P>
<P>
The girl had been living with her 75-year-old grandmother since
her parents died when she was a toddler.
</P>
<P>
Another victim is a 14-year-old girl who was raped repeatedly
by adult males, including the owner of a house where she was
living in Pyongchang County, Kwangwon Province.
</P>
<P>
The girl, also without parents, had been living on government
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, serious sexual molestation against minors is also
increasing, with some 10 such cases reported "officially" by
police across the country on July 11 alone.
</P>
<P>
In light of these developments, the local police have launched
a campaign against criminals recently. At least 15 people
suspected of raping or sexually molesting have been arrested in
the past five days.
</P>
<P>
The local news media are carrying articles deploring the
"collapse of ethics" and calling for preventive steps, and
educators are emphasizing the need to strengthen sex education at
schools.
</P>
<P>
Top government officials also began to pay attention. In a
recent parliament speech, Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung described
sexual violence as one of the crimes which undermine the ethics
and morality of society.

<HEADLINE> Bacterial Conjunctivitis Leading Cause of Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Seasonal bacterial
conjunctivitis was identified as the most prevalent eye disease,
often leading to blindness, among the children in the northern
areas of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A blindness survey conducted by the Aga Khan Health Service of
Pakistan (AKHSP) in the north of the country revealed that
allergic conjunctivitis and trachoma conjunctivitis are the two
other main causes of poor vision among the children in the area.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that bacterial conjunctivitis could be easily
managed through simple hygiene and antibiotic drops, acute poverty
in the area hampered the improvement of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Optical error, both myopia and hyperopia, was also singled out
as the most common cause of poor vision, again among the children,
correctable by spectacles but not affordable for the majority.
</P>
<P>
Presbyopia, age-related optical error resulting in difficulty
to focus up close, and age-related cataracts were the most common
cause of poor vision in the sample population over 50 years of
age.
</P>
<P>
The data collected by AKHSP revealed that most of the eye
conditions observed among children as well as adult population
were either preventable, treatable or reversible.
</P>
<P>
In the given situation, AKHSP launched a community-based
primary eye care program for the area involving lady health
visitors (LHVs), community health workers (CHWs) and medical
officers (MOs) in the project, facilitating the introduction of
specialized medicine in the region.
</P>
<P>
AKHSP also plans to review courses and quality assurance
programs for medical officers and LHVs in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- MORO National Liberation Front
(MNLF) Chairman Nur Misuari said on Friday that Philippine
President Fidel Ramos is the "moving force" behind the Mindanao
peace.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the Mindanao State University, Misuari
said it was the sincere desire of the Ramos administration to
bring lasting peace to Mindanao that made him decide to run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is now at hand," he said, "soon, we will see the
transformation of Mindanao from a kind of life that we have today
into a kind of life that is in accord with the dignity as a human
being."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Misuari finally accepted the government's offer for
him to run for governor under the ruling Lakas party in the
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao polls scheduled for
September.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the move signals the ending of the MNLF's
rebelling against the government.
</P>
<P>
Ramos hailed the decision of Misuari the same day and described
it as "a supreme act of statesmanship not only of the MNLF
chairman, but also of all his leaders and followers".
</P>
<P>
Misuari expressed his desire to meet with President Ramos soon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Have No Desire to Persuade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The remarks by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the United States indicate that the
U.S. government may have no desire to persuade Netanyahu to stick
to the land-for-peace principle, an Egyptian state-run newspaper
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, the substance of Netanyahu's statements indicates
that the U.S. government has failed or had no desire to persuade
or compel Netanyahu to stick to concluded agreements and pursue
negotiations in accordance with the Madrid formula, which has been
defended by the United States," the leading Arabic-language
newspaper Al-Ahram said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, speaking at his joint news conference with
U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House Tuesday, voiced
opposition to the land-for-peace principle, a departure from what
the previous Labor government accepted four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Arab states and the international community have called on
Israel to continue the Middle East peace process on the
basis of swapping occupied Arab land for peace. The principle
has been the guideline for Arab-Israeli peace negotiations since
the 1991 Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the U.S. failure to use strong persuasive
measures on Netanyahu is "diminishing the credibility of the
American role in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the paper said, the Arabs have to take
joint actions and cooperate in all fields while seeking
support from all "the other major powers that have positive
attitudes toward the peace settlement issue."
</P>
<P>
"The higher Arab interest should not thus remain contingent
on ... bilateral calculations between the United States and
Israel," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been playing an active role in the Mideast peace process as a
mediator between Israel and the Arabs, particularly the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak visited France early this month
shortly after a pan-Arab summit in Cairo. He will also fly to
Washington later this month.

</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Bureau of Statistics, the previous
week's SPI index increased from 182.99 to 183.53.
</P>
<P>
The upward movement is mainly due to rise in the prices of
onions, eggs, washing soap, electric bulbs and bananas.
</P>
<P>
The index is 9.49 percent higher than the index of the
corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Price Index of 19 kitchen items, consisting of wheat, wheat
flour, pulses, rice, mutton, beef, edible oils, potatoes,
tomatoes, red chilies and garlic for the week ending on July 8,
showed an increase of 0.26 percent as compared with the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to the rising in the prices of
onions.
</P>
<P>
An increase of 10.78 percent was also noted when a comparison
was made with the corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Statistics analysis is based on the
prices of 46 essential items in 12 major urban centers.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Sees Declining Inflation Rate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate controversy
between the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Ministry of Finance
seems to have ended as the World Bank gave its own figure.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank put Nigeria's inflation rate as at the end of
February 1996 at 46.7 percent, tallying with Finance Ministry's
47 percent and at variance with the central bank's 72.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, the country's inflation rate is
declining with prices of goods may be going down slowly in Lagos,
the biggest city of the country, compared with other parts of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts attribute the fall in inflation rate to
government fiscal discipline and effectiveness of Central Bank's
monetary policy which has helped to a large extent in mopping up
excess liquidity from circulation.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank predicted that economic growth of the country
is likely to be a little more rapid in 1996 than 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank revealed that the agricultural sector may
not have a rosy outing in fiscal 1996. Though the sector is
likely to grow at a modest level, it may not reach its potential
as output may continue to be constrained by factors such as
inefficient public sector marketing of agricultural inputs, most
especially fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The bureaucratic bottleneck at the ports has caught the
attention of the World Bank. The World Bank noted that if the
situation at ports did not improve soon, economic activity will
be seriously hampered.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria started rfeforms of its ports at the beginning of this
year with a new clearing system. under the reform measures,
accountants have replaced customs officials in collecting duties
and import duty report has been made madatory for all imports.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the World Bank, the measures, which are
aimded to reduce corruption and improve revenue generation, have
significantly reduced movement of goods at the ports, thereby
threatening the overall performance of the nation's economy.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Corrects Statement by Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Friday night slapped his Diplomatic Adviser Dore Gold
in the face by denying a slanderous statement against the previous
Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Gold said in an interview with Israel Radio Friday that he had
discovered the former Labor government made secret security
concessions to the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Netanyahu in his official visit to the United
States, Gold dropped a bombshell at home. Infuriated by the
accusation, Yossi Beilin, Labor Member of the Knesset and one of
the architects of the Oslo Accords, challenged Gold to provide
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Beilin said, it would further prove that the Likud
government was a government of lies. But Uzi Landau, Chairman of
the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, sided with Gold
by asserting that the revealed story might be true.
</P>
<P>
Landau listed Shimon Peres' letter on Jerusalem as one example
and claimed that there should be hundreds of such letters.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Television, Netanyahu said that he
had found no arrangements with the Palestinians outside the
published Oslo 1 and Oslo 2 accords.
</P>
<P>
After the interview Netanyahu informed his protege and Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh that the basement he was not aware of should
not be made public to the media.
</P>
<P>
He announced through the TV that his government intends to honor
all official agreements signed by the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The hardline Likud leader appeared to soften his tone following
his statements in Washington drew angry reactions from the Arab
world. Faisal Husseini, Member of the PLO Executive Committee,
described them as "a declaration of war" against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Although the Likud Party does not like the Oslo peace
accord, its government will keep to every clause in them,
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged the Palestinian Authority to stop diplomatic
activity in Orient House, PLO's office in East Jerusalem, to
avert confrontation with the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to gradually ease the closure on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip imposed by the Labor government four months ago.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that he could not see any problem
developing in contact with the PA, nor between himself and
(PA President) Yasser Arafat. But he failed to mention when
the meeting will take place.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu pronounced that Israel will use every means to
expand its understanding with the Palestinians. But he added
that they too had to honor their agreements.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Water Sector Open To Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Business enterprises are
now free to invest in the water sector, ending the monopoly
previously enjoyed by the National Urban Water Authority (NUWA),
the Tanzanian Minister for Water said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his ministry's budget of the 1996/97 financial year
to the session of the National Assembly, Minister for Water Pius
Ngowandu said that the country is not capable to realise the
target of supplying clean water to all people in the country by
relying only on the government allocation.
</P>
<P>
"If we have to achieve the water for all target by the year
2000, we will have to allocate 64 billion Tanzania Shillings
(about 100 million U.S. Dollars) to the water sector every year,
a sum of money which the government cannot raise," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that by continuing to depend on government
allocation, Tanzania will not be able to raise enough money to
achieve the target as government revenues are limited.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the businessmen in banks and other financial
institutions to invest in water sectors.
</P>
<P>
He promised to creat a conducive environment to enable
investors undertake their business with ease.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that under the new arrangements of the
country, investors would be allowed to construct, own and manage
water projects for some time before the projects are handed over
to the government. The scheme would allow investors to charge
users until the firm recovers its capital, with an acceptable
profit margin.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngowandu, NUWA is engaging in
discussions with several water companies from abroad to see how
these firms can inject money in the urban water supply systme,
according to the ministery.
</P>
<P>
A number of donors, including the World Bank, the European
Union and the Commonwealth Development Trust Fund have agreed to
aid Tanzania in implementing its strategy for development of
water supply.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Suspends Burundi Aid Convoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI,July 13 (Xinhua)-- The United Nations refugee agency
UNHCR had suspended plans to send an aid convoy to the troubled
Cibitoke Region of Burundi following a threat from a Hutu
grouping that it could be attacked, said a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The convoy, which was to have gone under escort by the Burundi
army, would have been the first of its type to go into the area
since three Swiss staff of the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) were killed there last month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Friday, UNHCR spokesman
Ron Redmond said that the UNHCR's decision to suspend the plan had
been taken after a message from an organisation called the Party for
the Liberation of the Hutu People (PALIPEHUTU ) was sent to a news
organisation in Nairobi on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted the message as saying the convoy would be
entering Cibitoke, where Hutu rebels have stepped up operations
against the Tutsi-dominated army, without PALIPEHUTU's clearance.
</P>
<P>
``If escorted by government troops,'' the message said, the
convoy ``could be at risk.'' It said that the Hutu party's
military wing, the National Forces of Liberation, ``would decline
all responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
``Such a threat has to be taken seriously, especially after
the killing of the ICRC staff members,'' said Redmond. The ICRC
itself has suspended its own operations outside the Burundi
capital, Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said the UNHCR was "very worried" about the
consequences of the suspension. The UNHCR also announced on
Friday it was running out of funds to help nearly two million
refugees from the 1994 civil war in Rwanda and the conflict in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The living conditions of the 5,000 displaced persons and 500
returnees (who had fled previous violence) to whom we want to
bring relief in this area are very difficult,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
``There are problems of malnutrition. We need to bring
urgently food to these people, such as shelter material,
blankets, soap and medicines.
</P>
<P>
``Clinics are closed because there is no more medicine, and
there is no more potable water because the system has been
destroyed,'' Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR convoy, which was to have been a one-day in-and-out
operation, was to have been joined by the U.N. Children's
Emergency Fund and the World Food Program.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Leader Survives Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- P.V. Narasimha Rao will continue
as president of the Indian National Congress as his detractors
could not muster enough courage to demand his resignation at a
crucial meeting on Friday night, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the party's supreme decision-making body, the
Congress Working Committee (CWC), was held at Rao's residence in
the capital and lasted only about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
All those who had planned to remove Rao from the party's
presidentship because of his alleged involvement in a 100,000 US
dollar cheating case were outmaneuvered by the former prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
It was a day of hectic parleys which culminated in an
anti-climax. Rao first summoned CWC member Sharad Pawar, who is
widely believed to be one of the potential successors to Rao in
case of Rao's resignation, to put forward his proposals.
</P>
<P>
Pawar, who appeared to have been persuaded by Rao, summoned
Rao's detractors, including another four CWC members, in turn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were also many communications between Rao's
emissaries such as former external affairs minister Pranab
Mukherjee and Rao's detractors.
</P>
<P>
At the CWC meeting on Friday night, none of the senior CWC
members, who had been openly demanding Rao's resignation in the
past few days, even remotely mentioned anything about Rao's
replacement.
</P>
<P>
The CWC decided to meet informally again on Tuesday at
Makherjee's residence here to pick up the threads of the meeting
on Friday. Significantly, Rao has offered to stay out of it.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on CPO, Rubber Tin Markets in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's crude palm oil
(CPO), rubber and tin markets ended the week mixed with CPO price
unchanged, rubber mixed and tin price lower.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's crude palm oil physicals remained unchanged this
week to close at 1,070 Malaysian Ringgit (about 428 US dollars)
per ton after see-sawing throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
The market touched its lowest of 1,040 Ringgit (about 416
dollars) per ton during the week which saw India and China
canceling their tenders. And later the market was back to last
week's closing level.
</P>
<P>
Players predicted that the palm oil prices would be boosted
further next week.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market ended mixed the week which saw
weaker note in RSS grades while the SMR grades were firmer.
</P>
<P>
August RSS One dropped 8.5 sen to 330.5 sen (about 1.32
dollars) per kg, while the SMR 20 grew 2.5 sen to 302.5 sen (about
1.21 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The market this week was generally lower in tandem with lower
movement of regional rubber future markets. Dealers predicted
that the market would slump further as there were no significant
leads to boost the market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week
lower to 15.4 Ringgit (about 6.16 dollars) per kg following the
bearish sentiment on copper and other base metals traded on the
London Metal Exchange (LME).
</P>
<P>
Trading was lackluster throughout the week, and was also
cautious and within a narrow range. Ready turnover for the week
stood at 526 tons against 800 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and that of LME on Friday
broadened to 60 US dollars per ton from 35 dollars previously.

<HEADLINE> Nepali NGOs to Take Back Sex Girls Detained in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Social organizations in Nepal
will soon take back some 126 girls who have been under police
custody in Mumbai, India in the last five months for the
involvement in prostitution, according to local English-language
daily Everest Herald today.
</P>
<P>
The girls are teenagers among the 218 Nepali sex workers who
were rescued by Indian police in a February raid on Mumbai's Red l
Light district and have been held in various remand homes there
since then.
</P>
<P>
A Mumbai court took a decision late last month to hand over the
126 Nepali girls to the Anti-AIDS National Network of Nepal, a
consortium of 37 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working
against AIDS and women-trafficking in Nepal, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to president of the network Durga Ghimire quoted by
the paper, six local NGOs would take in these ex-sex girls and
work for their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates said that there were more than 100,000
Nepali women working in prostitution in the neighboring India's
big cities and most of them were sold from Nepal's extreme poor
remote areas by traffickers.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 1.4 Billion Dollar Stand-By Credit for Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved a 12-month stand-by credit of 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars for Venezuela to back the country's 1996-97 economic
program.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic program is designed to seek a reversal
of the decline in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during the
fourth quarter of this year, real GDP growth of 4 percent in 1997
as well as a reduction in the monthly rate of inflation to 1.5 to
2 percent in the second half of 1996, 1 percent in the first half
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to increase the external current account surplus
from 2.4 percent of the GDP in 1995 to 4.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Net international reserves are targeted to increase by 1.6
billion dollars in 1996, to the equivalent of 5.6 months of
imports, and to rise further in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela joined the IMF in December 1946. Its quota is
equivalent to about 2.8 billion dollars and its outstanding use of
IMF credit currently totals 1.9 billion dollars.

<P>
VIENNA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Austria's most distinguished
composer Gottfried Von Einem died peacefully today at his home
at age of 78.
</P>
<P>
The works credited to this great musician include seven operas,
five pieces of ballet music, four symphonies and many others,
which combined to place him among the world's most prolific
composers in this century.
</P>
<P>
Born in Switzerland in 1918, the composer moved to Germany
where he received most of his education before his world-famous
Dantons Tod (Death of Danton) proved an immediate success in 1947
and earned him international recognition.
</P>
<P>
Then he moved to Vienna and turned out many of his music
masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
The death of the musician was widely lamented as a heavy loss
to the world music community of this century. Many important
political figures in Austria including the president and the prime
minister described him as a talented artist and hailed his works
as an integral part of European culture.

<P>
HANOI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The first anniversary of the
normalization of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and the
U.S. was marked today by a meeting between Vietnam's top leader Do
Muoi and Anthony Lake, the visiting U.S. President's National
Security Advisor.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Vietnamese Communist Party leader Do Muoi
laid stress on the Vietnamese people's desire for peace and
stability in order to concentrate their efforts on national
construction.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the Vietnamese people will continue to carry
out the open-door foreign policy, and cooperate with all countries
on the basis of respect for independence and sovereignty of each
other, equality, friendship, as well as mutually-beneficial
cooperation for development.
</P>
<P>
The party general secretary said "proceeding from its policy of
humanitarianism and goodwill, Vietnam will continue cooperation
with the U.S. in settling the issue of Americans missing in action
(MIAs), as well as its efforts to promote the Vietnam-U.S.
friendship."
</P>
<P>
Lake pointed out that since the two countries established
diplomatic relations, the bilateral relationship has continued with
remarkable progress.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the U.S.-Vietnamese cooperation are not only
beneficial to both countries but also to stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Lake spoke highly of Vietnam's constructive cooperation in the
search for American MIAs during the Vietnam war.

Later, Lake told foreign reporters that the U.S. government
regarded the MIA issue as a top priority in its relations with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During separate talks between Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Manh Cam and the U.S. advisor, the two sides expressed
readiness "to put the past behind and look forward to the future
in order to build their friendly and cooperative relationship on
the basis of mutual respect and benefit."
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that "priority should be given to economic
cooperation, including efforts to promote talks aimed at forming a
legal framework for their bilateral economic and trade
relations."
</P>
<P>
Lake and his party left here this morning to visit Da Nang and
Hue in central Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh city in the south.

DHAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's newly elected
parliament will go into its maiden session Sunday in a changed
political scenario with the Awami League (AL) on the ruling bench
after 21 years.
</P>
<P>
In a role-reversal, the AL emerged as the largest party in the
country's seventh parliament after winning 146 out of the 300
elected seats in the June 12 general polls, pushing the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) to the opposition bench.
</P>
<P>
According to related sources, the parliament's inaugural
sitting will elect the speaker and the deputy speaker before
taking up other matters, such as the president's inaugural address
and the adoption of obituary references.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, outgoing Speaker Shaikh Razzak Ali is
to chair the proceedings of the house until his successor takes
office.
</P>
<P>
Of the 314 parliamentary seats, including the reserved 30 woman
seats, the AL has 169, BNP 110, the Jatiya (National) Party 30,
Jamaat-E-Islami three and one for each of the two smaller parties.
</P>

Besides, 16 seats vacated so far are to be filled through

<HEADLINE> Japanese Fund to Pay Money to "Comfort Women" From Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua)-- The Asian Women's Fund, a
government-initiated fund in Japan, said it will offer "comfort
women" from the Philippines at least 2 million yen each, the Kyodo
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fund plans to pay money to about 300 surviving former sex
slaves or "comfort women" from eastern and southern Asian
countries and regions outside Japan, together with a letter of
apology from the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
These women were forced by the war-time Japanese government to
provide sexual services for the Imperial Japanese Army before and
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"Comfort women" from South Korea and Taiwan had expressed
strong reluctance to receive money from any private fund. They are
demanding compensation from the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
One of the Filipino victims, Maria Rosa Luna Henson, said in
Manila Thursday she wanted to accept the fund's offer, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
At least three other former sex slaves among the 46 Filipino
women who filed a suit against the Japanese government were also
willing to accept the money, said Henson.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has pledged to offer 700 million yen in
medical and welfare aid in the next 10 years to the "comfort
women," government sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that some 100,000 to 200,000 Asian women
outside Japan were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops
at front-line brothels before and during World War II.

BANGKOK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry has

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Set to Be Top Rubber Producer: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia, with ample land and
labor, will overtake Thailand as the world's number one rubber
producer after the turn of the century, Chairman of the Indonesian
Rubber Association O.K. Cornel was quoted as saying by local
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, currently the world's second largest rubber producer
with 1.5 million tons per annum, is expected to increase its
rubber output to 1.97 million tons by the year 2000 and to 2.34
million tons by 2005, Cornel said.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization has predicted
that Thailand's rubber production, which stood at 1.72 million
tons in 1994, will continue to increase until the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Cornel said, its output will be stagnant or even
fall because of land and labor constraints.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Malaysia, the world's third largest rubber
producer with an output of 1.1 million tons last year, will not be
able to challenge Indonesia's future domination because its output
has already started to drop.
</P>
<P>
The three Southeast Asian countries -- Thailand, Indonesia and
Malaysia -- currently account for more than 70 percent of the
global output of some six million tons per annum.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia exports nearly 90 percent of its rubber output to
more than 60 countries, with some 45 percent going to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the Asian Development Bank, Indonesia's
rubber exports are projected to increase to 1.59 million tons in
2000 and 1.82 million tons in 2005 from 1.32 million tons last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chile and Costa Rica today
highlighted consolidation of democracy and elimination of poverty
as the major tasks for the development of Central American
countries at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Chile-Central America entrepreneurial meeting
here today, Chilean and Costa Rican presidents, Eduardo Frei and
Jose Maria Figueres, agreed that there were many unfinished tasks
for the Central American countries in the political, economic, and
social fields.
</P>
<P>
Economic problems arising from excessive dependence on imported
raw materials must be addressed, Frei said.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean president reiterated the decision of his government
to give priority to Latin America, pointing out that "conditions
to expand relations between Central America and Chile already
exist."
</P>
<P>
President Figueres emphasized the need of modernizing means of
production in order to make them more competitive.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a great challenge to consolidate democracy,
eliminate inequality and eradicate poverty in this region.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
and Honduras, and Nicaraguan vice president Julia Mena attended
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Neither Panama nor Belize had sent high-level delegations to
the meeting as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which began earlier today, aimed to work out a
framework for seeking new ways of cooperation between Chile and
Central America, particularly the start of negotiations over a
free trade agreement, said Costa Rican sources.
</P>
<P>
Chilean-Central American trade went from 36 million U.S.
dollars in 1990 to 83 million dollars last year, and will increase
further after the Central American countries obtained credit loans
of 2 million dollars for the purchase of Chilean goods.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Bangladesh Govt Stresses Restoration of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The new Bangladeshi government has
stated that it would give top priority to the restoration of law
and order in the country, a step described by analysts here as
being in the right direction, although the administration is in
for major challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been torn by violence and disturbances in the
past few years as government-opposition conflicts led to frequent
strikes and violent clashes which have claimed many lives.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami League (AL) and the main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) are blaming each other for disrupting law
and order in a seemingly endless feud, despite budding signs of
stability after the AL defeated the ex-ruling BNP in the June 12
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Rafiqul Islam said on Monday that the government
would take stern action against "terrorists and law-breakers
irrespective of their political identities and social status" to
restore law and order, peace and stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said an integrated strategy would be finalized at a national
conference on law and order scheduled for July 20 in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the opposition BNP has accused members of
the ruling AL of killing and harassing BNP political workers.
</P>
<P>
BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, who stepped down from the
office of prime minister, has asked her party workers to build
resistance at all levels against the "injustice and repressive
measures" of the government led by AL President Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The two rival parties have recently been entangled in a new
round of clashes that claimed dozens of casualties.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the authorities closed the Dhaka Medical College
for an indefinite period following fighting between student wings
of the AL and the BNP, in which at least 15 people were injured
and about 20 rooms were ransacked.
</P>
<P>
While introducing a policy of national consensus to create a
congenial political atmosphere, the government is strengthening
its control over law-enforcing agencies, including the armed
forces and the police.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hasina, who is in charge of the Defense
Ministry, said that the armed forces would be kept from "any
undesirable interference" and all their activities must be in
accordance with the chain of command through the chiefs of three
services.
</P>
<P>
"My government will not allow anything beyond rules and
regulations in the armed forces," warned the prime minister, who
is also in charge of the armed forces division of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said the government appeared to have had the
armed forces under control with pro-BNP army officers having no
alternative but to be preparing for retirement.
</P>
<P>
In an appeasing approach to the threat of another round of
political tension and in a bid to win the much-needed stability,
the AL government has offered the olive branch to the BNP, going
as far as inviting Khaleda Zia to join the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The BNP leadership, though rejecting the invitation, has said
that it would "play its positive, pragmatic and new role in the
opposition bench of the parliament" instead of resorting to street
struggle.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that these promises may herald a
relatively stable situation in Bangladesh for some time to come.
But they added that a grudging BNP could be biding its time to
launch counterattacks against the less-experienced AL government,
as the rival politics is so deep-rooted in the country.

<HEADLINE> Inspection on Unsafe Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide inspection of coal
mining enterprises has been launched to check safety measures for
under-pit workers.
</P>
<P>
The inspection from July 20 to the end of August should help
improve industrial production safety and reduce accidents, said Yu
Shengde, a division Department of the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
Although the incidence of mine accidents and subsequent deaths
dropped slightly during the first half of this year, it's not
enough, Yu was quoted as saying by today' China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to yu, the ministries of labor, supervision, coal
industry, and geology and mineral resources, and the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions have jointly issued a circular on the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
The inspection will cover Anhui, Henan, Yunnan, Sichuan,
Shanxi, Gansu, Shaanxi and Hunan provinces and the Ningxia Hui and
Guangxi Zhuang autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors will check on the extent of safety training
available to miners and the proper handling of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that poor management and poor enforcement of the
Mining Safety Law was the primary cause of the accidents.
</P>
<P>
Some mine owners intentionally prolonged investigations and
settlements and even tried to hide accidents from authorities, Yu
said.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors will also determine how local authorities deal with
small open pit mines that lack basic safety facilities and have no
official licence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year, 529 major accidents resulted in
3,362 deaths, 19.4 percent and 8.3 percent more than accidents and
deaths in 1994, according to the CD report.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 25 percent of these accidents occured at unlicenced coal
mines, Yu said.

BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning province, has reappraised the professional
qualifications of all directors at the 2,000-odd banking
institutions in the city.
</P>
<P>
A few who were deemed not suitably qualified have been removed
from their post, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang branch of the People's Bank of China, the nation's
central bank, conducted the evaluation.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the 1,457 directors above the distribution centre
level have been reappraised, and 132 of them, or nine percent, were
found not qualified for their position.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, 13 people found highly unqualified
were fired.
</P>
<P>
The local government launched the re-evaluation after a survey

having unqualified directors at banking institutions.

JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto is
due to arrive back here this morning after doctors who gave him a
three-day medical checkup declared he was in "excellent" health,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto checked out of a cardiac hospital in the German spa
town of Bad Oeynhausen, where he underwent tests, and left for
home at around 11 am Friday, said the sources quoting
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono.
</P>
<P>
The president's plane was scheduled to touch down at Halim
Perdanakusuma Airport here at 8:15 am, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto left here last Sunday for a medical checkup in Germany
and he was accompanied by several of his children, grandchildren
and some other people.

<P>
Moerdiono said Soeharto had not been cut off from domestic
developments, as his aides provided him with daily updates.

In fact, the president actually made "directions" concerning
one specific report, Moerdiono said. He did not elaborate.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
stressed here today the importance of trade liberalization for the
development of Latin American economies when he inaugurated a
Chile-Central America entrepreneurial meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration ceremony, presided over with Costa Rican
President Jose Maria Figueres, Frei highlighted the achievements
of the Chilean economy in the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
He said his country has sustained a growth rate of nearly 7
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Frei is on a two-day official visit to Central America, where
he attended the meeting with his counterparts from Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and lower ranking officials from
Panama, Nicaragua and Belize.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean president was accompanied by 50 Chilean
entrepreneurs, who would hold talks with approximately 150 of
their Central American colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Frei emphasized the fact that Chile's trade exchanges with the
rest of the world have increased steadily, with an average growth
rate of 25 percent in the trade of manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
Chile and Central America must search for new markets because
their internal markets were too small, added the Chilean
president, who regarded Latin America as his highest priority.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Chile would work out a mechanism to strengthen its
relations with Central America, Frei said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres said
his country will take advantage of the complementarity of the
Central American economies and increase investment in Chile.
</P>
<P>
He promised to expand dialogue between major enterprises and
trade unions and to encourage small and medium-sized enterprises
to participate in this process.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 18,000 young
Chileans across the country have promised to donate their organs
for transplant after death, an official of a national institute
said today.
</P>
<P>
Leonardo Gonzalez, director of the National Institute of the
Chilean Youth, made public the figure when he revealed the results
of a campaign sponsored in January by his institute.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, carried out in the metropolitan and many other
regions in Chile, called on people to donate their organs after
death.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Public Health Fernando Munoz praised the
program and urged the public to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
He announced that 50 donations have been registered this year,
an increase of 36 over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister attributed the increase to a growing interest
of doctors in finding donors and a surge of willingness of donors'
relatives to carry out this kind of humanitarian action.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Government, EZLN to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexican government and the
rebel National Liberation Zapatista Army (EZLN) agreed today to
resume peace negotiations on June 16-17.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during an extraordinary meeting of
both sides in the town of San Andres Larrainzar, in the
southeastern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement released by the two parties said they had
agreed on the general rules for negotiations and the establishment
of a follow-up and verification commission.
</P>
<P>
Government delegation coordinator Marco Antonio Bernal
expressed his satisfaction over the results of the meeting, saying
that the progress achieved was a step in the right direction and
will prevent the peace talks from being derailed by accidental
incidents.
</P>
<P>
The only topic left pending was the mechanism to be adopted for
conciliation in the indigenous communities, added Bernal.
</P>
<P>
The peace dialogue between the government and the EZLN was
suspended early in May this year because of detention warrants
against EZLN members issued by the authorities of the Chiapas
state.
</P>
<P>
The EZLN, an armed group set up in Chiapas in the 1960s, has
5,000 members of the indigenous. It declared war against the
central government and its troops in 1993.

<HEADLINE> TV Producer to Advance Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- One of China's major television
producers, HiSense Electric Corp, is planing to advance overseas
market.
</P>
<P>
HiSense will concentrate on business in Southeast Asia, South
Africa and South America in the next two years, launching several
joint ventures in these regions, said Zhou Houjian, president of the
east China's Shandong-based company.
</P>
<P>
Today's China's Daily said that the company is expected to sign
a contract next month setting up a joint venture with a large
South African commercial company.
</P>
<P>
The company is also planning to set up a joint venture in a
Latin American country this year.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with an Indonesian company about building a TV
production venture is also under way.
</P>
<P>
Although the company has already exported to 28 countries in
Europe, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, Zhou said, the
export volume was too small.
</P>
<P>
He said the company wants to have a five to ten percent stake
of these countries' markets in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
The company's export value is expected to hit 50 million US
dollars by 2000, accounting for 30 percent of the company's total
sales volume.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company exported 7.5 million US dollars-worth of
television sets.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the company produced 800,000 television sets
and has a nearly five percent stake of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
To expand its reputation in the overseas market, the company is
seeking to list B shares, which are exclusively traded by overseas
investors.

<HEADLINE> Croats to Boycott Mostar City Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Croats in Mostar will
not participate in the newly-elected city council until election
"irregularities" are redressed, a senior Croat official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The Croat side will not participate in the formation of the
Mostar city council until the Bosnian federation constitutional
court passes a ruling on the complaint filed by the HDZ city
committee," Mijo Brajkovic, mayor of the Croat-held western part
of Mostar, told the city's Croat radio.
</P>
<P>
Brajkovic, who headed the list of the Croat Democratic Union
(HDZ) candidates, made the remarks after the European Union (EU)
administration in the southern Bosnian city publicized the results
of the June 30 local elections.
</P>
<P>
The official results show that the HDZ won 26,464 votes, while
the Muslim coalition led by the Party of Democratic Action
received 28,165 votes.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the HDZ would have only 16 of the 37 seats in the
city council, while the Muslim coalition would secure the rest,
including the five seats for other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ, claiming that there were "irregularities" in overseas
polling stations where the Muslim coalition won by an overwhelming
majority, was appealing to the higher court of Muslim-Croat
federation after its earlier complaint was rejected by an EU
ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the EU publication of the official results of
"legalizing illegality," Bozo Rajic, president of the Bosnian HDZ,
said "the September elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be
turned into a farce" if irregularities in Mostar elections were
not redressed.
</P>
<P>
Croats and Muslims fought fiercely during the 1993-94 period,
which has since divided the city into two parts with different
administrations, police, currencies and even car plates.
</P>
<P>
The elections, organized by the EU, is aimed at unifying the
ethnically divided city, but HDZ officials have said that the
elections only confirmed their call for continued separation
because citizens cast their votes along the ethnic lines.

<HEADLINE> Samper to Attend U.N. Meeting in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper will attend a U.N. meeting to be held in New York
in September despite the cancellation of his entry visa by the
U.S. government, a high-ranking Colombian diplomat said today.
</P>
<P>
Julio Londono Paredes, Colombian Ambassador to the U.N., told
the national radio network RCN that the president will make his
trip to New York in compliance with an agreement signed by the
U.N. and the U.S. on August 4, 1947.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S. federal, state, or local
authorities should not raise any obstacles to the entrance or exit
of the representatives of U.N. member countries.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government decided on Thursday to cancel Samper's
entry visa, accusing him of not fully cooperating with the U.S. in
combating drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department spokesman told a press conference that
Samper was not welcome to the U.S. under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement between the U.S. and the U.N.,
Londono said, President Samper and all other heads of state or
government of the countries throughout the world have the right of
going to and acting within the premises of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, Samper will go to the U.N. headquarters in New
York and take part in a meeting of Non-Aligned countries the next
day, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A southern Chinese provincial
capital has announced nine new polices to encourage 55 large group
enterprises to improve their economic growth mode and economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with sales of more than three billion yuan (about
360 million US dollars), can expect preferential treatment from
Guangzhou, the capital of well-developed Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
For fund raising purposes, the city will encourage the
enterprises to establish finance companies, take part in the
operation of urban co-operative banks and trust and investment
companies, and prepare to issue stocks and bonds on both domestic
and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
In foreign trade, the province will try to get more freedom for
the companies in the area of imports and exports, help them
establish foreign trade companies, acquire projects, invite bids,
export labor, become involved in international economic and
technological cooperation, and open offices, sales centers, and
put investments in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The city will also allow large enterprises to look into
diversified forms of merger, so that poorly-run companies merged
could have bank loan interest reduced or wiped out with the
approval from relevant banks.
</P>
<P>
Favorable treatment will also be given for management of state
assets, industrial development and investment, improvement of
capital structure, and revenues.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of nature
reserves in Hainan Province has helped increase the number of
Eld's deer, which are on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Dongfang and Baisha counties, on China's second largest island,
are home to the deer, but the deteriorating ecological conditions
due to human predatoriness had caused their numbers to drop to 26
by 1976.
</P>
<P>
To save the animal, the Ministry of Forestry and local
government invested 3.7 million yuan in the Datianpo Nature
Reserve and employed 32 people to look after and study the deer,
in Dongfang County in 1986.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the workers succeeded in introducing 18
Eld's deer from the Datianpo Nature Reserve to another nature
reserve that now has 31.

CARACAS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela deplored a
U.S. government decision to cancel Colombian President Ernesto
Samper's entry visa for his alleged links with drug cartels there.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today, Venezuelan Foreign Minister
Miguel Angel Burelli said they deplored the U.S. move since Samper
represents not an individual but a whole country.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians and diplomats have deplored Washington's
decision and forecast an impending intensified conflict between
both countries.
</P>
<P>
Professor of the Central University of Venezuela Carlos Romero
proposed an urgent meeting of the Organization of American States
(OAS) to study the current situation with reference to the 1991
Santiago Commitment.
</P>
<P>
Under the commitment, member countries of the OAS are committed
to condemn any action jeopardizing the democracy of the region
including military coups and external interference.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Samper's defense minister Fernando Botero had
accused him of accepting narco-money from Cali drug cartel, the
biggest cocaine syndicate in the world in the 1994 election
campaign which brought him to power.
</P>
<P>
After investigations the Colombian Congress exonerated him from
such charges early this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move came in response to Colombia's rejection some
days ago of a U.S. request to extradite four detained Colombian
drug traffickers most wanted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed the cancellation of Samper's entry visa may
be a prelude to severe U.S. economic sanctions against this South
American country.

<P>
BRASILIA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian World Cup striker
Romario will go to Spain next month to play for first division
Valencia under a new 8 million U.S. dollars, three-year contract,
Sao Paulo's television said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
TV Globo said Romario, who helped lead Flamengo to the Rio
championship with 26 goals, will play several friendship matches
in Brazil before leaving for Spain.
</P>
<P>
Romario left Barcelona last year to play for Flamengo but was
reportedly unhappy about sharing the limelight at the Rio club
with fellow striker Bebeto.
</P>
<P>
He was not chosen for the Brazilian OLympic team travelling
to Atlanta games this month.

MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Six people, including children,
were killed in the central Philippines on Thursday night when a
group of heavily armed men strafed with bullets a farm house in a
remote village, police said here today.
</P>
<P>
The police said the armed men, clad in fatigue uniforms, fired
from all sides at the hut owned by Rosalio Ayusep in Mandoawak
village, San Dionisio, Iloilo.
</P>
<P>
The Ayuseps reportedly had a dispute with San Dionisio Mayor
Peter Lopez, who was trying to buy a part of their paddy field in
Mandoawak before the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attackers also ransacked the victim's house of cash and
valuables before they escaped, the police said.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Stabilize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Lower interest rates and some
bargain hunting helped steady the stock market on Wall Street
today.
</P>
<P>
But the growing pessimism about company earnings and inflation
prevented a big rebound for the second time this week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.98 to 5,510.56, having
recovered from a midday slide that threatened to give the
blue-chip average its third loss of more than 50 points in six
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were bolstered by government reports showing that
wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.2 percent in June while retail
sales fell for the second time in three months.
</P>
<P>
Stocks reversed course as the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond moved to 7.03 percent compared with 7.05 percent late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues managed to surpass decliners with a slim
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 396.72
million shares, down considerably from the brisk pace of
Thursday's sell-off.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.20 to 346.84, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.52 to 646.19, and the American Stock
Exchange's market value index rose 0.68 to 549.77.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled nearly 35 points
Thursday, lost another 2.87 to 1,103.49. The technology-laden
Nasdaq, beset by a series of negative earnings outlooks from
computer related businesses, has now slid more than 11.5 percent
since setting a record high at 1,249.15 on June 5.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the market plunged as that trend was solidified by
profit warnings from Hewlett-Packard and United HealthCare.

SHIJIAZHUANG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A team of 17 Shanghai doctors
who dashed to the rescue when a massive earthquake hit Tangshan 20
years ago, returned to the city Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 17 doctors have returned to the city at the invitation of
the municipal government so they could see the new Tangshan, and
offer medical advice to their old friends.
</P>
<P>
A new beautiful and modern city of Tangshan has been
established out of the ruins, and the children who were rescued
have grown into adults.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the quake that shocked the world in July
1976, some 100 medical teams, comprising of 20,000 medical
workers, rushed to Tangshan from across the country to help rescue
and emergency work.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 40 teams, including some 2,000 medical workers,
were from Shanghai, the biggest city and financial center of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Ban Lifted on Horse-drawn Carriages </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATLANTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta has lifted the ban on the
horse-drawn carriages, which had been imposed for fear that horses
and shoulder-to-shoulder crowds wouldn't mix.
</P>
<P>
But they will be barred from pedestrian corridors such as
Peachtree Street, International Boulevard, Capitol Avenue and
portions of Central Avenue, as well as from restricted lanes and
streets closed to vehicular traffic.
</P>
<P>
Finding new routes might be tough, but horse-and-buggy
operators are determined to find a way to give tours during the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"This is history," said Patricia Willis, owner of Amen
Carriages. "We are willing to make the sacrifices to be part of
the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Any alternative route must be approved by Atlanta police Major
John Woodard, who oversees the Olympic traffic circulation plan,
and the city's Traffic Department before the carriages can roll
for Olympic visitors.

SANTIAGO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chilean authorities incinerated
today 600 kilograms of cocaine that had been confiscated in the
biggest haul of drug in the country on July 7.
</P>
<P>
Five Chileans and two Colombian nationals were detained when
police and customs agents searched a merchant ship docked in
the port of San Antonio, in the Fifth Region of the country, and
found the 15-million-dollar-worth cocaine.

Press reports said that the smuggling group was headed by
former Third Secretary of the Colombian Embassy in Chile Alberto
Botero during the government of Cesar Gaviria.
</P>
<P>
Acting Interior Ministr Belisario Velasco, who attended the
incineration procedure, told the press that Chile maintains
contacts with Colombia in search of clues.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Ambassador to Chile Samuel Salazar assured his
country's close cooperation in the clarifying of the case.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Expert Says No Muslim Mass Grave Exists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav forensic medicine expert
Zoran Stankovic said today there do not exist mass graves in
Srebrenica where thousands of Muslims were believed to be buried.
</P>
<P>
The international community's claim that Muslim mass graves
exist in the Serb-controlled city of Srebrenica is based on
assumptions rather than proof, Stankovic said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, he said
that after one month of search on localities around Srebrenica,
war crimes tribunal experts only found 20 bodies.
</P>
<P>
The international war crimes tribunal believes that thousands
of Muslims may be buried in mass graves in Srebrenica, a Muslim
enclave in eastern Bosnia which was overrun by the Serb army in
July last year. The Muslim government claimed that more than 6,000
Muslim men went missing after the fall of Srebrenica to the hands
of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the arrival of a Finnish expert team to the
region of Srebrenica, Stankovic said that this was another proof
of the arrogant and partial behavior of the international
community, "which looks only for the truth that suits it."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Stankovic became a member of an expert team of the
Yugoslav state committee for gathering information about crimes
against humanity and international law.
</P>
<P>
He argued that while the international experts were digging the
area around Srebrenica, the Yugoslav expert team should be in the
place too, "because if the international community wants
cooperation with us, it is only proper to offer it."
</P>
<P>
"The area where a dozen of bodies were found cannot be
considered a mass grave. This lacks seriousness and so does the
method of putting a probe into the ground and deciding whether
there are bodies there according to the smell," he said.
</P>
<P>
The forensic medicine expert also accused the international
community of incessantly applying double standards and making no
mention of the evidence that does not support the "truth" it
fights for.
</P>
<P>
"The Hague tribunal charged former Yugoslav army officers Mile
Mrksic and Veselin Sljivancanin with the alleged killing of 261
persons," but the fact was "only three (human) skeletons were
found after the investigation" into the evidence of the killing,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our side believes that facts and material evidence must not be
ignored, regardless of how embarrassing they might be for any of
the sides," Stankovic said, adding that an equal treatment and
observation of facts, rather than assumptions and indications,
were necessary in collecting evidence of war crimes.

<HEADLINE> Bildt: Obstacles Still Exist in Implementing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The international community's
High Representative to Bosnia Carl Bildt said today there were
still many obstacles in implementing the civilian part of the
Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in the Serb city of Banja Luka, Bildt said
these obstacles included the unresolved human rights, lack of
objectivity in mass media, the tendencies leading to political
violence and the lack of authorities' concern over revival of
economy in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
These phenomena were equally noted in both entities --
Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat federation, the Tanjug news
agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bildt especially criticized Bosnian Serb TV for issuing
propaganda that was not objective.
</P>
<P>
"The TV in (Serb capital) Pale continues to stick to its
decision not to be objective. But the people of the Bosnian Serb
republic deserve better propaganda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, all parties are entitled to equal
treatment by free and fair media -- particularly in the campaign
for the first post-war election in Bosnia scheduled for September
14.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said he had complained of media bias in the Bosnian Serb
Republic to Serb Vice-president Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
"The existing media do not fulfill objectivity criteria and we
shall give a chance to independent media," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Churns Onto Carolina Coastal Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Bertha churned onto
coastal islands of North Carolina today, ripping apart roofs,
shattering windows and flinging debris sideways.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane speed up its winds to 105 mph (169 kmph) before
the 35-mile wide eye crossed the tip of Cape Fear.
</P>
<P>
By 3 p.m. EDT (7 p.m. GMT), the center Bertha passed just to
the east of a wealthy enclave on Bald Head Island, about 30 miles
(48 km) southeast of Wilmington, and was advancing on scores of
beach communities to the northeast, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds reached more than 30 miles inland as the bulk of
the storm was moving along the coast toward the ports at Morehead
City and the Outer Banks further north.
</P>
<P>
In a deserted Myrtle Beach, skies turned dark as night as 105
mph gusts pushed 6- to 8-foot (around 2 meters) breakers against
the boardwalk, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Dangerous rip currents were reported along the Atlantic Coast
and Carolina beaches were closed.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists fled inland in
advance of the storm. As many as 14,500 people stayed in Red Cross
shelters overnight and about 7,000 remained in North and South
Carolina shelters today, as hurricane warnings remained in force
from Savannah, Georgia to the Virginia line.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- France hailed this evening the
reaching of an agreement on the method of controlling cease-fire
in southern Lebanon by Israel, Syria, Lebanon, France and the
United States in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement came this evening after five hours of
secret meeting by the member countries of a monitoring committee
on how to control cease-fire in southern Lebanon at the U.S. State
Department.
</P>
<P>
"France is joyful about this accord whose implementation will
be made with the shortest delay,"said the French Foreign Ministry
in a communique this evening.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee was set up on April 26 after Israel
made the Wrath of the Grapes offensive against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted Lebanese Ambassador to the United
States Riyad Tabbarah as saying that diplomats succeeded in
settling two points that used to be in dispute.
</P>
<P>
The two points are the time space for rotation of the
committee's presidency between the United States and France, and
the voting procedure of the committee, including the way in which
foreign ministers of the five countries can intervene if the
committee cannot agree upon a certain issue at an inferior level.
