<HEADLINE> Starving Baby Case Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tyler Isaac Walrond likely would have been  
walking by now, if he had lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, his parents are in court, arguing over whether his  
mother let her son die of malnourishment by insisting on breast 
feeding him despite her body's inadequate supply of milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabitha Walrond, 21, is charged with manslaughter. Her lawyer  
portrays her as a loving mother who was never told that her 
surgically reduced breasts put her at risk of not providing enough 
nourishment for her child. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler's father, Keenan Purrell, accuses Ms. Walrond of killing  
the 2-month old boy because she was upset that he left her and 
fathered a child with another woman. 
</P>
<P>
	When the baby died on Aug. 27, 1997, he weighed barely five  
pounds; his birth weight was 7 pounds, 15 ounces. Purrell broke 
down in sobs in court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked all shrunken,'' he said of his son the last time he  
saw him. ``I felt like I couldn't hold him tight enough. I couldn't 
let him go ... My son was looking like a head and some twigs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond wept as he testified.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy, from the moment this child died to this  
day,'' said her lawyer, Susan Tipograph. ``I think lots and lots of 
people had responsibility for this tragic and unnecessary death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tipograph said that when her client sought help for her  
baby, a health center turned her away because she lacked a Medicaid 
card. 
</P>
<P>
	Her client, she said, didn't know the child wasn't getting  
enough food, believed it was best to breast-feed him and was never 
warned by doctors that she was at risk for breast-feeding failure 
because of a breast reduction operation she'd had when she was 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Purrell, a 21-year-old former security guard, has testified that  
he spoke to Ms. Walrond only three times during her pregnancy and 
saw his son three times, including the day he died. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Ms. Walrond had refused to give the baby formula, saying  
he should only be breast fed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We argued about whether to feed him the formula,'' he said.  
``She kept saying `I'll take my baby and I'll go home' ... I 
started to say this is my son, this is my house,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother gave me the bottle and I fed it to him. He sucked it  
down. He really sucked it. I thought ... I've got a greedy baby,'' 
he said. ``I said, `Would you agree to give him a bottle a day? 
It's not going to kill him.'''

<HEADLINE> Unser Feeling Fine After Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAZARETH, Pa. (AP) -- Al Unser Jr. is back in his car and barely  
aware of the special equipment he's using this weekend to help him 
drive in the Bosch Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time CART champion is making his first appearance since  
breaking his ankle in an accident on the first lap of the season, 
March 21 in Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami. He's wearing a protective 
brace of carbon fiber and a special shoe large enough to 
accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nike's been making my shoes for last couple of years, and they  
jumped right in with both feet to accommodate the brace,'' Unser 
said Friday at Nazareth Speedway. ``Once the race gets going Sunday 
and the adrenaline flows, my ankle will not be an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although his right ankle is held together by a plate and screws,  
Unser sees it as no impediment. The only change in the car is in 
the throttle spring, which make the accelerator lighter to the 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got in the car for first time Monday, the ankle felt  
better than I expected,'' Unser said, alluding to a test in 
Madison, Ill. ``Being in the car is the best therapy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, an iron man of the sport, missed the last two races, the  
only time's he's been out of his car since failing to qualify for 
the 1995 Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the ankle is completely healed, Unser can turn all his  
attention to winning for the 32nd time in his career. Although he 
has not prevailed since 1995 -- a span of 54 races -- Unser is second 
only to Michael Andretti in career CART victories. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KNOWING NAZARETH:* There's a definite hometown advantage to  
racing at Nazareth Speedway, where only five of 12 previous Bosch 
Grand Prix winners have lacked a connection to either track owner 
Roger Penske or the town in the foothills of the Pocono Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerson Fittipaldi won the race three times -- twice for Penske.  
Paul Tracy, now driving for Barry Green, prevailed twice for 
Penske, and Danny Sullivan won once. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Rick Mears and Fittipaldi won Marlboro Challenge  
all-star races for Penske on the .946-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice a Bosch winner is Newman-Haas driver Michael Andretti of  
the Nazareth Andrettis. 
</P>
<P>
	Outsiders to win at Nazareth were Fittipaldi for Patrick-Ganassi  
Racing, Arie Luyendyk, Bobby Rahal, Nigel Mansell and defending 
champion Jimmy Vasser. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TIRE WARS:* Firestone, which has dominated rival tire supplier  
Goodyear for the last several seasons in CART, was hoping for its 
third pole in four races in qualifying Saturday for the Bosch Grand 
Prix. Cars on Firestones also have won 22 races in a row, dating to 
Michael Andretti's victory for Goodyear in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Firestone had the pole 18 times to just one for Goodyear in  
1998, and had that same edge in race victories. 
</P>
<P>
	At Nazareth, it was a Firestone rout. Of the top 10, only  
fourth-place finisher Gil de Ferran was on Goodyears. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* The Bosch Grand Prix on Sunday caps the first of  
three programs of racing this year at Nazareth Speedway, where Indy 
Lights and Toyota Atlantic cars also run this weekend. Later this 
month, NASCAR takes over with the Busch Series and modifieds, and 
returns in July with its trucks and all-pro cars. The Barber Dodge 
Pro Series also joins the NASCAR program May 22-23, and USAC sprint 
cars participate with the stockers July 16-18. ... Both Paul Tracy 
and Michael Andretti will be seeking a third Nazareth pole 
Saturday. They are tied with Rick Mears for the most in the race. 
... The front row of Patrick Carpentier and Greg Moore last year in 
Nazareth was only the second 1-2 start for Canadians in CART 
history. Tracy had the pole and Jacques Villeneuve started second 
in Phoenix in 1994. ... Andretti, hoping to match Emerson 
Fittipaldi's record of three Nazareth victyories, has been the most 
dominant driver in the event. He has led in eight of 11 races and 
been on the point for 599 laps. ... Tracy set the standard for 
dominance in 1994, leading for all but eight of 200 laps.

<HEADLINE> EDS To Cut 5,200 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Electronic Data Systems Corp. will cut 5,200  
jobs, or about 4 percent of its worldwide work force, in an attempt 
to reclaim its leadership in the computer services business. 
</P>
<P>
	EDS chairman and chief executive Richard H. Brown put a figure  
for the first time on a much-anticipated cost-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown promised analysts at a meeting in New York on Thursday  
that the cuts would be coupled with more rapid revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our aim is to reclaim our leadership and put the luster back''  
on the company, Brown said in his first meeting with the financial 
community since taking charge of EDS in January. 
</P>
<P>
	EDS has fallen behind IBM and other more aggressive rivals in  
winning new services contracts as EDS has grown more bureaucratic 
and its sales force has become complacent, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first priority is to re-ignite our growth engines. EDS is  
in a growth industry. We have got a tremendous opportunity. We will 
not be satisfied until our growth is in excess of the market growth 
rate,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts, which will include more than 600 reductions  
previously announced at EDS' Plano headquarters, should be 
completed by June, company officials said. Many of the people will 
be able to apply for vacant positions at the company, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has made largely symbolic cuts already, Brown said,  
such as reducing its fleet of corporate aircraft and eliminating 
its executive car program. 
</P>
<P>
	James Daley, chief financial officer, said further job cuts may  
be needed to reach the $1 billion cost savings goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said EDS has set out to hire more top guns into its sales  
force while eliminating the positions of those who aren't 
performing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking those who do not measure up to leave,'' he said.  
``In the last 60 days, we've removed the bottom 20 percent of our 
sales force.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Probes Underwriting of IPOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is investigating  
possible anti-competitive practices in securities firms' 
underwriting of initial public offerings of stock, a department 
spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was disclosed in a filing with securities  
regulators by investment giant Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Wall Street's 
largest privately held securities firm, which is scheduled to sell 
stock to the public for the first time next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Antitrust Division is looking at the possibility of  
anti-competitive practices in underwriting services for initial 
public offerings,'' Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona 
said. She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Her statement came in response to a question about Goldman,  
Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing  
today that the Justice Department had issued it a civil subpoena 
for information ``with respect to its investigation of an alleged 
conspiracy among securities underwriters to fix underwriting 
fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the biggest initial public offerings ever, New  
York-based Goldman, Sachs plans to raise as much as $3 billion in 
its IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	In its SEC filing, Goldman, Sachs also referred to a lawsuit  
filed by an individual investor last fall against Goldman and the 
other big Wall Street investment firms, alleging that they 
conspired to fix their underwriting fees for IPOs.

<HEADLINE> Criminals Fill Up Mental Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- For 124 years, Napa State Hospital has taken  
care of mental patients in an open, campus-like setting in the 
heart of California wine country. In March, however, the hospital 
erected a 16-foot-high chain-link fence topped with coils of 
glistening razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: Nearly 75 percent of the 739 current residents have  
criminal backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty frightening,'' said Myrna Abramowitz, a former  
trustee at nearby Napa Community College. ``What it's turning out 
to be is a penal institution and that worries me a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, only 25 percent of the patients at California's four  
state mental hospitals were sent there by the criminal justice 
system. The rest were mentally ill people who were deemed a danger 
to themselves or others and were committed under civil procedures 
by county mental health departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, however, all but the most severely ill civilly  
committed patients have been released, supposedly to get treatment 
in their own communities, under a movement known as 
deinstitutionalization. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, the Corrections Department and judges have filled the  
beds with mentally ill prison inmates and people found innocent by 
reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Carolla, a spokesman for the Virginia-based National  
Alliance for the Mentally Ill, said the trend is nationwide: Mental 
hospitals that once offered psychiatric care in comfortable 
settings were largely emptied during the movement to 
deinstitutionalize the mentally ill and are now being filled with 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the reason for the change is financial -- few county  
mental health departments can afford the $100,000 a year it costs 
to keep a patient at Napa State Hospital, said Carla Jacobs, a NAMI 
board member from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, pressure to accept criminals in the nation's 75,000  
remaining mental hospital beds has increased in the 14 states that 
allow violent sex offenders to be kept indefinitely for treatment 
after serving their prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Deinstitutionalization wasn't supposed to work this way,  
advocates for the mentally disabled say. Instead of getting 
medication and psychiatric care in their communities, former mental 
patients have been left on their own, swelling the numbers of 
homeless. Many ultimately commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people that are coming into state hospitals now, they're  
coming in the back door after they've been criminalized, rather 
than before the tragedies that put them there,'' Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, there were 27,000 people in California's mental  
hospitals and 27,000 inmates in the state's prisons and jails, 
Jacobs said. Today, there are just 4,500 mental hospital beds in 
California, and 160,000 inmates in the state's prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Since California's sex predator law was passed in 1995, the  
state's two hospitals previously designated for the criminally 
insane, Atascadero in San Luis Obispo County and Patton in San 
Bernardino County, have become overcrowded. That in turn has pushed 
``medium- to low-risk'' criminal mental patients to Napa and to 
Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, which also has increased 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	The change at Napa, which is California's oldest mental hospital  
and the county's largest employer with 2,100 workers, has been 
profound. As part of the $10 million security upgrade, police now 
check every car and frisk each visitor. 
</P>
<P>
	This hasn't exactly been heralded by the Chamber of Commerce,  
which prefers to direct the area's 5 million yearly visitors to 
Napa Valley's wineries and spas. 
</P>
<P>
	But state health officials say they have an obligation to treat  
all the mentally ill, including those with criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly some of these people who have been arrested have  
serious mental illnesses and they need treatment,'' said Stephen 
Mayberg, director of the state Department of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
	At Napa, murderers, rapists and arsonists wear khaki uniforms  
and are housed separately from the civilly committed patients, who 
live outside the newly fenced-in wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually feel safer coming to work. People are more in tune  
to security and safety,'' said hospital spokeswoman Lupe Rincon. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, employees must now wear electronic security badges and  
use shuttle buses to get around. And visitors to the criminal side 
must surrender their purses and can't bring in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost impossible to have a therapeutic environment''  
with all this security, Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital staff said it's virtually impossible to escape from  
the secure wing. But that hasn't appeased the hospital's neighbors, 
who would have preferred that the lush, tree-lined property be 
converted into an office park in this community 40 miles north of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	They worry that with the security will come an ever-more violent  
population. 
</P>
<P>
	Napa real estate agent R.Q. Williams also scoffs at the  
hospital's construction of a giant berm to shield the fence from 
wine-country visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to fool some people, but people that know and  
even visitors are going to ask, `What's going on over there?''' 
said Williams, who has lived in Napa for 25 years. ``It just isn't 
the image that we want to project.''

<HEADLINE> Issues Arise in Orioles-Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Federal aviation officials, at the request of  
the FBI and security officials, said today they have banned 
low-level flights over Camden Yards on Monday, when the Baltimore 
Orioles will play the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Jersey congressman said he would appeal the decision,  
which he said prevents groups from hiring planes to tow banners 
with messages opposing Cuban leader Fidel Castro or urging players 
to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said flights lower than  
1,500 feet will be banned from 1 p.m. until midnight within three 
miles of the stadium. Fire, police and media aircraft are exempt 
from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights over 1,500 feet will need clearance from Baltimore air  
controllers, which is the usual procedure, said Paul Turk, an FAA 
spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an unprecedented restriction of First Amendment rights  
without any validation of security concerns,'' said U.S. Rep Bob 
Menendez, D-N.J. ``When did a banner calling for freedom or urging 
people to seek political asylum became a national security risk?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez planned to protest the decision to the FBI and the FAA,  
said his spokeswoman, Yvette Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
	The request, made by Neil Gallagher, the FBI's assistant  
director for national security, said air space was the greatest 
security vulnerability at the event, according to Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call Friday by The Associated Press seeking comment  
from the FBI's public affairs office in Washington was not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cuban-Americans from New Jersey had planned to hire  
commercial banner towing services to fly anti-Castro and 
pro-democracy messages over the stadium, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban-American pilot Jose Basulto, president of the Miami-based  
Brothers to the Rescue, has also hinted he may fly over the 
stadium. Basulto said he flew just outside Cuban air space during 
the first game between the Orioles and the Cuban team in Havana in 
March, but did not drop leaflets as planned because of unfavorable 
wind conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Basulto, a veteran of the U.S.-sponsored invasion of Cuba in  
1961, refused to say Friday whether he would violate the FAA order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reserve the right as guaranteed by the constitution to  
express ourselves. Whether or not we do that, you're just going to 
have to wait and see,'' Basulto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban-American groups planning to protest against the Castro  
regime have complained repeatedly about the tight security measures 
imposed by the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have said they plan to enforce bans on flags,  
musical instruments and other items, and may ask fans who chant to 
leave if it disturbs other fans. Banners will be allowed only 
between innings, and will not be allowed if they are political or 
commercial, the team has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown University law professor and former Massachusetts  
congressman Father Robert Drinan said the Orioles' position might 
not stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they allow things between innings and they allow someone to  
bring in something for the Boy Scouts, for example, then they can't 
be the judge of what is political speech,'' said Drinan, a member 
of the advisory board of the American Civil Liberties Union and an 
opponent of the U.S. embargo of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Free speech rights are clearly guaranteed on city streets and  
Maryland Stadium Authority property outside the stadium gates, the 
Maryland chapter of the ACLU said Friday. The right to use banners 
and signs, however, is less clear inside the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the stadium is government-owned property, once it  
is leased by the Orioles, they may have control over how attendees 
conduct themselves, including whether they display banners'' the 
ACLU statement said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing May Increase Ellipso Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boeing Co. is exploring the possibility of  
significantly increasing its stake in Ellipso, a global satellite 
venture that would deliver telephone, e-mail and fax services, an 
official close to the discussions said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing now has about a 10 percent stake, worth $50 million, in  
Mobile Communications Holdings Inc., a privately held company that 
is overseeing the Ellipso satellite venture. The official, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Boeing may take a stake 
anywhere from 65 to 85 percent, valued at $400 million to $600 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Boeing Co. said the company's talks with  
Ellipso are ``exploratory'' and that it is talking to other global 
satellite ventures as well. She would not comment on the nature of 
Boeing's discussions with Ellipso. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellipso plans to launch the satellites in late 2001 and be in  
service by 2002. Ellipso wouldn't offer service directly to 
consumers and businesses but would lease its transmission 
facilities to other companies, which would provide services to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has a contract with Ellipso to be its main systems  
integrator, the company spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Service Disrupted to Online Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Customers at 21 banks, including First Union  
Corp., that use CheckFree for electronic banking services may be 
finding their transactions aren't quite glitch-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Some users of Quicken or Microsoft's Money financial software  
have reported problems either logging on or in getting ``kicked 
out'' before they were ready, said Terrie O'Hanlon, a CheckFree 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customer by customer, the experience is different,'' she said,  
adding that up to 500,000 customers potentially could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks that use a new transaction processing system called  
Genesis the ones having problems. CheckFree began switching banks 
to the new system six months ago, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief operating officer Pete Sinisgalli said in a statement  
workers had trouble diagnosing the ``root cause'' of the problem, 
but on Thursday believed they had identified it. 
</P>
<P>
	``(We're trying) to resolve this issue as quickly as possible to  
restore uninterrupted service for consumers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, was putting  
together special instructions and information for customers on its 
Web page. The Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union has some 16 million 
customers in the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our customers are affected. We don't know how many at  
this point,'' said spokeswoman Danielle Deabler. She estimated the 
total number of customers who bank online as in the ``hundreds of 
thousands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said First Union would work with CheckFree to make sure  
customers weren't charged late fees caused by the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross, CheckFree Holdings Co.  
has some 2.8 million customers and helps provide electronic payment 
services at 350 institutions. Founded in 1981, the company has 
1,800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a small percentage of Americans use such services, largely  
because of unfamiliarity or concerns about reliability and 
security.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Bonds Plummet / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bonds staged the steepest one-day fall  
in two months as signs of unexpected economic strength rekindled 
inflation jitters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond tumbled 1 7/8  
points, or by $18.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, shot up to 5.66 percent from 
Thursday's 5.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest drop since Feb. 25, when the long-term  
Treasury fell 2 1/32 points. It was the highest yield since the 
5.67 percent of April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The rout began after the government reported Friday that the  
U.S. economy expanded at a 4.5 percent annual rate in the first 
three months of the year, much stronger than expected. The selling 
intensified at midmorning as a manufacturing group in the Midwest 
reported the industrial economy was blistering in April as the 
second quarter began. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports raised fears among traders that the economy would  
overheat, despite evidence inflation remains tame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually, down the road, the worry is the Federal Reserve  
might raise short-term interest rates'' to cool off the economy, 
said Maury Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. While Harris 
believes that won't be necessary, he said the strong economic 
figures Friday clearly surprised traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising inflation reduces the value of fixed-income investments,  
such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp retreat in bonds also undercut stocks and set back a  
charge toward the 11,000 barrier by the Dow Jones industrial 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 3/16 point to 5/16 point, while intermediate maturities 
dropped between 17/32 point and 31/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on three-month Treasury bills was 4.54 percent as the  
discount rose 0.05 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.43 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.64 percent, while the discount 
increased 0.07 percentage point to 4.47 percent. One-year yields 
jumped to 4.76 percent as the discount rose 0.08 percentage point 
to 4.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, held steady at late Thursday's rate of 4.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 123 1/2 from 124 3/16 late Thursday. 
The average yield to maturity rose to 5.28 from 5.24 percent late 
Thursday.

<P>
	The New Jersey Devils are a team still trying to find its rhythm  
in the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	So defenseman Scott Stevens hopes they take a page from Tuesday  
night's 4-2 victory at Pittsburgh when they face the Penguins in 
Game 5 of their Eastern Conference series tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to finish our checks, but the bottom line is we want  
to play our game like the other night,'' said Stevens, whose team 
is tied 2-2 in the best-of-7 series, which resumes at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play the same way we did the last game. We have to  
play a convincing game, in people's faces, and make it 
uncomfortable for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Devils won the opener 3-1, then lost the next  
two, 4-1 and 4-2, before their Game 4 win. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games tonight, it will be Philadelphia at Toronto, St.  
Louis at Phoenix, Boston at Carolina and San Jose at Colorado. The 
Philadelphia-Toronto and Boston-Carolina series are each tied 2-2, 
while Phoenix leads St. Louis 3-1 and Colorado leads San Jose 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no games Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have played three straight games without  
league-leading scorer Jaromir Jagr, sidelined with a groin injury. 
They were 2-1 without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr said Wednesday he would play in Game 5, but there was some  
doubt following workouts on Thursday, when the star forward left 
practice early and didn't talk to the media. A decision on his 
availability was expected after this morning's skate or shortly 
before gametime. 
</P>
<P>
	With or without Jagr, Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur thinks  
the Penguins will be tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not going to give us anything,'' he said. ``Sometimes  
when you come in as the first seed and you play the eighth seed, 
you feel you are going to get the chance to win. But these guys 
won't beat themselves. We are going to have to beat them and that's 
what's surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers have also been somewhat of a surprise against the  
Maple Leafs. Like the Penguins, they're missing a superstar 
forward, Eric Lindros, who is recuperating from a collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers tied the series with an impressive 5-2 victory on  
Wednesday. Philadelphia has outshot Toronto 134-71 in the first 
four games, even more surprising because the Maple Leafs were the 
top scoring team in the NHL this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their forechecking has produced most of their scoring  
opportunities,'' Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn said. ``That's where 
they've been good all season, and for years, and we haven't been 
able to nullify it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins-Hurricanes series returns to Carolina following  
Boston's 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are at most three games left in this series, so there's  
not a lot of time to wait now,'' Carolina coach Paul Maurice said. 
``I'm happy we've been able to push this thing as far back as we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks showed the Avalanche they weren't going to go quietly  
with a 4-2 victory Wednesday night in Game 3 after losing the first 
two at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've still got the upper hand,'' San Jose defenseman Bill  
Houlder said. ``We've got some momentum, but momentum is only going 
to last so long -- like the first three or four minutes of the next 
game, if that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum is also the word in the Blues-Coyotes series. The  
Coyotes' 2-1 victory Tuesday night was their third straight after 
they lost the opener. Many of the Phoenix players think Game 4 was 
their best of the series, resulting in a quiet confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as we were happy about winning two games in St. Louis,  
I'd say 15 minutes after Tuesday's game everybody was 
businesslike,'' Rick Tocchet said. ``On the bus, there was no music 
playing, no partying going on. Guys were back to earth. It was just 
a quiet atmosphere. As a veteran player, I love seeing that.''

<HEADLINE> Star Jockey Fighting Back for Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Patrick Valenzuela's intense brown eyes  
gaze across the nearly empty Santa Anita racetrack. The noise from 
winner's circle celebrations and cheering fans is a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
	So are his days of being first out of the starting gate, urging  
his mount to the lead before the other horses could react. Once in 
front, Valenzuela often stole the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a brilliant rider,'' said Pete Pedersen, a steward at  
Southern California tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1989, Valenzuela was 26 and at his peak, riding Sunday  
Silence to victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. It didn't 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	Five months later, he was suspended for testing positive for  
cocaine, beginning a descent into drugs and alcohol that plagued 
him for the next 10 years. There were stretches of unexplained 
absences, suspensions and stints in drug rehab for the jockey who 
won nearly 3,000 races and $95 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
	His share of that money is gone, frittered away on drugs and  
gambling. Today, Valenzuela is only a visitor at Santa Anita. The 
man who once had five vehicles in his driveway arrives in a beaten 
up white car, borrowed from his brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that I became so successful so quick and  
didn't know what to do with my money, didn't know how to handle it 
and thought it would last forever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Valenzuela works pulling weeds in a nursery for $10  
an hour, knowing he once earned his current weekly salary in a 
single day at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard labor, and it makes me realize that being a jockey  
is a pretty easy living,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a black baseball cap bearing a red question mark, the  
36-year-old Valenzuela talks of another comeback in a sport once 
awed by his talent but now wary of his broken promises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want to be back racing. I really want to ride,''  
Valenzuela said. ``The racetrack is my life. This is the only 
livelihood I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the only time he's at a track now is to attend  
three-times-a-week meetings for recovering alcoholics and drug 
addicts. Valenzuela said he last used drugs in December, stopping 
because, ``It just didn't feel good anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We see Patrick on a regular basis and he's trying to get his  
life in order,'' said Don Murray, executive director of the Winners 
Foundation, a nonprofit support group that helps racetrack 
employees with their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible for me to predict who's going to make it or  
not. If you're the least bit rebellious, this idea keeps creeping 
in your head, `Nobody can tell me whether I can drink or not.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Valenzuela would have listened to anyone. He said he  
first tried marijuana at 17 -- the same year he won his first Santa 
Anita Derby aboard Codex in 1980. Then he got into cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was social to go out and have a line, but me, I couldn't  
stop at a line. I had to go for a whole pile,'' he said. ``Here 
were women who loved me and here was this powder, and I couldn't 
understand why I was going to the powder. I was destroying 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, he would go months without using drugs. Success always  
found him again. In 1990 he won riding titles at Hollywood Park and 
Del Mar, and won two $1 million Breeders' Cup races. He would go on 
to win four more Breeders' Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took that for granted,'' Valenzuela said. ``I would always  
come back and make it to the top and then ... do drugs and party 
until I was blue in the face and couldn't come to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela admitted he rode when he was hung over, but not when  
he had been drinking or using drugs. Instead, he just disappeared, 
stiffing owners and trainers from California to New York to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela's jockey's license was suspended in 1997 after he  
failed to fulfill his riding commitments at Santa Anita. Donald 
Calabria, his lawyer, was to meet Sunday with stewards at Hollywood 
Park to seek a license for Valenzuela to exercise horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to show the (California Horse Racing) board, stewards  
and race industry who this young man is and what he's put behind 
him,'' Calabria said. ``He's confronted his demons. ... Just let 
him know what the perimeters are so he can earn a living exercising 
horses and not working in a nursery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela hasn't been on a horse since December 1997, when he  
was thrown off and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right 
knee. He said he weighs 130 pounds, about 15 pounds over his riding 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm more of an asset to the game than I am destructive  
to it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedersen is one of three stewards who will hear Valenzuela's  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be most interested in what he's doing and not what he  
intends to do,'' Pedersen said. ``He's about as likable as you'd 
find under normal circumstances. Nobody knows what goes through his 
mind when the pressure gets there. He hasn't handled pressure that 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if he is granted an exercise license, Valenzuela knows he  
faces a tough time persuading trainers to allow him to work their 
expensive thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela had another setback recently when he was charged with  
robbing a cab driver of $150 at gunpoint. He spent 24 days in jail 
before the charges were dismissed because of a misidentification 
and lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hurt me a lot,'' he said. ``My reputation wasn't that  
great, but ... it sure made me look like a criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame jockey Bill Shoemaker would bet Valenzuela gets  
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he does his work and stays straight, keeps his  
weight down, does everything he should do, I don't see why he 
couldn't do it,'' he said. ``You can't help but like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela says he's broke and lives with relatives. As he tries  
to recover from alcoholism and drug addiction, he also is dealing 
with the aftereffects of two divorces. He has four daughters -- ages 
15, 13, 10 and 5 -- and is seeking visitation rights with his 
youngest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret a lot of the things I did to myself and to my  
family,'' he said. ``I wish I could've seen from the outside what 
they were seeing. I might have stopped a long time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If his latest comeback doesn't work out, Valenzuela said he  
might become a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter if I can ride or not, it's going to be OK,'' he  
said. ``I won't go out and use (drugs) over it.''

<HEADLINE> Mob Lawyer Runs for Mayor of Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Old-timers around here wistfully remember the  
days when the mob ran the casinos, when the likes of Tony ``The 
Ant'' Spilotro and Meyer Lansky kept brutal order in glitter gulch. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar Goodman remembers the days. He spent decades, after all,  
trying to keep those unsavory characters out of the slammer. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Goodman is courting a different clientele. He wants to  
be mayor of Las Vegas, the mouthpiece for all its citizens. His 
work for wiseguys? Fuhgetaboutit. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people just have the image of the mob lawyer  
things,'' Goodman said. ``But I honest to God believe I'm going to 
be the best mayor Las Vegas ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some wince at the prospect of the devil's advocate running what  
used to be a wide-open mob town. But Goodman's candidacy is playing 
so well that he is the front-runner among nine candidates in 
Tuesday's nonpartisan primary election. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 59, the man who played himself in the movie ``Casino'' is  
going after the position being vacated by Jan Jones with the same 
vengeance he used to defend Spilotro, the gangster who reputedly 
placed a rival's head in a vise and squeezed his eyeballs out. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, his candidacy isn't playing well everywhere in a  
city that has always struggled for respectability. One rival 
candidate, Arnie Adamsen, said the election of Goodman would ``set 
our city's reputation back 50 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce has endorsed Adamsen, a  
12-year member of the city council, and the powerful police union 
wouldn't think of supporting a man who fought them in court for so 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Adamsen and developer Mark Fine, one of the other leading  
candidates, have spent much of the primary attacking each other, 
playing right into Goodman's campaign. A poll released this week 
showed Goodman, a registered Democrat, leading the race with 36 
percent support, followed by Fine with 21 percent and Adamsen with 
20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 418 registered voters, conducted by Mason-Dixon  
Polling &AMP; Research Inc. for the Las Vegas Review-Journal and 
KTNV-TV, had a margin of error of 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	If no candidate wins a simple majority next week, the top two  
vote-getters will face off in the June 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in the last week has Adamsen gone on the attack, running a  
commercial with clips of Goodman seeming to suggest the government 
should sell drugs.

	``Those are his words, and he either has to defend them or eat  
his words,'' said Adamsen, who bills himself as ``Mr. Traffic 
Signal and Mr. Crossing Guard'' for his work on safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those were just sound bites,'' Goodman said. ``Everything was  
tongue-in-cheek. People have to have a sense of humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's more outlandish statements from the past haven't  
seemed to hurt him as he wages a populist campaign portraying 
himself as a defender of the defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the guy who continued to insist there ``is no Mafia''  
even after the bodies of Spilotro and his brother were found in an 
Illinois cornfield in 1986. Goodman later admitted it might not 
have been a farming accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman came to Las Vegas in 1965 and got his first big break  
when he was hired as legal counsel to Lansky. But even though he 
reveled in the courtroom battles, Goodman said he never socialized 
with mob clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamsen said Goodman would not only make a lousy mayor, but  
would be particularly bad for a city dominated by casino 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of Goodman's old adversaries say he would do just fine.  
Former federal prosecutor Lamond Mills, who battled Goodman in 
court, did a television commercial praising his former antagonist. 
</P>
<P>
	``This town has been run by the good old boys and real estate  
developers for a long time,'' Mills said. ``If Oscar is elected 
he'll take this system and stand it on its head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Goodman knows it is his celebrity and not his working  
knowledge of city problems that is making him the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm colorful and that's what got me in the limelight. If I  
were a podiatrist running for mayor you wouldn't be here,'' he told 
a reporter. ``I don't apologize for one day in my life.''

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 4.5 Percent Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remarkable U.S. economy grew at a strong  
4.5 percent annual rate in the first three months of this year, far 
above expectations, as consumers spent at the fastest pace in more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the solid growth in the  
gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, 
came despite the fact that the nation's trade deficit, battered by 
overseas economic turmoil, soared to a record level from January 
through March, subtracting 2.4 percentage points from overall 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Without this drag from trade, which amounted to a loss of $55.6  
billion in output, the GDP would grown at an even more remarkable 
6.9 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP report underscored the view of most economists that  
Americans are enjoying the best combination of strong growth, low 
unemployment and low inflation in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration, worried about rising  
protectionist pressures spawned by such higher trade deficits, has 
stepped up pressure on Japan and Europe to do more to boost their 
own growth as a way to increase U.S. exports and begin to narrow 
the trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.5 percent growth rate for the first quarter, more than a  
percentage point higher than many economists had been expecting, 
was faster than the 3.9 percent growth turned in for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The new GDP figure underscored that the U.S. economy has managed  
to prosper despite nearly two years of global currency turmoil that 
has pushed one-third of the world economy into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of overseas markets has been offset by American  
consumers, who increased spending at a 6.7 percent rate in the 
first three months of the year, the largest advance since a 7.2 
percent rise in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong spending has been bolstered by the lowest  
unemployment in nearly three decades, a soaring stock market and 
record highs for consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are so confident that they are dipping heavily into  
savings to finance their buying binge. The GDP report showed that 
the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable 
income, dropped to a negative number of minus 0.5 percent in the 
first quarter, an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the strong consumer demand and tight labor markets,  
inflation remained a no-show in the first three months of the year. 
A price measure tied to the GDP rose at an annual rate of just 1 
percent, little changed from a 0.9 percent increase in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling import prices, including big drops last year in  
petroleum prices because of slumping global demand, have played a 
major role in keeping U.S. inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the low inflation, the Federal Reserve has been able  
to permit faster economic growth than it would normally sanction 
with the unemployment rate at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally by this time, the central bank would have started to  
raise interest rates to slow economic growth and keep tight job 
markets from pushing inflation higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But a report Thursday showed that employers' cost for wages and  
benefits increased by the smallest amount on record, reinforcing 
the belief of many economists that the Fed will leave interest 
rates alone, possibly for the rest of this year, hoping that growth 
will slow on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.5 percent total GDP increase in the first quarter was down  
from a 6 percent surge in the final three months of last year, the 
biggest quarterly advance in nearly 15 years, a growth spike that 
was aided by a temporary narrowing in the trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first quarter, the 6.7 percent increase in consumer  
spending followed a strong 5 percent advance in the fourth quarter. 
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Business investment, which has been a driving force throughout  
this expansion, now the longest in peacetime history, was strong in 
the first quarter as well, rising by 10 percent with heavy 
investment in computers continuing, a gain in that category of 10.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing construction, which has been propelled by low mortgage  
rates and low unemployment, jumped 15.6 percent, the fastest 
advance in a year.

<HEADLINE> Dress Codes Tighten After Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Trench coat bans and school uniform proposals are  
sweeping the country as school districts try to bust up cliques, 
create conformity and keep youngsters from smuggling weapons 
following the Columbine High massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what causes a lot of children to get to the point  
where they break is because of feeling they are outcasts, and a lot 
of it has to do with how they dress and how they are able to 
look,'' said Alderman Sidney Turnipseed, who has asked the county 
school board in the Memphis suburb of Collierville, Tenn., to 
consider requiring uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 13 people before  
committing suicide April 20 at their Littleton, Colo., school. The 
teens were part of the so-called Trenchcoat Mafia and shared a 
predilection for dark ``Goth'' culture. 
</P>
<P>
	According to diary entries, their rage stemmed partly from  
feelings that they were social outcasts in a teen-age pecking order 
dominated by popular athletes. Harris and Klebold were apparently 
able to hide weapons beneath their long black coats. 
</P>
<P>
	While there have been other horrifying school shootings over the  
last two years -- in Pearl, Miss.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and Springfield, 
Ore. -- Littleton seems to be the first to prompt such widespread 
discussion on school dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of trench coat prohibitions -- in place already in  
Littleton; Portsmouth, N.H.; Henrietta, N.Y.; Hamblen County, 
Tenn.; and Scottsboro, Ala., for example -- consider the rule akin 
to metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dress code measures are aimed at imposing conformity and  
limiting adolescent isolation. President Clinton has said that 
school uniforms or a ``nonprovocative-dress'' code could address 
``this whole black trench coat deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids have always had different styles and fashions and fads  
that indicate rebelliousness, but when it reaches a point where it 
can also conceal weapons, then you need to address the potential 
danger,'' said Ron Stern, an elementary administrator in Granite 
City, Ill. The school board in the St. Louis suburb is considering 
a ban on trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics called such views misguided.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just because we have chains and spikes doesn't mean we're  
gonna go shooting people,'' said Patrick Connor, a 15-year-old 
freshman in the western Massachusetts community of Pittsfield, 
where city council members this week narrowly defeated a bid to 
prohibit ``flamboyant and excessively morbid'' dress. Connor wears 
a jacket with metal studs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dress code opponents said children will poke fun at others no  
matter what they wear, uniforms will not stop kids from forming 
cliques, and bans will do nothing to address the social isolation 
many youngsters feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to change the behavior of children who are  
deeply enough disturbed to do something like the two shooters in 
Colorado did,'' said Marc Posner, a researcher at the Education 
Development Center in Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	While such ``knee-jerk'' dress codes won't prevent another  
Littleton, they might reassure some students -- and certainly many 
parents, said Charles Figley, who directs The Traumatology 
Institute at Florida State University. 
</P>
<P>
	But some wondered at what point clothing bans will stop.  
</P>
<P>
	``I almost wish somebody in a football jersey had done it. What  
would they do then?'' asked Sarah Wunsch, an attorney with the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, which opposes 
dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools must do their homework, however, if they want a clothing  
code to survive a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Attire is considered a form of free expression and a  
constitutional right. Dress codes have only been upheld when 
schools could prove that the regulations addressed a specific 
problem, said June Arnette, associate director of the National 
School Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Election Bonus Is the Panama Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *BY ELOY O. AGUILAR   	
</P>
<P>
	PANAMA (AP) -- The winner of Sunday's presidential elections in  
this Central American country gets a big bonus: the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 31, the United States will turn the canal over to the  
new president, ending a relationship between the two countries that 
began with Panama's birth as a nation in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panama Canal Commission, now part of the U.S. government,  
will become an autonomous Panamanian agency in charge of the 
shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans taken by more than 
14,000 ships a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama, a country of 2.8 million people in the thin waist of the  
American continent, is only recently returning to democracy after a 
U.S. invasion ended the authoritarian rule of Gen. Manuel Noriega 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	So the United States and other countries have questions about  
the Panamanians' ability to run the canal. Panama insists those are 
misguided. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot afford to fail before the entire world,'' said  
Martin Torrijos, the ruling-party candidate. ``We are confident 
that we are capable of running the canal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Torrijos' father, the late military strongman Gen. Omar  
Torrijos, who engineered with then-President Carter the 1977 Canal 
Treaties whose final act of fulfillment will be the transfer of the 
waterway. 
</P>
<P>
	Mireya Moscoso, 52, the opposition candidate who polls show in a  
statistical dead heat with Torrijos, pledged to keep the canal free 
of politics and preserve the ecological balance that provides the 
water needed to raise and lower ships from one ocean to another 
through narrow locks at both ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``As president of Panama, I will be vigilant to make sure  
corruption and politics never invade the Panama Canal,'' she said 
at a campaign rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The official view of U.S. officials here is that the canal has  
lost its importance and the country its strategic value -- and that 
there is no need for a continued military presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad crossings and other facilities in the United States  
have reduced the U.S. reliance on the canal to move goods from one 
ocean to another. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Panamanian jungles have long served as U.S. military  
training grounds, that role has been declining as well. At the end 
of World War II, U.S. military here numbered 67,000. That number 
has dropped to 14,000 in recent years, even before the handover 
process began. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, some U.S. officials express concern that the canal  
will become outdated and may fall victim to Panamanian corruption 
and mismanagement. They say Panama needs to reassure the 
international shipping community that the canal will be run 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	Panamanians call that sour grapes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose it would be logical for many to think that we are  
going to destroy it,'' said Roberto Eisenmann, former publisher of 
La Prensa, the country's largest newspaper. But he says critics 
forget that the actual transfer of the canal started in 1985, when 
a Panamanian became assistant administrator of the canal, and 
accelerated when another Panamanian was named administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, more than 95 percent of the commission's 9,000 employees  
and 75 percent of the 300 pilots in charge of guiding ships through 
the canal are Panamanian. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States now pays Panama a share of the canal's  
revenues, about $100 million a year. But with the canal in 
Panamanian hands that income will more than double. Ships paid $545 
million in tolls in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a big bonus, ``but it could also be a problem,'' Eisenmann  
said. Traffic continues to increase each year, but to remain 
competitive, the canal needs to invest heavily in maintenance and 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	An audit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determined that the  
canal needs to invest $100 million annually through 2005 in 
services and equipment to reduce the passage time -- now nine hours 
-- and increase traffic by 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal, built in 1914, was originally designed to last 75  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal is the biggest jewel in the package the United States  
will transfer to Panama, but far from the only one. There are also 
98,800 acres formerly occupied by U.S. military bases along the 
canal banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama plans to use the area to develop ecological tourism and  
build ports and industrial parks.

<HEADLINE> Average Results for Chrysler Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chrysler Corp.'s three-year ``service action''  
to recall millions of minivans and fix them for free, long 
criticized as inadequate by consumer advocacy groups, has resulted 
in about the same percentage of vehicles repaired as a traditional 
recall, a government report shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was  
investigating why rear liftgate latches were popping open on some 
of the 4.37 million minivans that had the latches when Chrysler 
offered to replace them with stronger ones, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-seven people died in accidents when the liftgates opened  
and they were ejected from the rear of the popular Chrysler 
minivans from the 1984 through 1995 model years, according to NHTSA 
records. At least 134 ejections and 135 injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A final government report on the recall, obtained Thursday, says  
63 percent of minivan owners got the replacement latch. ``The 
overall completion rate is acceptable, given that some of the 
vehicles involved in this campaign are as much as 14 years old,'' 
the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics charged the government sidestepped its own procedures in  
agreeing to Chrysler's ``service action'' rather than making a 
formal finding of an auto defect, which leads to an official 
recall. Consumer groups said the service campaign left customers 
with the impression the problem was not important. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler, now DaimlerChrysler AG after a merger last year, said  
at the time that the latches were being replaced for customers' 
peace of mind after unfavorable publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Top federal regulators said it was results that counted, not  
procedure, and the agreement avoided a contentious legal battle 
since Chrysler argued the latches had no safety defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler's notification campaign for the massive replacement  
program was unusual because minivan owners who failed to respond to 
the initial owner notifications mailed in 1995 and 1996 received 
second and third mailings, and some received follow-up phone calls, 
regulators and DaimlerChrysler said. Dealership coordinators also 
received millions of dollars in incentives to bring customers in 
for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of owners bringing in their minivans was lower  
than regulators had initially predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	About 64 percent of van owners on average respond to recall  
notices. Michael Brownlee, then a top NHTSA official, predicted in 
1995 that Chrysler would substantially exceed that rate. And Dr. 
Ricardo Martinez, the agency's administrator, said: ``I will be 
very disappointed if we did not get much more than the 64 
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much a wash,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of  
the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. ``The reason (the 
service action) did as well as it did is because normally 
(automakers) don't do three mailings. The fact that there was so 
much criticism put them to the test to try to get these vehicles 
recalled.''

	Airline Again Cancels Flights  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines is blaming what it calls an  
illegal slowdown by its mechanics' union for delays in repair and 
maintenance that have forced cancellation of more than 200 flights 
since Sunday. Mechanics are taking longer than expected to repair 
planes, leaving aircraft unready for takeoff, said airline 
spokesman Jack Evans in Seattle. As a result of the delays, 35 
flights were canceled Tuesday, 52 Wednesday, 46 yesterday and 31 by 
mid-morning today, Evans said. Cancellations usually number about 
five a day. The mechanics' union -- the Airline Mechanics Fraternal 
Association -- has been in contract talks with the airline since 
last summer.

	Virgin Won't Fly on New Year's Eve

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virgin Atlantic Airways said today it will  
ground its 25-plane fleet on New Year's Eve -- to give its employees 
a special night off, not because of any concern that computers will 
malfunction due to Y2K problems. Most airlines are expected to keep 
flying on New Year's Eve, although many are weighing a reduction in 
overseas flights because of uncertainty about how computers in some 
foreign countries and airports will handle the switchover from 1999 
to 2000. Virgin Atlantic's mass cancellation is the first such 
action taken by an international carrier. A British regional 
carrier, Jersey European Airways, has said it won't fly Jan. 1 to 
give its employees time to celebrate.

	Volvo Increases Share in Scania  
</P>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo announced today that it has  
increased its stake in rival Swedish truck- and bus-maker Scania to 
about 15 percent. Volvo surprised the business community in January 
with the announcement that it had bought 13 percent of the shares 
in Scania and that it was seeking to merge. But talks between Volvo 
and the Investor holding company, which holds 45 percent of the 
shares in Scania, broke down this spring. Volvo in January sold its 
small but prestigious passenger car division to Ford Motor Co. for 
$6.45 billion, saying it wanted to concentrate on its other 
business areas including trucks, buses, heavy equipment, and marine 
and aeronautical engines.

	Economy Grows at 4.5 Percent Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy keeps surging, defying  
expectations with a brisk 4.5 percent growth rate for the first 
three months of the year. Economists marveled at the ``wondrous'' 
performance and President Clinton said: ``America's economic 
expansion continues to grow steady and strong.'' First-quarter 
growth in the gross domestic product, a measure of the nation's 
total output of goods and services, was faster than the economy's 
3.9 percent growth for 1998, the Commerce Department said today. It 
exceeded most analysts' predictions by a full percentage point and 
continued the country's longest period of economic expansion in 
peacetime history.

	Justice Probes Underwriting of IPOs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is investigating  
possible anti-competitive practices in securities firms' 
underwriting of initial public offerings of stock, a department 
spokeswoman said today. The investigation was disclosed in a filing 
with securities regulators by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Wall Street's 
largest privately held securities firm, which is scheduled for its 
own IPO next week. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. also confirmed 
today that the department had requested documents. Merrill Lynch &AMP; 
Co. and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. both declined to confirm or deny that 
they, too, had received a subpoena. Goldman, Sachs said in a 
Securities and Exchange Commission filing today that the department 
had issued it a civil subpoena for information ``with respect to 
its investigation of an alleged conspiracy among securities 
underwriters to fix underwriting fees.''

	US To Bring 7 New Cases Before WTO  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today targeted  
Europe, India, South Korea, Canada and Argentina for various 
alleged unfair trade practices. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky said the administration would bring seven new cases 
before the World Trade Organization in a variety of disputes 
ranging from European aviation practices to Indian barriers 
affecting U.S. automakers. The cases were being brought under a 
section of U.S. trade law that allows the United States to impose 
economic sanctions if a country does not agree to reform. 
Barshefsky said the new raft of trade cases is intended to ensure 
that the United States receives benefits negotiated in global trade 
talks before negotiations begin again in November.

	New Zealander Nominated To Head WTO  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Former New Zealand Prime Minister Mike Moore was  
nominated today to head the World Trade Organization in a close 
race that pitted him against Thailand's deputy prime minister. Ali 
Mchumo, chairman of the WTO's decision-making council, told council 
members he proposed Moore because he had support from 62 nations, 
three more than Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand. The meeting was 
adjourned to let members weigh the nomination. With a new round of 
trade talks looming and a ministerial conference coming up in 
Seattle in November, the role of WTO director-general is regarded 
as key. The organization is responsible for pushing through 
agreements to liberalize global commerce and set free trade rules.

	Brazilian Economy Cuts 3M Earnings  
</P>
<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- 3M reported a 4 percent drop in  
first-quarter earnings due to the weak Brazilian economy and a 
strong dollar overseas. The Maplewood-based maker of Scotch brand 
tape, scouring pads and other consumer, industrial and electronics 
products, said today it earned $384 million, or 95 cents per share, 
compared with $400 million, or 98 cents a share, a year ago. That 
was above Wall Street's expectations. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call Corp. expected earnings of 91 cents a share. Changes in 
currency exchange rates reduced earnings by an estimated 2 cents a 
share.

	Japan's Jobless Rate Hits Record  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Corporate restructuring efforts helped send Japan's  
jobless rate to yet another record high of 4.8 percent last month. 
The latest government unemployment rate figure reported today 
topped the previous all-time high of 4.6 percent set in February. 
Jobs remain scarce and the situation is unlikely to improve soon, 
government officials say. The jobless data are likely to heighten 
pessimism about the nation's economy, which could further hurt 
chances for a turnaround as worried consumers curtail spending. 
Lackluster consumer spending is a major reason the Japanese economy 
has not been able to rescue itself.

<HEADLINE> Hailing Century's Best Nonfiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Let the arguments begin, again.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a year after its list for this century's best fiction was  
ridiculed as a work of fiction itself, a last stand for the white, 
male guard, the Modern Library was back Thursday with some 
hopefully more appealing picks for nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The selections were announced on the eve of BookExpo America,  
the publishing industry's annual national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to settle on 100 English-language works, the Modern  
Library's voting panel was younger, and more racially and sexually 
integrated than the fiction committee. Its final list included 
everyone from Virginia Woolf to Tom Wolfe to Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the No. 1 book was a favorite of the old school: ``The  
Education of Henry Adams,'' published near the turn of the century 
and a classic statement of longing for simpler times. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't be my choice,'' said Lindy Hess, director of the  
summer publishing course at Radcliffe College. Last year, in 
response to the Modern Library's fiction list, she and her students 
announced their own, very different favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	So, for nonfiction, what should be No. 1?  
</P>
<P>
	``The Diary of Anne Frank.''  
</P>
<P>
	She was Dutch. This list is for English language.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Second Sex,'' by Simone de Beauvoir.  
</P>
<P>
	She was French.  
</P>
<P>
	``This,'' Hess said, ``is hard to do.''  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike with fiction, where such novels as ``Ulysses'' and ``The  
Great Gatsby'' make for obvious choices, there is no real canon for 
nonfiction. If you're a scientist, you might pick ``The Double 
Helix,'' James D. Watson's story of discovering DNA. An economist 
might go for John Maynard Keynes' ``The General Theory of 
Employment, Interest, and Money.'' A social activist might mention 
Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three books, by the way, made the top 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Blacks and women were far better represented than on the fiction  
list. The top 10 included one black, Booker T. Washington for ``Up 
From Slavery,'' and two women: Carson and Woolf, for ``A Room of 
One's Own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other blacks, James Baldwin (``Notes of a Native Son'') and  
Richard Wright (``Black Boy''), and two more women, Barbara Tuchman 
(``The Guns of August'') and Gertrude Stein (``The Autobiography of 
Alice B. Toklas''), made the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like they sort of learned their lesson from the  
fiction list,'' said novelist and essayist Mary Gordon. ``It sounds 
like a pretty good list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Nabokov, whose novel ``Lolita'' ranked No. 4 on the  
fiction list, was the only writer to make the top 10 in both 
categories. His memoir ``Speak, Memory'' came in at No. 8 for 
nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the top 10 were T.S. Eliot's ``Selected Essays,  
1917-1932'' and H.L. Mencken's ``The American Language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all the lucky authors could be gathered together, it would be  
the most memorable of publishing parties. The list joins such 
famous rivals as Washington and W.E.B. DuBois, Edward O. Wilson and 
Stephen Jay Gould, and Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King 
Jr. It includes Winston Churchill, Studs Terkel, Albert Einstein 
and Mark Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	Inevitably, some favorite books didn't make it. Hess mentioned  
Betty Friedan's ``The Feminine Mystique'' and Joan Didion's ``The 
White Album.'' Also missing were Ernest Hemingway's ``A Moveable 
Feast,'' James Agee's and Walker Evans' ``Let Us Now Praise Famous 
Men'' and Leon Edel's biography of Henry James. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it distressed me that there were no books about film on  
the list,'' said novelist Caleb Carr, a committee member. He had 
supported a collaboration between Francois Truffaut and Alfred 
Hitchcock, based on conversations they had in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's influenced more directors than any other book,'' Carr  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nice thing about the Modern Library list, critics and  
supporters agree, is that it gets people talking about books, and 
presumably reading them. Even books they thought they didn't care 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, for instance, admitted she tried reading ``The Education  
of Henry Adams'' back in high school and couldn't finish. ``Dull 
and plodding'' was how she remembered it. 
</P>
<P>
	And now?  
</P>
<P>
	``If it's No. 1,'' she said, ``I'm certainly going to give it  
another try.''

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Exchange Trading Floor Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- From an age of traders in kimono and clogs 120  
years ago to today's slick-suited players moving millions in a 
second, the Tokyo Stock Exchange has borne witness to Japan's rise 
to economic prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Japan's financial world bade farewell to an era as  
the closing bell rang on the trading floor for the last time. 
Computers and cost-cutting put an end to face-to-face trading on 
Asia's largest exchange at a time when Japan's economy is deep in 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the trading session, there was a ceremony replete  
with confetti and party noisemakers, marking the retirement of a 
system that had long stopped being the center of market activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The floor of the Tokyo exchange was once an arena for more than  
2,000 traders fighting for position as they used a complex sign 
language to buy and sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the early 1980s, securities companies have been  
switching to faster and more reliable electronic trading systems. 
By last year, any Japanese stock could be bought and sold 
electronically while fewer than 10 percent could be traded directly 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 100 employees still worked there and floor trading  
accounted for a scant 0.2 percent of Tokyo volume. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen securities-industry veterans demonstrated on Friday what  
is soon to be a lost art -- the trading by hand signals with which 
millions of dollars of shares could be bought with the wave of a 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took a lot of pride in being the fastest with an order,''  
said 68-year-old Miyoji Maruyama, who was a floor trader for eight 
years, starting in 1951. ``Now it's a competition between human 
brains and computers and computers make fewer mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading floor veterans said the shift to computers was  
inevitable, especially with the growing complexity of financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	And securities companies say they will save money by moving  
floor traders to more productive jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But many were sad to see the century-old tradition die.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before computers there was a feeling that the market was a  
living creature,'' said Toshinobu Yoshida, a floor trader for 35 
years. ``Now everyone is separated from the market and people don't 
even seem to notice if it's up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Japan's largest broker, Nomura Securities, had kept fewer  
than 10 traders on the floor of the exchange recently, company 
spokesman Isao Kawanaba said. They will be transferred to other 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Computerization isn't the only reason Tokyo trading has become  
more subdued in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged economic downturn and a decade-long decline in stock  
values has forced Japan's biggest brokers to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
	During Japan's ``bubble'' economy, Tokyo's benchmark stock index  
was more than twice its current value. And at the peak of market 
activity in 1988, there was more than twice as much trading as 
there was last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor trading is still conducted at stock exchanges in New York  
and Frankfurt, Germany, but other major exchanges have already gone 
completely electronic. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, and Paris have  
all closed their trading floors since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has had a formal stock exchange since 1878. In the early  
years traders wore traditional Japanese clothing and exchange 
officials tallied transactions with abacuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed for almost four years from 1945 as the  
country focused its attention on repairing its war-torn economy. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of that time, the sign over the entrance to the Tokyo  
exchange read ``Commander Naval Forces Far East'' and U.S. 
occupational forces used the trading floor as a gym and dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the expansive trading floor, with its 165-foot-high  
ceiling, will be remodeled for use as a stock and corporate 
information center.

<HEADLINE> Greece Awards F-16 Fighter Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece awarded Lockheed Martin a $2  
billion contract for more than 50 F-16 jet fighters as part of its 
program to modernize its armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Costas Simitis also announced that France's Dassault  
Aviation will be given a contract for 15 new Mirage 2000-5's and an 
order to upgrade 10 others in Greece's fleet of about 60. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say how much that contract -- which will include new  
weapons systems for all Mirage aircraft -- was worth. Each plane has 
an estimated cost of about $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the last such aircraft contract expected to go to an  
American company. Simitis said that from 2005, Greece will begin 
flying the Eurofighter, built by a four-nation European consortium 
led by British Aerospace and Dassault. 
</P>
<P>
	Simitis said Greece will buy between 60 and 90 Eurofighters  
after becoming a partner in the consortium. He added that up to 80 
percent of the aircraft will be built here and are expected to be 
delivered by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	``By deciding today that in the future Greece will participate  
in the Eurofighter program, we have decided on a homogenization of 
the armaments of our air force,'' Simitis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece currently flies a variety of American and French jets,  
mostly F-16's and Mirage 2000's. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin's F-16 beat out Boeing's F-15E, the Mirage and  
Russia's Su-27. The first jets are expected to be delivered in 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials are also lobbying Greece for naval and army  
contracts, including the M1-A2 Abrams battle tank.

<HEADLINE> Severinsen Quits Buffalo Orchestra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Doc Severinsen quit as pops conductor of  
the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra in a dispute with management 
over marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Severinsen said Thursday he's unhappy with a plan by the  
orchestra's new executive director, Lawrence Ribits, to replace two 
outside marketing consultants with an in-house marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it known with no punches held that I was very  
comfortable working with those women, and that it would probably 
not work well for me another way. In other words, if it's working, 
don't fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	``From then on, it was a contentious situation between him and  
me. All I wanted was to do the job and have it be a success,'' 
Severinsen said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The former leader of the band on ``The Tonight Show'' is in his  
seventh year with the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Philharmonic executives said they were blindsided by  
Severinsen's decision.

<HEADLINE> Text of Statement From Patriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the statement released by the New England Patriots today  
regarding the team's decision to cancel a deal to move the team to 
Hartford, Conn.: 

</P>
<P>
	The New England Patriots today announced that the team has  
terminated its agreement with the State of Connecticut under which 
the state would have financed construction of a 68,000-seat 
football stadium in downtown Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of an agreement reached earlier this year, the  
Patriots had the right to terminate the pact by May 2 if it was in 
doubt that the state would be able to open the stadium in time for 
the beginning of the 2002 season. 
</P>
<P>
	After placing a call to Connecticut Gov. John Rowland late this  
afternoon, Patriots owner Robert Kraft sent the governor a letter 
in which he stated the following: 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that you and your staff have worked tirelessly to put  
this deal together, but clearly, the scope of this project was a 
mountainous undertaking and much more complex than anyone 
anticipated when our discussions originally began. We know that you 
have exhausted every effort to meet the deadlines that have been 
within your control, but it has become clear to us that the goal of 
playing in a new stadium in Hartford by the year 2002 has a 
significant degree of uncertainty. When we originally announced our 
intentions to play in Hartford, we discussed a 2001 kickoff, but as 
I write this letter, the most probable kickoff in Hartford is now 
2003, five seasons from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making the announcement of the termination of the stadium  
agreement Kraft said, ``We owe a great debt of gratitude to Gov. 
Rowland and his staff, the Connecticut General Assembly and its 
leadership, the state Office of Policy and Management and the 
state's business and community leaders who worked so hard in this 
effort to help the Patriots remain a competitive franchise in New 
England.''

<HEADLINE> Controversy in Missouri Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Thirty people have been executed  
during Democrat Mel Carnahan's governorship, more than four times 
the number put to death during the two terms Republican John 
Ashcroft occupied the office. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Carnahan who created the office of crime victims' rights,  
toughened sentences for dangerous juveniles and sexual predators, 
and authorized the construction of five new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carnahan also commuted the death sentence of a murderer, an  
``act of mercy'' personally requested by the pope that has put the 
governor on the defensive in his race to unseat Ashcroft from his 
Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ashcroft is going to try to make all the political hay he  
can,'' said Saint Louis University political scientist Ken Warren. 
``He wants to try to make Carnahan look as soft as possible on 
crime, even though Carnahan's record shows he is not soft on 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate race already has had its share of spats observers  
like Warren have described as utterly bogus. In March, each camp 
suggested the other's Web site established links to sordid 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	That struck many as absurd, considering the spotless reputations  
of the candidates. Ashcroft is a gospel-singing son of an 
Assemblies of God minister, and Carnahan is a Southern Baptist 
deacon. 
</P>
<P>
	The commutation question, however, promises to have a much  
longer political shelf life. The controversy hasn't abated since 
Pope John Paul II looked into the governor's eyes three months ago 
and urged him to prevent Darrell Mease's execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft is holding a hearing in St. Louis on Saturday to  
discuss a crime victims' rights proposal. The headline on his news 
release: ``Family Members Will Tell of Impact of Mease 
Commutation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star witnesses at the hearing will be Buck and Anita  
Lawrence, parents of Willie Lawrence, the 19-year-old paraplegic 
killed by Mease's shotgun blast in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had no defense,'' Anita Lawrence said of her son after the  
Jan. 28 commutation. ``It was like killing a little old ant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawrences were furious to learn of the commutation through  
news reports, and Carnahan told a crime victims' rally on Thursday 
that he regretted the ``human error'' in failing to notify them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But one single act should not diminish the substantial record  
on crime victims' rights that we have worked so hard to shape 
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he was simply moved by the pope's ``extraordinary  
and specific request,'' made in the presence of Vice President Al 
Gore under the soaring dome of the St. Louis Cathedral Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, in fact, an act of mercy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan dismissed Ashcroft's hearing as ``transparently  
political,'' which the senator denied. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Thursday, Ashcroft said the Lawrences  
``can contribute an awareness of what a crime victim's circumstance 
is in a setting that relates to a commutation or a pardon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri resumed death penalties in January 1989 while Ashcroft  
was governor, and he never commuted such a sentence. Besides Mease, 
Carnahan has commuted one other, for an inmate who was declared 
mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft wants to amend a proposal sponsored by Sens. Jon Kyl,  
R-Ariz., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to require advance notice 
of commutation decisions for victims and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator and the Lawrences' attorney, Mark Richardson, said  
the parents asked for an opportunity to talk about the commutation. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not political people,'' Richardson said. ``They are  
genuinely, willingly coming forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bev Livingston, leader of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers in  
Missouri and a longtime victims' advocate, said she welcomed any 
attention to victims' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just would hate to see them be victimized twice by being  
exploited for political purposes,'' Ms. Livingston said of the 
Lawrences. ``That would be a crime in itself.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meritt M. Burnett, who attributed his  
longevity to doing all things in moderation and who smoked cigars 
until he was 107, died Tuesday at age 109 of prostate cancer at 
Howard University Hospital.

grandfathers hid slaves on the Underground Railroad. He retired 
from the Export-Import Bank as head messenger in 1960 and later 
opened his home to Howard University students for room and board.

	Snow and rain showers spread across the Rockies early today,  
while a slow-moving storm dumped rain in the Southeast. The rest of 
the country was mostly dry. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure should continue to deliver tranquil conditions to  
the northern United States, from New England west to the upper 
Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly cloudy skies were expected in the Lower Mississippi  
Valley and the central and southern Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered thunderstorms, some producing hail, were possible  
along with the rain showers from the Carolinas down to Florida. On 
Thursday, at least two tornadoes hit the Florida Panhandle, 
knocking down trees in parts of Okaloosa County and dumping hail 
the size of large marbles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the western part of the country, a persistent trough of low  
pressure should bring snow to the high elevations of the Rockies 
from Montana all the way south to Arizona. Ten inches could 
accumulate in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain showers and scattered thunderstorms should continue in the  
lower elevations across the region, with the strongest storms in 
southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico and western Texas. A few 
of these storms could contain large hail, damaging winds or even 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the far West, dry conditions should prevail along the coast.

<HEADLINE> Congress Cool on Civility Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some ideas generated at a bipartisan retreat  
aimed at making Congress a more civil place are receiving a cool 
reception from key House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	They suggested that proposals for fundamental changes in how the  
House runs would not be welcome, partly because they are not 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our differing beliefs many times simply result in an honest  
and vigorous debate. Nonetheless, incivility in the House is 
rare,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of a House Rules 
subcommittee that held a hearing on the proposals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead organizers of last month's congressional weekend in  
Hershey, Pa., touted the benefits of having 190 of the House's 435 
members gather to form across-the-aisle relationships and craft 
solutions to the House's ills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an experiment and it will succeed only if we have that  
bone-deep understanding that democracy is difficult,'' said Rep. 
Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	But organizers declined to detail the proposals they will  
include in their final report to House leaders, saying they wanted 
to present them first to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers intend to set only a few goals and realize they need  
both leaders' cooperation, said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Linder, though, said that while events such as the Hershey  
retreat are ``very helpful to the level of discourse, wholesale 
changes do not appear to be necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., the committee chairman: ``The  
most important thing we can do to improve civility is to provide 
opportunities for members and their families to get to know each 
other on a more personal level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the first Hershey conference in 1997, organizers pressed  
scores of recommendations, but few were adopted. This time, they 
hope for more success with a narrowly focused effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority Democrats -- still smarting that GOP leaders barred a  
censure vote during the impeachment debate and upset over committee 
representation -- vented the most frustrations at the retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, their suggestions focused more on changing how the House  
operates, while Republican ideas tended toward speaking 
respectfully during debate, said a top Hershey organizer, Rep. Anna 
Eshoo, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ideas discussed were forming an oversight committee to  
set standards for the majority party's treatment of the minority 
and developing a less grueling schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	For the civility campaigners, the biggest key to change lies  
with House leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who our leaders are set our tone around here,'' LaHood said.

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Exchange Trading Floor Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- During the late 1980s, the daily frenzy on the  
floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was a symbol of Japan's energetic 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But recession has since replaced boom. And today, computers and  
cost-cutting put an end to the 120-year old tradition of 
face-to-face trading on Asia's largest exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge open floor of the Tokyo exchange was once crowded with  
more than 2,000 traders, fighting for position as they used a 
complex sign-language to buy and sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, after the end of the trading day, it was the site of a  
closing ceremony replete with confetti and party noisemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The floor long ago stopped being the center of trading activity.  
Securities companies began switching to faster and more reliable 
electronic trading systems in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	By last year, all Japanese stocks could be traded by computer  
while fewer than 10 percent could be traded directly on the floor. 
Only about 100 employees still worked on the floor and trading 
there accounted for a scant 0.2 percent of Tokyo volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities companies and the exchange will save money by moving  
those workers to more productive jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, it is an epoch-making event but we don't think much  
about it,'' said Isao Kawanaba, a spokesman for Japan's biggest 
brokerage, Nomura Securities. ``There are very few people working 
there now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura's last floor traders would be transferred to other  
divisions, Kawanaba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Computerization isn't the only reason Tokyo trading has become  
more subdued in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged economic downturn and a decade-long decline in stock  
values has forced Japan's biggest brokers to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
	During Japan's ``bubble'' economy, Tokyo's benchmark stock index  
was more than twice its current value. And at the peak of market 
activity in 1988, there was more than twice as much trading as last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor trading is still done in New York and Frankfurt, Germany  
but other major exchanges have ceased already and gone completely 
electronic. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1986, stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, and  
Paris have closed their trading floors. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have been traded on a Tokyo exchange since 1878, though  
the market was closed for almost four years from 1945 as the 
country focused its attention on repairing its war-torn economy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. occupation forces used the trading floor briefly as a gym  
and dance hall before the exchange opened again in 1949, following 
Japan's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge trading floor, with it's 165-foot-high ceiling, will be  
remodeled for use as a stock and corporate information center.

	Clinton Calls Meeting on Violence  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he's inviting  
representatives of the entertainment industry, religious groups, 
weapons producers and others to the White House in May for a 
strategy session on youth violence. He says there's ``no simple 
single answer'' to the violence that broke out in Colorado last 
week. But he says there shouldn't be any fighting over who is to 
blame. Instead, he says, everyone should be looking for ways to 
take responsibility. He said he has ``listened carefully'' to what 
students, teachers, parents and others have said in the aftermath 
of the Colorado tragedy.

	Jesse Jackson Meets U.S. Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson held a prayer  
session with three American POWs today, but was told not to expect 
them to be freed anytime soon. The men were in good health, Jackson 
told CNN, saying ``our country should be proud of them.'' The civil 
rights leader added that the men have been kept isolated from one 
another in a military jail. He brought the men ``letters from 
family members, wives, spouses ... bibles and other religious 
paraphernalia.'' Shortly before the meeting, Assistant Foreign 
Minister Nebojsa Vujovic said the men's release ``is not on the 
agenda.''

	Panel Sets Up Kosovo Vote Showdown  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Setting up a showdown vote Monday, a committee  
today sent to the Senate without recommendation a proposal to widen 
President Clinton's authority to wage war in Yugoslavia. Senate 
leaders indicated they would try to kill the proposal, which would 
allow use of ground forces. The 14-4 vote by the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, sending the measure to the floor without a 
recommendation, comes as the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia 
intensifies. The committee was so deeply divided that the only 
motion to win a majority was the one to send it to the floor 
without a recommendation.

	Terrorism Death Toll Hits Record  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Terrorism took a record-high toll around the  
world in 1998, with 741 people killed and 5,952 injured. The 
bombings at two U.S. embassies in Africa caused many of the 
casualties. About 40 percent of the worldwide attacks -- or 111 of 
them -- were aimed at U.S. targets. Seventy-seven were bombings of 
multinational oil pipelines in Colombia. The State Department, in 
its annual report to Congress, made no changes in listing Cuba, 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria as sponsors of 
terrorism. The bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Kenya last August 
killed 291 people. The attack in Tanzania killed 10.

year before last week's massacre, officials confirmed today. The 
sheriff's deputy stationed at Columbine, Neil Gardner, received a 
report in March 1998 that Harris was detonating pipe bombs, the 
Denver Rocky Mountain News reported today. Sheriff's spokesman 
Steve Davis today confirmed that Gardner had been watching Harris 
``for quite some time,'' but without proof of a chargeable offense, 
there was nothing that he could do.

schoolchildren from the John Powers Center in Vernon Hills, a 
Chicago suburb, to the gathering in downstate East Peoria when it

<HEADLINE> Credit Firms Blamed for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most people believe credit card marketing to  
people under the age of 21 should be restricted, according to a new 
survey by the Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of people also believe credit card companies share  
the blame with debtors for the rising tide of personal 
bankruptcies, according to the survey released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty percent of respondents said they supported proposals to  
restrict credit card marketing to people under the age of 21, while 
17 percent opposed them. The remaining 3 percent didn't know or 
didn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, 74 percent of those polled said the credit card networks  
were at least partly responsible for the alarming increase in 
bankruptcy filings, while 22 percent said the companies were not 
responsible for it. Four percent of those polled said they didn't 
know, or refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation concluded, in a separate report on  
credit card debt, that consumers recently have exercised more 
restraint while card issuers have expanded their marketing and 
lines of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings come as legislation that would make it harder for  
people to erase their debts in bankruptcy court advances in 
Congress. This week, parallel bills cleared the House and Senate 
Judiciary Committees and are now awaiting votes by the two 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan legislation, being pushed by banks, credit card  
companies and retail businesses, is opposed by consumer groups, 
unions, civil rights groups and some Democratic lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Credit card issuers are shameless to lobby for personal  
bankruptcy restrictions while they aggressively market and extend 
credit,'' said Stephen Brobeck, the Consumer Federation's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined at a news conference by officials of Consumers  
Union, U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the United Auto 
Workers union. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the American Bankers Association couldn't  
immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong economy, the number of Americans filing  
personal bankruptcies last year reached a record 1.4 million, up 
more than 300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, big credit card networks, notably Visa and MasterCard,  
and retail-business groups say their losses from forgiven debts in 
bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest rates for consumers 
who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups and other opponents maintain the legislation  
favors corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey on bankruptcy blame, conducted by Opinion  
Research Corp. from April 22-25, covered a national sample of 1,011 
adults. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer To Leave When Torre Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- After 51 years, today could be Don  
Zimmer's last in professional baseball. Or maybe it'll be Saturday 
or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer has decided to leave the New York Yankees whenever Joe  
Torre is healthy enough to return as manager. Torre, who is 
recovering from prostate cancer surgery, could decide to take over 
as soon as tonight in Kansas City, although general manager Brian 
Cashman said that's not likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is not coming to Kansas City to manage Friday night;  
Friday night is not an option,'' Cashman said Thursday. ``I'd be 
surprised if it was in Kansas City, but I wouldn't rule it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman reiterated Cashman's comment in Kansas City today.  
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing Joe needs to do is acclimate himself to the  
travel and the demands of being with the team,'' said Rick Cerrone. 
``Tonight, Joe will just plan on watching the game.''. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who wants to leave to rest his aching right knee, was to  
talk things over with Torre this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe says he's managing (tonight), I'll go home,'' Zimmer  
said. ``If he says it'll be another week, I'll stay another week. 
... I don't want him to come back before he's ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said Torre will watch the Royals series from a luxury  
box until he decides he's physically ready to return to the dugout. 
He's being cautioned not to try coming back too soon for fear of 
getting worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's down, tired and fatigued, he's not going to be at his  
best to take the reins,'' Cashman said. ``No matter when he comes 
back, we'll say, `Wow, he came back fast.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer gathered his team in the clubhouse following Wednesday  
night's 8-6 loss to the Texas Rangers and announced: ``After 
tomorrow's game, I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He amended it Thursday to say he'd be around until Torre is  
back. Nonetheless, the Yankees went into last night's game knowing 
it could be their last with their beloved ``Popeye'' in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch led off with an inside-the-park homer and Tino  
Martinez added a three-run shot as New York beat Texas 5-3. It was 
the Yankees' fifth victory over the Rangers in six games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to see him (Torre) here,'' said Bernie  
Williams, who went 2-for-4 with an RBI and a run. ``Zim has done 
great, but it's been tough on him because of his knee. He's got to 
take care of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro Mendoza (3-1) cruised through eight innings, allowing an  
RBI double by Rusty Greer in the third and a two-run homer to 
Rafael Palmeiro in the eighth. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for 
his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mendoza would probably be the ace on most staffs,'' Rangers  
manager Johnny Oates said. ``He is a quality pitcher in my mind and 
he kept us off-balance most of the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morgan (4-1), who lost his bid to become baseball's first  
five-game winner, left after being hit on his right shin by Derek 
Jeter's line drive in the fifth. He's likely to make his next 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, was New York's bench coach the last three years  
until being asked in mid-March to serve as interim manager. He's 
guided them to first place in the AL East with a 14-6 record 
despite several key injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all miss his presence on the bench and in the clubhouse,  
his knowledge and insight,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ``He 
has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said the knee is 90 percent of the reason he's ready to  
leave. He classified the other 10 percent as personal. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he's had problems with team owner George  
Steinbrenner, Zimmer paused for more than 10 seconds, then slowly 
said: ``I'm not going to ruin my life by making bad statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his voice cracking and his bottom lip quivering, Zimmer  
added, ``I've been lucky enough to be in this game for 51 years. 
... I came in strong, quietly and that's the way I'd like to go 
out, not to burn any bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he's not calling this departure a retirement and he  
won't say he's quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say I'm going home,'' Zimmer said. ``I don't know what  
that means except I'm going home.'' 
</P>

 *Notes:* Knoblauch's leadoff homer was the 19th of his career. It  
was only the second inside-the-park homer at The Ballpark. Kansas 
City's Michael Tucker had the first on Aug. 16, 1996. ... Greer has 
an eight-game hitting streak, Texas' longest of the year. ... The 
Yankees put Roger Clemens on the disabled list with a strained left 
hamstring and called up left-handed reliever Tony Fossas. They also 
activated Brosius and sent outfielder Shane Spencer to Triple-A 
Columbus.

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Exchange Trading Floor Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- From an age of traders in kimono and clogs 120  
years ago to today's slick-suited players moving millions in a 
second, the Tokyo Stock Exchange has borne witness to Japan's rise 
to economic prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Japan's financial world bade farewell to an era as  
the closing bell rang on the trading floor for the last time. 
Computers and cost-cutting put an end to face-to-face trading on 
Asia's largest exchange at a time when Japan's economy is deep in 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the trading session, there was a ceremony replete  
with confetti and party noisemakers, marking the retirement of a 
system that had long stopped being the center of market activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The floor of the Tokyo exchange was once an arena for more than  
2,000 traders fighting for position as they used a complex sign 
language to buy and sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the early 1980s, securities companies have been  
switching to faster and more reliable electronic trading systems. 
By last year, any Japanese stock could be bought and sold 
electronically while fewer than 10 percent could be traded directly 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 100 employees still worked there and floor trading  
accounted for a scant 0.2 percent of Tokyo volume. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen securities-industry veterans demonstrated on Friday what  
is soon to be a lost art -- the trading by hand signals with which 
millions of dollars of shares could be bought with the wave of a 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took a lot of pride in being the fastest with an order,''  
said 68-year-old Miyoji Maruyama, who was a floor trader for eight 
years, starting in 1951. ``Now it's a competition between human 
brains and computers and computers make fewer mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading floor veterans said the shift to computers was  
inevitable, especially with the growing complexity of financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	And securities companies say they will save money by moving  
floor traders to more productive jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But many were sad to see the century-old tradition die.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before computers there was a feeling that the market was a  
living creature,'' said Toshinobu Yoshida, a floor trader for 35 
years. ``Now everyone is separated from the market and people don't 
even seem to notice if it's up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Japan's largest broker, Nomura Securities, had kept fewer  
than 10 traders on the floor of the exchange recently, company 
spokesman Isao Kawanaba said. They will be transferred to other 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Computerization isn't the only reason Tokyo trading has become  
more subdued in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged economic downturn and a decade-long decline in stock  
values has forced Japan's biggest brokers to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
	During Japan's ``bubble'' economy, Tokyo's benchmark stock index  
was more than twice its current value. And at the peak of market 
activity in 1988, there was more than twice as much trading as 
there was last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor trading is still conducted at stock exchanges in New York  
and Frankfurt, Germany, but other major exchanges have already gone 
completely electronic. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, and Paris have  
all closed their trading floors since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has had a formal stock exchange since 1878. In the early  
years traders wore traditional Japanese clothing and exchange 
officials tallied transactions with abacuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed for almost four years from 1945 as the  
country focused its attention on repairing its war-torn economy. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of that time, the sign over the entrance to the Tokyo  
exchange read ``Commander Naval Forces Far East'' and U.S. 
occupational forces used the trading floor as a gym and dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the expansive trading floor, with its 165-foot-high  
ceiling, will be remodeled for use as a stock and corporate 
information center.

<HEADLINE> Evidence From CBS, Newsweek Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- The judge in Kenneth Starr's latest  
prosecution refused to quash subpoenas Friday for the notes and 
testimony of Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff and outtakes from 
CBS's interview with presidential accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton said he will wait until the  
obstruction trial is under way against one-time Willey friend Julie 
Hiatt Steele before deciding whether Isikoff's testimony and the TV 
network outtakes are relevant to the case. The trial is set to 
begin Monday with jury selection 
</P>
<P>
	In a ``60 Minutes'' interview last year, Mrs. Willey, a former  
White House volunteer, described an unwanted sexual advance by 
President Clinton in the White House in 1993. Clinton has denied 
the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Isikoff interviewed Ms. Steele and Mrs. Willey in 1997 for a  
magazine story on the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers hope to use the Newsweek reporter's  
testimony and his notes and the CBS outtakes to attack the 
credibility of Mrs. Willey, who is expected to testify for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele initially told Isikoff that Mrs. Willey had confided  
in her about the alleged advance the day it happened in 1993. But 
she later recanted, telling Isikoff she had first heard about her 
friend's allegation against the president in 1997 when Mrs. Willey 
called and asked her to corroborate the story to the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele repeated the second version of her story to the FBI  
and two grand juries in Starr's probe, resulting in her indictment 
on three counts of obstruction and one count of making a false 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer representing Newsweek, Stuart Gold, argued that the  
subpoena to Isikoff should be set aside because ``he did not 
witness any crimes'' and his notes are not essential to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS lawyer Jay Ward Brown said another subpoena seeks ``all  
outtakes of Mrs. Willey'' from her interview and ``the burden is an 
unreasonable one'' on the network. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge countered that if an important news story were at  
stake, it would take about ``30 seconds'' for CBS to locate the 
outtakes. He said the network must locate the tapes and prepare for 
the possibility they may be presented at trial. The judge said he 
wanted to wait until next week to see whether Isikoff's notes of 
his interviews with Ms. Steele and Mrs. Willey would be relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers unsuccessfully sought a three-day delay in  
the start of the trial, saying that just this week they received a 
summary of an FBI interview from Starr's office of a witness who 
had ``extremely bad things to say about Mrs. Willey's 
credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered Starr prosecutor David Barger to assist in  
getting in touch with the witness, whose lawyer, according to Ms. 
Steele's lawyers, had not returned their phone calls.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Survivors Getting Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two Iowa boys stuffed $13 into an  
envelope and mailed it to Colorado. A junior high school class in 
Corning, Calif., sent $50. New York state's largest teachers union 
donated $5,000. A former Littleton resident in Peru telephoned and 
put $500 on his credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School, donations  
have been pouring in to help survivors and the families of those 
killed. Checks are coming so fast that some organizations are 
having trouble keeping up with the heaps of mail. Contributions 
arrive via the Internet from as far away as Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	One fund already has received more than $650,000 in donations  
and pledges, and a media foundation has promised to match 50 cents 
on the dollar up to the first $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney Co. donated $100,000, and the rock band the Goo Goo  
Dolls contributed $10,000. The band, whose current hit ``Slide'' 
has been on Billboard's Top 100 for weeks, was one of the first 
contribute after learning of the Columbine shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where it'll stop we don't know,'' said Mike Durkin, president  
of the Mile High United Way, which established The Healing Fund. 
``We didn't ask for any of that money. We didn't have to solicit 
folks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the fund, checks of $5,000 have been distributed this week  
to the families of the 13 killed and 23 wounded. The money is for 
immediate needs, such as funerals and hospital expenses, Durkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	No checks have been given to the families of Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold, the student gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The checks are in addition to the $1 million made available by  
the state and the $1.5 million by the federal government to pay for 
burials, medical expenses, lost wages and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of community leaders will meet to decide how to  
spend the rest of The Healing Fund money. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the funds will go toward things related to the Columbine  
incident, whether it's helping the families or helping to prevent 
this in the future through violence prevention programs,'' United 
Way spokeswoman Danielle Corriveau said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen other funds for victims have been set up, and  
six have been established for individuals, such as slain teacher 
Dave Sanders. The fund in his name will provide scholarships for 
Columbine seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Money also is being raised through the sale of memorial T-shirts  
and compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	A Denver company has produced and sold about 40,000 T-shirts --  
printed with a columbine, the state flower, and the date of the 
massacre -- and is donating the $5 profit from each one. 
</P>
<P>
	Discs of the song ``Friend of Mine,'' written by two brothers  
from Columbine in tribute to the victims, are on sale for $11.95. 
The boys performed the song at a memorial service attended by 
70,000, and the phone line to order it has been jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, a group of drag queens donated $880 in tips  
to a Columbine fund from a show at a local bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't even been able to go through everything,'' said  
Mona Sandoval, executive director of the Jefferson Foundation, an 
arm of the Jefferson County School District that has received 
$175,000 in donations and pledges. ``It's just overwhelming for 
this foundation, with a staff of three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sandoval says one envelope from Ames, Iowa, contained two  
five-dollar bills and three singles, along with a note that said 
simply, ``From two boys, 8 and 12 years old in Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An envelope from Lawrenceville, N.J., had a $25 check and a note  
from a secretary who said her donation was in memory of the 
students and of her boss' father, who died of a heart attack around 
the time of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the envelope from Pueblo. The woman's note read:  
</P>
<P>
	``My 14-year-old daughter says it's too bad that it takes  
something like this to bring people together. I would've liked to 
have sent a little something, but I can't afford it.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Author of Chernobyl Virus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The author of the Chernobyl computer virus  
told investigators that he created the bug hoping to humiliate and 
take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software 
providers, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted he didn't expect it to cause worldwide damage, a  
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen Ing-hau, 24, looked nervous and was speechless when he was  
mobbed by reporters after being summoned for police questioning on 
his involvement in a case that caused at least 600,000 computer 
meltdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chernobyl virus -- known in Taiwan as the CIH, for Chen's  
initials -- had even pressed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to 
study antivirus programs to prevent it from invading its computers, 
the police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of  
computer engineering at the Institute of Technology. Chen has since 
graduated and has been undergoing Taiwan's mandatory two-year 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen had spent long hours playing computer games since entering  
college and was a frequent victim of computer viruses when 
downloading video games and other software from the Internet, the 
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he created the highly vicious virus that could avoid  
detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool 
of the software providers, from whom he had bought antivirus 
programs that proved useless,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact. He  
regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26,  
the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to 
erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system 
settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Taiwanese law, someone convicted of spreading computer  
viruses can face up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say whether Chen will be charged. Computer  
experts said Chen might not be charged because he did not intend to 
spread the virus. But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking 
millions of dollars of damage compensation.

<HEADLINE> Indians Gear for `Dirty Election' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Breaking ideological barriers, India's  
major political parties are groping for new friends among old 
enemies in what the prime minister predicts will be a ``dirty 
election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on their recent performance at the polls, the Hindu  
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee and the Congress party of his main political rival, Sonia 
Gandhi, are unlikely to win a parliamentary majority on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	With another coalition government appearing inevitable, the two  
parties are already racing to align with the dozens of regional or 
special-interest parties that have emerged in recent years, each 
with tiny pockets of influence that could prove critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``This election is not going to be easy,'' Vajpayee was quoted  
as saying in Saturday's edition of the weekly newspaper, India 
Today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a dirty election,'' he said. ``We are in the  
midst of a do-or-die election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Vajpayee lost his majority by a single vote.  
Already new alignments are emerging. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two partners in Vajpayee's coalition -- the Samata Party  
of Defense Minister George Fernandes and the regional Trinamul 
Congress -- this week sought an electoral alliance with a socialist 
group they had previously assailed in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	From the opposition benches, Ramvilas Paswan, a powerful leader  
of the underclass and longtime Vajpayee critic, indicated he would 
support Vajpayee's party. A southern Indian party known by its 
Tamil acronym, DMK, has already switched sides and is Vajpayee's 
newest ally. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, no single party has won enough votes to come to  
power alone. All but one of the seven coalition governments since 
then have fallen within about a year after taking office when 
alliances snapped under coalition strains. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee sewed together 19 disparate parties into a coalition a  
year ago. By earlier this month, it had reduced to 16. His party 
lieutenants are now trying to bind them together with a common 
election manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
	The centrist Congress party also is seeking support from  
regional groups in India's 31 states and federally run territories. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress announced Friday that Mrs. Gandhi would run for a seat  
in Amethi, a farming constituency in the northern state of Uttar 
Pradesh once represented by her slain husband, former prime 
minister Rajiv Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the first election contested by Mrs. Gandhi, who is  
being projected as a candidate for prime minister. To qualify for 
the post, she must acquire a seat no later than six months after 
taking office. 
</P>
<P>
	An even larger issue is her ancestry. Italian-born, Mrs. Gandhi  
adopted Indian citizenship only 16 years after her marriage. Some 
Indians say only natural-born citizens should qualify for prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem for Congress is that some alignments that might  
be acceptable at the national level are rejected at the state 
level, where the parties may be competing for the same class of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times of India highlighted the mind-boggling political  
arithmetic in a front-page cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your calculation of tie-ups and alignments is too risky,''  
said one character, filling a chalkboard with complicated 
equations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find at the end we will be cooperating with our sworn  
opponents.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Penalizes Cal State Fullerton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) -- The NCAA placed Cal State Fullerton on  
four years of probation today for violations involving the men's 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Division I infraction's committee also restricted the  
university from awarding grants-in-aid to junior college transfer 
student-athletes for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The violations mostly involved recruiting of prospective  
student-athletes and providing prospects with improper inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee also found a lack of institutional control and  
that the university failed to adequately monitor its athletics 
programs,'' the NCAA said in a statement from Overland Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said that during summer and fall 1993 and summer  
1994, several prospective men's basketball players enrolled in 
junior colleges received assistance with registering and paying the 
costs of correspondence courses at other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospects also received assistance in course registration at  
junior colleges and payment of tuition costs, and received improper 
cash payments, lodging, transportation and other benefits, the NCAA 
said.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting conflicting views 
about the outlook for U.S. farm products.

<HEADLINE> GOP Campaign Aides Working for Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior advisers to Dan Quayle's 2000  
presidential campaign voluntarily went without paychecks recently, 
padding his fund-raising totals for the public reporting period 
that ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very common in campaigns. There is an understanding  
that you have to do whatever is needed to put the FEC report in the 
best possible light,'' campaign spokesman Jonathan Baron said. 
``Nobody's here for the money and that's the way it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Top officials of former American Red Cross President Elizabeth  
Dole's campaign also were not paid in March, nor was anyone who was 
working for publisher Steve Forbes' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle reported raising $2.1 million in the first quarter of  
1999, second only to early front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush 
in a field of at least 10 potential candidates. Much of that money 
was raised through direct mail, which is expensive; he spent $1 
million on fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president had 35,251 contributors, more than the  
23,339 people who gave to Bush. Overall, Quayle spent $1.6 million 
on the campaign. He would have spent even more without the help 
from a number of senior staff who did not get paychecks at the end 
of the reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the Quayle campaign ran into the red. He had reported  
debts of $675,788, compared with a campaign bank account balance of 
$500,443. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander was the only other  
candidate to run a deficit during the first three months of 1999. 
He reported owing $212,405 and having just $86,916 in the bank. 
Spokesman Steve Schmidt said everyone was paid regularly. ``Nobody 
had to defer payroll to artificially inflate the FEC reports,'' 
Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Dole campaign officials were not paid during March, FEC  
reports show. Campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer did not return a 
phone call Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' paychecks are being issued two weeks behind the pay  
period, meaning that the first checks went out in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a standard accounting procedure,'' spokeswoman Juleanna  
Glover Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, advisers for GOP nominee Bob Dole missed paychecks to  
help the campaign get through lean times. Baron said Quayle is 
having no trouble meeting his payroll, though he knows fund-raising 
will be a major challenge in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be nip and tuck all the way through because  
there's a big field and we're a resurgent campaign,'' Baron said.

<HEADLINE> Controversy in Mo. Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Thirty people have been executed  
during Democrat Mel Carnahan's governorship, more than four times 
the number put to death during the two terms Republican John 
Ashcroft occupied the office. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Carnahan who created the office of crime victims' rights,  
toughened sentences for dangerous juveniles and sexual predators, 
and authorized the construction of five new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carnahan also commuted the death sentence of a murderer, an  
``act of mercy'' personally requested by the pope that has put the 
governor on the defensive in his race to unseat Ashcroft from his 
Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ashcroft is going to try to make all the political hay he  
can,'' said Saint Louis University political scientist Ken Warren. 
``He wants to try to make Carnahan look as soft as possible on 
crime, even though Carnahan's record shows he is not soft on 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate race already has had its share of spats observers  
like Warren have described as utterly bogus. In March, each camp 
suggested the other's Web site established links to sordid 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	That struck many as absurd, considering the spotless reputations  
of the candidates. Ashcroft is a gospel-singing son of an 
Assemblies of God minister, and Carnahan is a Southern Baptist 
deacon. 
</P>
<P>
	The commutation question, however, promises to have a much  
longer political shelf life. The controversy hasn't abated since 
Pope John Paul II looked into the governor's eyes three months ago 
and urged him to prevent Darrell Mease's execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft is holding a hearing in St. Louis on Saturday to  
discuss a crime victims' rights proposal. The headline on his news 
release: ``Family Members Will Tell of Impact of Mease 
Commutation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star witnesses at the hearing will be Buck and Anita  
Lawrence, parents of Willie Lawrence, the 19-year-old paraplegic 
killed by Mease's shotgun blast in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had no defense,'' Anita Lawrence said of her son after the  
Jan. 28 commutation. ``It was like killing a little old ant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawrences were furious to learn of the commutation through  
news reports, and Carnahan told a crime victims' rally on Thursday 
that he regretted the ``human error'' in failing to notify them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But one single act should not diminish the substantial record  
on crime victims' rights that we have worked so hard to shape 
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he was simply moved by the pope's ``extraordinary  
and specific request,'' made in the presence of Vice President Al 
Gore under the soaring dome of the St. Louis Cathedral Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, in fact, an act of mercy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan dismissed Ashcroft's hearing as ``transparently  
political,'' which the senator denied. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Thursday, Ashcroft said the Lawrences  
``can contribute an awareness of what a crime victim's circumstance 
is in a setting that relates to a commutation or a pardon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri resumed death penalties in January 1989 while Ashcroft  
was governor, and he never commuted such a sentence. Besides Mease, 
Carnahan has commuted one other, for an inmate who was declared 
mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft wants to amend a proposal sponsored by Sens. Jon Kyl,  
R-Ariz., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to require advance notice 
of commutation decisions for victims and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator and the Lawrences' attorney, Mark Richardson, said  
the parents asked for an opportunity to talk about the commutation. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not political people,'' Richardson said. ``They are  
genuinely, willingly coming forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bev Livingston, leader of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers in  
Missouri and a longtime victims' advocate, said she welcomed any 
attention to victims' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just would hate to see them be victimized twice by being  
exploited for political purposes,'' Ms. Livingston said of the 
Lawrences. ``That would be a crime in itself.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Doubts It Can Repay Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's foreign debts are simply too large for  
the country to repay over the next decade, the finance minister 
said Friday in a stark assessment of the country's long-term 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Zadornov's comments were in line with what private  
economists have been saying, and the Russian government has warned 
for some time that it will have to restructure the country's $150 
billion in foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Zadornov was unusually frank in acknowledging that Russia  
won't be able to meet its debt obligations for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if the economic situation changes drastically, we will  
not be able to make foreign debt payments over the next 10 years 
according to the original schedule,'' Zadornov said, according the 
Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Russia had been paying back several billion  
dollars a year on its foreign debts. But the debt service jumped to 
$17.5 billion this year and will remain in that neighborhood for 
years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia would have had trouble coming up with that kind of money  
under any circumstances, but an economic crisis that hit last 
August has been bleeding the country's hard currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserves now stand at less than $11 billion, a paltry sum  
for a country of Russia's size and population. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia reached a tentative agreement with the International  
Monetary Fund on Wednesday for new loans worth $4.5 billion, but 
that will be used to pay back part of the money Russia already owes 
to the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has already defaulted on a number of foreign debts in  
recent months, and more missed payments are likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov said Russia has reached a preliminary agreement with  
the Paris and London clubs -- which represent some of Russia's 
largest international creditors -- to defer payments for 1999 and 
2000, the Interfax news agency reported. But he said the creditors 
need to look beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Russia can receive the IMF loan, it will need to  
implement a number of reforms, and it's not yet clear whether the 
hard-line parliament will approve them. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Ryzhkov, who heads the pro-government Our Home is  
Russia faction, said lawmakers were unlikely to approve more than a 
few of the bills demanded by the IMF. He said the legislators don't 
want to back unpopular financial measures, particularly with 
parliamentary elections set for December. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF is calling for steps that include an overhaul of the  
nation's banking system and a reduction of the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF announced a $22.6 billion rescue program for Russia just  
before the August crash, but it cut off lending afterward. Russia 
and the IMF have been negotiating for months on the new loan.

<HEADLINE> Teen Drunken Driving Levels Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fighting teen-age drinking and driving appears  
to have stalled after a decade of dramatic progress, a new study 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The prevalence of teen drunken driving fell about 40 percent  
between 1984 and 1997, says the study by Patrick O'Malley of the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	But a closer examination of the 1990s showed the progress may  
have peaked in 1992, O'Malley reported Thursday in the American 
Journal of Public Health. Since then, teen drunken driving rates 
have largely held steady -- although O'Malley did find a slight, not 
statistically significant, increase between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	What halted the progress?  
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley theorizes that teen-agers heard a lot more about the  
dangers of drunken driving in the 1980s and early 1990s than they 
do today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of activity and attention paid to the problem  
between 1984 and 1992,'' O'Malley said, recalling the 1980s passage 
of 21 as the drinking age, major Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
campaigns and much publicity about designated drivers. ``Some of 
that attention has dissipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government recorded a 59 percent reduction in  
alcohol-related traffic fatalities among 15- to 20-year-olds 
between 1982 and 1997, said alcohol expert Ralph Hingson of Boston 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new findings ``should be of concern,'' because they  
suggest newer teen drivers aren't getting the message, Hingson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said part of the problem is lack of enforcement of ``zero  
tolerance'' laws that are supposed to require that drivers' 
licenses are immediately revoked if teens drive after consuming any 
alcohol. Many teens aren't even aware of those laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, at least a third of stores sell alcohol without  
checking the customer's age, added Alexander Wagenaar of the 
University of Minnesota, who studies compliance with alcohol laws. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley used data from one of the longest-running surveys of  
teen health issues, run by his university. His findings: 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1984, 31.2 percent of high school seniors reported driving  
after drinking sometime during the previous two weeks. In 1995, 15 
percent did; in 1997, it was 18.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1984, 44.2 percent of high school seniors reported being a  
passenger in a vehicle driven by someone who had been drinking 
sometime during the previous two weeks. In 1995, that had dropped 
to 23.1 percent; in 1997, it was 26.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--When asked about having consumed five or more drinks, 18.3  
percent admitted driving after heavy drinking and 25.4 percent 
admitted being a passenger of a heavy drinker in 1984. In 1997, 
those numbers were 11.5 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	--As for peer pressure, 30 percent of seniors in 1984 said their  
friends would strongly disapprove if they drank and drove. That hit 
50 percent in 1992 and has stayed flat, at about 48 percent in 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules in Child Deaths Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A judge has ruled that four children cannot  
stay in their old home where four other youngsters were believed to 
have been slain. 
</P>
<P>
	Juvenile Judge Michael Murphy on Thursday placed the children --  
a 12-year-old boy and three girls, ages 11 to 8, who have been in 
separate foster homes -- in the custody of a grandmother, Cecile 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner ruled the four deaths were homicides by  
asphyxiation, but no charges have been filed. Police suspect one of 
the girls might have suffocated the victims, ages 1 to 3, but they 
have no proof. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue before the judge was whether the girl and the three  
other children would be allowed to live together again at the home 
of Regina Moreland. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said there was no evidence that the children were at  
risk from Ms. Moreland, 40, so it was not immediately clear why he 
did not allow the children to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moreland, who was the grandmother of three of the children  
who died and a great-aunt of the other, maintains that the deaths 
in 1997 and 1998 stemmed from natural causes and that her home is 
safe. She fought for the return of her three children and a 
grandchild. Ms. Marshall is her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are ``extremely disappointed'' with the judge's  
decision, added Jim Knight, spokesman for the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going back into the same situation they were in,''  
added Ann Stevens, a spokeswoman for the Montgomery County Children 
Services Board. ``There's no way that children services can assure 
the protection of these children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a custody hearing in March, a mental health worker said  
the girl police suspect in the deaths told her she sometimes held 
her hand over the mouths of the children to get them to stop 
crying, something her siblings also did. 
</P>
<P>
	But the girl denied causing their deaths, saying she believed  
other family members were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's therapist said he believes she is innocent.

<HEADLINE> Wohlers To Rehab in AAA Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds' effort to rehabilitate  
closer Mark Wohlers moves to the next stage on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander is to make his first official appearance in the  
Reds organization when he travels to Toledo to pitch an inning or 
two for the Triple-A Indianapolis affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, acquired from the Atlanta Braves on April 16 for  
reliever John Hudek, showed some encouraging signs during a spotty 
38-pitch workout under simulated game conditions Thursday in 
Philadelphia, where the Reds played the Phillies. Facing an 
alternating Reds duo of Dmitri Young and Mark Sweeney, Wohlers 
walked four, struck out four and allowed a ground ball single to 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers showed some of the control problems that sent his career  
downhill and led to his release from the Braves. But manager Jack 
McKeon and pitching coach Don Gullett saw enough positive signs to 
send him to Indianapolis for what could be a one- or two-game 
rehabilitation stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been outstanding on the side, and he's made a lot of  
progress,'' McKeon said. ``Now it's time to get him some action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers' missed pitches were either high or in the dirt. He was  
pleased that he wasn't wild inside or outside to the hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accomplished what I wanted to do,'' he said. ``Now I'm ready  
to pitch in a ballgame.''

	Japan's Jobless Rate Hits Record  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Corporate restructuring efforts helped send Japan's  
jobless rate to yet another record high of 4.8 percent last month. 
The latest government unemployment rate figure reported today 
topped the previous all-time high of 4.6 percent set in February. 
Jobs remain scarce and the situation is unlikely to improve soon, 
government officials say. The jobless data are likely to heighten 
pessimism about the nation's economy, which could further hurt 
chances for a turnaround as worried consumers curtail spending. 
Lackluster consumer spending is a major reason the Japanese economy 
has not been able to rescue itself.

	Economy Grows at 4.5 Percent Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remarkable U.S. economy grew at a strong  
4.5 percent annual rate in the first three months of this year, far 
above expectations, as consumers spent at the fastest pace in more 
than a decade. The Commerce Department reported that the solid 
growth in the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and 
services, came despite the fact that the nation's trade deficit, 
battered by overseas economic turmoil, soared to a record level 
from January through March, subtracting 2.4 percentage points from 
overall growth. Without this drag from trade, which amounted to a 
loss of $55.6 billion in output, the GDP would grow at an even more 
remarkable 6.9 percent in the first quarter.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia has no chance of making its foreign debt  
payments over the next decade, even if it receives more loans, the 
finance minister said today. And a leading lawmaker said parliament 
will probably approve only one-third of the measures the 
International Monetary Fund wants passed in return for new loans. 
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told reporters that Russia has 
reached a preliminary agreement with the Paris and London clubs -- 
which represent international creditors -- to defer payments for 
1999 and 2000, the Interfax news agency reported. But he said the 
creditors need to look beyond that.

	BEIJING (AP) -- China's securities regulator urged listed firms  
today to take the Year 2000 computer problem seriously and purge 
their computer systems of any glitches, the official Xinhua News 
Agency reported. In an open letter, the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission told the 878 listed firms to spend enough money and 
acquire enough expertise to modify and replace key computer systems 
so that they will not fail at year's end, Xinhua said. Experts fear 
that computers that use only the last two digits to mark the year 
will mistake 2000 for 1900 and malfunction.

	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- HomeGrocer.com, an Internet grocery  
shopping and home delivery business, has landed the first 
investment by a group headed by former Netscape Communications 
Corp. president James Barksdale. The Barksdale Group, formed 
specifically to aid new Internet businesses with high growth 
potential, is putting $5 million into the year-old company, a 
spokesman said yesterday. Barksdale formed his venture capital firm 
after receiving $700 million last month when Netscape was purchased

	GM Plans Ads During 2002 Olympics  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is moving ahead with plans  
to use the Olympics as a marketing platform to boost its slumping 
U.S. market share. This is despite revelations that Salt Lake City 
officials, who will host the 2002 winter games, bribed members of 
the International Olympic Committee. The controversy has driven 
some sponsors, including Johnson &AMP; Johnson, away. GM signed a $1 
billion pact in July 1997 to become the official car and truck of 
the U.S. Olympic Committee and 41 governing sports groups through 
the 2008 games. GM's stock was up 1 3/8 today at 91 3/8.

a former Albuquerque stockbroker, and a friend registered 
wallstreet.com for $70 in 1994. They had planned to develop a

<HEADLINE> Bucks' Robinson Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Glenn Robinson, the Milwaukee Bucks' leading  
scorer, strained a ligament in his right knee in the first quarter 
against Detroit tonight. Although he returned later in the quarter, 
he was scratched for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was standing near the Detroit basket when Pistons star  
Grant Hill hit the floor and rolled onto Robinson's right leg with 
6:20 left in the quarter. He writhed in pain for about 30 seconds 
and was helped off the court and into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who averages 18.7 points, returned with 5.6 seconds  
left in the period, his right knee in a sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't come out after halftime, nor did teammate Dell Curry,  
who was limited to four minutes in the first half because of back 
spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams began the night tied for the sixth spot in the Eastern  
Conference playoff race.

<HEADLINE> World Court: UN Official Is Immune </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The World Court has ruled that a  
senior U.N. representative is immune from multimillion-dollar libel 
lawsuits filed by several Malaysian companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The court granted U.N. Special Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy  
immunity Thursday for allegedly defamatory comments because the 
remarks made in 1995 were related to his U.N. duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's president, U.S. judge Stephen Schwebel, ruled that  
legal immunity should be enjoyed by independent officials working 
as U.N. rapporteurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cumaraswamy, a former chairman of the Malaysian Bar Council, is  
alleged to have libeled several Malaysian businesses in an 
interview with International Commercial Litigation magazine in 
which he said he was investigating alleged manipulation of the 
Malaysian judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Court, the highest U.N. judicial organ, said the  
Malaysian government should not have allowed libel lawsuits 
totaling $112 million to be filed against Cumaraswamy. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday that he  
accepted the World Court's ruling, the national news agency Bernama 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the United Nations and Malaysia pledged to abide by the  
ruling of the court, formally known as the International Court of 
Justice. Schwebel ordered Malaysia to inform national courts of the 
ruling.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Pushing Youth Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At a fund-raiser for the state Democratic party,  
Sen. Chuck Schumer spoke of his pleasant anticipation of working 
with the first female senator from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is who he meant: the dinner's honoree, Rep. Nita  
Lowey, or another guest -- Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Still tight-lipped about her political plans, Mrs. Clinton spent  
Thursday in New York and plans to return in eight days for her 
third visit in as many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was principal for a day at a junior high school,  
then addressed the $250,000 fund-raiser for the state Democratic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowey, the guest of honor, plans to run for the Senate seat  
being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000 if Mrs. Clinton 
doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to working, starting in January 2001, with the  
first woman senator of New York State,'' Schumer told his fellow 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton didn't indicate whether she intends to be that  
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's talked to a lot of people, heard different opinions,  
gotten advice,'' spokeswoman Marsha Berry said. ``She's still 
weighing opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Mrs. Clinton's comments throughout the day focused on  
issues related to the high school massacre in Littleton, Colo. At 
both the school and the dinner, she called for a national campaign 
against youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady said additional limits should be placed on access  
to weapons for young people, and urged parents and consumers to 
limit their children's exposure to violent movies and video games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do something about the culture of violence,'' she  
said. ``How do we send a signal to people who produce such media 
and to people who consume it? How do we create the same mind-set 
that turned drunk driving into a socially unacceptable act?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spent two days in New York City and Long Island  
last week, and is to return to the state May 7 for an AFL-CIO 
meeting in Buffalo on working women.

<HEADLINE> Rain Washes Out Calif. 500 Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Umbrellas and ponchos instead of suntan  
lotion and shorts were the order of the day Friday as steady 
showers washed out practice and qualifying for the NASCAR 
California 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Dark skies prevailed over the California Speedway, keeping  
drivers and cars in the garages, and fans huddled under the 
grandstand. It was the first time in the speedway's three-year 
history that rain interrupted the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've probably helped my golf game watching the Golf Channel,''  
Dale Jarrett joked. ``All we can do is hang out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rain had stopped by late afternoon, allowing an abbreviated  
practice for Saturday's Auto Club 300 Busch Series race. Practice 
for the Winston West 200 was pushed back to Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You travel all the way across the country and you get one hour  
of practice before the race, so that makes it difficult,'' said 
Jarrett, who was forced out before the halfway point of last year's 
California 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where good notes come into play. We have to go back to  
the first year when we ran the whole race,'' he said. ``We'll look 
at that so we can be best prepared whenever do get that practice 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LABONTE KEEPS ON GOING:* Call him Mr. Consistency. Terry  
Labonte is scheduled to start his 612th consecutive NASCAR race 
Sunday. He hasn't missed one since joining the circuit full-time in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke Richard Petty's record of 514 straight starts in April  
1996 at Martinsville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is one of just three drivers to complete all 500 laps of  
the first two California 500s, along with Jeff Gordon and Ricky 
Rudd. Labonte finished second in the inaugural race in 1997 and 
third last year.

of drivers on the California Speedway's Motor Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, winner of last year's California 500, put his footprints  
in cement Friday, alongside those of '97 winner Jeff Gordon. Both 
drivers also have bronze plaques marking their victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speedway is fantastic,'' Martin said. ``It was way neat to  
win the California 500 last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *VIDEO RACING:* Jeff Gordon's fondness for video games paid off  
against his fellow drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, Bobby Labonte, Mike Skinner, Ward Burton and Jeff Burton  
tested their video driving skills on a Daytona USA game Thursday at 
an Ontario restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, at 27 the youngest of the group, finished first in the  
20-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to admit I've got one of these at home, so I've got a  
little bit of an advantage,'' he said. ``Man, that was an awesome 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The video game race matched each of the drivers with five fans  
randomly selected in a nationwide drawing for the Winston No Bull 5 
sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gordon, Labonte, Skinner, Ward Burton or Jeff Burton wins  
Sunday's race, they'll earn $1 million for themselves and the same 
amount for the fan matched with them. 
</P>

	 *RACY CLOTHING:* Fashion-conscious women who are race fans don't  
have to settle for buying the usual souvenir T-shirts and baseball 
caps this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristi Markel and Wendy Misner have developed a line of  
sportswear for the estimated 40 percent of NASCAR fans who are 
women. The items, ranging from $18 hats to a $55 crop polar fleece 
jacket, were to go on sale Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As race enthusiasts for almost 20 years, we've seen that most  
fanwear is meant for the male consumer,'' said Markel, co-founder 
of Enginewear. ``This leaves a vastly untapped female market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The line, dubbed ``racy clothing for women,'' also includes a  
lycra body suit and a round neck baby doll T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

NASCAR drivers Elliott Sadler and Michael Waltrip celebrated

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 65.87 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks headed higher today, pushing the Dow  
Jones industrial average closer to 11,000, after a government 
report said the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
65.87 to 10,944.25, less than 56 points from 11,000. The Dow has 
set a record high close in each of the last three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Nasdaq composite index  
was up 36.57 to 2,565.01 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 
7.82 to 1,350.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy grew at a strong 4.5 percent annual rate in the  
first three months of this year, far above expectations, as 
consumers spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the solid growth in the  
gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, 
came despite the fact that the nation's trade deficit, battered by 
overseas economic turmoil, soared to a record level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an economy that is performing exceptionally well,''  
said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. 
``We're seeing vigorous demand in the U.S. and have a comfortable 
inflation situation which is a favorable setting for the stock 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Dow higher was Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing,  
up 4 7/8 to 90 1/2, after 3M reported higher than expected first-quarter 
profits. Dow component United Technologies, which announced a 
two-for-one stock split today, was up 3 9/16 to 147 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also rallied after three days of losses.  
</P>
<P>
	America Online advanced 3 1/8 to 144 1/2. Hewlett-Packard rose 1 1/8 to  
79 1/2 after a Merrill Lynch analyst said the personal computer maker 
will likely top second-quarter earnings estimates of 79 cents per 
share. IBM rose 4 13/16 to 209 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 402.7 million shares, 
slightly below Thursday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.66 to 640.75 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.38 to 781.38.

<HEADLINE> Jagr's Status Uncertain for Game 5 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr's questionable playing  
status is having one positive side effect for the Pittsburgh 
Penguins: It's kept the New Jersey Devils guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	After practicing for an hour Thursday, the Devils spent most of  
the next hour talking about Jagr, his three-game absence because of 
a groin injury and the need to hit the NHL's leading scorer should 
he play in Game 5 of the best-of-7 first-round series that is tied 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, however, Jagr's expected return tonight at the  
Continental Airlines Arena suddenly was a little more iffy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr didn't look good skating during the Penguins' practice in  
Pittsburgh on Thursday, sparking speculation the groin injury that 
sidelined him after Game 1 was still bothersome. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old winger left practice after about 15 minutes and  
went to the locker room, where he rode a stationary bike. The media 
waited an hour to talk with him, but he walked by without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 24 hours earlier, Jagr said his condition had improved and  
he expected to play, even though he would not be at 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hearing a lot about Jagr, but we have to focus on what  
we do,'' Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ``There is a reason we 
came in first place. Without putting any extra pressure on 
ourselves, we have to play the way the New Jersey Devils can play. 
Hopefully, the Penguins are a little worried about us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr's return seemed more certain after the Devils evened the  
series with a 4-2 win at Pittsburgh on Tuesday night. It was New 
Jersey's best game of the series, and the return of Jagr was seen 
as a boost the Penguins' needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision probably wouldn't be made until just before the  
game. Jagir did not take part in the morning skate-around, staying 
behind in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is he won't play,'' said Penguins coach Kevin  
Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jagr does play, the Devils plan to hit him every chance they  
get, within reason. That's playoff hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Devils captain Scott Stevens expects Jagr to play.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to finish our checks, but the bottom line is we want  
to play our game like the other night,'' Stevens said. ``If Jagr's 
back, that's fine. Yes, he's the player we have to watch, but we 
have to play the same way we did the last game. We have to play a 
convincing game, in people's faces, and make it uncomfortable for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine needs a better effort from his team, with or without  
Jagr, who had 127 points in winning his second straight scoring 
title and third in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extra day off gives us some rest, but I don't think we  
want to get the taste out of our mouths from the last game,'' 
Constantine said. ``We didn't play great, and hopefully that's a 
motivator for us to play better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have a 2-1 record without Jagr in the series. The  
key in the two wins has been their defense. The Devils have 
struggled to get odd-man rushes and Tom Barrasso has played well, 
allowing nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
	That's made for a closer series than anyone expected. The Devils  
were the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the third straight 
year, while Pittsburgh slipped to the eighth seed after struggling 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not going to give us anything,'' Devils goaltender  
Martin Brodeur said. ``Sometimes when you come in as the first seed 
and you play the eighth seed, you feel you are going to get the 
chance to win. But these guys won't beat themselves. We are going 
to have to beat them and that's what's surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series will return to Pittsburgh on Sunday for Game 6. If a  
deciding game is necessary, it will be played here on Tuesday 
night.

<HEADLINE> Goring Is Islanders' New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Butch Goring, who played for the New York  
Islanders during their dynasty of the early 1980s, was hired as 
coach of the struggling team today. 
</P>
<P>
	Goring replaced Bill Stewart, who was promoted from his  
assistant's job on Jan. 21, taking over for Mike Milbury, who had 
been both general manager and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, this is almost a dream come true,'' said Goring, whose  
coaching career began in 1981 as a playing assistant under Al 
Arbour. ``Since Al Arbour made me an assistant, there hasn't been a 
day when I haven't wanted to step into Al Arbour's shoes and be as 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders ended this season with a 24-48-10 record, worst in  
the Atlantic Division and third worst in the 27-team NHL. It was 
the fifth consecutive season they failed to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were a lot different when Goring played for the team,  
beginning late in the 1979-80 season through the first half of the 
1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
	During that span, the Islanders won four straight Stanley Cup  
titles, from 1980-83, and Goring was the most valuable player 
during the 1981 playoffs, collecting 10 goals and 10 assists in 18 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Goring, 49, was coach and general manager for the International  
Hockey League's Utah Grizzlies last season. He coached for just 
over a year with the NHL's Boston Bruins during the 1985-86 season 
and coached in the American Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	He began coaching the Denver Grizzlies in 1994 and stayed with  
the team when it moved to Utah. He has a 423-311-89 career coaching 
record, including a 235-141-33 record with Denver and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Goring rejected an offer to coach the Anaheim  
Mighty Ducks of the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he played 16 seasons in the NHL. He scored more than 30  
goals four different times, finishing his career with 375 goals and 
513 assists in 1,107 games.

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 4.5 Percent Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy keeps surging, defying  
expectations with a brisk 4.5 percent growth rate for the first 
three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists marveled at the ``wondrous'' performance and  
President Clinton said: ``America's economic expansion continues to 
grow steady and strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter growth in the gross domestic product, a measure of  
the nation's total output of goods and services, was faster than 
the economy's 3.9 percent growth for 1998, the Commerce Department 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It exceeded most analysts' predictions by a full percentage  
point and continued the country's longest period of economic 
expansion in peacetime history. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wondrous economy and it keeps rolling along,'' said  
Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some worry that an unremitting pace may ultimately  
spell danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is getting to be more of a surge that may, when it stops,  
go out with a bang more than a whimper,'' said Martin Regalia, 
chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	More analysts now predict that the Federal Reserve could move to  
raise interest rates later this year to try to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seemed to share the mixed feelings. After briefly  
pushing the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks to within 40 
points of the 11,000-point mark -- barely a month after passing the 
once-unimaginable 10,000 -- they retreated. In the end, the Dow fell 
89 points to close at 10,789 on Friday, below Thursday's 10,878 
record closing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the inflation that usually triggers Fed interest rate  
hikes remains a no-show so far. A price measure tied to the GDP 
rose at an annual rate of just 1 percent from January through 
March, little changed from a 0.9 percent increase in the fourth 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The solid growth in the GDP during the first three months of  
this year came despite the fact that the U.S. trade deficit 
ballooned to a record level, battered by nearly two years of global 
economic turmoil that has pushed one-third of the world into 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration announced Friday that it will file  
seven new trade complaints against Europe and other countries as 
part of its attempt to help narrow the trade gap. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton, who is hoping good times will help Democrats  
keep control of the White House in next year's election, chose to 
emphasize the positive in commenting on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strong growth, high investment, low inflation and low  
unemployment are a winning combination and more evidence that we 
should stick with an economic strategy that has helped usher in a 
new era of prosperity for the American people,'' he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans more than compensated for the loss of overseas markets  
by increasing spending at a 6.7 percent annual rate during the 
first three months of this year. That's the largest increase since 
a 7.2 percent rise in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports snapped up by consumers at bargain prices because of  
flagging overseas demand have played a major role in keeping U.S. 
inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's total  
economic activity, and the recent spree has been bolstered by the 
lowest unemployment in nearly three decades, a soaring stock market 
and record highs for consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are feeling so secure that they are dipping heavily  
into savings to finance their buying binge. The GDP report showed 
that the personal savings rate --savings as a percentage of 
disposable income -- dropped to a negative number of minus 0.5 
percent in the first quarter, an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen such a remarkable sustained boom in consumer  
spending,'' said Norman Robertson, an economist for nearly four 
decades who is now retired but still advising Smithfield Trust Co. 
in Pittsburgh. ``But it wasn't just consumer spending, housing was 
strong, investment was strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business investment, which has also been a driving force  
throughout the current economic expansion, rose by 10 percent in 
the first quarter as heavy purchases of computers continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, housing construction, propelled by low mortgage rates  
that have encouraged buyers, jumped 15.6 percent, the fastest 
advance in a year.

<HEADLINE> Study: Small Classes Improve Grades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Clinton administration pushes to hire  
more teachers, a study touts the educational benefits of smaller 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers on a decade-long Tennessee project say students in  
classes of 13 to 17 students perform better than their peers right 
through high school graduation, have higher grades, better 
graduation rates and are more likely to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
	``In high school, these are the students taking honors English,  
advanced mathematics and foreign languages,'' said Jayne 
Boyd-Zaharias, a lead researcher on Project STAR, which studied 
11,000-plus students since the 1985-86 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was released Thursday as Democrats called for $1.4  
billion to boost the president's plan to reduce class size by 
striving for a nationwide teacher-student ratio of 18-to-1. The 
six-year plan to hire 100,000 new teachers would cost more than $11 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are urging Congress to finish the job,'' said Education  
Secretary Richard W. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	The results come as lawmakers are debating how smaller classes  
fit into the overall improvement of schools. Last year, a $1.2 
billion ``down payment'' for 30,000 teachers received money in a 
spending bill approved by Congress. But Republican misgivings about 
the Clinton proposal could hurt its chances this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is little point to reducing class size if we don't have  
quality teachers,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the 
House Education and Workforce Committee, which on Thursday heard 
from experts who differed on whether small-classes are the only 
factor in giving children a good education. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reduce class sizes can hurt teacher quality, say  
other lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's push to add teachers to create smaller classes,  
schools sought waivers on what requirements teachers had to have, 
said Joe Karpinski, spokesman for the Senate Republican education 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``That resulted in more adults in the classroom, but not  
necessarily more qualified teachers in the classroom,'' Karpinski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Senate wants to focus on the long-standing federal  
education programs set to be renewed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has not introduced its plans for the  
programs, which include help for poor, bilingual and migrant 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Manley, a spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
said the class-size proposal could help all groups of children 
learn better. 
</P>
<P>
	The small-class study also found that minority and poor students  
were helped even more by small classes in some areas than other 
groups of children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee public-school students were randomly placed in  
three class-size groups: a regular-size group with 22 to 25 
students, a regular-size group with a classroom aide for the 
teacher and a small group with 13 to 17 pupils. About 20 other 
states have similar class-size reduction plans.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Calista Flockhart backed out of a long-scheduled  
interview with the NBC's ``Today'' show when its producers refused 
a request not to talk about her weight.

<HEADLINE> Laser Co-Inventor, Physicist Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur  
Schawlow, a co-inventor of the laser, has died at 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Schawlow, who died Wednesday after being stricken with leukemia,  
worked with Charles H. Townes to develop in 1960 the means of 
producing a concentrated beam of light. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasers are now a $3.5 billion industry, used in fiber optic  
telecommunications, scientific research, compact disc players and 
vision correction and other types of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair received a patent for their invention but didn't profit  
from it because they were working at Bell Labs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Schawlow joined the physics department at Stanford  
University. In 1981, he won the Nobel in physics for his 
contributions to laser spectroscopy, the study of how atoms and 
molecules react to light. 
</P>
<P>
	Schawlow used most of his Nobel Prize money to start a  
foundation and group home for autistic children. 
</P>
<P>
	Schawlow attended the University of Toronto on a mathematics and  
physics scholarship. A postdoctoral fellowship sent him to Columbia 
University to work with Townes. 
</P>
<P>
	Schawlow married Townes' sister, Aurelia, in 1951. She died in  
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Schawlow liked to demonstrate his laser ``ray gun'' to students  
by beaming it through a transparent balloon to pop a dark Mickey 
Mouse balloon inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a son, two daughters and five grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen in Tokyo today  
despite an indication from a top Japanese economic official that 
the government may consider new stimulus steps. The Tokyo stock 
market's main index lost 1.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.58 yen at late afternoon, up 0.50 yen from  
its level of 119.08 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its 
overnight New York level of 119.03 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 240.71 points,  
or 1.42 percent, closing the week at 16,701.53 points. The Nikkei 
dropped 15.03 points, or 0.09 percent, Wednesday. Tokyo financial 
markets were closed Thursday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar advanced as interbank dealers bought the U.S.  
currency despite remarks by Japan's Economic Planning Agency chief, 
Taichi Sakaiya, who said in Washington late Thursday that Japan 
would mull measures to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya, speaking after meeting with U.S. Deputy Treasury  
Secretary Lawrence Summers, denied that the government was 
considering a supplementary budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sakaiya's comment may suggest there was a progress toward new  
fiscal steps for the economy. But his words are a bit too vague to 
sell off dollars on,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant manager of 
foreign exchange at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors were waiting for the outcome of the summit  
between Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
in Washington on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some signs of improvement, Japan's economy remains weak  
as the country struggles to bail out of its worst recession in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 118.95 yen and 119.68 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 126.86 yen, down  
from 127.22 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Japanese technology shares dropped in line  
with the decline of similar shares overnight in New York. Also 
dampening the Tokyo market was Sony Corp.'s recent announcement of 
falling profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment among investors turned bearish quickly today following  
the release of fresh data on the state of Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony said Wednesday that its net income plunged nearly 20  
percent in the fiscal year ending March 31 because of recession at 
home and abroad. Sony stock closed today's trading at $93.70, down 
$4.60 from Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's jobless rate  
climbed to a record high 4.8 percent in March as corporate 
restructuring efforts forced more people out of work. The previous 
record was 4.6 percent, registered in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the agency said spending by Japanese wage earners  
last month fell 3.6 percent from the year-earlier month in real 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 535  
million shares, down from Wednesday's turnover of 677 million 
shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 646 to 512, with 163 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 10.52 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,337.12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.405 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.465 
percent, pushing its price up to 103.49 yen from 102.94 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan will be closed Monday through  
Wednesday because of national holidays. The markets will reopen on 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Source of Columbine Handgun Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators are interviewing a man who  
may have sold the semiautomatic pistol used by the Columbine High 
School gunmen, but authorities said Thursday no arrests are 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas said  
early in the day that the gun seller would be arrested ``in a day 
or two'' after negotiating the terms of his surrender, other 
investigators later backed away from that statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime laboratory technicians are conducting ballistics tests to  
determine which guns fired the ammunition that killed each of the 
13 victims. If it turns out that bullets fired by the 
paramilitary-style TEC DC-9 did not hit anyone, the gun seller may 
only face charges of illegal gun peddling rather than being 
implicated in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that we'll have some news soon,'' prosecutor Mark  
Pautler said. ``As far as arrests, as far as charges, we're still 
up in the air with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, police arrested a hardware store employee who they  
say made up a story that he saw gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold buy propane tanks, wire, screws, nails and duct tape -- 
material believed used in the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sowell, 50, was charged with making a false report to  
authorities, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pautler said other people are being interviewed as well, but he  
described them as witnesses, not suspects. He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a good idea to let people know ahead of time that we  
are going to arrest them,'' he said. ``They have a tendency to 
disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  
and Firearms visited the Blackjack Pizza shop, where the gunmen 
worked. The agents were investigating whether a pizza deliveryman 
acted as a middleman between the students and the gun seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF and the pizza shop managers declined to discuss the  
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, killed 12 students and  
a teacher before committing suicide in one of the worst school 
shootings in U.S. history. Another 23 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	A diary found at the home of one of the gunmen indicated the  
plot had been devised for a year and they planned to kill hundreds 
with an arsenal of guns and bombs. Investigators have found more 
than 50 propane and pipe bombs at the school and the teens' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The final Columbine victim to be buried, Isaiah Shoels, 18, was  
remembered Thursday at a spirited funeral in Denver that drew more 
than 5,000 mourners, including Gov. Bill Owens and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, investigators said Klebold's prom date, Robyn  
Anderson, 18, bought three of the four weapons -- two rifles and a 
shotgun -- used in the massacre. Under Colorado law, an 18-year old 
without a felony record can legally furnish minors with rifles and 
shotguns, which are classified as long guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Klebold's family said Thursday they had been  
the target of threats, which have been reported to authorities. 
``They are cooperating fully with the investigation,'' said Lisa 
Simon, the Klebolds' spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Tributes to the victims continue.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose Sharks hockey team brought a 50-foot banner  
inscribed with messages from players and fans to Denver, where they 
have a playoff game against the Colorado Avalanche on Friday night. 
The first two games in the series were postponed because of the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Jefferson County school district is holding an  
afternoon get-together at scenic Red Rocks Amphitheater for 
students and their families, teachers and public safety workers. 
Classes resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Poland of the National Association of School Psychologists  
said children affected by the shootings may feel afraid and 
hopeless, and experience night terrors, for an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time for parents to talk less and listen more,''  
he said.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. civil rights leader Jesse  
Jackson today sought freedom for three captive U.S. soldiers, while 
a Yugoslav government official told him that their release was 
``not on the agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Foreign Minister Nebojsa Vujovic spoke ahead of  
Jackson's hoped-for meeting with the American POWs planned for 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their release is not on the agenda, but the delegation will be  
able to see them and assure themselves they are in good health,'' 
Vujovic told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who had hoped for their release during his visit, also  
wants to meet on Saturday with President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The three American prisoners are Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez,  
24, of Los Angeles; Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, 
Texas; and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson spent the night in the capital during the heaviest air  
attack yet on the Yugoslav capital in more than five weeks of 
strikes. Missiles and bombs inflicted heavy damage on Yugoslav Army 
headquarters and other government buildings, as well as striking a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until there's a diplomatic breakthrough, the bombing will  
escalate and will expand,'' Jackson said, calling the bombing 
``intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But throughout his visit, Jackson treaded a thin line on who is  
to blame for the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are scared and there is pain on both sides,'' he said  
after touring the Vracar residential district, where a NATO air 
raid early today damaged at least two houses and injured nine 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea acknowledged later that one ``missile  
bomb'' had gone astray and landed on houses. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jackson watched, an elderly man stumbled through the wreckage  
of his house, poking through kitchen pots and jars of pickled 
vegetables and jams miraculously untouched by the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is incredible. I couldn't expect this from our friends,''  
Zhivko Novakov told reporters. ``They (NATO) will say again `Sorry, 
it was a mistake.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bombing cannot be a solution,'' said Jackson, visibly touched  
by the scene of destruction. ``But the same goes for the forceful 
displacement of ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who arrived in the Yugoslav capital on Thursday to try  
to visit the soldiers, earlier today met with Patriarch Pavle, the 
head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, to appeal for his help in 
securing the release of the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We people of faith have to create a climate for diplomatic  
talks, to build the bridges for diplomacy and trust,'' Jackson said 
in his meeting with the patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must love our enemy -- that is the key for peace.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets End Week Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally  
mixed Friday, with share prices surging in Bangkok and Singapore 
but slumping in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The key index in Bangkok soared 6.2 percent as foreign investors  
snapped up banking stocks following a decision by Moody's Investors 
Service Inc. to upgrade its ratings outlook for five Thai banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, index rose 26.86 points  
to close at 459.35. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking sector index surged after Moody's said it changed  
the outlook for the ratings of four major Thai commercial banks -- 
Bangkok Bank PCL, Krung Thai Bank PCL, Thai Farmers Bank PCL and 
Siam Commercial Bank PCL -- to stable from negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore also surged on bargain-hunting following two sessions  
of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealer said expectations that Singapore banks will cut their  
best lending rates also spurred buying. The Straits Times Index 
rose 67.70 points, or 3.7 percent, to 1,886.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher, boosted by expectations  
of a cut in local interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 153.5 points, or 1.2 percent, closing at 
13,333.20. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed, the Hong Kong Association of Banks  
announced that it was cutting deposit rates by a quarter point, to 
3.5 percent, in the second such cut this month. Leading banks also 
slashed their best lending rates to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 240.71  
points, or 1.42 percent, closing the week at 16,701.53 points. The 
Nikkei dropped 15.03 points, or 0.09 percent, Wednesday. Tokyo 
financial markets were closed Thursday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese technology shares dropped in line with the decline of  
similar shares overnight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment among investors turned bearish quickly on Friday  
following the release of fresh data on the state of Japan's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's jobless rate  
climbed to a record high 4.8 percent in March as corporate 
restructuring efforts forced more people out of work. The previous 
record was 4.6 percent, registered in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the agency said spending by Japanese wage earners  
last month fell 3.6 percent from the year-earlier month in real 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.58 yen at late  
afternoon, up 0.50 yen from its level of 119.08 yen late Wednesday 
in Tokyo and also above its overnight New York level of 119.03 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher in line with expectations of  
a rebound after three losing sessions. The market's key Weighted 
Stock Price Index of the Taiwan Stock rose 81.55 points, or 1.1 
percent, to 7,371.17. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark  
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 14.56 points, or 0.6 percent, to 
2,278.28. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed slightly higher, buoyed by  
bargain-hunting in second-line issues overlooked during recent 
rallies, traders said. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange 
Index edged up 0.21 point to 2,433.70. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed slightly lower,  
weighed down by selling among banking and industrial stocks as 
investors took profits. The All Ordinaries Index fell 3.8 points, 
or 0.1 percent, to 3,101.1. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly lower on continued  
profit-taking. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index slipped 0.02 
point to 752.59. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed higher. The benchmark  
Composite Index rose 0.9 percent, or 6.24 points, to 674.96. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher. The Composite Index  
rose 4.232 points, or 0.9 percent, to 495.222.

<HEADLINE> IOC Scandal Means Fewer Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The damage to the IOC's budget caused  
by the Olympics bribery scandal is hitting home to committee 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, a senior executive board member and chairman of  
the IOC coordination commission, said Friday that the IOC has 
agreed to cut the cost of services it will demand from Sydney to 
help meet a reduced budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games already  
had announced it will cut $48.7 million from the budget for the 
Games, blaming in part a dropoff in sponsorship from the corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge met with Sydney Olympic sponsors on Tuesday and apologized  
for the damage the scandal caused to the games' marketing 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, we played a role in the difficulties,'' Rogge said  
Friday at the end of commission's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take our responsibilities. By reducing the services  
that SOCOG will have to provide to us, we're going to give them a 
substantial saving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Services to the IOC are included in the host city contract.  
Rogge said IOC members' travel, accommodation and some other 
running costs are paid for by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the budget shortfall -- $32.5 million of expected  
sponsor revenue written off and an extra $16 million allocated for 
contingencies -- was not all the IOC's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Knight, president of the organizing committee, blamed  
the sponsorship shortfall on the IOC scandal. He said the IOC 
accepted that ``they are some of the problem and they must go some 
way towards assisting us to resolve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After visiting venues and being briefed on Sydney's readiness,  
Rogge said preparations were generally on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Two areas had been singled out for special attention -- the  
budget and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a delay in the implementation and testing of the sport  
results system -- a major headache at Atlanta in 1996 -- has been 
addressed with more personnel and money. 
</P>
<P>
	One venue problem still exists -- some local residents oppose  
part of Sydney's Bondi beach being closed for the beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said he would consider legal action against the local  
council if it sought to withdraw from an in-principle agreement to 
hold the competition on the beach.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Coming, Orioles Hurting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles would rather have the day  
off. 
</P>
<P>
	When their series with Cuba was first announced last month, the  
Orioles were considered one of baseball's best teams. They were 
also one of its highest-paid teams, with a nearly $80 million 
payroll and a lineup featuring Albert Belle, Cal Ripken and Will 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the rematch at Camden Yards on Monday, the Orioles  
have the worst record in baseball, the fans are booing and manager 
Ray Miller is in danger of losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken and Clark are on the disabled list, Belle is hitting .243  
and the pitching has been awful. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite plainly, the Orioles have a lot more to worry about than  
facing a Cuban all-star team, the first time a squad from the 
communist nation is playing a major league club in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this team needs a distraction right now,''  
shortstop Mike Bordick said. ``We'll play hard and play to win, but 
we've got issues that we have to straighten out. First and 
foremost, we have to focus on our season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 300 Cubans, including journalists, retired players and  
students, are expected to fly to Baltimore. Baseball-crazy Cubans 
back home hope the game will be broadcast live on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban-Americans from Miami and the New York-New Jersey  
metropolitan area are planning a protest at Camden Yards. They 
regard the game as a public relations coup for Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the game in Havana a month ago, Castro will not be in the  
stands. Neither will President Clinton, or any other high U.S. 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department isn't talking much about the game, except  
to acknowledge that a few of its employees might show up -- if they 
buy their own tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Clinton administration official briefed reporters  
Friday on the nearly sold-out game, but said his name couldn't be 
used. ``We're not in the position of encouraging defection; we're 
not in the position of discouraging defection,'' he said when asked 
about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	He said no special measures were being taken to deal with any  
defectors but added that Immigration and Naturalization Service 
personnel would likely be at the game. There is also no indication 
the Cubans will be bringing along security personnel to deflect any 
defectors, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition, which comes in the middle of a 12-game  
homestand, robs the Orioles of one of their two scheduled off days 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can always use an off day at home. They don't come around  
too often,'' reliever Mike Timlin said. ``But it's on the schedule 
and we've got to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Orioles traveled to Havana on March 28 for the historic  
first game, there was an air of mystery and excitement. The players 
knew little about Cuba and even less about the national team, which 
had fared well in Olympic competition but had never taken on a 
major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a playoff atmosphere,'' Bordick said. ``It seemed  
like as soon as the game started, then all of a sudden we 
understood it was our country against their country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles got all they could handle before winning 3-2 in 11  
innings. Baltimore is heading into this game after failing to have 
back-to-back wins all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a different kind of hoopla this time,'' said catcher  
Charles Johnson, who hit a two-run homer against the Cubans. ``I 
don't think there's the same amount of tension for this game. Part 
of the reason is the way we've been playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wants to win the game, but not at the expense of ruining  
a starting rotation that has struggled all season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will start Scott Kamieniecki, who is on the disabled  
list and hasn't pitched for Baltimore this season because of a 
hamstring injury. His start against Cuba is essentially a 
high-profile rehabilitative assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles desperately need some positive signs in a season  
gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it will be something that pulls us together and sets us  
off,'' Timlin said. ``You never know.''

<HEADLINE> Midwest Attendants Want To Unionize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Flight attendants for Midwest Express Airlines  
voted to unionize, becoming the second group of employees at the 
airline to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 360 eligible attendants, 204 voted for Association of  
Flight Attendants representation, according to results the National 
Mediation Board certified Thursday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted a voice on the job and security for our future,''  
said Sue Stein, one of the attendants who led the organizing drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote means the union, affiliated with the AFL-CIO, will  
represent all attendants at the airline. The union asked to begin 
contract negotiations, but no meeting date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	David C. Reeve, the airline's senior vice president of  
operations, said he was disappointed with the result of the 
election, but the Oak Creek-based company supported the employees' 
right to decide the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwest Express pilots are the only other unionized group at the  
airline. They are represented by Air Line Pilots Association and 
are negotiating their first contract.

<HEADLINE> WTO Wrestles With Picking New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization was due to make a  
final, desperate effort today to agree on a new leader after moves 
to appoint a former New Zealand premier ended in deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Renato Ruggiero of Italy, the WTO's director-general for the  
past four years, is stepping down, leaving the 134-nation body in 
crisis over his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting Friday of the WTO's decision-making council bogged  
down in procedural wrangling for eight hours, as supporters of 
Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi sought to 
block the nomination of New Zealander Mike Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Mchumo, the WTO council chairman adjourned the discussions  
until midday today. To avoid leaving themselves without an official 
head, delegates ``stopped the clock,'' meaning that they will treat 
the new meeting as still taking place on April 30, Ruggiero's last 
day in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo had earlier proposed to delegates that the U.S.-backed  
Moore be approved by consensus since he had the support of 62 
nations, three more than Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Japan, Malaysia, India and other Asian nations demanded  
a vote. This runs against the WTO's time-honored rule that all 
decisions be reached by consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially it became a case of Supachai supporters calling  
for a vote and Moore supporters saying no vote,'' said WTO 
spokesman Keith Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 50, has been involved in trade and foreign policy issues  
as a legislator for more than 20 years, nine of them as a minister. 
He was prime minister for eight weeks before his Labor party lost 
office in 1990. He is a supporter of free trade, but also an 
advocate for underprivileged and less powerful smaller states. 
</P>
<P>
	He is known for his no-nonsense, ``no-baggage'' approach to his  
responsibilities and wants to revamp the public image of the WTO, 
which is generally seen as remote and bureaucratic. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO post is seen as a key one, with a new round of trade  
talks looming and a ministerial conference coming up in Seattle in 
November. The organization is responsible for pushing through 
agreements to liberalize global commerce and set fair trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai, backed by Asia and Australia, the Middle East and  
several European countries, was long the front-runner and was 
widely perceived as the candidate of developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the all-important backing of the United States,  
Moore had support from South America and the Caribbean. In the 
closing stages of the contest he picked up backing in Africa, 
diplomats said, and that tipped the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe was divided between the two candidates, but European  
nations at Friday's meeting all indicated they would go along with 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Mchumo would be able to force through a  
decision -- repeating efforts prior to Friday's deadline all ended 
in failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Many nations fear a leadership vacuum at a time when the WTO is  
caught up in high-profile disputes between the United States and 
European Union over bananas and hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the sensitivity of the job, the United States on  
Friday targeted Europe, India, South Korea, Canada and Argentina on 
Friday for alleged unfair trade practices against American 
companies and said it would bring seven new cases before the WTO.

<HEADLINE> SUVs To Face Same Rules As Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Popular sport utility vehicles will have to  
meet the same, tough emission standards as cars under ambitious 
pollution rules to be proposed by the Clinton administration. 
Refiners will have to make cleaner gasoline, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency proposal is aimed at  
assuring that progress to improve air quality is not reversed by 
expected growth in travel and the fast-selling SUVs, some of which 
now emit more than twice as much pollution as cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House signed off on the proposal this week and an  
announcement was expected Saturday, said administration and other 
sources familiar with the plan. A final rule is not expected to be 
issued until the end of the year, and many of the requirements 
would not begin to be phased in until 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Tier II auto emission controls have prompted  
intense lobbying by both automakers and the oil companies, powerful 
industries that will be most affected by the new requirements. The 
new standards under the 1990 Clean Air Act will mirror nationwide 
California's tough air pollution rules. 
</P>
<P>
	While some details may still change, proposal's key elements,  
say government and private sources, include: 
</P>
<P>
	--A requirement for low-sulfur gasoline nationwide. Refiners  
would have to cut the content of sulfur -- which interferes with 
auto pollution control equipment -- from an average of 340 parts per 
million to 30 parts per million beginning in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	--An 80 percent reduction in the amount of smog-causing chemicals  
emitted from the tailpipe, to be phased in over several years 
beginning in 2004. Other pollutants also would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	--A requirement for automakers for the first time to include  
SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans in the mix of vehicles to 
determine fleet-wide tailpipe emission reductions. Some large SUVs 
may be given longer to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	The SUVs and pickup trucks, which last year accounted for nearly  
half of all new vehicles sold, currently are allowed to pollute two 
and three times as much as automobiles, although some manufacturers 
have made them significantly cleaner in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA has argued that as people drive more, increasingly in  
truck-like vehicles, future air quality cannot be improved without 
addressing pollution from such vehicles, or without imposing tough 
new requirements not only on automakers, but also on gasoline 
refiners to clean up the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If done properly, this decision can lead to tremendously  
cleaner cars and SUVs for the next decade and beyond,'' said Gene 
Karpinski, executive director of U.S. Public Interest Research 
Group, an environmental organization. That group recently estimated 
SUVs would spew 1.4 million tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide 
into the air annually by 2020 if not brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
	While cars today are 97 percent cleaner than models sold 30  
years ago, emission from cars and light trucks still account for 
one-third to one-half of the smog-causing pollution in urban areas 
as well as releases of microscopic soot and toxic chemicals, 
pollution control experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have become resigned in recent months to having to  
substantially reduce emissions from not only their cars but their 
heavily marketed truck-like vehicles as well. But they have asked 
the EPA to give them more time, until 2011, to do the job. EPA 
contends it can be done at least two years sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, however, agrees with automakers that for the tougher  
tailpipe standard to work, gasoline must become cleaner, and 
therefore proposed the 90 percent reduction in sulfur. 
</P>
<P>
	That reduction alone will reduce pollution from new cars and  
those already on the road, the equivalent of taking 54 million cars 
off the road, says William Becker, executive director of two groups 
of state and local air pollution control officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil industry representatives said they're ready to reduce sulfur  
in gasoline, but not by as much as the EPA wants and not 
nationwide, only in the eastern 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``A compelling case for nationwide fuel has not been made,''  
William O'Keefe, vice president of the American Petroleum 
Institute, said Friday. He said the EPA rule would cost industry $6 
billion in refinery changes, add 6 cents a gallon to the price of 
gasoline and cause some small refineries to close.

<HEADLINE> Insurer Head Fired in Bank Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRIESTE, Italy (AP) -- The takeover battle for one of Italy's  
largest banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, on Friday claimed 
the job of the chairman of Europe's third-largest insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Antoine Bernheim was fired Friday at a board meeting of  
Assicurazioni Generali SpA. Named to replace him was Alfonso 
Desiata, chairman of Generali's 54-percent-owned life insurer 
Alleanza Assicurazioni SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Generali's largest shareholder is the investment bank  
Mediobanca, which wanted Bernheim out because he tried to stay 
neutral in the takeover battle for Banca Commerciale Italiana, the 
fourth-largest bank in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is in merger talks with Banca Intesa SpA but has also  
received a rival $15.3 billion takeover bid from UniCredito 
Italiano SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Banca Commerciale owns 7.8 percent of Mediobanca and is  
Mediobanca's main outlet for selling the corporate bonds and other 
products it underwrites for virtually every top Italian company. A 
takeover of the bank could threaten the secretive investment bank's 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Generali owns 5 percent of Banca Commerciale. At least half of  
Generali's board members represent Mediobanca or its close business 
allies or are Generali executives close to Mediobanca. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between Mediobanca, one of the most powerful  
behind-the-scenes players in the Italian business world, and the 
independent Bernheim has been tense since he took over at Generali 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A Frenchman who is a partner in Lazard Freres, Bernheim tried to  
shake up the staid insurer with a series of acquisitions and 
consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Friday his ouster was initiated ``to settle old  
scores.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Seeks New Auto Pollution Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is about  
to propose tough new pollution controls on motor vehicles that for 
the first time would require popular sport-utility vehicles to be 
as clean-running as automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies also would have to produce much cleaner gasoline  
under the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The stringent new requirements, some of which would be phased in  
over the next decade, were given the nod this week by the White 
House and could be announced any day, administration officials said 
Thursday. The officials spoke only on condition they not be named. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA has told auto and oil industry representatives that  
dramatic, although technologically feasible, reductions in tailpipe 
emissions and cleaner gasoline are needed if state and local 
officials are to cut smog and soot to meet federal air quality 
requirements as well as reduce dangerous toxic chemicals and soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Tier II auto emission controls would require  
automakers on a fleet average to cut smog-causing chemical 
emissions and other pollution by up to 80 percent and take into 
account SUVs, light trucks and minivans that comprise half of all 
vehicles sold. 
</P>
<P>
	SUVs and pickup trucks currently can emit two and three times as  
much smog-causing nitrogen oxide than automobiles, although some 
models are considerably cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
	In another new twist, the EPA will require that the oil industry  
reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline by as much as 90 percent 
nationwide, according to sources familiar with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the auto emissions and gasoline requirements would mirror  
what California already has proposed, although the two plans are 
not identical. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have argued that they cannot meet the tougher  
tailpipe requirements without low-sulfur gasoline because sulfur 
inhibits pollution control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will define whether or not areas meet their  
federal health-based standards for smog and other pollutants,'' 
said William Becker, whose association represents state and local 
air pollution control officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The association has estimated that the proposed sulfur  
reductions in gasoline alone would cut smog-causing nitrogen oxide 
in half, equivalent to removing 54 million cars from the nation's 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirements are not expected to be made final until the  
end of the year and then the automakers will be given until 2004 to 
begin phasing in the cleaner vehicles over a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations, considered by EPA officials as the agency's  
most important environmental initiative this year, are expected to 
unleash intense lobbying from the two powerful industries most 
affected -- oil and automobiles -- as both seek to mold it more to 
their liking. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers in recent months have become resigned to the  
prospects of much tougher pollution control requirements for both 
cars and SUVs, but have argued for more time to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal recently floated by auto manufacturers would cut  
average fleet nitrogen oxide emissions to 0.07 grams per mile for 
all vehicles, including SUVs and light trucks, by 2011. The average 
is 0.4 grams per mile currently for cars and 0.7 grams to 1.1 grams 
per mile for SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers' proposal would have a phase-in that was two  
years longer than what the EPA had been considering and would 
condition the reductions on even stiffer sulfur reductions in 
gasoline than the EPA has had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have the cars and trucks converge is a big step forward,''  
Josephine Cooper, president of the Alliance of Automobile 
Manufacturers, said in a recent interview, adding that manufactures 
must have adequate time to comply -- and much cleaner gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	But with about one in every two vehicles sold now a light truck,  
SUV or minivan, environmentalists have argued that emission 
reduction gains will be lost if these vehicles are not required to 
meet as strict standards as automobiles and more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, said Samuel Leonard, General Motors' director for  
emissions and fuel efficiency, is that the exhaust from a large SUV 
has to be three times cleaner to meet the same gram-per-mile 
requirement as a car because the engine is doing three times the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers have argued that they can't meet the new  
requiremetns unless sulfur levels in gasoline are cut from its 340 
parts per million now to 30 parts per million, or perhaps even 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a reduction would add 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon to the  
price of gasoline and require $4 billion to $5 billion in 
retooling, driving some small refiners out of business, the 
American Petroleum Institute has argued. The oil industry has 
proposed limiting low-sulfur gasoline to 22 Eastern states and for 
the time being cutting sulfur only in half. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA, according to sources, has stood firm on insisting  
low-sulfur gasoline be required nationwide. To ease the burden on 
small, mostly Western, refiners, the proposal would provide some 
flexibility, including an extended timetable.

<HEADLINE> Onion Book 1st on Best-Seller List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Remember the immortal headlines? ``Zapruder  
Family Wowed At Home Movie Screening.'' ``Nancy Reagan Ends 
Nation's Drug Problem With Very Special `Diff'rent Strokes' 
Appearance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not. But hundreds of thousands of book buyers are seeing  
them now in the skewed story of the 20th century according to The 
Onion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Dumb Century,'' the Madison-based parody newspaper's  
``retrospective'' book, was released less than a month ago. On 
Sunday, it will be at the top of The New York Times' paperback 
nonfiction best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty amazing,'' Rob Siegel, The Onion's senior editor,  
said of the book's success. ``We didn't expect it, but we have a 
pretty solid, devoted, sizable underground fan base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book contains front page headlines and stories, putatively  
from old issues of The Onion, documenting historical events from 
1900 to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	All are written and designed by staff members of the satirical  
paper, which is actually only 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	A story dated Nov. 9, 1960, on John F. Kennedy's election to the  
White House calls him ``our nation's first handsome president'' and 
cites experts who noted that previous chief executives were 
``mildly attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The paper is a pretty big task to do every week,'' Siegel  
said. ``We spent basically two full years working round the clock, 
putting out the paper and the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly paper started in Madison and now has offices in  
Chicago, Denver and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	It features irreverent, off-the-wall headlines such as ``Soul  
Train Derails New Snacks'' and ``Social Security System Overhauled 
to Provide Early-Death Incentives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, there are serious movie and music reviews.  
</P>
<P>
	About 500,000 people read The Onion online at its Web site --  
www.theonion.com -- every week, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Onion has a deal to do a second book -- a compilation of  
material from the newspaper -- for Crown Publishers, a division of 
Random House that published ``Our Dumb Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A television special for NBC on ``Our Dumb Century'' also is in  
the works, Siegel said.

<HEADLINE> Winston Championship Talk Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Seven months and 25 races from the end of  
the Winston Cup season, the top drivers already are being bombarded 
by questions about the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that you didn't even think about that until  
maybe September, or at least midway through the summer,'' said 
Rusty Wallace, who won the series title in 1989. ``These days, it 
starts before Daytona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rain all day Friday washed out the first day of practice and  
qualifying for the California 500, leaving all the drivers time to 
kill. Inevitably, the rainy day talk turned to the championship 
battle, which currently has Jeff Burton leading Dale Jarrett by 40 
points and teammate Mark Martin by 85 after nine races. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin agrees with Wallace that nobody really thought about the  
championship early in the season when he first came into Winston 
Cup racing in 1981. But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way it is now, I think a team and driver need to start  
considering points in the 125-mile qualifying race in Daytona,'' 
Martin said. ``You don't want to wreck your good car and have to 
race in the Daytona 500 with something that isn't as good. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I almost think it makes it better. You don't have guys  
doing as many stupid things because they want to make sure they're 
there at the end of the race, getting a decent finish that gets 
them some points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As proof of his theory, Martin points out that there have  
already been seven race winners this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, it puts more cars in the mix, more cars in  
contention. But it takes a lot of the fun out of the year. I didn't 
sleep much the night after Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was referring to the race in March at Texas Motor  
Speedway, where a deflating tire sent him careening into the wall 
for a 34th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The intense Martin blamed himself for the incident because he  
had watched as both Jeff Gordon and Mike Skinner had crashed after 
their right front tires went flat earlier in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have enough experience to know that was going to  
happen,'' Martin said. ``I should have driven slower. Jeff Burton 
drove slow enough and finished seventh. I'd have given anything in 
the world to have run seventh, or ninth or 10th that day. I 
couldn't sleep because I was thinking about the 100 points we 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, the two-time defending series champion and winner of  
three of the past four titles, is fifth in the standings, an 
imposing 210 points behind Burton and 61 behind fourth-place Bobby 
Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	He has fallen into that hole mostly because of three finishes of  
36th or worse, resulting from two accidents and an engine failure. 
Despite early-season problems and that big deficit, Gordon remains 
the choice of many to win another title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, Jeff Gordon is still the one to beat,'' Jarrett said.  
``He's the only one in the top five who has won a championship. The 
rest of us have to prove we can get it done. 
</P>
<P>
	``You sure can't count those guys out of it. I kind of laugh  
when I hear people saying they're too far back to win the 
championship. Heck, we have 25 more races left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who has been third, second and third in the standings  
the last three years, said, ``Anybody who finishes in the top three 
for about six straight races is going to make up a lot of ground, 
and I think those guys could certainly do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point last season, Gordon had a run of 17 consecutive  
top-five finishes. He wound up the 1998 season with 13 victories 
after winning just three times through the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a year like we had last year, it's easy to say,  
`We're having a horrible year.' Yet we're fifth in the points,'' 
Gordon said. ``We're just trying to get some consistency. We've 
still got time to get it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is there too much emphasis on the championship?  
</P>
<P>
	``We can still have a great season even if we don't win the  
championship, but the championship is our ultimate goal every 
year,'' Gordon said.

<HEADLINE> Beer Aims at Gay Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) -- ``Gay Pride'' beer came out today --  
out of the brewery and onto the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	The beer, which is now available only in Massachusetts, is being  
marketed mainly to gays. Jenn Wolper, who created the brew, 
developed the idea one night in 1997 as she scanned the beer list 
at the Grotto, a gay bar in Northampton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come we don't have our own beer?'' she recalled asking the  
bartender. Wolper, a former manager in public health care and the 
communications industry, set about creating the beverage, the 
latest product to target the gay market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolper got June Peterson, a former colleague, to sign on as a  
business partner. They found a custom brewer in New Hampshire, put 
together about $70,000 largely from Peterson's investments, and 
arranged for the brewing of about 4,000 cases for starters. 
</P>
<P>
	The pale ale's bottle label features the initials ``GP'' and a  
banner saying ``Gay Pride.'' It will sell typically for between $14 
and $15 for a 12-pack, Wolper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a market that has been overlooked. There are a few  
niches out there that have not been judged politically correct -- or 
the margins aren't big enough,'' said Wolper, who is a lesbian. 
Peterson is heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolper incorporated her business as J. Lewis Co., named for her  
grandfather. The company will donate 1 percent of sales to gay 
rights and service groups and college scholarships for gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolper said she hopes to expand distribution to Rhode Island and  
Connecticut in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gay Pride'' beer joins a limited number of other products,  
from clothing to candy, that are aimed at a gay market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Queer Brewing Co. sells Q Pale Ale, a year-old beer, mainly  
around the San Francisco area. Ten percent of its profits are 
earmarked for gay causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Feemster, a former advertising executive who launched  
the business, said it was difficult to break though brand loyalty. 
But he said the gay community had become an attractive niche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to do something that truly was a part of the  
community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  N. Albania Chaos Hinders Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Mike McDonagh took all the necessary steps  
to organize an aid convoy in northern Albania -- he hired the 
trucks, got them loaded, and made sure special police armed with 
automatic rifles led the way. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire greeted the convoy snaking through the hills above  
Bajram Curri, the six gray-clad policemen jumped out and fired off 
a few bursts, then beckoned the trucks onward. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all in a day's work for international aid agencies  
operating in this impoverished region, where miserable roads, no 
airport or local communications network and general disorder 
combine to make it even harder to help the hundreds of thousands of 
refugees from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're in Europe but in some ways you're at the end of the  
world,'' said Ray Wilkinson, a former journalist now working as 
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The international relief effort for Kosovo refugees was  
criticized when ethnic Albanians began pouring over the borders 
from the Serbian province after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia on 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught off guard by the initial wave of scores of thousands into  
Albania, Macedonia and the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, the 
UNHCR and other agencies were slow to set up refugee camps and 
provide the usual blankets, cooking equipment, food and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief officials acknowledge they were unprepared for the sudden  
onslaught, but they also note that political problems in Macedonia 
and the logistical nightmare of Albania share at least some of the 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardships are daunting:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A crumbling, limited road system that makes overland transport  
extremely slow and damaging to vehicles. Three relief workers and 
their Albanian driver died earlier this month when their vehicle 
slid into a ravine. 
</P>
<P>
	-- No airport exists in the northern border region, requiring aid  
agencies to rely on the poor roads or transport helicopters to get 
supplies into the area. When refugees flood the border, their tiny 
tractors hauling wagons laden with goods and people clog the 
winding, mountain roads. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The virtually non-existent telephone network in the north  
makes satellite phones the only reliable means of communication. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Disputes with district officials, landowners, police and  
others in the Kukes district. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Banditry in the clan-based region that has increased in recent  
weeks, including muggings and harassment of refugees, petty theft 
of relief supplies and even armed robbery. Policemen, soldiers and 
private guards brandish automatic rifles, while handguns get 
flashed regularly on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonagh of Concern Worldwide knew the risks of running his  
four-truck convoy hauling flour, sugar, blankets and other items to 
Kosovo refugees in Bajram Curri, a notorious bandit town a few 
hours north of Kukes. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost every journalist who has gone there got robbed, including  
a group from The Associated Press, while the Organization of 
Security and Cooperation in Europe lost two vehicles at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonagh arranged with officials in Kukes for six special  
policemen in a blue, marked police van to ride in front until 
Bajram Curri, where a second group of seven would take over for the 
drive to the border village of Tropoja. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge problem,'' he said after the brief encounter with  
unsuccessful bandits. ``We're trying to get food to 2,500 refugees. 
So far they've been supplied by choppers ... but it's not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. World Food Program has managed to bring the needed 100  
tons of food aid to the region each day using helicopters and 
trucks, said spokeswoman Angela Walker. But it hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually when you think of a European country, you transport by  
road,'' she said. ``But the roads here are very difficult. The 
tractors are going 2 miles per hour, you can't get trucks up here. 
... It's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Due to security fears, the agency has banned any driving after  
dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're afraid that people are going to be held up,'' Walker  
said. ``It's scary because everyone here has guns. Someone said 
it's like the OK Corral or Dodge City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing dispute with local authorities, including the police,  
also causes problems. Wilkinson of the UNHCR told of a failed 
effort to construct a new camp for refugees who crossed over on the 
cumbersome tractors hauling wagons overladen with people and 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was your normal difficulty,'' he said. ``We abandoned it  
because control of the land was disputed by two villages and it 
couldn't be resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he said, poor local Albanians looted the tents and  
building supplies at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Some relief agencies complained Thursday that local police  
detained at least two truck drivers for lacking proper papers for 
the goods they were hauling. Relief workers called it the latest 
example of increasing harassment by local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it continues,'' said John Palmer of Goal, an Irish relief  
agency, ``we've told them we'll have to reconsider our 
participation.''

	``You're in Europe but in some ways you're at the end of the  
world,'' said Ray Wilkinson, a former journalist now working as 
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The international relief effort for Kosovo refugees was  
criticized when ethnic Albanians began pouring over the borders 
from the Serbian province after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia on 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught off guard by the initial wave of scores of thousands into  
Albania, Macedonia and the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, the 
UNHCR and other agencies were slow to set up refugee camps and 
provide the usual blankets, cooking equipment, food and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief officials acknowledge they were unprepared for the sudden  
onslaught, but they also note that political problems in Macedonia 
and the logistical nightmare of Albania share at least some of the 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardships are daunting:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A crumbling, limited road system that makes overland transport  
extremely slow and damaging to vehicles. Three relief workers and 
their Albanian driver died earlier this month when their vehicle 
slid into a ravine. 
</P>
<P>
	-- No airport exists in the northern border region, requiring aid  
agencies to rely on the poor roads or transport helicopters to get 
supplies into the area. When refugees flood the border, their tiny 
tractors hauling wagons laden with goods and people clog the 
winding, mountain roads. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The virtually non-existent telephone network in the north  
makes satellite phones the only reliable means of communication. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Disputes with district officials, landowners, police and  
others in the Kukes district. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Banditry in the clan-based region that has increased in recent  
weeks, including muggings and harassment of refugees, petty theft 
of relief supplies and even armed robbery. Policemen, soldiers and 
private guards brandish automatic rifles, while handguns get 
flashed regularly on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonagh of Concern Worldwide knew the risks of running his  
four-truck convoy hauling flour, sugar, blankets and other items to 
Kosovo refugees in Bajram Curri, a notorious bandit town a few 
hours north of Kukes. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost every journalist who has gone there got robbed, including  
a group from The Associated Press, while the Organization of 
Security and Cooperation in Europe lost two vehicles at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonagh arranged with officials in Kukes for six special  
policemen in a blue, marked police van to ride in front until 
Bajram Curri, where a second group of seven would take over for the 
drive to the border village of Tropoja. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge problem,'' he said after the brief encounter with  
unsuccessful bandits. ``We're trying to get food to 2,500 refugees. 
So far they've been supplied by choppers ... but it's not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. World Food Program has managed to bring the needed 100  
tons of food aid to the region each day using helicopters and 
trucks, said spokeswoman Angela Walker. But it hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually when you think of a European country, you transport by  
road,'' she said. ``But the roads here are very difficult. The 
tractors are going 2 miles per hour, you can't get trucks up here. 
... It's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Due to security fears, the agency has banned any driving after  
dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're afraid that people are going to be held up,'' Walker  
said. ``It's scary because everyone here has guns. Someone said 
it's like the OK Corral or Dodge City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing dispute with local authorities, including the police,  
also causes problems. Wilkinson of the UNHCR told of a failed 
effort to construct a new camp for refugees who crossed over on the 
cumbersome tractors hauling wagons overladen with people and 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was your normal difficulty,'' he said. ``We abandoned it  
because control of the land was disputed by two villages and it 
couldn't be resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he said, poor local Albanians looted the tents and  
building supplies at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Some relief agencies complained Thursday that local police  
detained at least two truck drivers for lacking proper papers for 
the goods they were hauling. Relief workers called it the latest 
example of increasing harassment by local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it continues,'' said John Palmer of Goal, an Irish relief  
agency, ``we've told them we'll have to reconsider our 
participation.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs $2.4B for Water Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to authorize $2.4  
billion over five years for 161 new or modified water projects 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed by a 418-5 vote, is similar to a measure  
that foundered last year in part because of controversy over 
several flood control and water supply provisions affecting 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill we bring to the floor today breaks that impasse,''  
said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee. ``People are not getting everything 
they want here. But it is a balanced compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The California provisions involve increasing flood protection  
along the American and Sacramento rivers and studying whether to 
raise the Folsom Dam in that area by 6 1/2 feet. Stripped out were 
items opposed by the Clinton administration that would have 
diverted water supplies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from California, the measure increases federal cost  
sharing for many deep water harbor dredging projects, extends 
authorization for Everglades restoration in Florida and authorizes 
$100 million for a variety of flood control projects that do not 
involve building structures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a similar bill last week. A conference  
committee will attempt to work out a final compromise.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 89.34 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as fears about inflation  
and rising interest rates resurfaced and foiled the Dow Jones 
industrials' attempt to reach 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 89.34 to 10,789.04, ending the blue chip index's  
advance on its latest milestone when it was only 39 points away. 
Nonetheless, the Dow surged 10.3 percent during April, and reached 
new closing highs 13 times during the month. It was up 99.37 for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were mixed on Friday, with the Nasdaq  
composite rising a modest 14.41 to 2,542.85, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index falling 7.65 to 1,335.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow, which traded as high as 10,961.71, began sinking after  
the bond market dropped in response to the Commerce Department's 
report that the U.S. economy grew at a strong 4.5 percent annual 
rate in the first three months of this year, far above 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond traders reacted to an inflation measure tied to the gross  
domestic product, which rose at an annual rate of 1.4 from January 
through March, up from 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase overshadowed the solid growth in the GDP, the total  
output of goods and services, which soared despite the nation's 
worsening trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond market yields soared to 5.66 percent from late Thursday's  
5.52 percent as investors feared the economic strength would 
reignite inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest 
rates higher. Higher rates raised the specter of high borrowing 
costs and lower corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was down more than 223 points during afternoon trading  
before regaining some ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the bond market clobbered the stock market,''  
said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets 
Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The down mood was compounded by a report from corporate  
purchasing executives that said manufacturing activity surged in 
the Midwest during April. The report by the Purchasing Management 
Association of Chicago is often viewed as a precursor to the survey 
on the economy by the National Association of Purchasing 
Management, which issues its own survey on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been generally calm about inflation and interest  
rates in recent weeks, focusing instead on first-quarter earnings 
reports. As recently as Thursday, a government report found wages 
moved up at their slowest pace on record, indicating inflation well 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone is worried about inflation today, they forgot to  
read the newspaper yesterday,'' said Charles Crane, market 
strategist at Key Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow stocks, American Express slipped 4 7/8 to 130 11/16  
and J.P. Morgan fell 3 1/4 to 134 3/4 because a rise in interest rates 
is likely to hurt financial service companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But technology stocks rallied after three days of losses,  
contributing to the rise in the Nasdaq index. America Online rose 1 
3/8 to 142 3/4 and Amazon.com was up 3 13/16 to 172 1/16. IBM advanced 
4 3/8 to 209 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard rose 1/2 to 78 7/8 after a Merrill Lynch analyst  
said the personal computer maker will likely top second-quarter 
earnings estimates of 79 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dow stock that did well Friday was Minnesota Mining and  
Manufacturing, up 3 3/8 to 89, after 3M reported higher than expected 
first-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said the interest rate concerns gave investors a  
reason to collect profits after the market's April surge. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you consider the market has risen almost 1,000 point in  
the past four weeks investors have a good excuse to sit back and 
enjoy some of their recent winnings,'' Crane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.79 to 634.30,  
and the American Stock Exchange composite fell 2.03 to 776.97. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
small-company stocks, edged 0.04 lower to 432.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated volume came to 1.13 billion shares, down from 1.22  
billion Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.4 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose .08 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Kills Climber in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A mountain climber fell 1,200 feet to  
his death in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park when an avalanche 
swept him over a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Haberl of Whistler, British Columbia, was climbing with two  
companions on an unnamed peak on Thursday afternoon when they 
became caught in a slow-moving, 4-foot-deep slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Two were able to break free, but Haberl was swept away. His  
companions found his body as they descended the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Haberl's death is Alaska's 12th avalanche fatality this year.  
Two snowboarders were killed in a slide on Tuesday near Juneau, and 
six people died in a mid-March avalanche southeast of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people died in Alaska avalanches in 1998.  
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Author of Chernobyl Virus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The author of the Chernobyl computer virus  
told investigators that he created the bug hoping to humiliate and 
take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software 
providers, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted he didn't expect it to cause worldwide damage, a  
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen Ing-hau, 24, looked nervous and was speechless when he was  
mobbed by reporters after being summoned for police questioning on 
his involvement in a case that caused at least 600,000 computer 
meltdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chernobyl virus -- known in Taiwan as the CIH, for Chen's  
initials -- had even pressed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to 
study antivirus programs to prevent it from invading its computers, 
the police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of  
computer engineering at the Institute of Technology. Chen has since 
graduated and has been undergoing Taiwan's mandatory two-year 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen had spent long hours playing computer games since entering  
college and was a frequent victim of computer viruses when 
downloading video games and other software from the Internet, the 
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he created the highly vicious virus that could avoid  
detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool 
of the software providers, from whom he had bought antivirus 
programs that proved useless,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact. He  
regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26,  
the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to 
erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system 
settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Taiwanese law, someone convicted of spreading computer  
viruses can face up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say whether Chen will be charged. Computer  
experts said Chen might not be charged because he did not intend to 
spread the virus. But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking 
millions of dollars of damage compensation.

<HEADLINE> Balkans Tourism Another Casualty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Fears of an escalating conflict in Yugoslavia have  
caused an increasing number of American tourists to cancel trips to 
Greece, Croatia and other countries in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. travel agencies report a sharp decline in airline and hotel  
bookings, and cruise ship companies are rerouting their vessels 
away from the eastern Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	Even travel to Italy has been affected, due in part to frequent  
TV images of NATO bombers taking off from an airbase in Aviano, 
north of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are saying, 'OK, I'd rather travel domestically this  
year.' As a result, we're seeing our U.S. and Canada business up 
very strongly,'' said Steve Kang, managing director of Maupintour, 
a tour operator based in Lawrence, Kan. Bookings for tours to 
Turkey, Greece and Italy have plunged by 25 percent or more, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans too are becoming more cautious. Some British and  
German vacationers are taking a dimmer view of Croatia's sunny 
coastline, and cruise operators have scaled back trips on the 
Danube River. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics are hard to come by, but analysts at  
PricewaterhouseCoopers estimate that hotels and travel companies 
have already lost business worth $100 million due to the effects of 
fighting in Kosovo and NATO's air raids on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounting firm predicts that losses will grow if NATO  
deploys ground troops or if the conflict spills beyond Yugoslavia's 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
	International Tours Fifth Avenue, a New York-based travel  
agency, reports that 70 of its 500 customers have canceled trips to 
southeastern Europe, including Greece and southern Italy. Scott 
Winsten, a senior vice-president for the firm, attributes many of 
the cancellations to a poor grasp of geography. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have no concept where anything is, whether it's Kosovo,  
Jamaica, Bermuda or the Bahamas,'' he said. ``They get very 
confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even one of his employees, Caroline Starr, is advising her  
customers to avoid Venice and other parts of eastern Italy for fear 
of an unexpected influx of ethnic Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agencies that specialize in trips to the Balkans have  
suffered the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Adriatic Sunshine Travel, a Chicago-based agency that organizes  
trips to Croatia and Bosnia, has seen sales plunge by 80 percent -- 
a crisis that owner Mirna Jelovac calls the worst she's experienced 
in 10 years of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For Audrey Oster, a New York artist, uncertainty about the  
Balkan turmoil is not reason enough for her to scrap her vacation 
plans. She and her husband are planning to fly next month to the 
Greek island of Corfu, which lies just miles off the Albanian 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly been a little bit of a question in my head,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they haven't bought their tickets yet, she said when  
they do, she'll make one practical concession: ``I'll probably buy 
trip insurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Physical danger is less the problem than concerns about possible  
airport closures and the need to make time-consuming detours, 
travel agents say. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines began feeling the effect of the conflict when NATO  
launched its air campaign. Military aircraft snarled air traffic in 
Frankfurt, Germany, causing one of Europe's biggest carriers, 
Lufthansa, to delay some flights and cancel others. 
</P>
<P>
	Lufthansa, British Airways and other airlines have been forced  
to divert Asia-bound flights around the conflict zone, adding up to 
an hour to each journey. 
</P>
<P>
	Some luxury cruise operators have stopped calling on ports in  
the Adriatic and eastern Mediterranean and have rerouted their 
ships further west. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise line, no longer lets  
its ships stop at the Croatian port of Dubrovnik. Company spokesman 
Tim Gallagher said the company could lose $50 million in business 
if the conflict in Kosovo drags on into the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	German tourists are continuing to travel to Hungary, which  
borders northern Yugoslavia, but the number of Germans traveling by 
road to Croatia has decreased by as much as 20 percent, said Bernd 
Rimele of TUI Deutschland, a charter tours company based in 
Hanover, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of British Travel Agents sees a decrease of less  
than 5 percent in the number of Britons making trips to Greece and 
southeastern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``British holiday-makers don't scare too easily,'' said ABTA  
spokesman Sean Tipton. 
</P>
<P>
	One effect of the conflict has been unforeseen bargains.  
</P>
<P>
	The recently remodeled Hotel Excelsior in Dubrovnik, Croatia, is  
struggling to fill its 172 rooms, and management has slashed rates 
by 30 percent since the NATO bombings began. A double room now goes 
for $42.45 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs may be in store if more guests fail to arrive.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we worry about that,'' said reception clerk Joseph  
Barcot.

<HEADLINE> Boy Bids $3M at Online Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HADDONFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Andrew Tyler had the winning bids on an  
antique bed, a 1971 red Corvette and an oak cradle. But the 
eighth-grader lost out on the 1955 Ford convertible, a Van Gogh 
painting and a rare Superman comic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't know what I was doing,'' Andrew said Thursday  
from his home in this Philadelphia suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	What he was doing was bidding money he didn't have via the  
Internet auction house eBay -- $3 million in bids from a boy with a 
weekly allowance of $15. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, nearly half the offers the 13-year-old made during the  
bidding frenzy -- for $925,012 worth of merchandise -- were accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Then mom and dad found out.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our kid is the nicest kid,'' said his mother, Ingrid, who  
found out last week. ``I was horrified. I could not believe it -- 
until I actually talked to my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tyler said she confronted Andrew and he admitted placing  
the bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``To him it was like a game. He didn't know it was real money,''  
she said. ``He really didn't know this was for real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	eBay said Andrew's account has been suspended and the sellers  
who accepted his deadbeat bids have been notified. When someone 
successfully bids via eBay, payment and delivery are worked out 
between the winning bidder and the seller. 
</P>
<P>
	As for eBay's security procedures, spokesman Kevin Pursglove  
said the company has a strict policy against bidding by anyone 
under 18. But he said eBay largely works on the honor system. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-week period, Andrew bid on 13 items, including $1.2  
million for a medical office in Jacksonville, Fla., $500,000 for 
the Van Gogh, $120,000 for the first Superman comic book and 
$35,000 for a replica of a Viking ship. 
</P>
<P>
	While eight of the bids failed, Andrew had the winning bid on  
five items, including the bed that belonged to Sir John A. 
Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid for the 1860s bed stood at $12,000 until Andrew  
demolished the competition -- he offered $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew admits he was lucky to get off with just losing his  
Internet privileges. ``My parents are just mad at me, nothing 
else,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bitter Scottish Derby Seen Up Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Claudio Reyna has played in the World Cup, two Olympics and  
captained a side in the German Bundesliga. He's even dodged 
projectiles while hostile fans spat on him during a World Cup 
qualifier in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	Some feel that's little preparation for an ``Old Firm'' clash.  
</P>
<P>
	Few matches around the world compare to the Glasgow derby  
between Rangers and Celtic, a 109-year-old grudge match that, on 
Sunday, Reyna will become the first American to see from field 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously one of the more traditional rivalries,'' the  
25-year-old international said by phone. ``Its one of the biggest 
games in the world. Every time they play, it's THE game of year. 
The atmosphere, whether at Ibrox (Stadium) or Celtic Park, is 
incredible. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not many places in the world like it,'' added Reyna,  
who lines up for Rangers. ``I'm really excited. The guys have told 
me all about it. The fans are so passionate. The guys were telling 
me today, that Ibrox will be full with 50,000 fans watching the 
game on two giant TV screens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's more than a traditional intra-city rivalry, even by soccer  
standards. Separated by a mere five miles, the two clubs are worlds 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The game's passion dates back to the medieval animosity between  
Catholics (Celtic) and Protestants (Rangers). Add the fact the two 
clubs have won 83 Scottish league titles and 57 Scottish Cup 
titles, making the matches very often for some type of crown, and 
it's wise not to wear Rangers blue or Celtic green on game day -- 
unless seated with like-minded folk. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last decade or so, the game has changed somewhat. Instead  
of relying on predominantly homegrown Protestant or Catholic 
players, both sides have become very international, signing players 
from across Europe and throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the management of both clubs is now foreign.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even with that, even though the game on the pitch has changed  
quite drastically, with a frenzied first 25 minutes with adrenalin 
pumping, even though all that has changed, you still have a hot 
atmosphere, a bitter atmosphere,'' Glasgow Daily Mail sports writer 
Peter Jarbin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyna has had only a couple of weeks to adjust to Scottish life  
since transferring from Germany's VfL Wolfsburg on April 2. On top 
of that, his first child, Jack, was born April 10. He left the baby 
and his wife Danielle, a former member of the U.S. women's team, in 
Germany. They are expected to arrive in Scotland next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting used to it,'' Reyna said. ``Obviously it's a new  
country. Everybody has been very nice at the club. It's made the 
transition a lot easier, adjusting to the Scottish game. I've got 
two games under my belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the big challenge is so many supporters. It was so  
exciting for me ... stepping on field there were 50,000 people,'' 
Reyna said, describing a 3-1 victory over Aberdeen. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyna has been overseas his entire professional career, starting  
with Germany's Bayer Leverkusen in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the 1994 U.S. World Cup team, but didn't  
play. He was the playmaker in France '98, playing every minute, but 
is remembered most for being fouled early in the first game against 
Germany by Jens Jeremies and not being effective after that. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned to Germany after the World Cup, Reyna struggled  
to regain his place at Wolfsburg. When he finally did, he was 
largely praised, but Reyna began looking elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Having gone from a modest German club to one of the oldest and  
most famous in the world -- Rangers was founded in 1872 -- Reyna 
understands the significance of an American playing soccer abroad 
at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being an American is even more of a challenge,'' Reyna said.  
``You have to prove Americans can play at a big club. It's a little 
bit of a responsibility for America, that if I do well it may give 
an opportunity to others.''

<HEADLINE> Military Satellite Titan in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A military communication satellite  
worth $800 million ended up in the wrong orbit Friday, the third 
failed mission in a row for the Air Force's most powerful rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The three strikes have cost taxpayers $3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we have three failures in a row of any system ...  
something is not right,'' said Brig. Gen. Randy Starbuck, who's in 
charge of the Cape Canaveral Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything appeared to go well as the Titan IV rocket lifted off  
early Friday afternoon, delayed 1 1/2 hours by minor technical 
problems and overnight thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	But seven hours later at a hastily convened news conference, Air  
Force officials said the Defense Department's newest Milstar 
satellite was stranded in a lopsided orbit thousands of miles too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force controllers will try to boost the satellite using  
on-board fuel and thrusters. Starbuck said it was too soon to 
speculate what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The first hint of trouble came a half-hour into the flight.  
</P>
<P>
	An upper-stage Centaur rocket was supposed to boost the  
satellite into a 22,300-mile-high orbit, but did not fire properly, 
Starbuck said. There also may have been other problems earlier in 
the flight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A different type of upper-stage motor malfunctioned three weeks  
ago, leaving a missile-warning satellite in a useless orbit. In 
August, one of the rockets and a spy satellite were destroyed in an 
explosion shortly after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Starbuck said there appears to be no similarities among the  
three failures. It's been decades since the same kind of rocket 
failed three times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was to have joined two less sophisticated Milstars  
already in orbit. In all, the Air Force planned six such satellites 
to provide secure, jam-proof communication between U.S. military 
commanders and troops in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials stressed that Friday's mishap will not  
hamper the military's communications or the nation's security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstar program was criticized by the General Accounting  
Office last fall as outdated and inefficient. The satellites were 
conceived during the Cold War and designed to withstand the 
radiation from a nuclear blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Corp. built both the satellite and the Titan IV  
rocket.

<HEADLINE> Palladium Futures Prices Plunge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By CLIFF EDWARDS    	
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures prices plunged 10 percent Friday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange after large deliveries of the metal 
boosted speculation Russia is exporting again following a lengthy 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cocoa rose sharply, as did wheat and soybeans.  
</P>
<P>
	Palladium tumbled at the beginning of trading and never  
recovered on news as much as 160,000 ounces of palladium, or nearly 
10 times the daily recent average, was sold overnight in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge sale pointed to Russian selling, since that country  
controls nearly 80 percent of the world's supply. South Africa 
exports much of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has not made large-scale shipments of the industrial  
metal since December, the third consecutive year it has held 
supplies off the market, purportedly because of bureaucratic 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Western manufacturers rely on the metal for use in cleaner  
burning automobile emission-control devices, in jewelry and in 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium demand has been increasing steadily for the past four  
years as more countries set tough pollution-control standards, but 
prices for the metal have tumbled in recent weeks amid fears 
manufacturers weary of the repeated delays may find alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for June delivery fell 32.90, or 9.8 percent, to $308  
an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York as chocolate manufacturers became heavy buyers amid 
speculation that prices had fallen to their lowest for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures have plunged in recent weeks as crops poured in  
from harvests of major West African manufacturers. With the major 
candy-making season still months away, manufacturers have been 
content to sit on the sidelines and wait for prices to fall to 
their lowest. 
</P>
<P>
	July cocoa rose $13 to $1019 a ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade were  
pressured early in the session amid heavier-than-expected 
deliveries of supplies for the May contract -- a sign that farmers 
are settling for lower prices amid fears matters will become worse 
in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But wheat later rose on marginal export demand and news the  
government made another large purchase for donation to needy 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans found some support on conflicting forecasts for weather  
next week in Midwest growing regions. The National Weather Service 
is calling for above-normal rainfall, but some private forecasters 
are saying skies will remain clear at least through Wednesday. That 
will encourage corn planting and could lead to more of that crop 
getting into the ground over soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.68 a bushel; July soybeans rose 2  
cents to $4.86 1/2 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans $20M for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators will postpone a showdown over  
allowing President Clinton to use ``whatever means necessary'' to 
win the battle against Yugoslavia, Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, D-S.D., made the prediction as the U.S.-led NATO  
bombing of Yugoslavia intensified dramatically and the United 
States committed more long-range bombers to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle told reporters that he and Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., will join forces against considering a motion by 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that would allow Clinton to use the 
force necessary -- including ground troops -- to prevail against 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Daschle predicted the 
leaders will prevail in the vote Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do is to follow the advice of the president,  
who admonished us to give the war effort and the air mission time 
to function, time to work. I believe that it is working,'' Daschle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks came in the wake of House refusal to endorse the  
bombing campaign against Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, a House committee approved nearly $13 billion to pay  
for Pentagon operations in the Balkans and elsewhere. Clinton, who 
had asked for half as much money, today directed the State 
Department to release up to $20 million in existing emergency funds 
to aid Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also formally directed the State Department to begin  
clearing the way for up to 20,000 refugees to come to the United 
States for shelter with volunteers and relatives here. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said  
the bombing campaign has entered the ``domination phase.'' That 
means warplanes try to hit enemy troops on the ground, in addition 
to the supplies and infrastructure that support Milosevic's 
military machine. 
</P>
<P>
	In what was apparently the largest onslaught to date, NATO  
planned 670 air sorties throughout the day and night Thursday to 
take advantage of clearing weather. Of those, 296 were listed as 
attack or combat flights and the others a mixture of support and 
reconnaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	``So today's a big one,'' Shelton said at a briefing for  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton was to begin visiting U.S. air crews in the region today  
as part of a short trip to the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is conducting air operations over Yugoslavia both day and  
night, virtually around the clock,'' Shelton said. ``Our military 
strikes have taken a heavy toll on Milosevic's forces and his 
security infrastructure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton noted clear skies were predicted over Yugoslavia for the  
next several days, which should allow for more bombing runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clouds hamper the lasers and other precision instruments that  
guide many missiles and bombs, and pilots have turned back or held 
off on dropping bombs when weather interfered. 
</P>
<P>
	The $12.9 billion spending package approved Thursday by the  
House Appropriations Committee was double what President Clinton 
requested. It will cover the fighting and buttress Pentagon needs 
around the globe. House floor debate is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Defense Secretary William Cohen announced he was  
sending 10 additional B-52 bombers to Europe, more than doubling 
the number now flying long-range bombing missions from a base in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO bombing campaign that began March 24 was designed to  
force the Serb-led Yugoslav government to accept conditions for 
peace in the province of Kosovo, and allow ethnic Albanian refugees 
to return to their homes under the protection of an international 
peace-keeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees and aid workers report a string of atrocities,  
including mass killings, by Serb forces inside Kosovo and hundreds 
of thousands of refugees have fled the southern Serbian province in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia, led by Milosevic, is the dominant of two republics that  
make up Yugoslavia. Other Slavic countries have split from the 
federation since the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia wants to retain control of Kosovo, which it regards as  
the republic's cultural cradle despite the fact that ethnic Serbs 
were actually a minority there until a few weeks ago. NATO wants 
the province to be autonomous but still remain a nominal part of 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats invoked the suffering of the refugees as  
they accused Republicans of undermining American troops with an 
unexpected 213-213 House vote Wednesday to withheld support for the 
NATO air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri called the  
vote ``a low moment in foreign policy and the history of this 
institution.'' He blamed ``a small but determined extreme 
majority'' for orchestrating the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip, noted that  
26 Democrats also voted against the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The partisan finger-pointing came as a 10-member congressional  
delegation led by Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., headed to Vienna, 
Austria, to meet with members of the Russian parliament to discuss 
possible ways of resolving the Balkans crisis.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Survivors Getting Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two Iowa boys stuffed $13 into an  
envelope and mailed it to Colorado. A junior high school class in 
Corning, Calif., sent $50. New York state's largest teachers union 
donated $5,000. A former Littleton resident in Peru telephoned and 
put $500 on his credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School, donations  
have been pouring in to help survivors and the families of those 
killed. Checks are coming so fast that some organizations are 
having trouble keeping up with the heaps of mail. Contributions 
arrive via the Internet from as far away as Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	One fund already has received more than $650,000 in donations  
and pledges, and a media foundation has promised to match 50 cents 
on the dollar up to the first $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney Co. donated $100,000, and the rock band the Goo Goo  
Dolls contributed $10,000. The band, whose current hit ``Slide'' 
has been on Billboard's Top 100 for weeks, was one of the first 
contribute after learning of the Columbine shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where it'll stop we don't know,'' said Mike Durkin, president  
of the Mile High United Way, which established The Healing Fund. 
``We didn't ask for any of that money. We didn't have to solicit 
folks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the fund, checks of $5,000 have been distributed this week  
to the families of the 13 killed and 23 wounded. The money is for 
immediate needs, such as funerals and hospital expenses, Durkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	No checks have been given to the families of Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold, the student gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The checks are in addition to the $1 million made available by  
the state and the $1.5 million by the federal government to pay for 
burials, medical expenses, lost wages and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of community leaders will meet to decide how to  
spend the rest of The Healing Fund money. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the funds will go toward things related to the Columbine  
incident, whether it's helping the families or helping to prevent 
this in the future through violence prevention programs,'' United 
Way spokeswoman Danielle Corriveau said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen other funds for victims have been set up, and  
six have been established for individuals, such as slain teacher 
Dave Sanders. The fund in his name will provide scholarships for 
Columbine seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Money also is being raised through the sale of memorial T-shirts  
and compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	A Denver company has produced and sold about 40,000 T-shirts --  
printed with a columbine, the state flower, and the date of the 
massacre -- and is donating the $5 profit from each one. 
</P>
<P>
	Discs of the song ``Friend of Mine,'' written by two brothers  
from Columbine in tribute to the victims, are on sale for $11.95. 
The boys performed the song at a memorial service attended by 
70,000, and the phone line to order it has been jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, a group of drag queens donated $880 in tips  
to a Columbine fund from a show at a local bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't even been able to go through everything,'' said  
Mona Sandoval, executive director of the Jefferson Foundation, an 
arm of the Jefferson County School District that has received 
$175,000 in donations and pledges. ``It's just overwhelming for 
this foundation, with a staff of three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sandoval says one envelope from Ames, Iowa, contained two  
five-dollar bills and three singles, along with a note that said 
simply, ``From two boys, 8 and 12 years old in Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An envelope from Lawrenceville, N.J., had a $25 check and a note  
from a secretary who said her donation was in memory of the 
students and of her boss' father, who died of a heart attack around 
the time of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the envelope from Pueblo. The woman's note read:  
</P>
<P>
	``My 14-year-old daughter says it's too bad that it takes  
something like this to bring people together. I would've liked to 
have sent a little something, but I can't afford it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> Chicago Police Tactics Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge has freed a teen-ager who confessed to  
fatally stabbing a woman who, it turns out, was never stabbed at 
all. The case has stoked the debate over whether Chicago police are 
bullying people into admitting to crimes they didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Huggins, 16, had spent more than a year behind bars  
awaiting trial. He was acquitted by a judge Thursday after a 
medical expert testified that the victim, 26-year-old Lorraine 
Gates, was beaten and strangled, not stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of four murder cases whose unraveling has proved a  
major embarrassment to Chicago-area law enforcement authorities in 
the last three years. The cases have prompted demands from defense 
attorneys for an investigation of police conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police have a saying -- `Let's make him talk,''' Huggins'  
attorney, Andre Grant, said Friday. ``Unfortunately, that means, 
`Let's make him admit things that the physical evidence tells us 
simply could not have happened.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they accept the decision of Circuit Judge  
Thomas Sumner to free Huggins. But they still say Huggins was the 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Benjamin, a spokesman for the state's attorney's office,  
noted that Huggins in his statement said he stabbed and punched the 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are often inconsistencies in people's statements, even  
when they confess to crimes that they commit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his decision, the judge suggested that the zeal of police and  
prosecutors to solve the case clouded their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes in this system -- in this process we have which is  
presumed to ferret out the truth -- the truth gets obscured in the 
process of winning and losing,'' Sumner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that besides the inconsistency involving stab wounds,  
the victim's DNA was found in blood on a jacket belonging to 
another teen. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins' lawyer is scheduled to go to court May 14 to seek a  
special prosecutor to investigate police handling of another case 
that has haunted Chicago for months -- the beating death of 
11-year-old honor student Ryan Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Two boys, 7 and 8, were charged with Ryan's murder in August  
after six hours alone with Chicago detectives who said the boys had 
confessed. The boys supposedly admitted they killed her for her 
bicycle. The charges were dropped after semen was found in her 
clothing. An ex-convict has since been charged with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, four men who served years behind bars for a 1978 gang  
rape and double murder that evidence shows they didn't commit 
agreed to a $36 million settlement with Cook County, whose 
sheriff's police made the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the so-called Ford Heights Four said their clients  
were the victims of a racially motivated frameup. The defendants 
were freed as the result of work by a Northwestern University 
journalism class. 
</P>
<P>
	More work by Northwestern journalism students resulted in the  
Feb. 5 release of 43-year-old Anthony Porter, who spent 16 years in 
prison for a double homicide in Chicago. Another man now admits he 
pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	After admitting their mistake in the Ryan Harris case, Cook  
County State's Attorney Richard Devine and Chicago Police 
Superintendent Terry Hillard announced new safeguards to prevent a 
repeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Murder suspects will be allowed to give a videotaped statement  
after they are questioned, and youngsters who are being questioned 
by police will have the right to have their parents in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grant said it will take more to solve the problem. He said  
the federal government eventually will be forced to investigate the 
way Chicago police take confessions in homicide cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Huggins didn't confess to a thing,'' Grant said. ``He  
just parroted back what he was told. He was a 15-year-old kid who 
was frightened, frightened and intimidated.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 154.06 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Friday after a glowing  
report on the U.S. economy rekindled inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 154.06 at 10,724.32. The Dow, which had moved higher in the 
morning, began sinking after the bond market became unnerved by the 
economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell. The Nasdaq composite index  
was down 23.94 at 2,504.50. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 
20.27 to 1,322.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market dropped markedly in response to the Commerce  
Department's report that the U.S. economy grew at a strong 4.5 
percent annual rate in the first three months of this year, far 
above expectations, as consumers spent at the fastest pace in more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The department reported that the solid growth in the gross  
domestic product, the total output of goods and services, came 
despite the fact that the nation's trade deficit, battered by 
overseas economic turmoil, soared to a record level. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond market yields soared to 5.66 percent from late Thursday's  
5.52 percent as investors feared the economic strength would 
reignite inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest 
rates higher. Higher rates raised the specter of high borrowing 
costs and lower corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds got hit pretty hard,'' said Bob Basel, a head trader at  
Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow stocks, American Express slipped 5 1/16 to 130 5/16  
and J.P. Morgan fell 4 to 134 because a rise in interest rates is 
likely to hurt financial service companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, another Dow stock, fell 3 1/8 to 43 1/4.  
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks returned most of their early gains. America  
Online fell 3 5/8 to 137 3/4. Amazon.com was down 1 3/4 to 166 1/2 
</P>
<P>
	But Hewlett-Packard rose 7/8 to 79 1/4 after a Merrill Lynch analyst  
said the personal computer maker will likely top second-quarter 
earnings estimates of 79 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were marginally ahead of decliners on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 721 million shares, 
slightly below Thursday's level. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Service Disrupted to Online Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Customers at 21 banks, including First Union  
Corp., that use CheckFree for electronic banking services may be 
finding their transactions aren't quite glitch-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Some users of Quicken or Microsoft's Money financial software  
have reported problems either logging on or in getting ``kicked 
out'' before they were ready, said Terrie O'Hanlon, a CheckFree 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customer by customer, the experience is different,'' she said,  
adding that up to 500,000 customers potentially could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks that use a new transaction processing system called  
Genesis the ones having problems. CheckFree began switching banks 
to the new system six months ago, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief operating officer Pete Sinisgalli said in a statement  
workers had trouble diagnosing the ``root cause'' of the problem, 
but on Thursday believed they had identified it. 
</P>
<P>
	``(We're trying) to resolve this issue as quickly as possible to  
restore uninterrupted service for consumers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, was putting  
together special instructions and information for customers on its 
Web page. The Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union has some 16 million 
customers in the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our customers are affected. We don't know how many at  
this point,'' said spokeswoman Danielle Deabler. She estimated the 
total number of customers who bank online as in the ``hundreds of 
thousands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said First Union would work with CheckFree to make sure  
customers weren't charged late fees caused by the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross, CheckFree Holdings Co.  
has some 2.8 million customers and helps provide electronic payment 
services at 350 institutions. Founded in 1981, the company has 
1,800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a small percentage of Americans use such services, largely  
because of unfamiliarity or concerns about reliability and 
security.

<HEADLINE> China Vows To Boost Tax Collections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China is intensifying tax collections to try to  
boost government revenues to 20 percent of gross domestic product 
within three to five years, state media reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government revenues last year accounted for 12.4 percent of the  
$963 billion economy, the China Securities News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Finance Minister Lou Jiwei vowed to boost that to 20  
percent, with about two-thirds of the tax total coming from central 
government collections, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax revenues this year are expected to total $130 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``Reform of the management of the government's budget will take  
some time ... but the government is committed to the development of 
an effective fiscal system,'' Lou was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Join the Peace Corps, Go Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peace Corps volunteers often live in rural  
dwellings without a phone or TV, but a big majority -- 72 percent -- 
now have easy access to a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than have running water in their generally humble  
living quarters -- 67 percent -- and about the same percentage as 
those with electricity, according to a survey filled out by 
three-fourths of the 6,700 overseas volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is changing and the Peace Corps is changing with  
it,'' Peace Corps Director Mark Gearan said in an interview. But he 
acknowledged the results were surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, sent out last year and compiled this week, shows  
that in addition to widespread computer access, 60 percent of 
volunteers have easy access to a fax machine, 53 percent have 
e-mail and 38 percent use the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, two-thirds of volunteers still live in small  
towns, villages or rural areas or on outer islands and only 34 
percent have a telephone and 32 percent a television. Volunteers 
receive a minimal living allowance and a readjustment allowance 
after they return from the normal two-year stint. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not yet on the new volunteer's list of recommended gear,  
but Patrick Gamman from Tillamook, Ore., took a solar-powered 
laptop computer with him to a remote village in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	``He rides a horse to work. He lives in a former chicken coop on  
stilts. He has no electricity and no running water. But he's 
writing on a computer,'' said Gearan, who recently visited Gamman 
in his village. 
</P>
<P>
	Add a cell phone, and a volunteer can get access to the  
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential for developing countries to literally leapfrog  
and gain all the benefits of information is enormous,'' said 
Gearan, who in just three years as Peace Corps director has seen a 
sea change in technology used by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers who do not have their own computers often have access  
to Internet cafes, which are popping up in unexpected places across 
the Third World. They allow people to maintain e-mail accounts and 
even Web sites without actually owning any hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous surveys, in 1993 and 1987, didn't ask about computer  
access. A survey in 1997 found 40 percent used computers in their 
workplace, but the new survey broadened the question and revealed 
nearly twice as many using computers at home, at work or elsewhere.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar rose today against most other  
major currencies in European trading. Gold prices also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 119.59 Japanese yen from 118.90 yen late  
Thursday, and was higher against the euro, the currency of 11 
European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell to $1.0584 by late in the day in Europe from  
$1.0597 late Thursday. It briefly traded at a new intraday low of 
$1.0555 before recovering. The previous intraday low was $1.0561 on 
April 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates compared with late Thursday included 1.5230  
Swiss francs, up from 1.5168, and 1.4583 Canadian dollars, down 
from 1.4663. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6105, down from $1.6114.

	SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who suffocated her newborn son in a  
plastic bag was sentenced to 21 years in prison after pleading no 
contest to second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence, handed down Thursday to Jannifer Butler, 27,  
includes no possibility of parole. Prosecutors sought to keep Ms. 
Butler jailed until after her childbearing years, Assistant State 
Attorney Gino Feliciani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Butler had zipped her newborn baby into a  
plastic comforter bag and hid him in a closet after giving birth on 
Christmas Day 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	They said she concealed her pregnancy before and after giving  
birth because she said her family was having money problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Ms. Butler after  
she pleaded innocent by reason of insanity to first-degree murder. 
Her no-contest plea to a lesser charge averted a trial scheduled 
for next week.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen and Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the  
euro today as another round of positive U.S. economic data 
overwhelmed the foreign exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, the common currency of 11 European nations, fell to  
yet another low as the data were released. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of a U.S. story,'' even overtaking the continued  
conflict in Kosovo that has undermined the euro, said Jay Bryson, 
an international economist at First Union Capital Markets in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.40  
Japanese yen, up from 119.03 yen late Thursday. The euro fell 
against the dollar, trading at $1.0582, down from $1.0591. During 
the trading day, the euro fell to $1.0550, its lowest point since 
its January launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders liked U.S. economic data released Friday and used it to  
push the dollar higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product  
grew 4.5 percent in the first three months of the year, greater 
than the 3.9 percent growth for all of 1998. Inflation was a 
no-show. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's fall was halted, however, by traders' fears caused by  
previous comments by European officials. The head of the German 
central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, made remarks Thursday indicating that 
the European Central Bank could well intervene to prop up the euro 
if necessary, Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen was weakened Friday by fresh negative economic data,  
with Japan's jobless rate rising and wages falling. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5243 Swiss francs, up from 1.5202,  
and 1.4587 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4665 late Thursday. The 
British pound was quoted at $1.6090, up from $1.6088. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8484 German 
marks, up from 1.8467; 6.1996 French francs, up from 6.1920; and 
1,828.15 Italian lire, unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Harassment Suit Against Coach Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge has transfered a $12  
million lawsuit accusing the University of North Carolina women's 
soccer coach of sexual harassment and misconduct to Greensboro from 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former players filed the lawsuit against Anson Dorrance  
eight months ago. Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Ann Claire 
Williams of suburban Chicago agreed to transfer the lawsuit, but 
denied a dismissal motion by UNC attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	In successfully arguing for the case's transfer, UNC lawyers  
said it would be expensive and time-consuming for attorneys and 
witnesses to have to travel regularly to suburban Chicago, the home 
of plaintiffs Debbie Keller and Melissa Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said the case belongs in North Carolina since ``almost  
all of the critical events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred in 
North Carolina'' and all the defendants live here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll go where we have to go,'' said Marcy DeFalco, an  
attorney for Keller and Jennings. ``The court could have dismissed 
our case entirely. We still feel that we have a strong case, 
regardless of whether it's in Illinois or North Carolina.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reporters for Newsweek and The Washington Post  
won journalism prizes for writing about President Clinton and the 
Monica Lewinsky affair, while a reporter for Knight Ridder was 
recognized for a story about Clinton's trip to Africa last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards will be presented Saturday night at the 85th annual  
dinner of the White House Correspondents' Association. Clinton's 
attendance at the dinner was in doubt for a while, supposedly 
because of White House irritation at the prospect of the president 
having to shake hands with Newsweek's Michael Isikoff, who is 
credited with breaking the Lewinsky story. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton now plans to attend, but he is expected to arrive after  
the presentation of the awards. ``The president will get there when 
he gets there,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Isikoff won the Edgar A. Poe award for his coverage of the  
Lewinsky scandal. In addition, John Harris of The Washington Post 
won the Aldo Beckman award for a full range of presidential 
coverage, and Jodi Enda of Knight Ridder won the Merriman Smith 
award for presidential writing under deadline pressure, for her 
reporting from Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bill Lambrecht of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch won  
the Raymond Clapper Memorial Award for a series of articles 
examining the worldwide use of genetically engineered crops. Lee 
Davidson of the Deseret News in Salt Lake City won second place for 
a series on the results of a 1990 law designed to compensate cancer 
victims of atomic testing.

<HEADLINE> Source of Columbine Handgun Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators are interviewing a man who  
may have sold the semiautomatic pistol used by the Columbine High 
School gunmen, but authorities said Thursday no arrests are 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas said  
early in the day that the gun seller would be arrested ``in a day 
or two'' after negotiating the terms of his surrender, other 
investigators later backed away from that statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime laboratory technicians are conducting ballistics tests to  
determine which guns fired the ammunition that killed each of the 
13 victims. If it turns out that bullets fired by the 
paramilitary-style TEC DC-9 did not hit anyone, the gun seller may 
only face charges of illegal gun peddling rather than being 
implicated in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that we'll have some news soon,'' prosecutor Mark  
Pautler said. ``As far as arrests, as far as charges, we're still 
up in the air with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, police arrested a hardware store employee who they  
say made up a story that he saw gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold buy propane tanks, wire, screws, nails and duct tape -- 
material believed used in the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sowell, 50, was charged with making a false report to  
authorities, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pautler said other people are being interviewed as well, but he  
described them as witnesses, not suspects. He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a good idea to let people know ahead of time that we  
are going to arrest them,'' he said. ``They have a tendency to 
disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  
and Firearms visited the Blackjack Pizza shop, where the gunmen 
worked. The agents were investigating whether a pizza deliveryman 
acted as a middleman between the students and the gun seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF and the pizza shop managers declined to discuss the  
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, killed 12 students and  
a teacher before committing suicide in one of the worst school 
shootings in U.S. history. Another 23 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	A diary found at the home of one of the gunmen indicated the  
plot had been devised for a year and they planned to kill hundreds 
with an arsenal of guns and bombs. Investigators have found more 
than 50 propane and pipe bombs at the school and the teens' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The final Columbine victim to be buried, Isaiah Shoels, 18, was  
remembered Thursday at a spirited funeral in Denver that drew more 
than 5,000 mourners, including Gov. Bill Owens and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, investigators said Klebold's prom date, Robyn  
Anderson, 18, bought three of the four weapons -- two rifles and a 
shotgun -- used in the massacre. Under Colorado law, an 18-year old 
without a felony record can legally furnish minors with rifles and 
shotguns, which are classified as long guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Klebold's family said Thursday they had been  
the target of threats, which have been reported to authorities. 
``They are cooperating fully with the investigation,'' said Lisa 
Simon, the Klebolds' spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Tributes to the victims continue.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose Sharks hockey team brought a 50-foot banner  
inscribed with messages from players and fans to Denver, where they 
have a playoff game against the Colorado Avalanche on Friday night. 
The first two games in the series were postponed because of the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Jefferson County school district is holding an  
afternoon get-together at scenic Red Rocks Amphitheater for 
students and their families, teachers and public safety workers. 
Classes resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Poland of the National Association of School Psychologists  
said children affected by the shootings may feel afraid and 
hopeless, and experience night terrors, for an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time for parents to talk less and listen more,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Rio's Celebrated Beaches Fouled Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- If the girl from Ipanema walked to  
the beach these days she'd likely turn around and walk right back, 
holding her nose. 
</P>
<P>
	With a major sewer line under repair, the city is dumping tons  
of raw sewage into the ocean along Rio's most fashionable beaches, 
creating a foul-smelling brown stain that's a nightmare for a city 
that thrives on tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists riding the cable car up the famed Sugarloaf Mountain  
can see the fetid sewage discharging at the mountain's base as it 
spreads into the sea towards Copacabana beach. A few miles down the 
coast, another pipe poking out of a hillside of coconut and banana 
trees spews a torrent of dark water into the surf below, sending an 
evil-smelling cloud past the beach-front hotels toward fashionable 
Ipanema and Leblon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hit us coming in. The smell was just awful,'' said Gregory  
Tennyson of Diamond Bar, Calif, gazing out the huge picture window 
of his luxury hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a room with a nice view of the ocean, but we changed it  
for one in the back,'' he said. ``This is our first time in Rio, 
and probably our last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was created by the decrepit sewage pipe that carries  
untreated waste from the city's residential South Zone and dumps it 
far out at sea. In January, a pillar supporting the pipe collapsed, 
and an inspection showed that others were about to give way. The 
state water utility, CEDAE, built four new pillars, but a 165-foot 
section of pipe had to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The government oil company Petrobras, experts at offshore  
drilling, supplied a barge and divers to work on the pipe, buried 
in silt under 80 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	But while they work, three tons of sewage per second spews onto  
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Samples of sea water near Ipanema register a pollution level of  
up to 16,000 fecal coliform bacteria per 100 milliliters of water -- 
16 times the accepted level and a risk for dysentery or other 
stomach ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Rio's beaches have been closed to bathers. Signs along  
the shore show a thumb pointing down and the warning ``Not safe for 
swimming'' in English and Portuguese. On fashionable Leblon beach, 
public toilets backed up Friday, spewing raw sewage over the mosaic 
sidewalks into the bike path. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers from FEEMA, the state environmental agency, patrol the  
shore, chasing anyone who strays too near the water and handing out 
leaflets to explain the danger. Swimming is considered safe only 
beyond Barra da Tijuca, about 15 miles down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	But barring an occasional surfer, the regular beachgoers have  
all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually we get lots of business, but now it's empty all day.  
We hardly see a tourist,'' said Alberto Henrique dos Santos, an 
attendant at one of the food and drinks kiosks lining Ipanema 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	At a small fishing colony in Copacabana, fishermen complained  
that no one was buying. Consumers are afraid of contamination, even 
though the fish come from outside the polluted area. 
</P>
<P>
	Repairs should be finished by next week, weather permitting,  
according to CEDAE. Then, it will be another two weeks before the 
water is clean enough for swimming, FEEMA says. 
</P>
<P>
	No long-term environmental damage is expected because the  
pollutants are organic material that decomposes quickly, said Paulo 
Cesar Rosman, a professor of oceanographic engineering at the 
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it takes more than pollution to scare away some visitors.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we saw all the garbage,'' said Angel Melendez, a tourist  
from New York. ``We thought it was normal.''

<HEADLINE> Jagr's Status Uncertain for Game 5 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr's questionable playing  
status is having one positive side effect for the Pittsburgh 
Penguins: It's kept the New Jersey Devils guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	After practicing for an hour Thursday, the Devils spent most of  
the next hour talking about Jagr, his three-game absence because of 
a groin injury and the need to hit the NHL's leading scorer should 
he play in Game 5 of the best-of-7 first-round series that is tied 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, however, Jagr's expected return tonight at the  
Continental Airlines Arena suddenly was a little more iffy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr didn't look good skating during the Penguins' practice in  
Pittsburgh on Thursday, sparking speculation the groin injury that 
sidelined him after Game 1 was still bothersome. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old winger left practice after about 15 minutes and  
went to the locker room, where he rode a stationary bike. The media 
waited an hour to talk with him, but he walked by without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 24 hours earlier, Jagr said his condition had improved and  
he expected to play, even though he would not be at 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hearing a lot about Jagr, but we have to focus on what  
we do,'' Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ``There is a reason we 
came in first place. Without putting any extra pressure on 
ourselves, we have to play the way the New Jersey Devils can play. 
Hopefully, the Penguins are a little worried about us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr's return seemed more certain after the Devils evened the  
series with a 4-2 win at Pittsburgh on Tuesday night. It was New 
Jersey's best game of the series, and the return of Jagr was seen 
as a boost the Penguins' needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision probably wouldn't be made until just before the  
game. Jagir did not take part in the morning skate-around, staying 
behind in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is he won't play,'' said Penguins coach Kevin  
Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jagr does play, the Devils plan to hit him every chance they  
get, within reason. That's playoff hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Devils captain Scott Stevens expects Jagr to play.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to finish our checks, but the bottom line is we want  
to play our game like the other night,'' Stevens said. ``If Jagr's 
back, that's fine. Yes, he's the player we have to watch, but we 
have to play the same way we did the last game. We have to play a 
convincing game, in people's faces, and make it uncomfortable for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine needs a better effort from his team, with or without  
Jagr, who had 127 points in winning his second straight scoring 
title and third in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extra day off gives us some rest, but I don't think we  
want to get the taste out of our mouths from the last game,'' 
Constantine said. ``We didn't play great, and hopefully that's a 
motivator for us to play better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have a 2-1 record without Jagr in the series. The  
key in the two wins has been their defense. The Devils have 
struggled to get odd-man rushes and Tom Barrasso has played well, 
allowing nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
	That's made for a closer series than anyone expected. The Devils  
were the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the third straight 
year, while Pittsburgh slipped to the eighth seed after struggling 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not going to give us anything,'' Devils goaltender  
Martin Brodeur said. ``Sometimes when you come in as the first seed 
and you play the eighth seed, you feel you are going to get the 
chance to win. But these guys won't beat themselves. We are going 
to have to beat them and that's what's surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series will return to Pittsburgh on Sunday for Game 6. If a  
deciding game is necessary, it will be played here on Tuesday 
night.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The author of the Chernobyl computer virus  
told investigators that he created the bug hoping to humiliate and 
take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software 
providers, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted he didn't expect it to cause worldwide damage, a  
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen Ing-hau, 24, looked nervous and was speechless when he was  
mobbed by reporters after being summoned for police questioning on 
his involvement in a case that caused at least 600,000 computer 
meltdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chernobyl virus -- known in Taiwan as the CIH, for Chen's  
initials -- had even pressed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to 
study antivirus programs to prevent it from invading its computers, 
the police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of  
computer engineering at the Institute of Technology. Chen has since 
graduated and has been undergoing Taiwan's mandatory two-year 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen had spent long hours playing computer games since entering  
college and was a frequent victim of computer viruses when 
downloading video games and other software from the Internet, the 
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he created the highly vicious virus that could avoid  
detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool 
of the software providers, from whom he had bought antivirus 
programs that proved useless,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact. He  
regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26,  
the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to 
erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system 
settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Taiwanese law, someone convicted of spreading computer  
viruses can face up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say whether Chen will be charged. Computer  
experts said Chen might not be charged because he did not intend to 
spread the virus. But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking 
millions of dollars of damage compensation.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Oppose Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few of the Republican presidential contenders  
see a need for new gun control legislation in the wake of high 
school shootings in Colorado. Instead, they're urging enforcement 
of existing laws and scrutiny of a violence-tinged popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole favors child safety locks for firearms ``whether  
voluntary or through federal legislation,'' according to her 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The front-runner for the nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
expressed support for legislation to extend the requirement for 
instant background checks to purchases made at gun shows. But he 
did so only after a bill to that effect died in committee in the 
state legislature, and sponsors said they had detected no effort on 
his part to win passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the others seeking the nomination said no further  
legislation is needed, and none reacted more vehemently that Pat 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those brutal and nihilistic killers in Colorado violated 19  
federal and state gun and explosive laws,'' he said in a written 
statement. ``To suggest that passage of a 20th or 21st or 22nd 
might have prevented this atrocity is delusional and demagogic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, in a television interview  
shortly after the shootings, also turned aside a question about new 
legislation. ``So I hope we don't try to use this as an excuse to 
go and take away guns. Let's focus on the behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes said that ``in terms of guns, I think we need to  
enforce laws that are on the books.'' He said the shootings 
``underscore the need to be teaching our children morals and values 
obviously at home, but particularly in the schools now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week after the shootings, President Clinton proposed new  
legislation to curb the availability of guns, particularly to 
juveniles. Although no bill has yet been sent to Congress, 
Democrats in both houses are expected to push for a vote later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Iowa this week, called  
for tighter controls on guns as well as reduced violence in the 
popular culture. His only rival for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, Bill Bradley, voted for gun control legislation while 
in Congress. ``Better gun control measures need to be a part of an 
overall response to what happened,'' said his spokesman, Eric 
Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who receive handsome contributions from the  
National Rifle Association, traditionally have opposed gun 
legislation. Perhaps as a result, the issue customarily plays 
little if any role in contests for the GOP presidential nomination, 
but is more likely to arise during a general election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bush and Mrs. Dole -- who departed cautiously  
from party orthodoxy on abortion earlier this year -- have indicated 
support for gun control measures in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's belated support for the proposed Texas law extending  
background checks to gun show purchases stirred controversy there. 
</P>
<P>
	But Karen Hughes, an aide to Bush, said the governor has  
``consistently supported since 1994 the idea of instant background 
checks at gun shows to make sure the people we don't want to sell 
guns to are not buying guns.'' She noted that Bush previously 
signed legislation prohibiting anyone from carrying a weapon within 
300 yards of a school, and holding adults criminally liable if they 
allow a juvenile access to a loaded gun. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she wasn't aware of any position Bush had taken on  
calls for child safety locks on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ari Fleisher, a spokesman for Mrs. Dole, said the former Red  
Cross president supports a gun lock proposal. ``She is for child 
safety locks whether voluntary or through federal legislation. She 
supports child safety locks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also joined the ranks of Republicans suggesting a look  
at the impact of current culture on behavior. ``While we can never 
have censorship, corporate America in Hollywood, TV, the makers of 
video games, have a responsibility to remember the community to 
think about the message they put out,'' Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other GOP candidates made similar points, although they,  
unlike Mrs. Dole, said they saw no need for additional legislation 
to control guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people believe this can be fixed by passing a  
handful of laws,'' said Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who voted for a 
ban on assault-style weapons that cleared Congress in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though people in the polls have a visceral reaction  
against guns, they don't think that new laws will fix this.... They 
know this thing has to be solved from within families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona was one of four lawmakers who wrote  
Clinton after the shootings to call for a close look at ``the 
entertainment media and the violent images and message with which 
they are bombarding our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer said that rather than approve new legislation,  
``political leaders can use their moral authority to shame the 
people that are making a lot of money in the popular culture by 
serving up Marilyn Manson and death games and very explicit and 
gory murders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued shortly after the shootings, Lamar  
Alexander said, ``This will not be stopped by more laws coming out 
of Washington.''

<HEADLINE> Gambling Industry Releases Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study paid for by the gambling industry  
finds little evidence that the spread of casinos contributes 
significantly to white-collar crimes like embezzlement, forgery and 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The study counters one popular criticism of gambling -- that the  
proliferation of casinos encourages compulsive gamblers to steal 
and cheat to support their habit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arguments for and against casino gambling have often relied on  
anecdotal accounts to make their case, but they are not a 
sufficient basis for public policy decisions that affect thousands 
and perhaps millions of people,'' says the report by Jay S. 
Albanese, an author whose books include ``White Collar Crime in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not address such crimes as armed robbery or theft.  
</P>
<P>
	Albanese, chairman of the criminal justice department at  
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, was presenting his 
study Friday at a gambling conference in Omaha, Neb. The study was 
paid for by the American Gaming Association, which represents 
commercial casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanese reviewed FBI crime data for nine large casino markets:  
Las Vegas; Atlantic City; Tunica, Vicksburg and Biloxi-Gulfport in 
Mississippi; Kansas City and St. Louis in Missouri; and Lake 
Charles and Shreveport in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1988 and 1996, he found, embezzlement arrests increased  
in four of the markets, declined in three and remained the same in 
three. Forgery arrests went up in Biloxi-Gulfport but down in the 
eight other markets, and fraud arrests increased in five markets 
and declined in four. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanese concluded that ``there have been more net decreases  
over time than there have been increases in arrests for 
embezzlement, forgery and fraud among the largest casino 
jurisdictions.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Spares Dogs, Banishes Them </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Two dogs sentenced to death for causing an  
ostrich stampede that left 12 birds dead and another dozen missing 
were spared when a judge banished them from the state instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikita, a Siberian husky, and Max, a Doberman pinscher, were  
ordered put to death last month under a law dealing with dogs that 
chase, injure or kill livestock or poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	The dogs' owner, Gina Park, appealed the order, and Judge  
Stanley P. Klein on Thursday imposed a lesser penalty because the 
dogs peacefully followed animal control officers' commands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were perpetually vicious, the last thing that would  
happen is they would surrender,'' Klein said. ``I don't believe 
that the dogs have forfeited their right to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klein banished the dogs from Virginia and bordering states.  
</P>
<P>
	A weeping Ms. Park declined to comment after the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Fouche, the ostrich breeder, said the ruling was fine.  
``As long as they're going to be kept from doing it again,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Angry Drivers Boycott Gas Pumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On the day that cyberspace activists called for a nationwide gas  
boycott, Erika Litchfield was filling up her Land Rover at a 
Chevron Station, where the truck swallowed up a hefty $30 in fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no choice. I'm stuck with this,'' she said at a station  
in San Francisco's tony Pacific Heights, where classical music 
filters through speakers at the pump. ``It's awful, isn't it? Trust 
me, if I had a choice I'd boycott.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choice or not, it seemed as if many motorists ignored the  
Internet campaign calling for a one-day ``Gas Out'' in protest of 
escalating fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey said late Friday afternoon that  
the ``Gas Out'' had ``virtually no impact'' on business at its 
8,000 stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the message has been that consumers are frustrated by  
the sudden rise in prices and think it isn't warranted and we hear 
that,'' Libbey said. However, he said Chevron has no plans to lower 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Global agreements to cut oil production has sent the price of  
gas skyrocketing more than 20 percent in recent weeks. Explosions 
and problems at refineries in California contributed to an 
especially sharp spike in prices there, prompting an investigation 
by California's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide  
showed the average prices at self-service stations was $1.17 per 
gallon for regular gasoline, $1.27 for mid-grade and $1.36 for 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price in California for unleaded regular, self-serve  
gasoline is up 42 cents from last month, to $1.64 per gallon, the 
American Automobile Association said. Selected markets in 
California, however, report prices of more than $2 a gallon for 
premium grades. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the ``Gas Out'' originated in an e-mail message, it was  
tough to tell exactly who promoted it and how widespread it was, 
though reports Friday suggested it was concentrated in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of a Shell station in Vancouver, Wash., who supported  
the boycott said she ``definitely'' noticed a drop in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not long enough. If they did it from Friday to Monday, it  
would definitely have an effect,'' said Karen Rock. ``But they 
can't do it. People aren't willing to walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Hedgecock, a radio talk show host and former San Diego  
mayor who has led ``Buy No Gas Fridays'' in the city for the past 
month, said he plans to continue the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not just here today,'' he said as he and 30 listeners  
protested outside a Chevron station to the supportive honking of 
passing drivers. ``We're going to do this every Friday until the 
prices come down in line with the national average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Lambert, a new sport utility vehicle owner in Newark,  
Calif., said he urged six friends to join him in a daylong boycott 
in an e-mail message a month ago. Within days, he said, others 
rallied to the cause and forwarded e-mails of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time we did something about the price of gasoline in  
America! ... Let's have a GAS OUT!'' read one message that showed 
up in computers in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross Relles, the owner of a Sacramento, Calif., Chevron station  
charging $2.07 for full service premium, complained that business 
Friday was down by as much as 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is promoting this idiotic day, all it's hurting is the  
small retailers like me,'' Relles said. ``We should be absolutely 
swamped because it's not only Friday but it's pay day.''

<HEADLINE> Volvo Increases Share in Scania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo announced Friday that it has  
increased its stake in rival Swedish truck- and bus-maker Scania to 
about 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo surprised the business community in January with the  
announcement that it had bought 13 percent of the shares in Scania 
and that it was seeking to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	But talks between Volvo and the Investor holding company, which  
holds 45 percent of the shares in Scania, broke down this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo in January sold its small but prestigious passenger car  
division to Ford Motor Co. for 50 billion kronor ($6.45 billion), 
saying it wanted to concentrate on its other business areas 
including trucks, buses, heavy equipment, and marine and 
aeronautical engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The seller of the latest Scania shares was not disclosed. The  
purchase, which includes call options, will give Volvo 15.6 percent 
of the share capital and 15.1 percent of the voting rights once the 
options are exercised, Volvo said.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Police Monitored Eric Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Police began keeping an eye on Columbine  
High School gunman Eric Harris a year ago after learning he 
threatened to kill a schoolmate and others, and often talked about 
making and blowing up pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	But aside from watching Harris, sheriff's deputies said there  
was little else they could do because the parents who tipped police 
off to the threatening behavior wanted to remain anonymous. They 
also found no evidence of lawbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the ability to speak to a victim or positively  
identify a suspect, elements of a crime could not be established,'' 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students returned to school on Friday for the first  
since the April 20 attack. Many students reported to nearby 
Chatfield High for orientation before classes resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been without seeing my friends for almost two weeks and  
the only goodbye was, `Run!'' said Jennifer Despain, a 16-year-old 
sophomore. ``I really want to get back and see my teachers and hold 
a pencil in my hand and do math equations or something. Something 
that's not funerals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are still seeking evidence as to whether others  
helped Harris and Dylan Klebold plot their assault. The gunmen 
killed 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	About a year before the assault, Neil Gardner, the sheriff's  
deputy stationed at Columbine, received a ``suspicious incident'' 
report that Harris' Web site discussed detonating pipe bombs and 
committing mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 1998 report came from Randy Brown, who claimed his  
18-year-old son Brooks had been repeatedly threatened by Harris, a 
schoolmate. Brown gave the sheriff's office printouts of Harris' 
Web site warnings, which included threats to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	``God, I can't wait until I can kill you people'' read one of  
the postings. ``I'll just go to some downtown area in some big 
(expletive) city and blow up and shoot everything I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Browns refused to let their son's name be used  
in the investigation, and they also declined to file a formal 
complaint that would have allowed investigators to directly 
question Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	A threatening e-mail sent to Brooks Brown was deleted, so  
investigators were not able to follow up that lead. And detectives 
tried but could not find Harris' Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to the Browns' home went unanswered Friday, but the  
Browns told NBC News that the sheriff's department response 
``ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping they would go to the school. We were hoping  
they would go to the parents,'' Judy Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner was at Columbine when Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17,  
attacked the school with bombs and assault weapons, and exchanged 
fire with one of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's department said Gardner had been keeping an eye on  
Harris at school, observing his actions and noting his associates. 
But, without proof of a chargeable offense, there was nothing he 
could do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the information available at the time, reasonable  
action was taken with all reports received by the Brown family,'' 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown eventually made peace with Harris, and ran into him the  
day of the shooting as he was walking out of the high school to 
smoke a cigarette. An approaching Harris warned him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he was not surprised at the violent rampage.  
</P>
<P>
	``He did it because he hated people,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investigators are negotiating with the lawyers of the  
parents of the gunmen over the terms of a police interview. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the only person arrested in the attack is a hardware  
store clerk accused of concocting a story about selling the gunmen 
material used in their bombs. Others have been questioned, but 
prosecutors declined to label them as suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun dealer Larry Russell told the Denver Rocky Mountain News  
that he sold the semiautomatic pistol used in the shootings to an 
unidentified adult last year. He said the TEC DC-9 was one of 
several he bought from a gun dealer in a closeout sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said he sold the gun at a gun show in Denver last year.  
But he didn't keep a record of the sale and isn't sure when he sold 
it, or who bought it. He said he is sure the buyer was not a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said he has seen pictures of gunmen Harris and Klebold,  
and did not recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, authorities arrested a 34-year-old woman accused of  
calling in a phony bomb threat that briefly forced the evacuation 
of a high school. On Thursday, deputies arrested a hardware store 
clerk whose claims of selling bomb materials to Harris and Klebold 
proved unfounded.

<HEADLINE> Bus Carrying Deaf Children Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAIDWOOD, Ill. (AP) -- A bus carrying deaf children to a  
spelling bee flipped over on a highway Friday, killing a father. 
</P>
<P>
	Four adults were seriously hurt in the crash. None of the 16  
children aboard suffered major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the bus swerved across the median into oncoming  
traffic about 50 miles southwest of Chicago, clipped a car and 
flipped over. The car's driver was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they did not know why the bus driver lost  
control. Police Master Sgt. Ty Simmons said it is possible she may 
have fallen asleep. Witnesses said the bus was moving at high 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
	No citations had been issued.  
</P>
<P>
	The children from the John Powers Center in Vernon Hills, a  
suburb, were en route to the State of Illinois Deaf Spelling Bee in 
East Peoria. The event was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The one fatality was a father of a girl on the bus. Another man  
who was thrown from the bus and pinned underneath was in critical 
condition and three women were listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The charter bus driver, Renee Rand, had a permit to drive school  
buses, but it was suspended in 1995 after she received two tickets 
within a year for speeding, according to Anne Dybek, a spokeswoman 
for the secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rand reapplied for her school bus permit in April 1996 but was  
rejected because she failed fingerprint checks aimed at weeding out 
people with criminal convictions, said Dybek. She did not know what 
caused Rand to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Rand most recently was cited for driving without insurance.  
Dybek said Rand's driving privileges were scheduled to be suspended 
starting July 17, unless she provided proof that she has insurance.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Extend Stewart's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Quarterback Kordell Stewart has agreed to a  
deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers that will take him at least 
through the 2003 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not available, and the team will make no official  
announcement until Stewart's agent, Leigh Steinberg, returns from 
vacation in 10 days, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials were not immediately available for comment, but  
Stewart's new contract was filed with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension will keep Stewart with the Steelers for at least  
five more years. He had been under contract for two more seasons 
under a 1997 extension; that was his first as a starting 
quarterback for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to earn $2.05 million next season and $2.5  
million in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Onion Book 1st on Best-Seller List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Remember the immortal headlines? ``Zapruder  
Family Wowed At Home Movie Screening.'' ``Nancy Reagan Ends 
Nation's Drug Problem With Very Special `Diff'rent Strokes' 
Appearance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not. But hundreds of thousands of book buyers are seeing  
them now in the skewed story of the 20th century according to The 
Onion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Dumb History,'' the Madison-based parody newspaper's  
``retrospective'' book, was released less than a month ago. On 
Sunday, it will be at the top of The New York Times' paperback 
nonfiction best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty amazing,'' Rob Siegel, The Onion's senior editor,  
said of the book's success. ``We didn't expect it, but we have a 
pretty solid, devoted, sizable underground fan base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book contains front page headlines and stories, putatively  
from old issues of The Onion, documenting historical events from 
1900 to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	All are written and designed by staff members of the satirical  
paper, which is actually only 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	A story dated Nov. 9, 1960, on John F. Kennedy's election to the  
White House calls him ``our nation's first handsome president'' and 
cites experts who noted that previous chief executives were 
``mildly attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The paper is a pretty big task to do every week,'' Siegel  
said. ``We spent basically two full years working round the clock, 
putting out the paper and the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly paper started in Madison and now has offices in  
Chicago, Denver and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	It features irreverent, off-the-wall headlines such as ``Soul  
Train Derails New Snacks'' and ``Social Security System Overhauled 
to Provide Early-Death Incentives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, there are serious movie and music reviews.  
</P>
<P>
	About 500,000 people read The Onion online at its Web site --  
www.theonion.com -- every week, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Onion has a deal to do a second book -- a compilation of  
material from the newspaper -- for Crown Publishers, a division of 
Random House that published ``Our Dumb Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A television special for NBC on ``Our Dumb Century'' also is in  
the works, Siegel said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Teen's Confession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge acquitted a 16-year-old boy who had  
confessed to stabbing to death a woman who, according to the 
coroner, had not been stabbed at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County Judge Thomas Sumner said Thursday that no physical  
evidence tied the suspect, Eddie Huggins, to the slaying of 
Lorraine Gates, 26, in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins, who was charged as an adult with murder, has been in  
custody for more than a year. Though he gave a confession to 
police, Huggins says he didn't kill her and claims he signed the 
confession only after threats and hours of questioning by police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumner -- who heard the case without a jury -- suggested law  
enforcement authorities lost sight of their duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes in this system -- in this process we have which is  
presumed to ferret out the truth -- the truth gets obscured in the 
process of winning and losing,'' the judge said in announcing his 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lary Simms, a former assistant Cook County medical examiner,  
testified that police knew within hours of Huggins' arrest that an 
autopsy showed Ms. Gates had died from blunt trauma and 
strangulation, not stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins' attorneys called the case a travesty of justice and  
called for a special prosecutor to investigate police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put the words in his mouth that he stabbed her repeatedly  
and tussled about the apartment,'' said lawyer R. Eugene Pincham, a 
former appellate judge. ``But they didn't get the script right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors Caren Armbrust, Bernard Murray and Dan Fahlgren had  
no comment after the verdict. Bob Benjamin, spokesman for Cook 
County State's Attorney Dick Devine, said there was no reason to 
investigate police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Huggins after a 17-year-old acquaintance, who  
was arrested on another charge, said Huggins told him that he 
killed a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	But no physical evidence and no eyewitnesses link Huggins to the  
crime. DNA tests showed the victim's and someone else's blood on a 
jacket taken from the 17-year-old who implicated Huggins. Tests 
showed it wasn't Huggins' blood. Tests also excluded Huggins as the 
source of semen recovered from Ms. Gates' body. The 17-year-old's 
DNA has not been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Local authorities are already under fire for a case last year in  
which two boys, ages 7 and 8, were charged with first degree murder 
in the July slaying of 11-year-old honor student Ryan Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boys were arrested after six hours of questioning by  
detectives, who said the two confessed to killing Ryan because they 
wanted her new bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against the boys were dropped in September after crime  
lab tests found semen in Ryan's clothing. A 30-year-old man was 
eventually charged.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Voting on New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Members of the WNBA players union were voting  
today on whether to approve a new four-year collective bargaining 
agreement that would pave the way for the start of the league's 
third season. 
</P>
<P>
	``About half the ballots are in and there's been an overwhelming  
response in one direction, but I can't say which way,'' union 
executive director Pam Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority is required for approval.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still optimistic about the agreement being ratified,''  
Wheeler said Friday. ``I don't know when we'll have all the 
ballots. Hopefully, we'll have them by the end of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final result of the voting might not be revealed until  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The players association and the league reached a deal after a  
four-hour meeting Thursday -- a week after an apparent accord fell 
apart when each side accused the other of trying to change terms at 
the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	That forced the league to postpone its player draft, scheduled  
for last Tuesday, for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract, if approved, would set a salary scale for draft  
picks of $50,000 for the first four players chosen, $44,000 for the 
fifth through eighth players and $37,500 for the rest of the 
players chosen in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-round picks would get $30,000, third-round $27,000 and  
fourth-round picks would earn the rookie minimum of $25,000. The 
deal includes increases of five percent per year in those scales. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosters can include three players from the folded ABL, except  
for the expansion Orlando and Minnesota franchises, which will be 
permitted five former ABL players each. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has a reopener clause after three years, and both sides  
agreed to no-lockout, no-strike clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	Players will receive a guaranteed percentage of all royalties  
from the sale of player-identified licensed products with a minimum 
payment of $100,000 to be made each year to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also includes provisions for a 401K plan,  
year-round health and dental insurances and paid maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Players also will be allowed to participate in up to two  
not-for-profit, charitable events.

<HEADLINE> PEZ-Heads Making Sweet Pilgrimage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE, Conn. (AP) -- The sugar in the air. The flip-top  
dispensers. The tart rectangular candies. This, undoubtedly, is PEZ 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	You don't have to tell the PEZ-heads. Hundreds of people who  
love the candy and the colorful, collectible dispensers it comes in 
are flocking here from as far away as Austria and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother ship, in this case, is PEZ Candy Inc. And the  
occasion is this weekend's first-ever gathering of PEZ aficionados 
in the town where the treats are manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll be all over the lawn with telephoto lenses. They'll be  
with their noses up against the back window,'' said Scott 
McWhinnie, the ``Pezident'' of PEZ Candy. ``They'll be picking 
through the garbage looking for old dispensers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Convention organizer Richard Belyski said PEZ-heads are mostly  
baby boomers trying to relive their childhood. ``Everybody 
remembers them as a kid. We're people from all walks of life, 
doctors, lawyers,'' said Belyski, 41, a police officer in Glen 
Cove, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	PEZ lovers will tell you their favorite treat is not just a  
hard, fruit-flavored candy. It's an American icon that spans 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the mystique focuses on the different character  
dispensers, from Mickey Mouse to Fred Flintstone and Spiderman to 
Kermit the Frog. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of his brethren, Johann Patek, 42, who flew in from  
Vienna, Austria, for the convention, has so many dispensers he has 
lost count. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. I cannot explain,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	John Laspina, 45, of Middletown, N.J., admits he has spent $850  
or more for a single dispenser -- the ``psychedelic eye'' created in 
the '60s. He has five of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a kid, between Sunday school and church, I used to  
run to fill up my PEZ,'' said Laspina, a faraway look in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	David Welch, 37, of Murphysboro, Ill., also had his first  
experience with PEZ as a child and has since become an authority, 
having written two books, ``Pictorial Guide to Plastic Candy 
Dispensers'' and the seminal ``Collecting PEZ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He specializes in historical dispensers. The originals look like  
cigarette lighters, which is fitting, since Austrian Eduard Haas 
invented PEZ in 1927 as a mint for smokers. The name was derived 
from the German word for peppermint, pfefferminz. 
</P>
<P>
	PEZ didn't arrive in America until 1952. About 3 billion are  
consumed annually in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-PEZ pack has 35 calories and no nutritional value  
whatsoever, but McWhinnie insisted there are candies that are worse 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a lot of dental problems with PEZ,'' he said.  
``PEZ don't stick to your teeth. They dissolve.''

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Rises, Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen in Tokyo today  
despite an indication from a top Japanese economic official that 
the government may consider new stimulus steps. The Tokyo stock 
market's main index lost 1.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.58 yen at late afternoon, up 0.50 yen from  
its level of 119.08 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its 
overnight New York level of 119.03 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 240.71 points,  
or 1.42 percent, closing the week at 16,701.53 points. The Nikkei 
dropped 15.03 points, or 0.09 percent, Wednesday. Tokyo financial 
markets were closed Thursday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar advanced as interbank dealers bought the U.S.  
currency despite remarks by Japan's Economic Planning Agency chief, 
Taichi Sakaiya, who said in Washington late Thursday that Japan 
would mull measures to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya, speaking after meeting with U.S. Deputy Treasury  
Secretary Lawrence Summers, denied that the government was 
considering a supplementary budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sakaiya's comment may suggest there was a progress toward new  
fiscal steps for the economy. But his words are a bit too vague to 
sell off dollars on,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant manager of 
foreign exchange at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors were waiting for the outcome of the summit  
between Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
in Washington on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some signs of improvement, Japan's economy remains weak  
as the country struggles to bail out of its worst recession in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 118.95 yen and 119.68 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 126.86 yen, down  
from 127.22 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Japanese technology shares dropped in line  
with the decline of similar shares overnight in New York. Also 
dampening the Tokyo market was Sony Corp.'s recent announcement of 
falling profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment among investors turned bearish quickly today following  
the release of fresh data on the state of Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony said Wednesday that its net income plunged nearly 20  
percent in the fiscal year ending March 31 because of recession at 
home and abroad. Sony stock closed today's trading at $93.70, down 
$4.60 from Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's jobless rate  
climbed to a record high 4.8 percent in March as corporate 
restructuring efforts forced more people out of work. The previous 
record was 4.6 percent, registered in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the agency said spending by Japanese wage earners  
last month fell 3.6 percent from the year-earlier month in real 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 535  
million shares, down from Wednesday's turnover of 677 million 
shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 646 to 512, with 163 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 10.52 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,337.12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.405 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.465 
percent, pushing its price up to 103.49 yen from 102.94 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan will be closed Monday through  
Wednesday because of national holidays. The markets will reopen on 
Thursday.

$4.60 from Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's jobless rate  
climbed to a record high 4.8 percent in March as corporate 
restructuring efforts forced more people out of work. The previous 
record was 4.6 percent, registered in February.

	Separately, the agency said spending by Japanese wage earners  
last month fell 3.6 percent from the year-earlier month in real 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 535  
million shares, down from Wednesday's turnover of 677 million

unchanged.

	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 10.52 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,337.12

<HEADLINE> Smoker Wins $2.2M Asbestos Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A cancer sufferer who smoked cigarettes with  
asbestos filters has won a $2.2 million jury verdict against 
manufacturers of the brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Connor, 75, sued after he was diagnosed in June 1997  
with mesothelioma, a cancer linked to asbestos. He had smoked a 
pack of Kents a day for eight years before quitting about 37 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Thursday returned the verdict against Lorillard Inc.,  
maker of Kents, and Hollingsworth &AMP; Vose Co., which made the 
``Micronite'' filters used in the cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the companies said they would appeal. The companies  
have won nine of the 11 other lawsuits that have been tried. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent cigarettes were the only brand that had asbestos in  
filters. Advertising for the cigarettes sold from 1952 to 1956 
called them ``the protection you need'' against tar and nicotine 
because asbestos would filter the toxins. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorillard lawyer Roger Geary argued that tests done in the 1950s  
found the filters didn't release asbestos into the smoke. At the 
time, medical journals rated Kent as one of the best cigarettes for 
removing tar and nicotine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company abandoned the filters because they were expensive  
and caused a bad taste, Geary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged an elaborate cover-up by the companies to  
hide the dangers of the filters. Studies in 1954 about whether 
asbestos was leaking into the smoke have disappeared, the lawsuit 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers who monitor tobacco litigation said the verdict  
reflected a growing hostility toward cigarette manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important,'' said Richard Daynard, a law professor  
at Northeastern University and chairman of the Tobacco Products 
Liability Project. ``It shows that juries are now willing to hit 
tobacco companies hard for misbehavior.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 65.87 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks headed higher today, pushing the Dow  
Jones industrial average closer to 11,000, after a government 
report said the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
65.87 to 10,944.25, less than 56 points from 11,000. The Dow has 
set a record high close in each of the last three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Nasdaq composite index  
was up 36.57 to 2,565.01 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 
7.82 to 1,350.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy grew at a strong 4.5 percent annual rate in the  
first three months of this year, far above expectations, as 
consumers spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the solid growth in the  
gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, 
came despite the fact that the nation's trade deficit, battered by 
overseas economic turmoil, soared to a record level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an economy that is performing exceptionally well,''  
said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. 
``We're seeing vigorous demand in the U.S. and have a comfortable 
inflation situation which is a favorable setting for the stock 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Dow higher was Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing,  
up 4 7/8 to 90 1/2, after 3M reported higher than expected first-quarter 
profits. Dow component United Technologies, which announced a 
two-for-one stock split today, was up 3 9/16 to 147 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also rallied after three days of losses.  
</P>
<P>
	America Online advanced 3 1/8 to 144 1/2. Hewlett-Packard rose 1 1/8 to  
79 1/2 after a Merrill Lynch analyst said the personal computer maker 
will likely top second-quarter earnings estimates of 79 cents per 
share. IBM rose 4 13/16 to 209 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 402.7 million shares, 
slightly below Thursday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.66 to 640.75 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.38 to 781.38.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Youth Violence Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he will convene a  
White House strategy session with representatives of the Internet 
and entertainment industries, the gun lobby, government and the 
clergy to build a national movement against youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The session, a response to last week's Colorado school shooting,  
is slated for May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need nothing less than a grass-roots effort to protect our  
children and turn them away from violence,'' Clinton said in a Rose 
Garden announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If citizens, parents and children alike working together in  
their communities can reduce teen pregnancy, reduce drunk driving, 
make seat-belt use nearly universal, then working together we can 
protect our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton emphasized that he wanted gun manufacturers and gun  
owners, whose political lobbies have bitterly fought him on 
gun-control legislation, to be part of the White House discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's bury the hatchet and build a future for our children  
together,'' he offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, in an interview broadcast on NBC's ``Today,''  
Clinton made clear that he would not limit any White House youth 
violence summit to the influence of the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``What should we do about guns? What should we do about culture?  
What should we do about the schools? How can we help the parents? 
And, what is government's responsibility? Those are the big 
questions. We should ask and answer all of them -- not just one,'' 
Clinton said on the television program. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress asked Clinton earlier this week to convene  
an emergency summit of entertainment industry executives to address 
the kind of youth rage that erupted at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo.

<HEADLINE> Memorabilia Dealer Gets Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A sports memorabilia dealer was sentenced  
Friday to four months of probation for selling more than 1,000 fake 
signatures of Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Randa also ordered Ron Marth  
to pay a $5,000 fine and restitution to his victims as determined 
by a government review. 
</P>
<P>
	Marth, 53, who operated a memorabilia store in suburban  
Milwaukee, was also sentenced to 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Marth pleaded guilty  
last May to a federal fraud charge. He promised to cooperate with 
investigators in identifying the person who forged Favre's 
signature on 8-by-10 inch photographs of the athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also included Marth admission that he participated  
in a scheme from January 1997 to mid-February 1998 to sell at least 
1,000 items with forged Favre signatures.

<HEADLINE> Coach in Wheelchair Brings Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A paraplegic high school baseball coach who  
uses a wheelchair can finish this season without restrictions that 
some umpires had imposed such as preventing him from approaching 
the mound during pitching changes. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting privately with a federal judge on Friday, both  
sides agreed that for the remainder of the season, Victor Barrios 
will have the same coaching rights as those who don't use a 
wheelchair, said his lawyer, Jilana Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Barrios will be able to coach as all other coaches do,''  
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big relief not just off my shoulders, but the team's  
shoulders where the kids don't have the distraction,'' Barrios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Interscholastic Federation and the Orange County  
Baseball Officials Association also agreed to work toward resolving 
the issue for future seasons. The plaintiffs' lawyers couldn't 
immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some umpires had restricted Barrios from going onto the field,  
saying his wheelchair slowed games and posed safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrios and his lawyer say that's crazy.  
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody's watched (former Los Angeles Dodgers manager)  
Tommy Lasorda walk to the mound, well, coach Barrios gets out there 
faster, even before all the kids get in,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrios filed a civil rights lawsuit against the CIF alleging  
the governing body of high school athletics was preventing him from 
coaching because he uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court suit, filed Tuesday, said the CIF and  
co-defendant Orange County Baseball Officials Association ban that 
keeps Barrios off the field is a violation of the American's with 
Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrios, 26, coached baseball for four years at Magnolia High  
School, another CIF school, without objection. When he moved to 
Westminster High School this season, umpires told him he would have 
to remain in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrios has been confined to the dugout for eight of 13 games  
played this season by the Westminster Lions, who were 5-4 in league 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrios, a former gang member paralyzed from the waist down in a  
shooting seven years ago, shares the coaching job at Westminster 
while he works toward a physical education degree at Fullerton 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy that we've taken a step toward making CIF and  
the umpires let me do the job I was hired to do -- coach baseball,'' 
he said after the suit was filed.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Merchandise Hitting Shelves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- ``Star Wars'' merchandise will hit store shelves  
across America on Monday, but a lucky group of dedicated fans got a 
peek today at the extensive lineup of products based on the 
much-awaited movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The thousands who gathered at the ``Star Wars Celebration''  
convention were the first members of the general public to view the 
toys and other goods tied to the much-hyped movie, ``Star Wars: 
Episode I - The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars'' creator LucasFilm Ltd. previously had barred  
nearly all information on merchandise from being released until 
12:01 a.m. on May 3, when stores can officially begin selling the 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers anticipate this launch to be the biggest introduction  
of movie-themed merchandise ever. The movie will be released May 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	There was lots of looking but no buying for the attendees at the  
crowded convention, where announcements like ``Meet your party 
under the X-Wing'' droned over the public address system and people 
came dressed as their favorite ``Star Wars'' characters. 
</P>
<P>
	There were faces pressed up to locked glass displays containing  
the latest action figures from Hasbro, which is manufacturing many 
of the toys and games based on the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a Jabba the Hut plastic figure that comes with a frog.  
The frog's head can be removed, stuffed in Jabba's head and he will 
spit it into a gong. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight basic action figures, which are 3 3/4 inches tall,  
include the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young man and Anakin 
Skywalker, the father of hero Luke Skywalker who later became Darth 
Vader. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included are Jar Jar Binks, a new space creature and Queen  
Amidala, the leader of the ``good'' side. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these figures will contain a microchip, allowing them to  
speak up to four lines from the movie. The actions figures will 
sell from $6.99 to $7.99, while related computer gear to make them 
talk costs an additional $20 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
	A collection of Queen Amidala fashion dolls also is for sale.  
And there is a 3-D diorama that recreates memorable movie scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included among the new toys is Snapping Jaws, which has a  
mouth that opens and shuts, the Two-Headed Announcer, which speaks 
different languages out of its two heads and the Flash Speeder with 
a simulated laser cannon . 
</P>
<P>
	``The big news is basic figures this year is that they can talk.  
Their audio chips will speak words from the movie,'' said Hasbro 
spokesman Daron Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also shown on Friday was Pepsi's new line of 24 collector soda  
cans, which feature movie characters. Cans will hit stores in the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	While anxious fans gawked at the new merchandise, they had to  
wait until Monday like the rest of the world before they could buy 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were already planning for the big day.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be there when the stores open.,'' said Seattle software  
developer and lawyer Chris Hancock of Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Exchange Trading Floor Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- During the late 1980s, the daily frenzy on the  
floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was a symbol of Japan's energetic 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But recession has since replaced boom. And today, computers and  
cost-cutting put an end to the 120-year old tradition of 
face-to-face trading on Asia's largest exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge open floor of the Tokyo exchange was once crowded with  
more than 2,000 traders, fighting for position as they used a 
complex sign-language to buy and sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, after the end of the trading day, it was the site of a  
closing ceremony replete with confetti and party noisemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The floor long ago stopped being the center of trading activity.  
Securities companies began switching to faster and more reliable 
electronic trading systems in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	By last year, all Japanese stocks could be traded by computer  
while fewer than 10 percent could be traded directly on the floor. 
Only about 100 employees still worked on the floor and trading 
there accounted for a scant 0.2 percent of Tokyo volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities companies and the exchange will save money by moving  
those workers to more productive jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, it is an epoch-making event but we don't think much  
about it,'' said Isao Kawanaba, a spokesman for Japan's biggest 
brokerage, Nomura Securities. ``There are very few people working 
there now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura's last floor traders would be transferred to other  
divisions, Kawanaba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Computerization isn't the only reason Tokyo trading has become  
more subdued in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged economic downturn and a decade-long decline in stock  
values has forced Japan's biggest brokers to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
	During Japan's ``bubble'' economy, Tokyo's benchmark stock index  
was more than twice its current value. And at the peak of market 
activity in 1988, there was more than twice as much trading as last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor trading is still done in New York and Frankfurt, Germany  
but other major exchanges have ceased already and gone completely 
electronic. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1986, stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, and  
Paris have closed their trading floors. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have been traded on a Tokyo exchange since 1878, though  
the market was closed for almost four years from 1945 as the 
country focused its attention on repairing its war-torn economy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. occupation forces used the trading floor briefly as a gym  
and dance hall before the exchange opened again in 1949, following 
Japan's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge trading floor, with it's 165-foot-high ceiling, will be  
remodeled for use as a stock and corporate information center.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Explores Ainu Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mysterious Ainu of northern Japan, a  
people whose culture, language and physical appearance set them 
apart from other Asians, are featured in a new Smithsonian 
Institution exhibition that seeks to tell their story to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a large trading and fishing people living across a broad  
region, the Ainu today number only about 25,000, concentrated on 
Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido. In some ways, their story 
parallels that of American Indians, overrun by outsiders in the 
1800s, their lands lost and culture threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Ainu history and culture are featured in an exhibit opening  
today at the National Museum of Natural History. Starting in 
January, the exhibit, ``Ainu, Spirit of a Northern People,'' will 
go on tour around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Long a mystery to outsiders, the Ainu look so different from  
other Asians that early European and American visitors once 
speculated that the Ainu were a lost tribe of Caucasians. 
</P>
<P>
	Today most anthropologists consider them descendants of ancient  
Asian peoples, explained curator William Fitzhugh, director of the 
museum's Arctic Studies Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars believe the Ainu stem from the prehistoric Jomon  
culture, which was replaced by the forerunners of the modern 
Japanese about 2,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not Japanese at all,'' said Fitzhugh. The separate  
Ainu culture was finally recognized by a 1997 Japanese law, he 
noted. A revival of ancient traditions is getting under way. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a big change from just over a decade ago, when a joint  
U.S.-Soviet exhibition at the Smithsonian featuring the peoples of 
northern lands excluded the Ainu at the request of the then-Soviet 
Union, which didn't want attention called to having expelled these 
people from lands it ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike their Asian neighbors, the Ainu are more muscular and  
have wavy hair and deep-set eyes. The men tend to grow full, bushy 
beards and the women tattoo their lips, arms and hands. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to language, researchers are at a loss to find  
good links between the Ainu tongue and others, though some have 
suggested Central Asian roots, some Pacific native languages and 
even American Indian connections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The word 'unknown' still remains the most cogent summary that  
most Ainu linguists can agree on,'' the Smithsonian curators 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ainu had Japan's northern Hokkaido Island nearly to  
themselves for hundreds of years, hunting, fishing and trading with 
nearby peoples. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Meiji took over the government of Japan in 1868, they  
opened Hokkaido to settlement and the Ainu were overrun by new 
arrivals, falling into decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the Ainu were reduced to making animal carvings to  
sell to tourists, a craft that proved popular with visitors but 
conflicts with their tradition, which banned representations of 
people or animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ainu clothing, made of finely woven tree inner bark, and tools  
and weapons are on display in the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	A centerpiece is a bearskin illustrating a return of the spirit  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ainu believe all things are physical manifestations of gods  
and the bear represents the god of the mountains. When he visits 
the Ainu, he puts on bearskin and flesh to be given as gifts to the 
people. The bear's spirit is dispatched back to its world with an 
elaborate ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Prices Mixed on Wall Street / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today after  
analysts found data in the government's latest economic assessment 
that rekindled inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
was down 89.34 at 10,789.04. Broader market indicators were mixed, 
with the Nasdaq composite closing modestly higher and the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 index falling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow, up during morning trading, began sinking after the bond  
market dropped markedly in response to the Commerce Department's 
report that the U.S. economy grew at a strong 4.5 percent annual 
rate in the first three months of this year, far above 
expectations. The gain was attributed to consumers spending at the 
fastest pace in more than a decade . 
</P>
<P>
	Bond traders reacted to an inflation measure tied to the GDP,  
which rose at an annual rate of 1.4 from January through March, up 
from a 0.8 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The price hike overshadowed the solid growth in the gross  
domestic product, the total output of goods and services, which 
soared despite the nation's worsening trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond market yields soared to 5.65 percent from late Thursday's  
5.52 percent as investors feared the economic strength would 
reignite inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest 
rates higher. Higher rates raised the specter of high borrowing 
costs and lower corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the bond market clobbered the stock market,''  
said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets 
Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The down mood in the financial markets was compounded by a  
report from corporate purchasing executives that said manufacturing 
activity surged in the Midwest during April. The report by the 
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago is often viewed as a 
precursor to the survey on the economy by the National Association 
of Purchasing Management, which issues its report on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow stocks, American Express slipped 4 11/16 to 130 11/16  
and J.P. Morgan fell 3 1/4 to 134 3/4 because a rise in interest rates is 
likely to hurt financial service companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But technology stocks rallied after three days of losses.  
America Online rose 1 5/8 to 143. Amazon.com was up 3 13/16 to 172 
1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard rose 3/8 to 78 3/4 after a Merrill Lynch analyst said  
the personal computer maker will likely top second-quarter earnings 
estimates of 79 cents per share.

<HEADLINE> CheckFree Says Problem Nearly Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- CheckFree said Friday that it was almost  
glitch-free again after services were disrupted this week for some 
home-banking consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Stephanie Norton said the system was working at 98  
percent capacity and the company expected to soon be operating 
without any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	She said technical staffers had identified a software  
application problem that caused up to 500,000 people who used 
Quicken or Microsoft Money software to face sporadic difficulty 
accessing their bank accounts or completing transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20 banks that had been switched to a new processing system  
over the last six months were affected in a problem that began 
showing up early Monday. Customers were advised to use paper checks 
or telephone or automatic tellers to make transactions if they were 
having problems. 
</P>
<P>
	CheckFree representatives will work with each bank to resolve  
any problems caused by late payments related to the glitch, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Norcross, Ga., CheckFree Holdings Co. has some 2.8  
million customers and helps provide electronic payment services at 
350 institutions.

<HEADLINE> China Orders Firms To Get Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's securities regulator urged listed firms  
Friday to take the threat of the Year 2000 computer problem 
seriously and purge their computer systems of any glitches, the 
official Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In an open letter, the China Securities Regulatory Commission  
told the 878 listed firms to spend enough money and acquire enough 
expertise to modify and replace key computer systems so that they 
will not fail at year's end, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firms need to recognize the serious risks the computer glitch,  
known as Y2K, poses to the stability of markets and investor 
confidence, Xinhua cited the letter as saying. It added that firms 
ought to be prepared for lawsuits arising from any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts fear that computers which use only the last two digits  
to mark the year will mistake 2000 for 1900 and malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the letter gave no indication how far along most firms  
were, its underlying tone confirmed assessments by foreign analysts 
that China's preparations were lagging. Last month, the 
government's top Y2K troubleshooter said a lack of money and 
experience were hampering China's readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial securities is one of 18 key sectors in which the  
government is expending all efforts to make sure are Y2K-compliant. 
The government troubleshooter, Zhang Qi, last month praised the 
securities sector for doing an ``excellent job'' in rooting out Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities exchanges and brokerages are supposed to have cleared  
their computer systems of the glitch by May 30. The sector has run 
three tests so far, Xinhua said. The last one, in February, turned 
up some problems, as was expected, officials have said.

<HEADLINE> Safety Varies Among Flight Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- International travelers buying tickets from an  
airline with a good safety record may end up traveling on a carrier 
with a lesser one, thanks to the spread of worldwide airline 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines, for example, offers regular service from  
Newark, N.J., to Taipei, Taiwan. On one trip, passengers carrying 
Continental tickets bearing Continental flight numbers fly on a 
Continental plane to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	When they arrive, their tickets and flight numbers continue to  
read ``Continental,'' but they are transferred to a plane of one of 
the carrier's Asian partners, China Airlines, for the leg to 
Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Air Travelers Association, a Washington passenger  
advocacy group, gave Continental an A for flight safety. China 
Airlines, which had fatal accidents in 1994 and 1989, as well as a 
747 skid into Hong Kong harbor in 1993, got an F. 
</P>
<P>
	Another survey, conducted in 1996 by the travel publisher Conde  
Naste, listed the Taiwan-based China Airlines with an accident rate 
of 11.43 fatal accidents per million flights. Continental had a 
fatal accident rate of 0.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing practice of flight partnerships known as  
``code-shares'' makes the problem of inconsistent flight safety 
especially vexing. While airlines have been passing off customers 
for years, they used to do so with separate tickets and flight 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Code-shares present the illusion that one airline is providing  
all of a passenger's flight service. Airlines favor the arrangement 
because it allows them to project the image of a larger route 
network, while giving passengers the ability to make seamless 
connections between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The government requires airlines to warn passengers when they  
will be switched to another carrier, but it concedes the warnings 
sometimes aren't given or don't filter through a travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
	That has prompted action:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Transportation Department, which must approve code-shares,  
is considering changing its policies so it can directly weigh the 
quality of the foreign airline partner. Under existing rules, the 
department looks only at the safety standards of the country where 
the foreign carrier is based, not at the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Defense Department, which spends $1.2 billion annually on  
travel, is about to ask six major airlines -- American, Continental, 
Delta, Northwest, TWA and United -- to complete safety checks of 
their code-share partners. 
</P>
<P>
	--The inspector general for the Transportation Department is  
analyzing whether code-share policy assesses foreign airline 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this is fairly new and it's growing, so we're reviewing  
how we ought to look at these,'' said Patrick Murphy, deputy 
assistant secretary of transportation for aviation and 
international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Delta Air Lines suspended its partnership with  
Korean Air after a cargo jet flown by the Asian carrier crashed in 
Shanghai, China. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming in the aftermath of other Korean Air accidents, and a  
report by two Korean Air pilots critical of the airline's safety, 
Delta said it would not put its passengers on the planes ``pending 
a thorough review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that when you put your code on another  
carrier's flight, you're putting your cloak of respectability and 
safety onto that carrier's airplane,'' said David Stempler, 
president of the Air Travelers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines are reluctant to say how they check the safety of their  
flight partners, but most say they would not knowingly put their 
passengers at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Dave Messing said Continental Airlines cannot control  
partners' flights, but ``we do monitor the safety and performance 
of alliance airlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, which participates in the Star Alliance with  
such major carriers as Lufthansa and Air Canada, said airlines must 
agree to a 20-point safety program before they are admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the requirements: that they share safety data and that the  
leader of each airline make a public statement saying employees 
will not be punished if they report safety problems.

<HEADLINE> Firstar To Acquire Mercantile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Firstar Corporation will acquire Mercantile  
Bancorporation Inc. for about $10.6 billion in stock, creating a 
Midwestern banking powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined bank would be the 13th largest bank holding company  
in the United States, with assets of more than $75 billion and 
deposits of $59 billion. It would have assets under management of 
$67 billion and a market capitalization of $32 billion, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal values Mercantile at $66 per share, a premium of 29  
percent over Mercantile's closing stock price Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition was announced after the market closed Friday.  
Takeover speculation during the trading session helped send shares 
of Mercantile up $5.75, or 11 percent, to close at $57 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Shares of Firstar slipped $1.50, or 5 percent, 
to close at $30.06 1/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	This transaction will create the second largest Midwest banking  
franchise, providing a full line of consumer banking, commercial 
banking and trust and investment management services and products. 
It would have more than 5 million customers through its 
approximately 1,180 branch locations in nine Midwest states and 
Tennessee, Arkansas and Arizona, plus trust operations in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined companies' corporate headquarters will remain in  
Milwaukee, with St. Louis becoming the headquarters for corporate 
banking and Cincinnati continuing as the headquarters for consumer 
banking. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry A. Grundhofer, Firstar's president and chief executive  
officer, will continue in that position, Firstar said. Thomas H. 
Jacobsen, Mercantile's chairman, president and chief executive 
officer, will become chairman of the board of Firstar and will 
co-chair the board's executive committee with Grundhofer. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger L. Fitzsimonds, Firstar's current chairman, plans to  
retire upon the closing of the acquisition and will be named 
chairman emeritus at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors will be comprised of 14 representatives  
of Firstar and four representatives of Mercantile. 
</P>
<P>
	Firstar Corporation, based in Milwaukee, now has $38 billion in  
assets and about 720 banking offices in Ohio, Wisconsin, Kentucky, 
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercantile, with $36 billion in asset, is based in St. Louis.  
The company operates banks in nearly 500 locations in Missouri, 
Iowa, Kansas, Illinois, Arkansas and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercantile's non-banking subsidiaries include companies  
providing brokerage services, asset-based lending, factoring, 
investment advisory services, leasing services and credit life and 
other insurance products as agent.

<HEADLINE> Derby Analyst Likes Prime Timber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While others might shy away from making a pick in the Kentucky  
Derby, there's no such hesitation for new ABC commentator Hank 
Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that comes from working for one of the most outspoken men  
in sports television history. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg, the NFL and horse racing expert for ESPN, has been  
hired to add his expertise to ABC's Kentucky Derby crew. And he's 
done well for ESPN -- correctly picking four of the past five Derby 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Johnson, the voice of the Derby, predicted Silver Charm in  
1997, and Lesley Visser called Go For Gin in 1994, but other than 
that, ABC's experts haven't fared so well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I wasn't just hired to pick the winner,'' Goldberg  
said. ``If that's the case, I could have a very short career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are many viewers who tune in and rely on ABC's crew in  
order to place their wager. For them, here's Hammerin' Hank's tip: 
Prime Timber. 
</P>
<P>
	Where did Goldberg learn to be so bold? Jimmy ``The Greek''  
Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was Jimmy the Greek's ghost,'' Goldberg said. ``I worked on  
his column and helped him with all his NFL stuff -- before he opened 
his mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg, along with nearly everyone else, believes this is the  
most wide-open Derby ever. He also likes Stephen Got Even. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's three for three this year,'' Goldberg said. ``I know he  
hasn't run in five weeks and that it's been 40 years since a horse 
won with more than a four-week layoff, but I still like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg added that the fact he has bought three horses in the  
past year with Nick Zito, the trainer of Stephen Got Even, has 
nothing to do with that pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg doesn't buy the notion that fewer people are watching  
horse racing's premier event nowadays. Last year's Derby posted a 
6.1 mark, compared with a 10.1 when Unbridled won to begin the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of simulcast facilities that you can go to has  
increased dramatically,'' he said. ``People who used to stay home 
and watch the race are now able to go out, watch it and bet it. 
Those people don't count towards the ratings. This is still a huge 
event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ABC has added an announcer-handicapper for its 25th  
anniversary of covering the race, it has ended a four-year streak 
of implementing some technological innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	The network planned on using a Gyro Cam, which was to be mounted  
on a Land Rover that follows the horses along the inside of the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	However, weather conditions prevented ABC from testing the  
device at the track. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MIDTOWN BOWLING: CBS will televise the first-ever outdoor pro  
bowling event Saturday and there won't be any rain delays, make-up 
dates or tarps. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, there will be a tent over the temporary lanes for the  
finals of the New York City PBA Experience. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
will open the telecast by rolling the first ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Even avid bowler Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos is  
involved, leading a youth clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are numerous challenges setting up bowling lanes in the  
middle of Manhattan,'' PBA commissioner Mark Gerberich said. ``The 
weather, accommodating the fans and actually pulling it off, making 
it exciting for those who come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerberich expects about 3,000 fans, who will watch for free.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLAWLESS DRAW:* Unlike last year, ESPN began its Derby coverage  
without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Lincoln was nowhere to be found for Wednesday's  
post-position draw. He took the blame for last year's blunder when 
he misread No. 15 instead of No. 5, causing the cable network to 
redo the live show. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year it went smoothly,'' said ESPN's Chris Fowler, the  
host for the event. ``Some things got ironed out from last year. 
It's a learning process and can still be more entertaining in a few 
ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardcore racing fans enjoy the event, but the majority of the  
country is little interested. ESPN should alter the seemingly 
endless format, which has a draw for order selection, followed by 
another draw in which post selection is determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Or better yet, just scrap the show altogether.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* CBS will broadcast the Houston Open for the first  
time Saturday and Sunday, but commentator Jim Nantz is familiar 
with the course. Nantz played on the University of Houston golf 
team. ... Pam Shriver will join HBO for its 1999 Wimbledon 
coverage. ... Showtime's remake of ``That Championship Season'' 
airs June 6. ... ESPN will broadcast John Elway's retirement news 
conference live Sunday and also have him on ``Sunday Conversation'' 
with Roy Firestone. ... NBC's top basketball team of Bob Costas and 
Doug Collins gets a break from the Lakers this weekend, instead 
working the Knicks-Pacers game Sunday. ... The Orioles-Cuba 
exhibition at Camden Yards will be on Fox Sports Net Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Conviction in Forged JFK Papers Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man was found guilty Friday of selling  
salacious, but forged documents claiming President Kennedy paid 
hush money to keep secret an affair with Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence X. Cusack III, who made a fortune selling hundreds of  
Kennedy-linked documents he claimed came from his father, was 
convicted on 13 mail and wire fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack, 48, of Fairfield, Conn., faces up to five years in  
prison on each of the 13 fraud counts, and a maximum $250,000 fine 
on each count when he is sentenced in July. 
</P>
<P>
	When Judge Denise Cote announced the guilty verdict on each  
charge, Cusack's jaw dropped. He stared, eyes narrowed, at the 
jurors, then he shook his head repeatedly and dropped his face into 
his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The case caused a furor in 1997 after Pulitzer Prize-winning  
author Seymour Hersh deleted material based on the documents from 
his book, ``The Dark Side of Camelot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack produced letters that he said were written between his  
late father, who helped handle the Monroe estate, and the slain 
president. The documents appeared to prove rumors about Kennedy and 
Miss Monroe, the Mafia and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the papers, Kennedy had set up a trust for Monroe's  
mother to buy silence about the rumored affair between the 
president and the actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Cusack swindled investors out of about $7  
million between 1993 and 1997 by selling the phony documents, 
including letters bearing Kennedy's forged signature. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made key mistakes, prosecutors said. One letter  
purportedly signed by Kennedy includes ZIP codes, which did not 
exist at the time the letter was dated. And the typeface used in 
many of the letters came from a typewriter that was not 
manufactured until the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack ``told lie after lie after lie to make people believe the  
documents were real,'' prosecutor Peter Neiman told the jury 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Robert Katzberg told jurors that while a  
handwriting expert concluded the president's script had been 
simulated or traced, it could not be proved his client did it. But 
the government said the evidence was ``overwhelming'' that Cusack 
was ``the person responsible'' for the forgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Among prosecutors' evidence were taped conversations in which  
Cusack confessed to forgery to a dealer who had helped sell the 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like, how and when do you 'fess up?'' Cusack said  
in one conversation. ``How am I going to explain that? ... It just 
got out of hand.''

<HEADLINE> 38th Day of NATO Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now in its 38th day, NATO's air war in  
Yugoslavia has lasted as long as the U.S.-led air campaign in the 
1991 Gulf War, which on Day 39 added a ground attack to kick Iraq 
out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	On Day 38 of Operation Allied Force -- designed to compel  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to give up his grip on Kosovo 
-- the bombs kept falling with little sign that Milosevic was near 
the breaking point. NATO warplanes today struck Yugoslav army 
headquarters and the interior ministry in Belgrade in what alliance 
officials called the strongest attack so far on the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no consensus in NATO for committing ground troops, and,  
some say, no political will to go all out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're setting it out piecemeal,'' said retired Gen. Michael  
Dugan, who was Air Force chief of staff when the Iraqis invaded 
Kuwait in August 1990. He said in an interview Thursday that he saw 
signs of a toughening in NATO's approach, including the decision to 
send more B-52 bombers into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	At this stage of the U.S.-led air war against Iraq, there was  
little doubt about the outcome. The allies had wrecked Iraqi air 
defenses and destroyed an estimated one-third of his armor in 
Kuwait. Hundreds of Iraqi soldiers already had been taken prisoner 
and those that remained in Kuwait were desperate. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Bush gave Iraqi President Saddam Hussein a  
deadline of Feb. 23 to give up Kuwait or face a U.S.-led land 
invasion, there were about 700,000 allied troops -- including 
520,000 Americans -- poised on the Saudi Arabian border to barrel 
across desert sand berms into Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Balkans, by contrast, NATO has fewer than 20,000 soldiers  
on the ground, and most of them are occupied with housing refugees 
in Albania and Macedonia. What's more, NATO says it has not even 
begun to develop a battle plan for ground troops; it insists that a 
land campaign will not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons between the air campaigns against Iraq and  
Yugoslavia are limited in many respects, although many military 
analysts use the Gulf War example in criticizing NATO for not using 
overwhelming force. By Day 38 in the Gulf, the allies had flown 
about 90,000 missions, compared with 12,000 so far in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	It might also be said, however, that the United States is still  
fighting the air war in Iraq. American and British planes carried 
out a four-day bombing campaign in Iraq last December, and since 
then have been bombing air defense targets in northern and southern 
Iraq with almost daily regularity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Day 38 of the U.S.-led air war against Iraq, U.S. officials  
announced that allied bombing had destroyed 39 percent of Iraqi 
tanks in Kuwait, 32 percent of all armored vehicles and 48 percent 
of artillery. Once the ground troops stormed into Kuwait, the 
Iraqis were ready to quit within 100 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	So far in Kosovo, by NATO's estimate, the Serbs have lost no  
more than 15 percent of their tanks, although the efficiency of 
attacks on armor is likely to improve once the Army puts its Apache 
attack helicopters into action. Defense Secretary William Cohen 
said Thursday the Apache crews have ``some more training to do'' 
before the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, will send them into 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and other U.S. officials are quick to point out the  
differences between Yugoslavia and the Gulf War. One is that 
bombing is more difficult in the Balkans, where frequent low cloud 
cover makes it difficult to target from high altitude. The Iraqis 
were mostly exposed in the open desert, whereas the Serbs have 
hills and forest to hide their armor and air defense systems. There 
also are more civilians to keep out of the line of fire in Serbia, 
where many military and communications targets are near civilian 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers comparison also is somewhat misleading. The allies  
were flying as many as 2,900 missions a day in Iraq, compared with 
600 on a big day in Yugoslavia. While there is no question that the 
air campaign in Iraq was more intense, technological advances since 
1991 have enabled NATO planes to hit more targets in Yugoslavia 
with fewer total bombs than was true during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 9 percent of bombs used in the Gulf were of the  
precision-guided variety, compared with more than 90 percent in the 
current campaign, according to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<HEADLINE> Feds Threaten Lawsuit Against N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state, faced with the threat of a  
federal lawsuit over alleged racial discrimination by its troopers, 
is seeking a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said it has found enough evidence of  
discrimination to sue the New Jersey State Police. State Attorney 
General Peter Verniero said Thursday his office intends to work out 
an agreement with federal lawyers to avoid actual litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit threat came to Verniero's office Monday as he  
appeared before the state Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the 
state police and the practice of stopping or searching motorists 
based on race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Verniero said he looked forward to working with the  
Justice Department to ``ensure that New Jersey becomes a model for 
addressing this important civil rights issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Division of Civil Rights spokeswoman Christine DiBartolo said  
New Jersey's response was what Justice Department officials sought. 
``We are very pleased that they have agreed to enter into 
negotiations with us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal laws approved in 1994 gave the Justice Department new  
authority to investigate police practices and to file lawsuits 
against entire departments if civil rights violations are detected. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the reforms were passed, settlements have resolved threats  
of such lawsuits with police departments in Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
In both cases, civilians were designated to monitor citizen 
complaints or to audit police activity reports. 
</P>
<P>
	However, DiBartolo said nothing can be drawn from those cases  
with respect to the negotiations with the 2,700-officer New Jersey 
State Police -- the largest police agency so far to face a lawsuit 
threat, and the first statewide police force to be targeted by the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Verniero's office last week released a report that found  
officers in at least two police barracks -- Moorestown and Cranbury 
-- engaged in racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department lawyer told The New York Times that the  
federal investigation mirrored that report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the focus also on the Moorestown and Cranbury stations,  
and that certainly was the focus of many of the complaints of 
motorists,'' said the lawyer, who was not identified in today's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	The source also said the Justice Department had agreed that some  
of the remedies suggested in Verniero's report were ``a starting 
point'' for negotiations. Those include revising the procedure for 
traffic stops, focusing on statewide drug enforcement strategy 
rather than pursuing individual vehicles and making quarterly 
reports on the racial breakdown of motorists who deal with state 
police.

<HEADLINE> New Zealander Nominated To Head WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Former New Zealand Prime Minister Mike Moore was  
nominated today as the new head of the World Trade Organization in 
a close race that pitted him against Thailand's deputy prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Mchumo, chairman of the WTO's decision-making council, told  
council members he formally proposed Moore because he had support 
from 62 nations, three more than Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the considered opinion that Mr. Moore faced less  
opposition to his candidacy,'' said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was adjourned to let members weigh the nomination.  
</P>
<P>
	With a new round of trade talks looming and a ministerial  
conference coming up in Seattle in November, the role of WTO 
director-general is regarded as key. The organization is 
responsible for pushing through agreements to liberalize global 
commerce and set free trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether Asian nations would seek to  
veto Moore's nomination. The United States supported Moore's 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries argued it was vital to avoid a leadership vacuum  
at a time when the WTO is caught up in high-profile disputes 
between the United States and European Union over bananas and 
hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the leadership headaches, the WTO's four deputies  
were also expected to leave at the same time as Renato Ruggiero, an 
Italian who has been the WTO head for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 50, is a supporter of free trade, but also an advocate  
for the underprivileged and less powerful, smaller nations.

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Sues Gun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis on Friday became the latest U.S. city  
to sue gun makers, dealers and trade groups to recover damages for 
crimes involving firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, based on public nuisance and negligence laws,  
alleges gun manufacturers have failed to regulate sales and 
implement safety features to prevent gun use by children and other 
unauthorized users. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit is similar to suits filed recently by Chicago, Atlanta,  
Miami, Detroit, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Bridgeport, Conn., and 
Wayne County, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a federal court jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., found nine  
gun makers liable for shootings. Three companies were ordered to 
pay a total of $500,000 to one of seven plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Firearms industry representatives say the lawsuits do nothing to  
prevent crime and are aimed at driving gun makers out of business.

<HEADLINE> Derby Trainer of Decade Up for Grabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Nick Zito remembers his first Kentucky  
Derby well. The trainer remembers his second Kentucky Derby even 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember standing there looking at everything, talking to a  
reporter and lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back,'' Zito said 
Thursday. ``Finally, she asked, `What are you looking at?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her I didn't want to miss anything.''  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't. On his second trip to Churchill Downs, in 1991, Zito  
won his first Kentucky Derby with Strike the Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, he won again with Go for Gin, making him one  
of three trainers to win a pair of Derbys this decade. Bob Baffert 
and D. Wayne Lukas are the others: Baffert won the last two with 
Real Quiet in '98 and Silver Charm in '97; Lukas won the two before 
with Grindstone in '96 and Thunder Gulch in '95. 
</P>
<P>
	A win Saturday by any of them would break the tie and leave the  
victor with the distinction of being the Derby's ``Trainer of the 
Decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After you win, it's like `wow!' and you just want to keep  
going,'' said Zito, glancing around the backstretch Thursday to 
make sure his Derby horses, Adonis and Stephen Got Even, were OK. 
``It's unbelievable to think you've won two Kentucky Derbys and 
you're pushing for a third one. That's what makes America great, 
huh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, with the most formidable contingent of all for the  
Derby, is pushing for an unprecedented three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there's going to be a year when I don't have anything,  
so I just try to stay calm and cool and enjoy the moment,'' Baffert 
said. ``The Derby's become a fun thing for me, like a 
minivacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coupled entry of the gelding General Challenge and the filly  
Excellent Meeting is the morning favorite at 3-1, while Prime 
Timber is the second choice in the full field of 20 3-year-olds at 
7-2. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Baffert scratched Excellent Meeting from today's  
Kentucky Oaks, deciding to run her in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sort of had it planned, but didn't want to say anything. We  
always had the Derby in mind, but we wanted to leave it up to fate 
and see how we drew, and something told me she needs to run,'' 
Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, meanwhile, is the veteran of the group, a trainer who has  
saddled at least one Derby horse every year starting in 1981. His 
first win came with the filly Winning Colors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Zito will be in his ninth Derby, the 46-year-old  
Baffert his fourth. Both trainers won their first Derby the second 
time around -- Zito after Thirty Six Red finished ninth in 1990; and 
Baffert after Cavonnier was second and Semoran 14th in '96. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected to racing's Hall of Fame on Tuesday, the 63-year-old  
Lukas will send out Cat Thief and Charismatic in the 1 1/4-mile Derby, 
which will carry a record purse of $1,201,200 if all 20 horses 
start. The winner's share would be a record $901,200. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been a friendly rivalry among the three, with Zito  
claiming he picked the No. 1 post for Adonis because ``I don't want 
to be near Baffert's horses,'' and Lukas reminding the others he's 
already won three Derbys. Baffert's horses will leave from post 
Nos. 6, 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, success breeds success and owners have been quick to  
jump on the Baffert bandwagon. Lukas and Zito do OK, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert trains General Challenge and Excellent Meeting for John  
and Betty Mabee, three-time Eclipse Award-winning breeders; Prime 
Timber for timber executive Aaron Jones; and Silver Charm for Bob 
and Beverly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has been the longtime trainer for William T. Young, but  
also trains for the Lewises; Zito plays on his New York connections 
and trains for Yankees boss George Steinbrenner and Boston Celtics 
president and coach Rick Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been talk all week about the Derby, about who's going  
to do what and how it's going to unfold and riders and trainers and 
different guys doing different things,'' Lukas said, ``but the 
bottom line is it gets down to the horse, and I've been blessed 
with prime dollars and owners who are very supportive and let me 
come here year after year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lukas has collected 10 wins in Triple Crown races starting  
with Codex's 1980 Preakness victory, Baffert has four classic 
victories in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Zito sees it, no matter how impressive your stable is,  
you still have to be ``blessed and lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Baffert's had a very strong hand the last couple of years, the  
guy has been unbelievably great,'' Zito said. ``And he's got two 
more shots this year. But you still have to be lucky, real lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, Lukas and Zito are not alone in their search for racing  
luck Saturday. They may have seven horses in the field, but there 
are other top contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, the Blue Grass winner trained by Elliott Walden, is the  
third choice in the betting at 5-1. Walden made a splash in the 
classics last year when Victory Gallop spoiled Real Quiet's bid for 
the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's not forget Florida Derby winner Vicar, a 6-1 shot trained  
by Carl Nafzger, who won the 1990 Derby with Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the mystery horses from Dubai, Aljabr and  
Worldly Manner, the coupled entry at 12-1. Neither colt ran a 
traditional 3-year-old prep race, but Baffert trained Worldly 
Manner as a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Godolphin Stable, and rest of Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum and  
Sheikh Maktoum al Maktoum's racing empire, is in its first Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``To come here and win the first time,'' Sheikh Mohammed said,  
``would be over the moon.''

<HEADLINE> Stephen Got Even Is Derby Favorite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Lightly raced Stephen Got Even, 12-1 on  
the morning line, was the lukewarm 4-1 favorite for the Kentucky 
Derby after early wagering today at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it is Steven Got Even's three-race winning streak,  
including a Grade II stakes race at Turfway Park on March 27, or 
perhaps his connections, trainer Nick Zito and jockey Chris 
McCarron. Zito won the 1991 Derby with Strike the Gold and the 1994 
Derby with Go for Gin; McCarron rode Go for Gin and won the 1987 
Derby aboard Alysheba. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Grass Stakes winner Menifee and Florida Derby winner Vicar  
are each 5-1. Menifee was 5-1 and Vicar was 6-1 on the morning 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	After the early wagering, the Bob Baffert entry of Excellent  
Meeting and General Challenge is 6-1. The entry was the 3-1 
favorite when wagering opened. The Baffert-trained Prime Timber, 
second choice on the morning line at 7-2, is 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in Friday's crowd went for the mutuel field, which includes  
Risen Star winner Ecton Park, Arkansas Derby winner Valhol, 
Louisiana Derby winner Kimberlite Pipe, Lemon Drop Kid and K One 
King. The field is 7-1, down from 12-1 on the morning line.

<HEADLINE> Repsol Offers $13B for YPF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The Spanish energy company Repsol is  
offering $13.4 billion for the Argentine oil giant YPF in a deal 
that would create a more formidable Latin American rival to the 
state oil companies of Venezuela and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer announced late Thursday could lead to the latest  
merger in the rapidly consolidating oil industry. A deal would 
create one of the world's 10 biggest oil companies with revenue of 
more than $27 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Exxon and Mobil agreed to merge in a deal now  
worth nearly $88 billion that will create the world's largest oil 
company. Earlier this year, BP Amoco announced it planned to 
acquire Atlantic Richfield Co. in a deal now valued at nearly $30 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Repsol's cash offer of $44.78 a share for the 85 percent of YPF  
that it doesn't already own represents a 25 percent premium over 
the Argentine company's closing price Thursday on the Buenos Aires 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal between the two former state-owned oil companies  
goes through, Repsol hopes to achieve double-digit earnings growth 
until 2002, Repsol chairman Alfonso Cortina told a news conference 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bid was uninvited, Cortina declined to describe it a  
hostile, adding that he hoped the YPF board would recommend the 
offer to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from YPF.  
</P>
<P>
	Cortina said the takeover would allow Repsol to cut costs by  
between $300 million and $350 million a year, primarily through 
merging YPF with Repsol's Astra unit in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to give a figure on potential job cuts, and said  
that the net affect of the deal would be to create employment 
opportunities as the company would grow so fast. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be among the world oil industry's top 10,  
Cortina told reporters. It would be the seventh largest in refining 
capacity, the eighth in terms of crude reserves and the ninth 
measured on crude oil and natural gas production, Spanish news 
agency Efe reported. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for its cash offer, Repsol has arranged a syndicated loan  
$15.5 billion with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co, La 
Caixa, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Citigroup Inc. and UBS AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this heavy debt, Cortina said the bid won't put too much  
pressure on the company's balance sheet. He said Repsol will reduce 
the impact of the debt through a large capital increase and by 
issuing convertible bonds. Another $2.5 billion of the debt will be 
reduced through the sale of non-core assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Repsol offer expires June 23, and will be conditioned on,  
among other things, Repsol's acquisition of more than 50 percent of 
YPF's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortina said any opposing bid for YPF must be more than $47 a  
share because of an agreement between Repsol and the Argentine 
government signed when the Spanish company bought 15 percent of the 
Argentine oil giant in January. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. May See Trouble in World Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The United States will be relying on a  
makeshift squad of NHL and European-based players at hockey's world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
        The Americans, led by Kevin Stevens of the New York Rangers,  
need to finish at least second in its four-team group to advance to 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
        Six NHL players turned down invitations to play for American  
squad this week, including Edmonton's Bill Guerin, Doug Weight, Todd 
Marchant, Tom Poti and Mike Grier and Ottawa's Shawn McEachern. 
</P>
<P>
        The United States, which beat Canada in the final of the 1996  
World Cup with its best players, finished 12th last year in Switzerland 
and had to qualify for these championships. 
</P>
<P>
        ``The margins are small,'' said Art Berglund, general manager  
of Team USA. ``In Switzerland, we beat the Swiss 5-2 in the first game. 
The Swiss then went on to the semifinals while we ended up 12th.'' 
</P>
<P>
        One highlight will be the debut of Sweden's 18-year-old twins,  
Daniel and Henrik Sedin. 
</P>
<P>
        In their debut in Sweden's 4-3 exhibition loss to Finland in  
Stockholm last week, Henrik set up his brother for a goal. 
</P>
<P>
        Both are likely first-round picks in the NHL Draft this summer.  
But only one is expected to enter, with the other one waiting until 
next year's draft to improve their hopes of playing on the same NHL 
club. 
</P>
<P>
        Sweden added 1996 NHL Rookie of the Year Daniel Alfredsson  
to its roster after the Ottawa Senators were eliminated in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
        Among other Swedish NHLers accepting invitations were goalie  
Tommy Salo of the Edmonton Oilers, high-scoring Markus Naslund of the 
Vancouver Canucks and Niklas Sundstrom of the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
        Canada's strength lies in its defense, anchored by Rob Blake  
of the Los Angeles Kings, who won the 1998 Norris Trophy as the NHL's 
top defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
        Ron Tugnutt of Ottawa is likely to be Canada's No. 1 goalie.  
He had the best NHL's best goals-against average (1.79). 
</P>
<P>
        Forwards will include Adam Graves of the New York Rangers (38  
goal this season), Eric Daze of the Chicago Blackhawks (22 goals), 
Ray Whitney of the Florida Panthers (26 goals) and Cory Stillman of 
the Calgary Flames (27 goals). 
</P>
<P>
        Teemu Selanne of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, who was the NHL's  
top goal scorer (47 goals) this season, will be reunited on the same 
line with Saku Koivu of the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
        Another high scoring forward, Alexei Yashin of Ottawa (44 goals  
and 94 points this season), is expected to join the Russian squad. 
</P>
<P>
        The tournament starts Saturday with Canada against Slovakia  
in the Group A opener and Austria against the Czech Republic in Group 
C in Oslo. Italy plays host nation Norway (Group A) and the U.S. meets 
Japan in an evening game. 
</P>
<P>
        Latvia and Switzerland meet in the Group B opener on Sunday  
followed by Sweden against France. In Group D games, Russia takes on 
Belarus and Finland plays Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Strips on Mars Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Early in its history, the geology of Mars may  
have been much like that of Earth, with molten rock gurgling to the 
surface from a hot interior and with crustal plates drifting on the 
surface, according to new studies. 
</P>
<P>
	In research published today in the journal Science, a team of  
scientists report that instruments aboard the Mars Global Surveyor 
detected magnetic stripes on Mars that closely resemble the 
terrestrial markings of surface spreading and continental drift. 
</P>
<P>
	This may mean the very young Mars resembled the very young  
Earth, but that Mars ran out of its internal energy sources and 
became a geologically dead planet early in its history, said Norman 
F. Ness of the University of Delaware, co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data suggests that Mars was once magnetic and was far more  
similar to Earth's global magnetic field than had been previously 
assumed,'' Ness said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of this magnetic field is frozen in rocks that were  
molten when the magnetic field existed. When the rocks hardened, 
they retained the original magnetism and that now has been detected 
and mapped by the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the present time, there is no evidence of a global magnetic  
field on Mars,'' said Ness. ``That means the dynamo died and what 
is left is the memory of that dynamo, stored in the crustal rocks 
like a magnetic tape recording.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern of magnetic rock closely resembles the striations  
that led scientists to discover on Earth that continents sit atop 
immense crustal plates that inch about the globe over millions of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists previously believed that continental drift occurred  
only on Earth because studies had shown the process did not take 
place on Venus, the solar system planet nearest Earth's size, said 
Ness. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discovery of Martian magnetic striations suggests that  
planet could also have had continent-sized plates that split apart 
on the surface and inched apart, pushed by the flow of magma 
bubbling up through crustal rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said the energy that heated the rock apparently ran out  
within a few hundred million years and Mars became a geologically 
dead planet. The solar system, including the Earth and Mars, are 
thought to have formed 4 billion to 4.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicki L. Hansen, a Southern Methodist University geologist, said  
that the fate of Mars also awaits the Earth. She said the Earth 
eventually will also exhaust its internal energy and its molten 
core will cool. This will shut down the planet's magnetic field and 
allow radiation from the sun to strip away the Earth's atmosphere 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Mars went through at a very young age is what will occur  
on the Earth eventually,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said Mars died much more quickly than Earth because the red  
planet is smaller and had much less internal heat generated by 
friction and the decay of radioactive minerals.

<HEADLINE> Virgin Won't Fly on New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Already known for its pampered passengers and  
thrill-seeking owner, Virgin Atlantic Airways now has another 
distinction: It is the first international carrier to announce it 
won't fly on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said Friday it will ground its 25-plane fleet to  
give its employees a special night off, not because of any concern 
that computers will malfunction due to Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the night itself, our passengers themselves were telling us  
they would rather be with their loved ones than in a 747 over the 
Atlantic. Our employees agreed,'' said Virgin spokesman Paul Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Most airlines are expected to keep flying on New Year's Eve,  
although many are weighing a reduction in overseas flights because 
of uncertainty about how computers in some foreign countries and 
airports will handle the switchover from 1999 to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Atlantic's mass cancellation is the first such action  
taken by an international carrier. A British regional carrier, 
Jersey European Airways, has also said it won't fly on Jan. 1 to 
give its employees time to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Atlantic flies to London from New York; Washington; Miami  
and Orlando, Fla.; Los Angeles; and San Francisco. It also serves 
Tokyo; Hong Kong; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computers were designed to view dates in a two-digit  
format. There is concern that when the date changes from ``99'' to 
``00,'' some computers will misconstrue that as 1900, instead of 
2000. While most airplane computers do not rely on dates, computers 
that control radars, airport lights and other services could be 
vulnerable to problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Atlantic is known for nonconformity in the image of its  
founder, British tycoon, balloonist and boat racer Richard Branson. 
It has offered in-flight massages, passenger pajamas and private 
limousines for its business-class customers. And it traditionally 
does not fly on Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, its decision was at least a mild surprise to other  
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that there are many carriers that are looking at a lot  
of different possibilities, but (we) had not been informed 
officially,'' said Nancy Gauthier, spokeswoman for the 
International Air Transport Association, an international airline 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our knowledge, most of the carriers want to maintain the  
maximum service they can. It is a light-load night, 
traditionally,'' Gauthier said. Airlines are expected to announce 
their flying schedules by early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said Virgin Atlantic made its decision in January,  
although word of it spread only this week. The airline does not 
plan to start any flights on Dec. 31, but will let those in the air 
land that day. It will resume service on Jan. 1, based on its 
normal schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how much the grounding will cost Virgin Atlantic.  
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration recently conducted a test to  
prove that its Y2K computer fixes will work New Year's Eve. 
Airlines are also busy testing their computers, and both Boeing and 
its European counterpart, Airbus Industrie, have said their planes 
will not experience problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. carriers are in good shape. Right now they're gathering  
information to make decisions on other places,'' said David Fuscus, 
spokesman for the Air Transport Association, a trade group for 
major U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The carriers are particularly concerned about preparations in  
parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Some are weighing flight 
cuts over the holiday to reduce the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency  
based in Montreal, is surveying foreign airports and airlines to 
assess overall readiness. It expects reports by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the FAA and the State Department plan to announce  
on July 1 which countries still have Year 2000 problems.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Teen Takes Gun To School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A 13-year-old California boy with a loaded handgun and a hit  
list of 30 names was arrested at school, and a possible explosive 
device that students said resembled a propane tank was found in a 
North Carolina high school today. 
</P>
<P>
	They were two of the latest and most serious threats to disrupt  
schools since the Colorado massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	In Matthews, N.C., a Charlotte suburb, Butler High School's 650  
students were sent home for the day today after the device was 
found in a boys' bathroom at the start of the school day, officials 
said. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents removed the device and sent it to the Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms laboratory to determine whether it 
contained explosive materials, said ATF spokesman Earl Woodham. It 
will also be checked for fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some students have described it as a propane tank,'' said  
Woodham. ``I can't deny that (description).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Propane tank bombs were found at Columbine High School in  
Littleton, Colo., after two students massacred 12 students and a 
teacher before killing themselves April 20. The killings have set 
off a spate of copycat threats. Thousands of students from New York 
to California have stayed away from school. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, authorities pulled a boy out of class at Sierra  
Middle School in Bakersfield, Calif., after classmates said they 
saw a gun under his shirt and saw him loading it outside. 
</P>
<P>
	A .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and 13 rounds of ammunition  
were found on the boy, Kern County sheriff's Cmdr. Don Youngblood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly have a clear picture of what was in his mind and  
there was no denial'' of his intentions, Youngblood said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the boy's backpack were 30 pieces of paper, each one with the  
name of a classmate or teacher, a drawing and the words ``because 
they deserved to die'' scrawled at the bottom, Youngblood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's father was arrested for allegedly leaving the weapon  
on the floor of his closet where the boy had access to it, 
Youngblood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples of other incidents plaguing students and officials  
Thursday and today: 
</P>
<P>
	--In Cheektowaga, N.Y., a letter referring to the Littleton  
rampage and threatening more violence kept most students away from 
John F. Kennedy High School today and forced the school to close 
early. The letter said the two Colorado attackers were ``the tip of 
the iceberg. ... We are smarter than you inferior parasites. We 
won't get caught and you will all die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The high school in Marathon, Wis., was evacuated today after  
what was thought to be a pipe bomb was found attached to a school 
door, but it was later determined that the device did not contain 
any explosives, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Washington's Bainbridge Island, classes were canceled at all  
five schools today and bomb-sniffing dogs searched the buildings 
after a threatening note was found on a door to the high school. No 
bombs were found. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Ohio's Guernsey County, the East Guernsey, Cambridge and  
Rolling Hills districts canceled classes today for what the 
sheriff's department would describe only as safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Enid, Okla., a school employee found a pipe bomb in a  
restroom of a high school Thursday. Classes were canceled for the 
1,400 students and state troopers disabled the device. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Tavares, Fla., a 10th-grader playing hooky Thursday was  
arrested for making bomb threats that led to the evacuation of 
27,000 students from all 39 Lake County schools in central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a kid doing something really stupid,'' said Sgt.  
Nick Pallitto, Lake County (Fla.) sheriff's spokesman.

<HEADLINE> `Wallstreet.com' Sells for $1M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- What's in a name? For Eric ``Wall  
Street'' Wade and his two partners, it's more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio sold Wade's Internet name -- wallstreet.com -- to Players  
Only, a Venezuelan company, for about $343,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Players Only plans to use the site for a gambling game based on  
stock performance. Players Only has said it will offer stock 
quotes, company information and online trading -- along with 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade, a former Albuquerque stockbroker, and a friend registered  
wallstreet.com for $70 in 1994. They had planned to develop a 
full-scale financial services site, but then they started getting 
unsolicited offers for the name. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners and a friend sold wallstreet.com last week through  
online auctioneers New Commerce Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Domain names -- the combinations of letters, numbers and-or  
symbols that serve as Internet addresses -- can pay off big. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the name altavista.com sold for $3.35 million last  
year. Other recent sales include business.com for $150,000, 
internet.com for $100,000 and tv.com for $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The name wallstreet.com attracted attention immediately, Wade  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between 4,000 and 17,000 people a day would just type `Wall  
Street' into their browser. We called it background noise. People 
were just typing it in to see what would happen.''

<HEADLINE> IOC To Help Pay for Scandal Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- International Olympic Committee members  
might have to accept less than first-class service at the Sydney 
2000 Games to help pay for budgetary damage caused by the Olympics 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, a senior executive board member and chairman of  
the IOC coordination commission, said today the IOC has agreed to 
cut the cost of services it will demand from Sydney to help meet a 
reduced budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)  
last week announced it would cut $48.7 million from the budget, 
blaming in part a lack of sponsorship interest caused by the 
Olympic corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, visiting Sydney to review preparations for the games, met  
with Sydney Olympic sponsors on Tuesday and apologized for the 
damage the scandal caused to the games' marketing potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we played a role in the difficulties of SOCOG to  
reach that (sponsorship) target,'' Rogge said today at the end of 
commission's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take our responsibilities. By reducing the services  
that SOCOG will have to provide to us, we're going to give them a 
substantial saving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Services to the IOC are included in the host city contract.  
Rogge said IOC members' travel, accommodation and some other 
running costs are paid for by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the budget shortfall -- $32.5 million of expected  
sponsor revenue written off and an extra $16 million allocated for 
``contingencies'' -- was not all the IOC's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president Michael Knight, who directly blamed the  
sponsorship shortfall on the IOC scandal, said the IOC accepted 
that ``they are some of the problem and they must go some way 
towards assisting us to resolve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After visiting games venues and being briefed on Sydney's  
readiness, Rogge said preparations were generally up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two areas had been singled out for special attention -- the  
budget and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a delay in the implementation and testing of the sport  
results system -- a major headache at Atlanta in 1996 -- has been 
addressed with more personnel and money being allocated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the commission gave the thumbs-up to arrangements for  
the sports venues, the Olympic villages, hotel accommodation, 
transport, security and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	One venue problem exists -- some local residents oppose part of  
Sydney's famous Bondi beach being closed for the beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said he would consider legal action against the local  
council if it sought to withdraw from an in-principle agreement to 
hold the competition on the beach.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Mass. Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man who barricaded himself on his 14-acre estate  
for nine months in a fight over whether he had to repay a $1.6 
million bank loan was convicted of contempt Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sweeney, who was captured in his home February 1998 by six  
marshals after they broke a window to get in, faces a maximum six 
months in prison when sentenced in August. He said he planned to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say they own the estate because Sweeney and  
his wife, Rhetta, defaulted on their 1987 bank loan, which had been 
taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney, 59, was evicted but refused to leave the estate, which  
once belonged to his great-grandfather, a secretary of the Navy, 
postmaster general and an ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also said the Sweeneys owed $1.4 million in taxes  
in addition to the loan payments, but the Sweeneys said they had 
been swindled by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, anti-government militia members allied themselves  
with the Sweeneys and patrolled the estate, 20 miles outside Boston 
and a few miles up the road from the fox-hunting and polo grounds 
of the Myopia Hunt Club.

<HEADLINE> Army Takes Over Comoros Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORONI, Comoros (AP) -- Army officers seized power in the Comoros  
Republic today, saying the military could not allow the Indian 
Ocean nation to descend into chaos following failed peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio Comoros broadcast a statement by Army Chief of General  
staff Assoumani Azzali that said President Tadjiddine Ben Said 
Massonde had been removed from power. He and other government 
officials had been asked to remain in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate reports of violence on the archipelago.  
</P>
<P>
	``The army has taken over to prevent our country from being  
plunged into chaos. We cannot sit and wait for it to collapse,'' 
said the statement. The radio also played martial music. 
</P>
<P>
	The army announcement marked the fourth coup in the Comoros  
since the country gained independence from France in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The country of 700,000 people is located 190 miles east of the  
coast of Mozambique and is made up of Grand Comore, Moheli and the 
secessionist island of Anjouan. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming Anjouan was being cut off from national revenues  
brought in by the export of cloves, vanilla and ylang-ylang flowers 
for perfume, its leaders first attempted to become a French 
overseas territory like neighboring Mayotte island. But when France 
turned that down, they opted for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of former President Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim sent  
in troops to put down the secession, but they failed. Thousands of 
Anjouan residents have fled to the main island since the fighting 
broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	Army spokesman Lt. Rashidi Abdullah said today from the main  
island that under military rule anyone found harassing people from 
Anjouan would be severely punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want the Anjouan people to leave,'' Abdullah said.  
</P>
<P>
	A peace conference held in Madagascar to resolve the Anjouan  
conflict ended last week with little progress. The Anjouan 
delegation put off signing a framework agreement worked out by the 
Organization of African Unity, pending consultations with 
colleagues at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the OAU-backed agreement -- signed by representatives of  
Grand Comore, Moheli and the Comoros government -- each of the three 
islands would have its own government within a new entity to be 
called the Union of Comorian Islands, which would have a separate 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	When the outcome of the conference became known, gangs in Grand  
Comore began harassing people from Anjouan and forcing them to 
leave on boats to return to their home island. 
</P>
<P>
	Tadjiddine took power after President Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim  
died Nov. 6. Tadjiddine indefinitely postponed presidential 
elections scheduled for February.

<HEADLINE> Faulk Surprise Show at Rams' Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Running back Marshall Faulk, who wants a fresh  
start as well as a new deal, changed his mind about holding out 
until the St. Louis Rams re-work his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk showed up for the team's three-day minicamp, which began  
Friday, in what he said was a show of good faith. It didn't hurt 
that Faulk's agent, Rocky Arceneaux, and Rams executive vice 
president Jay Zygmunt have begun talks on renegotiating the 
seven-year deal he signed as a rookie in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it has anything to do with that,'' Faulk said.  
``I have no clue, to be honest with you, how the contract talks are 
going. I try to stay out of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk is set to make a base salary of $2.2 million next season  
and is seeking a multiyear deal that would pay him closer to $5 
million a year. The Rams indicated they're serious about upgrading 
Faulk's pay by releasing offensive guard Zach Wiegert, who had been 
due to make $3.2 million as the team's transition player, earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, acquired two days before the draft from the Indianapolis  
Colts for second- and fifth-round draft picks, backed off his 
no-show stance after he found out there would be 100 percent 
attendance at what the Rams called a voluntary minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my decision,'' Faulk said. ``I felt if everybody else  
was going to make the commitment, I should put my issues aside and 
come in and show them I'm dedicated to winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk spent his first five professional seasons with the Colts,  
and he's looking forward to the change of scenery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like getting the opportunity to start all over  
again,'' he said. ``But to know what to expect, to know how to deal 
with it, to know what questions are going to be asked, and what's 
going to be asked of you from a team standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, who rushed for 1,319 yards and caught 86 passes last  
year, is among 82 players at the minicamp. The Rams also are 
getting a first look at new quarterback Trent Green, offensive 
guard Adam Timmerman, linebacker Todd Collins, safety Devin Bush 
and the seven-player draft class headed by wide receiver Torry 
Holt.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Committee Hires Ad Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee has hired an  
advertising firm to develop its first ad campaign even as it tries 
to help cover a shortfall in fund-raising for the scandal-ridden 
2002 Salt Lake City Games. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported Friday that the committee expects to start a  
$10 million campaign in print media June 24 and that the ads would 
likely feature past and present Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from ad agency GSD&AMP;M included confirmation from  
Olympic officials, who did not immediately return calls for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Clay Russ, a senior vice president at the ad agency  
GSD&AMP;M, said his agency had been hired about a week ago to develop 
the campaign but said work was just starting. He was unable to 
confirm the spending figure, the starting date or any other 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad plans are being disclosed as the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee is still $300 million short of the $859 million in 
sponsor fees budgeted for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one sponsor -- timekeeper Seiko -- has signed up since the  
reports broke in November that members of the International Olympic 
Committee were given cash and other favors before Salt Lake was 
chosen as host for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson broke off negotiations on a $30 million  
package in part because of the bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Brantley Needs Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jeff Brantley doesn't know how or when he  
hurt his shoulder this time. The Philadelphia Phillies closer just 
knows he needs surgery and probably won't pitch again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley learned Friday that he needs surgery on his torn labrum  
-- the same type of injury that sidelined him for most of the 1997 
season. The only bright spot is that Dr. Craig Morgan told him the 
injury isn't career-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley expects Dr. James Andrews to confirm the diagnosis when  
he visits him Monday in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed that I can't do this job,'' said  
Brantley, acquired from the Cardinals with Ron Gant in an offseason 
trade that sent former Phillies closer Ricky Bottalico to St. 
Louis. ``But I think that they will be happy with me one of these 
days. It may be spring training next year, but they'll get their 
money's worth out of Jeff Brantley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan couldn't determine when Brantley injured his shoulder  
this time. He had arthroscopic surgery in 1997, came back in 1998 
with the Cardinals and pitched through pain all season. Brantley 
said he never had an MRI while with the Cardinals, and believes the 
labrum was torn last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody really asked me about my shoulder last year,'' Brantley  
said. ``They just sat me down in the bullpen and I got a free 
ticket. I really doubt that it happened in spring training. I would 
say, and this is just my feeling, that this was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley had a dominant spring and started the season strong,  
recording four saves with a 2.84 ERA in seven games. He was 
sidelined for 11 days with a sore shoulder, returning to get a save 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting the ninth on Wednesday night, Brantley walked one  
batter and struck out another, then squatted behind the mound 
shaking his head in obvious pain and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley said the pain was nothing like what he felt at spring  
training in 1997, when he blew out his shoulder with one pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only time that I've ever felt like my arm was going  
to explode,'' Brantley said. ``After that, it's just been very 
uncomfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he did in 1997 with the Reds, Brantley said he will stay  
with the Phillies while doing his rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to be here,'' Brantley said. ``I could go home  
and hang out with my family and watch my boy play ball, but these 
guys are paying me a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley makes $2.8 million this season in the last year of his  
contract. The Cardinals are paying $1 million of it as part of the 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	While ruling over the bullpen as an elder statesman in  
Cincinnati, Brantley groomed Jeff Shaw into a dominant closer. He 
taught Shaw everything from how to read scouting reports and what 
to look for in newspapers to the importance of watching early 
batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, Shaw, now with the Dodgers, was the only one in the  
dugout before the game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still amazes me that he can sit there and watch two or  
three pitches and know how to get a guy out,'' Shaw said. ``I'm 
like, `How do you see that?' And he says, `You don't see that? It's 
right there.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Brantley, it appears he'll be doing a lot of  
watching again.

<HEADLINE> China Orders Firms To Get Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's securities regulator urged listed firms  
Friday to take the threat of the Year 2000 computer problem 
seriously and purge their computer systems of any glitches, the 
official Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In an open letter, the China Securities Regulatory Commission  
told the 878 listed firms to spend enough money and acquire enough 
expertise to modify and replace key computer systems so that they 
will not fail at year's end, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firms need to recognize the serious risks the computer glitch,  
known as Y2K, poses to the stability of markets and investor 
confidence, Xinhua cited the letter as saying. It added that firms 
ought to be prepared for lawsuits arising from any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts fear that computers which use only the last two digits  
to mark the year will mistake 2000 for 1900 and malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the letter gave no indication how far along most firms  
were, its underlying tone confirmed assessments by foreign analysts 
that China's preparations were lagging. Last month, the 
government's top Y2K troubleshooter said a lack of money and 
experience were hampering China's readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial securities is one of 18 key sectors in which the  
government is expending all efforts to make sure are Y2K-compliant. 
The government troubleshooter, Zhang Qi, last month praised the 
securities sector for doing an ``excellent job'' in rooting out Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities exchanges and brokerages are supposed to have cleared  
their computer systems of the glitch by May 30. The sector has run 
three tests so far, Xinhua said. The last one, in February, turned 
up some problems, as was expected, officials have said.

<HEADLINE> New `Swan Lake' Opens Ballet Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York City Ballet opened its season with  
a full-evening ballet, a new, two-act ``Swan Lake,'' choreographed 
by Peter Martins. 
</P>
<P>
	It's largely a success, though some scenes lag in the extended  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Darci Kistler, clear in line and sublimely graceful, was  
glorious as the Swan Queen. Damian Woetzel danced a self-effacing 
Prince and Jock Soto was the evil Von Rotbart, a part expanded by 
Martins, ballet master in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Martins choreographed the production after the 1895 work of  
Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov and borrowed steps from George 
Balanchine's one-act version. 
</P>
<P>
	The first scene, at the Prince's 21st birthday party, has women  
guests in green dresses and men in orange tights and blouson tops, 
dancing in flowing patterns. But the scene becomes overlong. 
</P>
<P>
	Several times, Martins introduces tiny boy and girl dancers who  
momentarily steal the show. Providing variety are Benjamin Bowman 
as a spirited jester and a dance by Benjamin Millepied, Jennifer 
Tinsley and Pascale van Kipnis. 
</P>
<P>
	But one wonders, when do we get to the swans?  
</P>
<P>
	The Prince finally goes hunting, where he sees the women who  
have been changed to swans by Rotbart. Kistler uses arm motions to 
express her fear of the Prince and then, arms quivering, indicates 
she is intrigued. Kistler becomes a Swan Queen to make a Prince 
fall in love; she is feminine and self-sufficient, neither weak nor 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
	The four cygnets, Amanda Edge, Carrie Lee Riggins, Janie Taylor  
and Elizabeth Walker, none yet classified as a company soloist, 
were pert and diamond-sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps de ballet was excellent. Martins moves them in  
semicircle and V lines instead of straight lines, keeping the 
classical look but subtly updating it. We missed solos by swans, 
but the length of the first scene apparently prevented those. 
</P>
<P>
	In Act 2, in the palace ballroom, six princesses in pastel gowns  
dance for the Prince, followed by Hungarian, Russian, Spanish and 
Neapolitan diversions. 
</P>
<P>
	Then enter the Black Swan, Rotbart's daughter cloned to look  
like the Swan Queen. In her new guise, Kistler doesn't turn cold; 
her gestures are delicate and feminine enough to fool the Prince. 
Often, near the end of their pas de deux, Rotbart yanks his 
daughter away from the Prince. This breaks the duet's building 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Martins' ending, the Swan Queen suffers heartbreakingly,  
crumbling to the ground, one leg bent under her. Black swans dance 
with white swans. After a short love duet by the Prince and Swan 
Queen, Rotbart falls and dies. But, because the Prince was tricked 
into declaring love for another, the Swan must leave him, 
despairing. 
</P>
<P>
	Per Kirkeby's and Kirsten Lund Nielsen's costumes were elaborate  
while Kirkeby's scenery was usually an abstract painting. In the 
final scene, the backdrop was brown wood, making the stage look 
like a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo Fiorato conducted the Tchaikovsky music. The New York City  
Ballet will dance at the New York State Theater through June 27.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Launches Another Titan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Anxious for a win after two failed  
missions, the Air Force today launched its most powerful rocket 
with an advanced military communication satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything appeared to go well as the 2 million-pound Titan IV  
rumbled into a cloudy sky at 12:30 p.m. Liftoff was 1 1/2 hours late 
because of minor technical problems and overnight thunderstorms 
that put the launch team behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-hour into the flight, the Air Force confirmed the first  
phase of launch had gone as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket carried an $800 million Milstar satellite for the  
Defense Department. It was bound for a 22,300-mile-high orbit where 
the first Milstar was placed in 1994 and the second in 1995. In 
all, six Milstars are planned. The satellites are designed to 
provide secure, jam-proof communication between U.S. commanders and 
troops in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said once the newest Milstar reached orbit,  
they would be unable to release any information if something goes 
wrong until a security review is conducted. Even then, certain 
information may be withheld if officials determine it could be 
exploited by an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, the last time a Titan IV rocket flew, the  
missile-warning satellite on board ended up in a useless orbit 
because of a malfunctioning upper-stage motor. Air Force officials 
acknowledged this week that the satellite will never reach the 
desired 22,300-mile-high orbit and therefore will never perform its 
intended mission. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first Titan IV launch since last August, when the  
rocket and a spy satellite were destroyed in an explosion shortly 
after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined losses of those two missions: nearly $2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Today's mission cost $1.23 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The Milstar program, criticized by the General Accounting Office  
last fall for being outdated and inefficient, was conceived during 
the Cold War and therefore designed to withstand the radiation 
fallout of a nuclear blast. 
</P>
<P>
	The military is less worried about nuclear war and more worried  
about conflicts like the one in Yugoslavia, said Air Force Col. 
Mike Kelly, a deputy commander. But he said the satellites are 
still useful. They have carried targeting information for cruise 
missiles, for instance, Kelly noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reports that say Milstar can't do the job, I think those are  
flat wrong,'' he said. ``If there's only one communication system 
left in the United States in a catastrophe, it will be Milstar -- 
and Milstar will get the word through.''

<HEADLINE> Islanders Introduce Coach Goring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders have taken  
another spin on the coaching carousel. This time they wound up with 
a former player. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Goring was introduced Friday as the ninth head coach in  
the franchise's 27-year history, replacing interim coach Bill 
Stewart who was fired after going 11-19-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a long and successful career as a coach and player,''  
Islanders general manager Mike Milbury said of Goring. ``We've had 
problems as an organization in the last few years with regards to 
stability in our coaching situation. We think he's solved that 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goring becomes the fifth coach for the Islanders since the  
1994-95 season, a span that saw Milbury hold the job on two 
occasions. He started as coach last season and resigned Jan. 21, 
turning the team over to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Goring's playing career spanned 16 seasons with Los Angeles, the  
Islanders and Boston. Immediately after retiring in 1985, he became 
the head coach of the Bruins and was fired during the 1986-87 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has coached on the junior level and in the minor  
leagues, winning consecutive International Hockey League 
championships with the Utah Grizzlies in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thinks very creatively, and more so offensively than  
defensively,'' Milbury said. ``His being a former Islander is also 
a plus, but it's certainly not the reason to go about things. I 
think I have more integrity than to bring in a guy with (this 
former) Stanley Cup team if I didn't think he could do the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goring, who agreed to a multiyear contract, coached Utah to a  
39-34 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, this is almost a dream come true,'' Goring said.  
``Since Al Arbour made me an assistant coach, there hasn't been a 
day that I haven't wanted to step in Al Arbour's shoes and be as 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goring promised the Islanders, who won four consecutive Stanley  
Cups in the 1980s under Arbour, would be more offensive minded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing good happens when the puck is in our end, so I want to  
forecheck and keep the puck in the other end,'' he said. ``Hockey 
is a game of emotions and reactions. I coach that way, and I want 
my players to play that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goring said he isn't concerned about any of the distractions  
that plagued the Islanders the last few seasons, from changes in 
ownership to losing talent to budgetary constraints. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will just coach the team I'm given,'' he said. ``I bleed  
Islander blue. I walked into a practice in Utah last season wearing 
an Islander jacket, and someone said to me, `Old habits die hard.'

<HEADLINE> Attendants Agree To Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- America West flight attendants have approved a  
five-year labor contract, ending more than four years of bitter 
negotiations, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A tentative agreement had been reached last month, hours after a  
strike deadline had expired. That agreement was subject to approval 
by the union's 2,200 members. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 83 percent of those members voted to approve the  
contract by turning in their ballots by Friday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The high turnout and high approval rate make this a clear  
mandate in favor of the contract,'' said Bill McGlashen, president 
of the Association of Flight Attendants Council representing 
America West. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants are the fourth employee group to ratify a  
labor contract at America West, the nation's ninth-largest carrier. 
Pilots were first, followed by mechanics and dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants with 10 to 16 years' experience will see their  
annual pay increase from about $25,000 to $32,200 effective 
Saturday. After 3 1/2 years, that would increase to $33,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Aug. 1, flight attendants will receive for the first  
time a per diem, or daily allowance, of $1.30 per hour for all 
hours spent away from their home base. The rate would increase to 
$1.50 per hour after 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	David Nary of Tempe, Ariz., an America West flight attendant for  
14 years, said he won't have to work overtime any longer to make 
ends meet. His hourly pay will jump from $24.41 to $35.80 under the 
new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we can hold our heads up high. We fought for a contract  
and now we'll be treated as a major league airline, not a 
second-rate one,'' Nary said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the contract process was wrapping up for the flight  
attendants, it's just getting starting for other America West 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Trotti, interim president for the union representing the  
airline's 2,200 baggage handlers, said the company expects to set 
dates for the start of contract negotiations within the next two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Mediation Board on April 13 upheld the handlers'  
vote to join the Transport Workers Union. The airline had claimed 
the vote violated election secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Engel, an analyst at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., welcomed the  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that (America West) has no more contracts  
coming due for a while,'' Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots' contract expires in May 2000, but Engel said neither  
it nor the pending baggage handlers' negotiations were likely to 
present problems in the near future.

<HEADLINE> New Computers for Indian Trust Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure to clean up $3 billion in  
Indian trust funds, the Interior Department is spending $60 million 
on a new computer system that may not work, congressional 
investigators warn. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Thursday by the General Accounting Office said  
Interior is going ahead with the project without analyzing its 
needs adequately and ensuring that it can handle its trust 
information, which requires linking data from different systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is making the same mistakes as other agencies,  
including the Federal Aviation Administration, that have been 
forced to spend millions of dollars in cost overruns on computer 
projects, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian accounts were mismanaged for decades, and the  
department now is being sued by a group of account holders. Lawyers 
in the case say the government could be liable for billions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the GAO, Congress' investigative and auditing arm,  
``confirms my worst fears,'' said the chairman of the Senate Indian 
Affairs Committee, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo. ``In the 
long, sad history of trust fund mismanagement, this may be the most 
irresponsible action of all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interior officials say they saved planning time by buying  
software off the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get this fixed now rather than spending another two  
to three years studying it,'' said Rex Hackler, a spokesman for 
Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. ``The BIA is going to 
incredible lengths to make sure this system is working by the 
deadlines that have been set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new computer system is supposed to give Indians a way to  
check their funds at any time and link the accounts with Interior's 
land records. The system is supposed to be operational in the BIA's 
Billings, Mont., regional office in June and working in all other 
BIA regions by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the Indians who are suing the department said  
Interior should delay the new accounting system. ``We want this 
solved, too, but there's no need to throw money away,'' said Keith 
Harper of the Native Americans Rights Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA had to spend an extra $38 million to make its air  
traffic control systems work together because it had failed to plan 
properly, the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without adequate planning, ``agencies are at risk of building  
and buying systems that are duplicative, incompatible and 
unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Skier Moran Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Former U.S. Olympic freestyle skier Jim  
Moran was released from a hospital today, two months after 
suffering a brain injury when he landed badly during a competition 
at Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran, 26, was released from Craig Hospital and will live in the  
area with his mother and receive outpatient therapy, the hospital 
said in a news release. He hopes later to live in Page, Ariz., for 
a time and eventually return to Park City, Utah, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital said Moran has a ``terrific attitude'' and has made  
``significant progress'' since he was admitted to Craig in 
mid-March. He had been at nearby Swedish Medical Center since his 
accident at the U.S. Freeskiing Open Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran is walking on his own even though his right arm and leg  
remain partially paralyzed, Craig spokesman Kenny Hosack said. But 
he still needs therapy for coordination and endurance. He also 
needs therapy for speech clarity and hoarseness, though he can 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran is beginning to manage his own affairs, Hosack said, but  
he still requires therapy for short-term memory, planning, 
problem-solving and ``other higher cognitive processes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran left the U.S. team after finishing 23rd in the moguls  
competition in the Winter Games last year. He skied to two World 
Cup moguls victories, a 1993 event in Breckenridge and a 1996 
competition in Altenmarkt, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said he hopes to ski competitively again someday.

<HEADLINE> Former Piston Caught in Drug House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Former Detroit Piston Earl Cureton was caught in  
a suspected drug house yesterday and was charged with a misdemeanor 
of loitering in a place of illegal occupation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four others were also charged in the raid on a Detroit home,  
including two with a felony of intent to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	``His demeanor to me was that he's embarrassed to be caught up  
in this,'' Sgt. Marlene Sanders of the police narcotics section 
said. ``He said it was just bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Thursday night raid, police said they confiscated  
$98,800 worth of marijuana, $180,093 in narcotics proceeds, scales 
and two vehicles, including Cureton's Lincoln Navigator. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major operation, obviously,'' Police Chief Benny  
Napoleon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cureton was free on bond and faces a May 6 court date.  
</P>
<P>
	Cureton was scheduled to coach the College All-Stars against the  
Harlem Globetrotters Saturday night. However, Globetrotters 
spokesman Brett Meister said he would not be coaching. Meister said 
he didn't know who made that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Cureton played for the Pistons from 1983 to 1986. He also played  
for Philadelphia, Chicago, the Los Angeles Clippers, Charlotte, New 
York, Houston and Toronto. He retired in 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Exchange Trading Floor Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- During the late 1980s, the daily frenzy on the  
floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was a symbol of Japan's energetic 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But recession has since replaced boom. And today, computers and  
cost-cutting put an end to the 120-year old tradition of 
face-to-face trading on Asia's largest exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge open floor of the Tokyo exchange was once crowded with  
more than 2,000 traders, fighting for position as they used a 
complex sign-language to buy and sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, after the end of the trading day, it was the site of a  
closing ceremony replete with confetti and party noisemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The floor long ago stopped being the center of trading activity.  
Securities companies began switching to faster and more reliable 
electronic trading systems in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	By last year, all Japanese stocks could be traded by computer  
while fewer than 10 percent could be traded directly on the floor. 
Only about 100 employees still worked on the floor and trading 
there accounted for a scant 0.2 percent of Tokyo volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities companies and the exchange will save money by moving  
those workers to more productive jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, it is an epoch-making event but we don't think much  
about it,'' said Isao Kawanaba, a spokesman for Japan's biggest 
brokerage, Nomura Securities. ``There are very few people working 
there now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura's last floor traders would be transferred to other  
divisions, Kawanaba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Computerization isn't the only reason Tokyo trading has become  
more subdued in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged economic downturn and a decade-long decline in stock  
values has forced Japan's biggest brokers to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
	During Japan's ``bubble'' economy, Tokyo's benchmark stock index  
was more than twice its current value. And at the peak of market 
activity in 1988, there was more than twice as much trading as last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor trading is still done in New York and Frankfurt, Germany  
but other major exchanges have ceased already and gone completely 
electronic. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1986, stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, and  
Paris have closed their trading floors. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have been traded on a Tokyo exchange since 1878, though  
the market was closed for almost four years from 1945 as the 
country focused its attention on repairing its war-torn economy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. occupation forces used the trading floor briefly as a gym  
and dance hall before the exchange opened again in 1949, following 
Japan's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge trading floor, with it's 165-foot-high ceiling, will be  
remodeled for use as a stock and corporate information center.

<HEADLINE> Spandau Ballet Loses Royalties Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The High Court rejected a claim Friday by three  
former members of the pop group Spandau Ballet for hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in royalties from the band's former 
songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Sir Hugh Park said he found it ``unconscionable'' for  
singer Tony Hadley, drummer John Keeble and sax player Steve Norman 
to claim large sums in royalties from Gary Kemp for songs he had 
written. 
</P>
<P>
	The three argued they were entitled to a share of Kemp's  
earnings from the publishing rights to the band's string of 1980s 
hits, including ``True'' and ``Gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said they had a verbal agreement with Kemp that they would  
each receive one-twelfth of all the royalties from the songs. 
</P>
<P>
	All three have struggled to build successful careers since the  
band folded while Kemp and his brother, Martin, the group's bass 
player, have become successful actors.

<HEADLINE> Bus of Deaf Children Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAIDWOOD, Ill. (AP) -- A bus carrying deaf children to a  
spelling bee flipped over on Interstate 55 today, killing one man 
and injuring 23 people, one critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was carrying deaf schoolchildren from the John Powers  
Center in Vernon Hills, a Chicago suburb, to the gathering in 
downstate East Peoria when it crashed at about 7 a.m. near 
Braidwood, about 50 miles southwest of Chicago, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The southbound bus had drifted into the center median and was  
clipped by a northbound car while the bus' driver was trying to get 
back into the southbound lanes, according to Wilmington Police 
Chief Jim Metta. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus appears to have flipped over more than once before  
coming to rest in a ditch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the approximately seven adults on the bus were pinned  
underneath it, and one of the two was killed, he said. The man was 
the father of a girl on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	At Provena Saint Joseph Medical Center in Joliet, 31-year-old  
man was in critical condition and three adults were in serious 
condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. Three others -- two children 
and an adult -- at Provena were in good condition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen others were taken to three other hospitals. None of  
their injuries were considered life-threatening, according to 
hospital spokeswomen.

<HEADLINE> Reliever Slocumb Released by Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles released reliever  
Heathcliff Slocumb on Friday, less than 24 hours after he yielded 
seven runs in one inning and walked off the mound with a 12.46 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Slocumb, who signed with Baltimore as a free agent in January,  
allowed 12 earned runs in 10 appearances. He had not given up a run 
in four straight outings before Kansas City homered twice in a 
seven-run ninth inning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I had a bad game last night. Other than that I  
thought I was throwing fine,'' Slocumb said. ``It's definitely a 
surprise to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents were batting .395 against Slocumb, who never showed  
the form he displayed while compiling a 2.08 ERA in spring 
training. The Orioles are responsible for his entire $1.1 million 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some good guys going in the minors, and I figure  
it's time to go with some youth,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. 
``Maybe a breath of fresh air will do us some good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slocumb, 32, has pitched in 434 major league games since making  
his debut with the Chicago Cubs in 1991. He came to Baltimore after 
spending 1 1/2 years with the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had a pretty decent spring,'' he said. ``The only  
thing anybody can ask for is opportunity. I felt like I was going 
to get that, with this being a pretty successful organization. 
Obviously it didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles filled the void by calling up right-handed reliever  
Gabe Molina, who had four saves and a 0.00 in nine games with 
Triple-A Rochester. Molina, 23, has never pitched in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to bring up some young kids that's fine by me,''  
Slocumb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slocumb was only part of the reason why the Orioles entered  
Friday night's game against Minnesota with a major league high 6.76 
ERA 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a point of telling him I wasn't blaming him,'' Miller  
said. ``We've got to do something. We're scoring almost five runs a 
game and giving up seven. It doesn't take a genius to know why 
we're 5-16.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Slocumb: ``I know the nature of the game and I know there  
is a lot of pressure on this organization to be successful. Whether 
I thought things were done fairly or unfairly is irrelevant.''

<HEADLINE> Attorneys Spar in Cable Car Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A videotape made during a Marine jet  
training mission that resulted in the deaths of 20 people at an 
Italian ski resort would have provided irrefutable evidence about 
the flight before the accident, a Navy investigator testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigator, Mark Fallon, also said Thursday that he  
considered his work a criminal investigation from the day it 
started -- one day after the Feb. 3, 1998, accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The date is important because prosecutors say Capt. Richard  
Ashby, 32, should have known an inquiry was under way when he 
helped get rid of the video a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is accused of obstruction of  
justice for allegedly tampering with the tape. He could be 
sentenced to 10 years in prison or dismissed from the service if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate jury acquitted him of 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter stemming from the tragedy near Cavalese, Italy, when a 
gondola plunged to the ground after a support cable was cut by 
Ashby's jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitted taking the tape from the jet, leaving a blank  
one in its place and later giving it to his navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. But he maintains he did not 
intend to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy and was sentenced to dismissal from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, a firefighter testified that after the jet  
landed, Ashby tried twice to get into the cockpit of the EA-6B 
Prowler ``to get a map and some other equipment.'' Master Sgt. 
Richard Henry said he denied Ashby access both times because of 
safety concerns. The crippled jet was leaking hydraulic fluid and 
its right wing was nearly sheared off.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Matches Iraq Air War Duration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now in its 38th day, NATO's air war in  
Yugoslavia has lasted as long as the U.S.-led air campaign in the 
1991 Gulf War, which on Day 39 added a ground attack to kick Iraq 
out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	On Day 38 of Operation Allied Force -- designed to compel  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to give up his grip on Kosovo 
-- the bombs kept falling with little sign that Milosevic was near 
the breaking point. NATO warplanes today struck Yugoslav army 
headquarters and the interior ministry in Belgrade in what alliance 
officials called the strongest attack so far on the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no consensus in NATO for committing ground troops, and,  
some say, no political will to go all out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're setting it out piecemeal,'' said retired Gen. Michael  
Dugan, who was Air Force chief of staff when the Iraqis invaded 
Kuwait in August 1990. He said in an interview Thursday that he saw 
signs of a toughening in NATO's approach, including the decision to 
send more B-52 bombers into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	At this stage of the U.S.-led air war against Iraq, there was  
little doubt about the outcome. The allies had wrecked Iraqi air 
defenses and destroyed an estimated one-third of his armor in 
Kuwait. Hundreds of Iraqi soldiers already had been taken prisoner 
and those that remained in Kuwait were desperate. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Bush gave Iraqi President Saddam Hussein a  
deadline of Feb. 23 to give up Kuwait or face a U.S.-led land 
invasion, there were about 700,000 allied troops -- including 
520,000 Americans -- poised on the Saudi Arabian border to barrel 
across desert sand berms into Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Balkans, by contrast, NATO has fewer than 20,000 soldiers  
on the ground, and most of them are occupied with housing refugees 
in Albania and Macedonia. What's more, NATO says it has not even 
begun to develop a battle plan for ground troops; it insists that a 
land campaign will not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 38 days of the air war against Iraq, 46 Americans  
were killed in action. Thus far in the current conflict, not a 
single U.S. or allied troop has been reported killed, either in 
combat or in accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons between the air campaigns against Iraq and  
Yugoslavia are limited in many respects, although many military 
analysts use the Gulf War example in criticizing NATO for not using 
overwhelming force. By Day 38 in the Gulf, the allies had flown 
about 90,000 missions, compared with 12,000 so far in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	It might also be said, however, that the United States is still  
fighting the air war in Iraq. American and British planes carried 
out a four-day bombing campaign in Iraq last December, and since 
then have been bombing air defense targets in northern and southern 
Iraq with almost daily regularity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Day 38 of the U.S.-led air war against Iraq, U.S. officials  
announced that allied bombing had destroyed 39 percent of Iraqi 
tanks in Kuwait, 32 percent of all armored vehicles and 48 percent 
of artillery. Once the ground troops stormed into Kuwait, the 
Iraqis were ready to quit within 100 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	So far in Kosovo, by NATO's estimate, the Serbs have lost no  
more than 15 percent of their tanks, although the efficiency of 
attacks on armor is likely to improve once the Army puts its Apache 
attack helicopters into action. Defense Secretary William Cohen 
said Thursday the Apache crews have ``some more training to do'' 
before the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, will send them into 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and other U.S. officials are quick to point out the  
differences between Yugoslavia and the Gulf War. One is that 
bombing is more difficult in the Balkans, where frequent low cloud 
cover makes it difficult to target from high altitude. The Iraqis 
were mostly exposed in the open desert, whereas the Serbs have 
hills and forest to hide their armor and air defense systems. There 
also are more civilians to keep out of the line of fire in Serbia, 
where many military and communications targets are near civilian 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers comparison also is somewhat misleading. The allies  
were flying as many as 2,900 missions a day in Iraq, compared with 
600 on a big day in Yugoslavia. While there is no question that the 
air campaign in Iraq was more intense, technological advances since 
1991 have enabled NATO planes to hit more targets in Yugoslavia 
with fewer total bombs than was true during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 9 percent of bombs used in the Gulf were of the  
precision-guided variety, compared with more than 90 percent in the 
current campaign, according to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<P>
	On Day 38 of Operation Allied Force -- designed to compel  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to give up his grip on Kosovo 
-- the bombs kept falling with little sign that Milosevic was near 
the breaking point. NATO warplanes today struck Yugoslav army 
headquarters and the interior ministry in Belgrade in what alliance 
officials called the strongest attack so far on the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no consensus in NATO for committing ground troops, and,  
some say, no political will to go all out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're setting it out piecemeal,'' said retired Gen. Michael  
Dugan, who was Air Force chief of staff when the Iraqis invaded 
Kuwait in August 1990. He said in an interview Thursday that he saw 
signs of a toughening in NATO's approach, including the decision to 
send more B-52 bombers into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	At this stage of the U.S.-led air war against Iraq, there was  
little doubt about the outcome. The allies had wrecked Iraqi air 
defenses and destroyed an estimated one-third of his armor in 
Kuwait. Hundreds of Iraqi soldiers already had been taken prisoner 
and those that remained in Kuwait were desperate. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Bush gave Iraqi President Saddam Hussein a  
deadline of Feb. 23 to give up Kuwait or face a U.S.-led land 
invasion, there were about 700,000 allied troops -- including 
520,000 Americans -- poised on the Saudi Arabian border to barrel 
across desert sand berms into Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Balkans, by contrast, NATO has fewer than 20,000 soldiers  
on the ground, and most of them are occupied with housing refugees 
in Albania and Macedonia. What's more, NATO says it has not even 
begun to develop a battle plan for ground troops; it insists that a 
land campaign will not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 38 days of the air war against Iraq, 46 Americans  
were killed in action. Thus far in the current conflict, not a 
single U.S. or allied troop has been reported killed, either in 
combat or in accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons between the air campaigns against Iraq and  
Yugoslavia are limited in many respects, although many military 
analysts use the Gulf War example in criticizing NATO for not using 
overwhelming force. By Day 38 in the Gulf, the allies had flown 
about 90,000 missions, compared with 12,000 so far in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	It might also be said, however, that the United States is still  
fighting the air war in Iraq. American and British planes carried 
out a four-day bombing campaign in Iraq last December, and since 
then have been bombing air defense targets in northern and southern 
Iraq with almost daily regularity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Day 38 of the U.S.-led air war against Iraq, U.S. officials  
announced that allied bombing had destroyed 39 percent of Iraqi 
tanks in Kuwait, 32 percent of all armored vehicles and 48 percent 
of artillery. Once the ground troops stormed into Kuwait, the 
Iraqis were ready to quit within 100 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	So far in Kosovo, by NATO's estimate, the Serbs have lost no  
more than 15 percent of their tanks, although the efficiency of 
attacks on armor is likely to improve once the Army puts its Apache 
attack helicopters into action. Defense Secretary William Cohen 
said Thursday the Apache crews have ``some more training to do'' 
before the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, will send them into 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and other U.S. officials are quick to point out the  
differences between Yugoslavia and the Gulf War. One is that 
bombing is more difficult in the Balkans, where frequent low cloud 
cover makes it difficult to target from high altitude. The Iraqis 
were mostly exposed in the open desert, whereas the Serbs have 
hills and forest to hide their armor and air defense systems. There 
also are more civilians to keep out of the line of fire in Serbia, 
where many military and communications targets are near civilian 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers comparison also is somewhat misleading. The allies  
were flying as many as 2,900 missions a day in Iraq, compared with 
600 on a big day in Yugoslavia. While there is no question that the 
air campaign in Iraq was more intense, technological advances since 
1991 have enabled NATO planes to hit more targets in Yugoslavia 
with fewer total bombs than was true during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 9 percent of bombs used in the Gulf were of the  
precision-guided variety, compared with more than 90 percent in the 
current campaign, according to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<HEADLINE> Derby Trainer of Decade Up for Grabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Nick Zito remembers his first Kentucky  
Derby well. The trainer remembers his second Kentucky Derby even 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember standing there looking at everything, talking to a  
reporter and lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back,'' Zito said 
Thursday. ``Finally, she asked, `What are you looking at?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her I didn't want to miss anything.''  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't. On his second trip to Churchill Downs, in 1991, Zito  
won his first Kentucky Derby with Strike the Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, he won again with Go for Gin, making him one  
of three trainers to win a pair of Derbys this decade. Bob Baffert 
and D. Wayne Lukas are the others: Baffert won the last two with 
Real Quiet in '98 and Silver Charm in '97; Lukas won the two before 
with Grindstone in '96 and Thunder Gulch in '95. 
</P>
<P>
	A win Saturday by any of them would break the tie and leave the  
victor with the distinction of being the Derby's ``Trainer of the 
Decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After you win, it's like `wow!' and you just want to keep  
going,'' said Zito, glancing around the backstretch Thursday to 
make sure his Derby horses, Adonis and Stephen Got Even, were OK. 
``It's unbelievable to think you've won two Kentucky Derbys and 
you're pushing for a third one. That's what makes America great, 
huh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, with the most formidable contingent of all for the  
Derby, is pushing for an unprecedented three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there's going to be a year when I don't have anything,  
so I just try to stay calm and cool and enjoy the moment,'' Baffert 
said. ``The Derby's become a fun thing for me, like a 
minivacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coupled entry of the gelding General Challenge and the filly  
Excellent Meeting is the morning favorite at 3-1, while Prime 
Timber is the second choice in the full field of 20 3-year-olds at 
7-2. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Baffert scratched Excellent Meeting from today's  
Kentucky Oaks, deciding to run her in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sort of had it planned, but didn't want to say anything. We  
always had the Derby in mind, but we wanted to leave it up to fate 
and see how we drew, and something told me she needs to run,'' 
Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, meanwhile, is the veteran of the group, a trainer who has  
saddled at least one Derby horse every year starting in 1981. His 
first win came with the filly Winning Colors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Zito will be in his ninth Derby, the 46-year-old  
Baffert his fourth. Both trainers won their first Derby the second 
time around -- Zito after Thirty Six Red finished ninth in 1990; and 
Baffert after Cavonnier was second and Semoran 14th in '96. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected to racing's Hall of Fame on Tuesday, the 63-year-old  
Lukas will send out Cat Thief and Charismatic in the 1 1/4-mile Derby, 
which will carry a record purse of $1,201,200 if all 20 horses 
start. The winner's share would be a record $901,200. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been a friendly rivalry among the three, with Zito  
claiming he picked the No. 1 post for Adonis because ``I don't want 
to be near Baffert's horses,'' and Lukas reminding the others he's 
already won three Derbys. Baffert's horses will leave from post 
Nos. 6, 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, success breeds success and owners have been quick to  
jump on the Baffert bandwagon. Lukas and Zito do OK, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert trains General Challenge and Excellent Meeting for John  
and Betty Mabee, three-time Eclipse Award-winning breeders; Prime 
Timber for timber executive Aaron Jones; and Silver Charm for Bob 
and Beverly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has been the longtime trainer for William T. Young, but  
also trains for the Lewises; Zito plays on his New York connections 
and trains for Yankees boss George Steinbrenner and Boston Celtics 
president and coach Rick Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been talk all week about the Derby, about who's going  
to do what and how it's going to unfold and riders and trainers and 
different guys doing different things,'' Lukas said, ``but the 
bottom line is it gets down to the horse, and I've been blessed 
with prime dollars and owners who are very supportive and let me 
come here year after year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lukas has collected 10 wins in Triple Crown races starting  
with Codex's 1980 Preakness victory, Baffert has four classic 
victories in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Zito sees it, no matter how impressive your stable is,  
you still have to be ``blessed and lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Baffert's had a very strong hand the last couple of years, the  
guy has been unbelievably great,'' Zito said. ``And he's got two 
more shots this year. But you still have to be lucky, real lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, Lukas and Zito are not alone in their search for racing  
luck Saturday. They may have seven horses in the field, but there 
are other top contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, the Blue Grass winner trained by Elliott Walden, is the  
third choice in the betting at 5-1. Walden made a splash in the 
classics last year when Victory Gallop spoiled Real Quiet's bid for 
the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's not forget Florida Derby winner Vicar, a 6-1 shot trained  
by Carl Nafzger, who won the 1990 Derby with Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the mystery horses from Dubai, Aljabr and  
Worldly Manner, the coupled entry at 12-1. Neither colt ran a 
traditional 3-year-old prep race, but Baffert trained Worldly 
Manner as a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Godolphin Stable, and rest of Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum and  
Sheikh Maktoum al Maktoum's racing empire, is in its first Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``To come here and win the first time,'' Sheikh Mohammed said,  
``would be over the moon.''

<HEADLINE> GM Plans Ads During 2002 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is moving ahead with plans  
to use the Olympics as a marketing platform to boost its slumping 
U.S. market share. 
</P>
<P>
	This is despite revelations that Salt Lake City officials bribed  
members of the International Olympic Committee. The controversy 
surrounding the games has driven some sponsors, including Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson, away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen anything on the horizon that devalues the  
Olympics,'' Phil Guarascio, GM's vice-president for advertising and 
corporate marketing, told The Detroit News for a story published 
Friday. ``Our original vision to use the Olympics as a marketing 
platform is still valid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM signed a $1 billion pact in July 1997 to become the official  
car and truck of the U.S. Olympic Committee and 41 governing sports 
groups through the 2008 Olympic games. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, GM will concentrate its Olympic marketing and  
sponsorship support on teams and athletes. The automaker plans to 
unveil details of its latest Olympic-themed television and print 
advertising on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad campaign will open this summer, 18 months before the 2000  
summer games in Sydney. The bulk of GM's spending will be for 
commercials on NBC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Oldsmobile and Chevrolet divisions plan to use Olympic  
magic to boost their image. 
</P>
<P>
	Oldsmobile disclosed plans Thursday to provide more than $1  
million in prize money to sponsor nine beach volleyball tournaments 
starting in May. Beginning in 2000, the Olympic rings will be 
featured in Oldsmobile advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games are an important springboard to reinvent  
Oldsmobile,'' Michael Sands, advertising and sales promotion 
director for the Oldsmobile Alero, told the News. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Chevrolet extended its sponsorship of the U.S. Ski,  
Snowboard and Hockey Olympic teams through 2004, and is negotiating 
to extend its sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic figure skating team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is on what we feel will endure -- the athletes and  
competition that will unfold on the rink and on the slope,'' said 
Mac Whisner, Chevrolet's director of truck advertising and 
promotion.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Corporate restructuring efforts helped send Japan's  
jobless rate to yet another record high of 4.8 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest government unemployment rate figure reported today  
topped the previous all-time high of 4.6 percent set in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs remain scarce and the situation is unlikely to improve  
soon, government officials say. The jobless data are likely to 
heighten pessimism about the nation's economy, which could further 
hurt chances for a turnaround as worried consumers curtail 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Lackluster consumer spending is a major reason the Japanese  
economy has not been able to rescue itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies are under pressure to trim workers because of  
Japan's economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unemployment situation is becoming increasingly severe.  
And it is our most important task to tackle the situation,'' Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The results sent the major barometer of the Tokyo Stock Exchange  
falling. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 240.71 
points, or 1.42 percent, closing the week at 16,701.53 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Those out of work reached a record 3.39 million in March, while  
those employed fell by 840,000 from a year earlier to 63.84 million 
-- the 14th straight month of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Income for wage earners in the fiscal year ended March 31 fell  
1.3 person from the previous year -- the biggest drop since the 
government started keeping records in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The government found that spending fell 0.9 percent on the year  
in the fiscal year ended March 31, after dropping 2.3 percent in 
fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending by Japanese wage earners in March averaged $3,100, down  
3.6 percent from a year ago, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the government said that there were only 88 new jobs  
per 100 job-seekers for March. That was down from the figure a year 
ago of 96 new job offers per 100 job-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Ministry also said there were 49 job offers for every  
100 people looking for jobs last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Job offers plunged compared to the previous year in most  
sectors, including manufacturing and construction, the Labor 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	By age, unemployment was especially serious for youngsters,  
surging to 11.7 percent last month for those between the ages of 15 
and 24, up 1.8 percentage points from the same month a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Misses Tonight's Playoff Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Pittsburgh forward Jaromir Jagr  
missed his fourth straight playoff game tonight with a groin injury 
that might sideline him for the rest of the Penguins' first-round 
playoff series with New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I feel the way I feel now, I won't play,'' Jagr said after  
arriving at the Continental Airlines Arena a little more than a 
hour before Game 5 of the best-of-7 series that is tied at two 
games apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr was quick to point out that things could change quickly,  
but the NHL's leading scorer added he would not be able to play in 
his current condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible to start and stop,'' Jagr said, noting that's  
the key to his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr re-aggravated the groin injury late in Game 1, a 3-1  
Devils' victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh won the next two games without him, but the Devils  
evened the series with a 4-2 win Tuesday night. Jagr said Wednesday 
that he expected to play in Game 5, but he struggled skating in 
practice on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not come to the arena for the morning skate on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever he is ready to come back, we'll welcome him back with  
open arms,'' Penguins forward Matthew Barnaby. ``We just have to 
focus on the game.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots, Conn. Discuss Move Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Despite environmental concerns that could  
delay stadium construction and a counteroffer from Massachusetts, 
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft remains committed to moving 
his team to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft and Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland met for four hours  
Thursday night to discuss the state's plans to build the team a 
$380 million stadium on the Hartford waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland said the state is making substantial progress toward  
meeting its commitment to finish the stadium by 2002, and is 
working with Kraft and the Patriots to convince NFL owners to vote 
in favor of the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal and the Patriots' goal is to open the 2002 season here  
in Hartford,'' Rowland said. ``As I've said so many times before, 
it will happen. Failure is not an option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported today that Kraft has received a report  
from consultants who say it is unlikely the stadium will be ready 
on time. There are several outstanding issues that could delay 
construction, including the contamination of the site, and delays 
in moving a steam plant off the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the governor nor Kraft would take any questions from  
reporters. Kraft did not say whether he believed that environmental 
problems with the stadium site could be resolved, or whether he 
would consider the new offer from Massachusetts if Connecticut 
fails to meet its deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal agreed to by Bay State leaders this week,  
Massachusetts would pay $70 million for infrastructure supporting a 
new stadium in Foxboro, Mass., the team's current home. But Kraft 
would have to pay for the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal has always been to play in a new stadium in downtown  
Hartford in 2002,'' Kraft said. ``That was the spirit of our 
discussion tonight and as usual it was very frank and candid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is scheduled to vote on whether to approve the Patriots  
move from Foxboro on May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next five weeks, we're going to continue working  
together because it's our mutual goal to convince the NFL ownership 
that the deal we struck last fall was in the best interest of the 
team, the fans and all those involved, including the league,'' 
Rowland said. ``We're confident we can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, who was traveling in  
California, was not surprised at the comments from Kraft and 
Rowland, Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly wasn't unexpected that the Patriots and Hartford  
would continue their talks,'' she said. ``We would expect Kraft 
would want to keep all his options open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact remains that Massachusetts has a lot to offer that  
Connecticut just can't match. That is the loyal fan base and the 
media market,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Connecticut Attorney General Richard  
Blumenthal said he was preparing to sue the NFL for actively 
promoting Massachusetts' bid to keep the Patriots, despite the 
agreement Kraft signed to come to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit would charge the NFL with interfering with the  
agreement between Connecticut and Kraft, and with restraining 
competition, by trying to block a move by the Patriots to Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL is proactively intervening to lure the team away from  
an agreement the team has with Connecticut,'' Blumenthal said. ``We 
could sue for hundreds of millions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal referred to a visit by NFL commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue to Boston last week. Tuesday night, Bay State legislative 
leaders announced a plan to keep the team. 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit, Tagliabue said that Massachusetts was the  
``optimal'' home for the Patriots. NFL officials have said in the 
past that they prefer that the team stay in Boston, the sixth 
largest television market in the country. Hartford is 27th. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of proactive intervention to interfere in an  
established agreement is what may violate the law,'' Blumenthal 
said. Kraft signed an agreement with Connecticut on Feb. 12.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Economy Cuts 3M Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- 3M reported a 4 percent drop in  
first-quarter earnings due to the weak Brazilian economy and a 
strong dollar overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maplewood-based maker of Scotch brand tape, scouring pads  
and other consumer, industrial and electronics products, said 
Friday it earned $384 million, or 95 cents per share, compared with 
$400 million, or 98 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That was above Wall Street's expectations. Analysts surveyed by  
First Call Corp. expected earnings of 91 cents a share for 
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter sales rose 2 percent to $3.78 billion from $3.70  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Results benefited from an improvement in sales in the  
Asia-Pacific area, healthy productivity gains and solid growth in 
several of our U.S. businesses, but were negatively affected by the 
Brazilian economic situation and continued strengthening of the 
U.S. dollar,'' said L.D. DeSimone, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in currency exchange rates reduced earnings by an  
estimated 2 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSimone said the company is on schedule with its restructuring  
activities, which involve reductions in corporate structure, 
consolidation of manufacturing operations and withdrawal from 
low-return and non-core product lines.

<HEADLINE> Govt Takes Low Profile in Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State Department officials view Monday's  
rematch between the Baltimore Orioles and Cuba as a ``significant 
people-to-people event'' and say it will have little impact on 
relations with Fidel Castro's government. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the game Baltimore won 3-2 in extra innings in Havana a  
month ago, the Cuban president will not be in the stands. Neither 
will President Clinton, or any other high U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department isn't talking much about the game with the  
Cuban all-stars, except to acknowledge that a few of its employees 
might show up -- if they buy their own tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Clinton administration official briefed reporters  
Friday on the nearly sold-out game, but said his name couldn't be 
used. ``We're not in the position of encouraging defection; we're 
not in the position of discouraging defection,'' he said when asked 
about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	He said no special measures were being taken to deal with any  
defectors but added that Immigration and Naturalization Service 
personnel would likely be at the game. There is also no indication 
the Cubans will be bringing along security personnel to deflect any 
defectors, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team is expected to arrive on two chartered planes wit  
a total of about 300 people -- roughly the same number of Americans 
in the Orioles entourage to Cuba. Traveling with the team will be 
Cuban journalists, retired players and students. 
</P>
<P>
	The top Cuban official at the game is expected to be Jose  
Fernandez, head of the Cuban Olympic Committee. Fernandez also 
attended the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 65.87 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks headed higher today, pushing the Dow  
Jones industrial average closer to 11,000, after a government 
report said the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
65.87 to 10,944.25, less than 56 points from 11,000. The Dow has 
set a record high close in each of the last three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Nasdaq composite index  
was up 36.57 to 2,565.01 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 
7.82 to 1,350.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy grew at a strong 4.5 percent annual rate in the  
first three months of this year, far above expectations, as 
consumers spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the solid growth in the  
gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, 
came despite the fact that the nation's trade deficit, battered by 
overseas economic turmoil, soared to a record level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an economy that is performing exceptionally well,''  
said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. 
``We're seeing vigorous demand in the U.S. and have a comfortable 
inflation situation which is a favorable setting for the stock 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Dow higher was Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing,  
up 4 7/8 to 90 1/2, after 3M reported higher than expected first-quarter 
profits. Dow component United Technologies, which announced a 
two-for-one stock split today, was up 3 9/16 to 147 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also rallied after three days of losses.  
</P>
<P>
	America Online advanced 3 1/8 to 144 1/2. Hewlett-Packard rose 1 1/8 to  
79 1/2 after a Merrill Lynch analyst said the personal computer maker 
will likely top second-quarter earnings estimates of 79 cents per 
share. IBM rose 4 13/16 to 209 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 402.7 million shares, 
slightly below Thursday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.66 to 640.75 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.38 to 781.38.

<HEADLINE> Attorneys Spar in Cable Car Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A videotape made during a Marine jet  
training mission that resulted in the deaths of 20 people at an 
Italian ski resort would have provided irrefutable evidence about 
the flight before the accident, a Navy investigator testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigator, Mark Fallon, also said Thursday that he  
considered his work a criminal investigation from the day it 
started -- one day after the Feb. 3, 1998, accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The date is important because prosecutors say Capt. Richard  
Ashby, 32, should have known an inquiry was under way when he 
helped get rid of the video a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is accused of obstruction of  
justice for allegedly tampering with the tape. He could be 
sentenced to 10 years in prison or dismissed from the service if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate jury acquitted him of 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter stemming from the tragedy near Cavalese, Italy, when a 
gondola plunged to the ground after a support cable was cut by 
Ashby's jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitted taking the tape from the jet, leaving a blank  
one in its place and later giving it to his navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. But he maintains he did not 
intend to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy and was sentenced to dismissal from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, a firefighter testified that after the jet  
landed, Ashby tried twice to get into the cockpit of the EA-6B 
Prowler ``to get a map and some other equipment.'' Master Sgt. 
Richard Henry said he denied Ashby access both times because of 
safety concerns. The crippled jet was leaking hydraulic fluid and 
its right wing was nearly sheared off.

                         *Michael E. Barron    	
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Michael E. Barron, a supervising editor in the  
Atlanta bureau of The Associated Press for four decades, died 
Wednesday of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron had been in charge of the AP's report for afternoon  
newspapers in Georgia since the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron joined the AP in 1960 after two years as a reporter at  
The Valdosta Daily Times. Earlier, he worked as an editor at The 
Atlanta Constitution for two years, interrupted by six months 
active duty in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his AP career, Barron worked as Atlanta sports editor,  
covering, among other things, the Masters golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf was Barron's love, and in 1978 he wrote a first-person  
story about playing the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland. He 
worked the overnight shift in part because it allowed him to play 
18 holes nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron was involved in countless national stories, from the  
civil rights movement to the Atlanta child slayings of the early 
1980s to the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by two aunts and several cousins.

<P>
	BRIARCLIFF MANOR, N.Y. (AP) -- Rolf W. Landauer, who helped bring  
the concept of information into the mainstream of physics, died 
Tuesday of brain cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Landauer's landmark work in the early 1960s helped show that the  
binary code of ones and zeroes that runs computers was tangible. He 
found that information was rooted in the real world, and could be 
understood by applying the laws of physics. 
</P>
<P>
	Landauer, who worked at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center,  
pioneered the exploration of the theoretical limits of computers in 
terms of power, speed and memory capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	He developed a theory, now called Landauer's principle, refuting  
the widely-held belief that processing a bit of information 
processed by a computer consumed some energy, limiting computer 
power. The increasing efficiency of computer technology, though, 
has shown that computations can be carried out with lessening 
amounts of energy.

laser and a Nobel Prize winner, died Wednesay from pneumonia and 
congestive heart failure after a long battle with leukemia. He was 
77. 
</P>
<P>
	Schawlow attended the University of Toronto on a mathematics and  
physics scholarship. A postdoctoral fellowship sent him to Columbia 
University to work with Charles H. Townes, with whom he later 
invented the laser. The pair received a patent for their invention 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Schawlow joined the physics department at Stanford. In  
1981, he received a Nobel Prize for physics.

<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Lyric soprano Maria Stader, one of  
the leading performers of Mozart arias, died Tuesday. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	She retired from the stage after a final 1969 performance of  
Mozart's Requiem in New York's Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Stader rarely appeared in operas, instead concentrating on  
concerts, and was sought out by leading conductors including Bruno 
Walter and Herbert von Karajan. 
</P>
<P>
	Stader rose to prominence when she won an international  
competition in Geneva in 1939. She spent World War II in 
Switzerland, but went on to sing throughout Europe in the post-war 
years, specializing in Bach cantatas and masses and particularly in 
Mozart's concert arias. 
</P>
<P>
	She made her U.S. debut in 1954 and performed with the  
Philadelphia Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Cleveland 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950 and 1956, she was awarded the Lilli Lehmann medal for  
outstanding artistic achievement by the Mozarteum in Salzburg, 
Austria.

three Tom Clancy books and won an Oscar in 1982 for ``Missing,'' 
died Wednesday of cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's first screenplay was ``Jackson County Jail'' in 1976.  
He also wrote the movie scripts for the Clancy movies ``The Hunt 
for Red October,'' ``Clear and Present Danger'' and ``Patriot 
Games.''

musical director for several Las Vegas acts including Ronald 
Reagan, died Sunday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Van gave comedian Redd Foxx his first job in Las Vegas and  
opened the city's first rock 'n' roll club. Van signed Foxx in 1964 
as an opening act for Dinah Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Van was established as a ``society bandleader,'' playing mostly  
ballroom dances, when he took a job at the old El Rancho Vegas in 
June 1942. He remained to become one of Las Vegas' best-known 
musical figures. 
</P>
<P>
	As leader of the house band at The Last Frontier, Van was the  
bandleader for Ronald Reagan when the future president headlined 
the hotel showroom in February 1954.

<HEADLINE>  Author of Chernobyl Virus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The author of the Chernobyl computer virus  
told investigators that he created the bug hoping to humiliate and 
take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software 
providers, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted he didn't expect it to cause worldwide damage, a  
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen Ing-hau, 24, looked nervous and was speechless when he was  
mobbed by reporters after being summoned for police questioning on 
his involvement in a case that caused at least 600,000 computer 
meltdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chernobyl virus -- known in Taiwan as the CIH, for Chen's  
initials -- had even pressed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to 
study antivirus programs to prevent it from invading its computers, 
the police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of  
computer engineering at the Institute of Technology. Chen has since 
graduated and has been undergoing Taiwan's mandatory two-year 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen had spent long hours playing computer games since entering  
college and was a frequent victim of computer viruses when 
downloading video games and other software from the Internet, the 
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he created the highly vicious virus that could avoid  
detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool 
of the software providers, from whom he had bought antivirus 
programs that proved useless,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact. He  
regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26,  
the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to 
erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system 
settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Taiwanese law, someone convicted of spreading computer  
viruses can face up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say whether Chen will be charged. Computer  
experts said Chen might not be charged because he did not intend to 
spread the virus. But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking 
millions of dollars of damage compensation.

<HEADLINE> Ethics Students Caught Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Twenty-five San Diego State University business  
students got an ``F'' for cheating. The class? Ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of those enrolled in a business ethics course were  
caught using answers to a quiz last month. All were given failing 
grades for the course and most were placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal was reported this week in the student newspaper, The  
Daily Aztec, and in today's San Diego Union-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did I learn? Obviously not to cheat. It's not worth it,''  
one student told the Union-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecturer Brian D. Cornforth said he set a trap to catch cheaters  
after receiving a tip that students were using answers they culled 
from tests given to an earlier session of the class. 
</P>
<P>
	``A line must be drawn in the sand,'' he said. ``This is just  
too egregious, it's too heinous a cheating scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Logan, the university's judicial procedures officer, said  
the case was unusual because of the number of students involved: 
``Most of my cheating cases are just one person making the decision 
to cheat on their own.''

<HEADLINE> Moms, Good and Bad, on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What can you say about ``Murphy Brown,'' ``One  
Day at a Time,'' ``thirtysomething,'' ``Happy Days,'' ``Eight Is 
Enough'' and ``Roseanne''? Why, you put them all together, they 
spell M-O-T-H-E-R! 
</P>
<P>
	As Mother's Day 1999 draws near, Mom continues to loom large not  
only in our hearts, but also on our TV screens. Just as she always 
has -- at least since Dec. 19, 1948, when the very first sitcom 
received TV's first stork call. 
</P>
<P>
	The series was ``Mary Kay and Johnny.'' Its star gave birth a  
half-hour before airtime. Then viewers watched her co-star and 
real-life husband perform solo as the expectant TV father, pacing 
the floor until he got word about his TV wife: Mary Kay was now a 
TV mom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since, TV moms have multiplied. Literally. Just during the  
current fecund season, Phoebe of ``Friends'' gave birth to 
triplets. Then Annie had twins on ``7th Heaven.'' Now ditto for 
Fran on the May 12 finale of ``The Nanny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly a half-century, Harriet Nelson of the long-running  
comedy ``Ozzie &AMP; Harriet'' remains the mother superior of TV moms. 
It was she who established the no-fuss-no-muss of June Cleaver, 
Carol Brady and TV's other maternal paragons. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, TV moms come in lots more styles. Loopy,  
stressed-out, manipulative. And wonderfully odious. Like Olivia 
Soprano, widowed mother of a mob boss on HBO's acclaimed ``The 
Sopranos.'' Never mind she's Italian, not Greek -- this is the Medea 
of bad TV mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	When her dutiful son Tony brings her flowers, she whines, ``I'm  
not dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Tony asks her to consider moving into a luxury retirement  
community, she wails, ``Go! Go into the ham and take the carving 
knife and stab me here! Now! Please!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As played by Nancy Marchand, Olivia is sullen, self-pitying and  
Machiavellian. Worst of all, she seems fixated on destroying Tony 
(played by James Gandolfini) as she conspires with her 
brother-in-law, Tony's underhanded rival for the family business. 
Mama mia! 
</P>
<P>
	After learning of his mother's filicidal bent, Tony confronts  
Olivia in the hospital, where she is recovering from a stroke. ``I 
tried to do the right thing by you,'' he explodes, ``and you tried 
to have me whacked!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has something else to say to his helpless ma: She shouldn't  
be surprised if he whacks her first. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that death can put a stop to every TV mom. On the NBC drama  
``Providence,'' Lynda Hansen's body wasn't cold before she had 
resumed meddling in the love life of her physician daughter Sydney 
(Melina Kanakaredes). 
</P>
<P>
	Played by Concetta Tomei, Lynda arrives at Syd's medical clinic  
with pearls, cigarette and an urge to horn in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are going to love this operation,'' Mother declares. ``I'm  
about to remove some of the positive qualities of your ex-boyfriend 
Jerry and implant them in your new boyfriend Kyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You gotta be dreaming!'' scoffs Syd.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, dear,'' Mom reminds her. ``YOU are.''  
</P>
<P>
	But Ray Barone isn't. His mother haunts his household not in his  
dreams, but in the flesh (and usually a flowered pantsuit), from 
right across the street on CBS' sitcom ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forever barging in on Ray and his wife, Marie (played by Doris  
Roberts) is an expert at the put-down that masquerades as 
helpfulness. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving unannounced with Tupperware containers, she tells  
daughter-in-law Debra that she made ravioli for the grandkids. 
``They look so skinny compared to the other children,'' she meows. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in a rare moment of privacy, Ray (Ray Romano) praises  
Debra on her in-law coping skills. ``It's survival of the 
fittest,'' he says. ``If you didn't learn how to hold your own, my 
mother would be wearing you as a coat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long may Marie rule her little corner of Long Island. But come  
the year 3000, Mom -- just ``Mom''-- may rule the world. Or so says 
Fox's new animated comedy ``Futurama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The richest, most ruthless industrialist on the planet, Mom  
considers Mom's Old-Fashioned Robot Oil key to Momcorp's continued 
prosperity. Lucky for Mom that a far better source of robot oil -- 
the humble anchovy -- is long extinct. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if anyone ever got hold of anchovy DNA,'' Mom growls at  
her browbeaten sons, ``they could chop out the oil-making gene, 
stick it in a bunch of Third World kids and -- bam! -- cheap, 
effective robot oil, enough to put dear old Mom out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that such a thing would ever happen, of course. ``No one,''  
she seethes, ``messes with Mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who says TV doesn't teach the right things?  
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Zimmer May Leave After Torre Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- After 51 years, today could be Don  
Zimmer's last in professional baseball. Or maybe it'll be Saturday 
or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer has decided to leave the New York Yankees whenever Joe  
Torre is healthy enough to return as manager. Torre, who is 
recovering from prostate cancer surgery, could decide to take over 
as soon as tonight in Kansas City, although general manager Brian 
Cashman said that's not likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is not coming to Kansas City to manage Friday night;  
Friday night is not an option,'' Cashman said Thursday. ``I'd be 
surprised if it was in Kansas City, but I wouldn't rule it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who wants to leave to rest his aching right knee, was to  
talk things over with Torre this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe says he's managing (tonight), I'll go home,'' Zimmer  
said. ``If he says it'll be another week, I'll stay another week. 
... I don't want him to come back before he's ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said Torre will watch the Royals series from a luxury  
box until he decides he's physically ready to return to the dugout. 
He's being cautioned not to try coming back too soon for fear of 
getting worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's down, tired and fatigued, he's not going to be at his  
best to take the reins,'' Cashman said. ``No matter when he comes 
back, we'll say, `Wow, he came back fast.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer gathered his team in the clubhouse following Wednesday  
night's 8-6 loss to the Texas Rangers and announced: ``After 
tomorrow's game, I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He amended it Thursday to say he'd be around until Torre is  
back. Nonetheless, the Yankees went into last night's game knowing 
it could be their last with their beloved ``Popeye'' in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch led off with an inside-the-park homer and Tino  
Martinez added a three-run shot as New York beat Texas 5-3. It was 
the Yankees' fifth victory over the Rangers in six games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to see him (Torre) here,'' said Bernie  
Williams, who went 2-for-4 with an RBI and a run. ``Zim has done 
great, but it's been tough on him because of his knee. He's got to 
take care of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro Mendoza (3-1) cruised through eight innings, allowing an  
RBI double by Rusty Greer in the third and a two-run homer to 
Rafael Palmeiro in the eighth. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for 
his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mendoza would probably be the ace on most staffs,'' Rangers  
manager Johnny Oates said. ``He is a quality pitcher in my mind and 
he kept us off-balance most of the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morgan (4-1), who lost his bid to become baseball's first  
five-game winner, left after being hit on his right shin by Derek 
Jeter's line drive in the fifth. He's likely to make his next 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, was New York's bench coach the last three years  
until being asked in mid-March to serve as interim manager. He's 
guided them to first place in the AL East with a 14-6 record 
despite several key injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all miss his presence on the bench and in the clubhouse,  
his knowledge and insight,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ``He 
has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said the knee is 90 percent of the reason he's ready to  
leave. He classified the other 10 percent as personal. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he's had problems with team owner George  
Steinbrenner, Zimmer paused for more than 10 seconds, then slowly 
said: ``I'm not going to ruin my life by making bad statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his voice cracking and his bottom lip quivering, Zimmer  
added, ``I've been lucky enough to be in this game for 51 years. 
... I came in strong, quietly and that's the way I'd like to go 
out, not to burn any bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said everyone in the Yankees organization, including  
Steinbrenner, is thankful to Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, he appreciates what Zim has done,'' Cashman said.  
``You can't say anything about it but high praise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he's not calling this departure a retirement and he  
won't say he's quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say I'm going home,'' Zimmer said. ``I don't know what  
that means except I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Knoblauch's leadoff homer was the 19th of his career. It  
was only the second inside-the-park homer at The Ballpark. Kansas 
City's Michael Tucker had the first on Aug. 16, 1996. ... Greer has 
an eight-game hitting streak, Texas' longest of the year. ... The 
Yankees put Roger Clemens on the disabled list with a strained left 
hamstring and called up left-handed reliever Tony Fossas. They also

<HEADLINE> Deputy Had Been Watching Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The sheriff's deputy stationed at Columbine High  
School had been keeping an eye on gunman Eric Harris for about a 
year before last week's massacre, officials confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News reported today that Neil Gardner,  
the sheriff's deputy stationed at Columbine, received a report in 
March 1998 that Harris was detonating pipe bombs and talked of 
committing mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper obtained a copy of a ``suspicious incident''  
police report sent to Gardner. It was based on information that 
Columbine parent Randy Brown filed with the sheriff's office on 
March 18, 1998. It included printouts of Harris' Internet warnings 
that he was ready to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	``God, I can't wait until I can kill you people'' read one of  
the postings contained in report. ``I'll just go to some downtown 
area in some big (expletive) city and blow up and shoot everything 
I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner was at Columbine April 20 when Harris and Dylan Klebold  
attacked the school with bombs and assault weapons. Gardner 
exchanged fire with one of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis confirmed that Gardner  
``had been watching Eric for quite some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gardner had been keeping an eye on Harris at school,  
observing his actions and noting his associates. But, without proof 
of a chargeable offense, there was nothing that he could do, Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Parr told the News: ``It was sent to him, and  
he was aware of it, and nothing came of it. There was simply 
nothing else we could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives have traced guns used in the Columbine High School  
massacre, seized dozens of bombs and recovered dramatic video 
evidence of the nightmare inside. 
</P>
<P>
	But 11 days after the attack, the only person who has been  
arrested is a hardware store clerk accused of concocting a story 
about selling the gunmen material used in their bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had hoped for more as they seek evidence that  
others helped Harris and Klebold plot their April 20 assault on the 
Littleton school. The gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher 
before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were questioning a man who may have supplied the  
semiautomatic pistol used by one of the young attackers. But 
authorities said no arrests were imminent -- a sharp about-face from 
earlier suggestions that the man would be arrested ``in a day or 
two'' after negotiating terms of his surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have been questioned, but prosecutor Mark Pautler  
declined to label them as suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a good idea to let people know ahead of time that we  
are going to arrest them,'' he said Thursday. ``They have a 
tendency to disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
earlier this week visited the Blackjack Pizza shop where Harris, 
18, and Klebold, 17, worked. The agents were investigating whether 
a pizza deliveryman acted as a middleman between the students and 
the gun seller. The ATF and pizza shop managers declined to discuss 
the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime laboratory technicians are conducting ballistics tests to  
determine which guns fired the ammunition that killed each of the 
13 victims. If bullets fired by the paramilitary-style TEC DC-9 did 
not hit anyone, the gun seller may only face charges of illegal gun 
peddling rather than being implicated in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Klebold's prom date, Robyn Anderson, 18,  
bought three of the four weapons -- two rifles and a shotgun -- used 
in the massacre. Authorities insist she, too, is only a witness. 
Under Colorado law, an 18-year old without a felony record can 
legally furnish minors with rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they have not formally interviewed the  
killers' parents, blaming scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to set it up now,'' Pautler told The Washington  
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, Thornton gun dealer Larry Russell told the  
News that he sold the semiautomatic pistol used in the shootings to 
an unidentified adult last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell says the TEC-DC-9 was one of several he bought from gun  
dealer Royce Spain when Spain's Federal Heights gun shop closed. 
Russell said he sold the gun at a Tanner Gun Show at the Denver 
Merchandise Mart last year. But he didn't keep a record of the sale 
and isn't sure when he sold it, or who bought it. He said he would 
have asked for identification and is sure the buyer was not a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said he has seen pictures of gunmen Harris and Klebold,  
and did not recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sheriff John Stone said investigators who examined  
inventory records and receipts at a hardware store have concluded 
that Gary Sowell, 50, lied about selling the youths propane tanks, 
wire, screws and other materials used to make the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sowell was charged Thursday with making a false report to  
authorities, a misdemeanor, and booked in the Jefferson County jail 
on $1,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this will slow down some of these crackpot calls that  
we're getting,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, heartbroken residents held the last of the funerals  
for massacre victims, a gospel-infused memorial to 18-year-old 
Isaiah Shoels. 
</P>
<P>
	Choir singers raised their hands skyward while belting out  
joyous praise. In between hymns, speakers mixed fond memories of 
the 4-foot-11 football player -- described as ``small in stature but 
large in heart'' -- with calls for societal change. 
</P>
<P>
	``When does this stop? When does it end?'' asked William  
Collins, Isaiah's grandfather. ``I'm tired of laying to rest 
politicians, engineers, athletes, musicians, artists, janitors and 
sanitation haulers who are robbed of reaching their potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels' father, Michael, said his son ``had two strikes against  
him'' in the minds of the gunmen: He was an athlete and he was 
black. Students said the gunmen were seeking athletes and singled 
Shoels out because of his race.

<HEADLINE> Media Wins in Mich. Riot Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Eleven newspapers and television stations  
don't have to give prosecutors unpublished photographs and video of 
a campus riot that prosecutors want for their investigation, the 
Michigan Supreme Court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the wrong kind of subpoena was used, and sent the  
case back to District Court so prosecutors could request a type of 
subpoena known as an investigative subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if prosecutors make that request, it is unlikely the  
case would go very far. A Circuit Court judge has already forbidden 
the use of investigative subpoenas in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III was unavailable for comment  
Friday, an assistant prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunnings sought hundreds of unpublished photographs and video  
footage taken the night of March 27, when more than 5,000 people 
rioted on the Michigan State University campus and in downtown East 
Lansing. The riots began in the final moments of the NCAA semifinal 
game in which Michigan State lost to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Herschel Fink, an attorney for the Detroit Free Press, said they  
were pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The news outlets contend that turning over unpublished photos  
and video would compromise their ability to gather the news. Fink 
has said that such orders place reporters in jeopardy by forcing 
them to act as agents of the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lower court judges have ruled the materials aren't protected  
because the riot was filmed in a public place and media laws are 
only meant to protect confidential sources. The judges have also 
ruled that people filming the riot were witnesses to crimes and are 
therefore compelled to give evidence to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Free Press, media involved in the case are  
the Lansing State Journal, The State News -- Michigan State's 
student newspaper -- and eight TV stations.

<HEADLINE>  Zimmer May Leave After Torre Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- After 51 years, today could be Don  
Zimmer's last in professional baseball. Or maybe it'll be Saturday 
or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer has decided to leave the New York Yankees whenever Joe  
Torre is healthy enough to return as manager. Torre, who is 
recovering from prostate cancer surgery, could decide to take over 
as soon as tonight in Kansas City, although general manager Brian 
Cashman said that's not likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is not coming to Kansas City to manage Friday night;  
Friday night is not an option,'' Cashman said Thursday. ``I'd be 
surprised if it was in Kansas City, but I wouldn't rule it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who wants to leave to rest his aching right knee, was to  
talk things over with Torre this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe says he's managing (tonight), I'll go home,'' Zimmer  
said. ``If he says it'll be another week, I'll stay another week. 
... I don't want him to come back before he's ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said Torre will watch the Royals series from a luxury  
box until he decides he's physically ready to return to the dugout. 
He's being cautioned not to try coming back too soon for fear of 
getting worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's down, tired and fatigued, he's not going to be at his  
best to take the reins,'' Cashman said. ``No matter when he comes 
back, we'll say, `Wow, he came back fast.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer gathered his team in the clubhouse following Wednesday  
night's 8-6 loss to the Texas Rangers and announced: ``After 
tomorrow's game, I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He amended it Thursday to say he'd be around until Torre is  
back. Nonetheless, the Yankees went into last night's game knowing 
it could be their last with their beloved ``Popeye'' in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch led off with an inside-the-park homer and Tino  
Martinez added a three-run shot as New York beat Texas 5-3. It was 
the Yankees' fifth victory over the Rangers in six games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to see him (Torre) here,'' said Bernie  
Williams, who went 2-for-4 with an RBI and a run. ``Zim has done 
great, but it's been tough on him because of his knee. He's got to 
take care of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro Mendoza (3-1) cruised through eight innings, allowing an  
RBI double by Rusty Greer in the third and a two-run homer to 
Rafael Palmeiro in the eighth. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for 
his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mendoza would probably be the ace on most staffs,'' Rangers  
manager Johnny Oates said. ``He is a quality pitcher in my mind and 
he kept us off-balance most of the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morgan (4-1), who lost his bid to become baseball's first  
five-game winner, left after being hit on his right shin by Derek 
Jeter's line drive in the fifth. He's likely to make his next 
start.

his knowledge and insight,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ``He 
has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said the knee is 90 percent of the reason he's ready to  
leave. He classified the other 10 percent as personal. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he's had problems with team owner George  
Steinbrenner, Zimmer paused for more than 10 seconds, then slowly 
said: ``I'm not going to ruin my life by making bad statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his voice cracking and his bottom lip quivering, Zimmer  
added, ``I've been lucky enough to be in this game for 51 years. 
... I came in strong, quietly and that's the way I'd like to go 
out, not to burn any bridges.''

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Minor Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Celtics forward Greg Minor will miss the  
rest of the season because of a hairline fracture in his right hip, 
the team announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 swingman was injured during Thursday's game at  
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial X-rays in Miami were inconclusive, but further tests in  
Boston revealed the fracture in the socket of Minor's right hip, 
said Celtics spokesman Jeff Twiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor, who averaged 4.9 points and 2.7 rebounds in 44 games this  
season, fell while running downcourt early in the first quarter in 
the Celtics' 107-96 victory. He was screaming in pain and had to be 
helped off the court by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	The fracture could take three to five weeks to heal, but will  
not require surgery, Twiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor was hospitalized at New England Baptist Hospital in  
Boston. He could be released over the next few days, Twiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor, a first-round draft pick of the Los Angeles Clippers out  
of Louisville in 1994, is in his fifth season with the Celtics, who 
signed him as a free agent before the 1994-95 season.

<HEADLINE> Online Auction Team Backs Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Scratch ``team of high-priced,  
professionally-trained cybergeeks'' off your Internet shopping 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of 16 managers and engineers who offered their  
services for $3.14 million on an online auction house has backed 
out. The team pulled its posting without explanation Thursday from 
eBay, the Web's largest bidding site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seller ended the auction. He did not give a reason when we  
talked to him,'' said eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove. ``They didn't 
explain anything. We have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The posting had three or four bids before it was pulled, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group members, who declined to identify themselves for fear  
of getting fired, sparked interest with its posting on eBay, which 
usually auctions off things like autographed baseballs and Beanie 
Babies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 workers -- including a director, two managers, three  
engineers and five administrators -- claim they currently work, 
unhappily, for a Silicon Valley company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just sitting around talking, watching our company  
disintegrate and watching all these great people leaving,'' said a 
spokesman for the group calling itself ``ispteam.'' They had been 
working together for years, and hated the idea of splitting up. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman could not be reached for comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Consolidation Loans Aren't for All / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- You probably have seen a television  
ad with the theme: A happy couple in a beautiful home smiling as 
bright as the sunbeams streaming in the windows. 
</P>
<P>
	All their bills have been crammed into one through debt  
consolidation and they're saving hundreds of dollars a month. 
</P>
<P>
	But credit counselors say financial doom could dim the bright  
picture if the happy couple hasn't learned to manage money. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've just wrapped it up in a neat little package; they  
still owe the money,'' said Gail M. Merrill, education director at 
Consumer Credit Counseling Services of Maine Inc. in South 
Portland, which provides financial counseling services throughout 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over the best way to deal with debt is heating up  
around the country. Opponents of consolidation contend that tying 
unsecured debt to collateral like one's home is not the best option 
for those who can't rein in their spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit National Foundation for Consumer Credit of Silver  
Spring, Md., which runs a national network of 1,500 Consumer Credit 
Counseling Services offices, has already been airing ads against 
consolidation in Maine and plans to start a nationwide campaign in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	With personal debt high and personal bankruptcies at a record  
1.4 million filings last year, lending companies have been jumping 
at the opportunity to consolidate various debts into one payment. 
The loan companies buy unsecured debt, like money owed to credit 
card companies, and replace it with one loan payment. They make 
their money from the interest on the loan, and have the collateral 
of the house if the borrower isn't able to come through with the 
loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merrill says many consolidation loans do little to tackle  
the underlying problem of overspending. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors with the National Foundation for Consumer Credit, who  
helped 1.5 million people last year, work with creditors to set up 
debt repayment plans, which may include waived fees, interest and 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Clients deposit money each month with the counseling service,  
which pays the creditors. The rules usually require clients to cut 
up their credit cards and refrain from applying for new plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	While debt repayment plans don't erase credit history, they can  
demonstrate that a client has learned to budget better. 
</P>
<P>
	However, lenders maintain debt consolidation could be the answer  
for certain borrowers, particularly homeowners or those who have 
equity in real estate, since property is often used as collateral. 
It can be a good idea for those who already know how to manage 
money and are looking for lower interest on debts or for a tax 
advantage, they say. The interest paid on most home-equity loans is 
tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Benson, a senior vice president at The Money Store in  
Sacramento, Calif., says his clients are either looking for lower 
rates, are tired of paying on several credit cards or have suffered 
a financial setback due to job loss, a medical problem, or divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson says loan rates, which depend on borrowers' credit  
history and income, range from around 8 percent to 13 percent. 
That's lower than average credit card rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernita and Leonard Cox of Los Angeles took out a consolidation  
loan at 10.5 percent from The Money Store in 1997 and were so happy 
they recommended that Mrs. Cox's mother do the same. They also 
agreed to appear in a commercial that aired in November.

	``There were just too many itty-bitty bills. That can drive you  
crazy,'' said Mrs. Cox, a business owner. ``We were able to 
refinance, pay off some of the credit cards and basically just get 
right back starting all over again.''

	The Federal Trade Commission warns that some lenders may pack  
hidden fees and extra costs into contracts, encourage people to pad 
their incomes to qualify or try to persuade applicants to 
repeatedly refinance loans. Victims of such practices may end up 
losing their homes.

	``Don't be afraid to ask the same question over and over again

<HEADLINE> Stroh Brewery Completes Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Stroh Brewery Co. has completed the sale of all  
of its brands to Miller Brewing Co. and Pabst Brewing Co., ending a 
century and a half of beer-making after tough competition and a 
trend toward consolidation hurt its sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, the nation's second-largest brewer behind Anheuser-Busch  
Inc., agreed to buy Stroh's Henry Weinhard's and Mickeys brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Pabst agreed to buy the rest of Stroh's brands, including  
Stroh's, Old Milwaukee and Schlitz. It also is buying Stroh's 
brewery in Lehigh Valley, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh said it would continue to operate its five remaining  
breweries until production can be shifted to Miller or Pabst. All 
hourly and more than 75 percent of salaried workers will keep their 
jobs during the transition, expected to last until the end of the 
year, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh Brewery has about 1,900 hourly and 765 salaried employees.  
</P>
<P>
	The companies have not disclosed complete terms of the deals,  
though Pabst said it borrowed $185 million to pay for it. The 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel estimated the two deals at $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh began brewing in Detroit in 1850, after the family already  
had been brewing for two generations in Germany. During Prohibition 
the company made products ranging from ice cream and soda to the 
ingredients necessary for home brewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer industry analysts say the move reflects a trend toward  
consolidation made necessary because the top companies carry so 
much weight.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Protest Arrest Plan Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A congressman is warning that lawsuits are  
possible if peaceful demonstrators are arrested at the Baltimore 
Orioles' exhibition game Monday against the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of anti-Casto protesters are expected from the New York  
area and Florida. But the Orioles have a strict policy against 
banners and political demonstrations inside the park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have the time to try to challenge them in  
court, although there may be those who will seek to express 
themselves peacefully,'' Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are arrested, they may have a lawsuit on their hands  
since I understand the stadium was built with public funds. So I'm 
not sure they have an absolute right to control free speech in the 
manner in which they are trying to control it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have announced strict guidelines for fan conduct  
will be enforced, and fans might be asked to leave, even for 
chanting, if it disturbs other fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Banners will not be allowed to be displayed during play, and  
political and commercial messages will not be not allowed. Fans 
will be warned once and will be escorted out of the stadium if they 
persist, the team has said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banners and flags are prohibited,'' said John Maroon, a team  
spokesman. ``It's a longstanding club policy that anything 
political in nature is inappropriate and, at the discretion of the 
Orioles, shall not be displayed at the ball park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have a constitutional right to conduct a peaceful  
protest and will be given an appropriate and visible place to do 
that outside the gates of the ball park,'' Maroon added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have sold tickets in pairs, making it difficult for  
larger groups to sit together, Cuban exile groups have complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Ana Gamonal, a spokeswoman for Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.,  
said she believes the team might be within its rights to ban 
political protests inside the stadium. But she expected members of 
Cuban exile groups would take advantage of the warning policy to 
display banners once. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they do it once, then it's OK,'' Gamonal said.  
</P>
<P>
	She also questioned whether the Orioles were legally able to ban  
political protests in the stadium's parking lots. Groups seeking to 
either protest Fidel Castro's regime, or call for an end to the 
U.S. embargo of Cuba, will be allowed to protest in designated 
areas, the team has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez said he expects up to a thousand anti-Castro protesters  
from the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area to board buses for 
Baltimore on Monday. More are expected from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez has been an outspoken critic of the Orioles' exhibition  
games with Cuban teams, saying human rights abuses by the Castro 
regime are being overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be incredible if people are arrested for  
displaying a sign, chanting a phrase, or displaying the American 
flag,'' Menendez said.

<HEADLINE> Coroner Uses Web To Help in Morgue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- The San Bernardino County  
coroner's office has created what it says is the nation's first 
Internet clearinghouse for information on unclaimed bodies in the 
morgue. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more than 170 names on the list, which is found on the  
Web at http://www.unclaimedpersons.com. The plan is to make it a national 
database. 
</P>
<P>
	They died in hospitals, nursing homes, car crashes and on the  
street. One of the youngest is 15, the oldest 99. The last person 
on the list is Keith Ray Zorn, a 60-year-old transient born in 
Nebraska who died in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of those on the list are like Zorn -- homeless.  
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody, somewhere, loves this man. We just haven't been able  
to find them,'' coroner inspector Randy Emon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members in search of lost relatives can access the  
federal government's Social Security death index, but the Social 
Security number of the deceased is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner's Web site lists name, age, place of birth, place of  
death and the investigator's name and telephone number. It carries 
information only on deceased people whose identities are known. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will serve a very useful purpose,'' said Edmund Donoghue,  
president of the National Association of Medical Examiners and 
chief of the Cook County coroner's office in Illinois. ``I think it 
will bring people some peace of mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Web sites operated by missing persons groups and a new one  
being established by the California attorney general's office 
already offer information on unidentified John and Jane Does. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, we've pushed for a Web site for unclaimed bodies  
that have a name. They've had databases for unidentified corpses. 
What about the identified? They have family, too,'' said Doyle 
Tolbert, who is in charge of family notification for the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office.

<HEADLINE>  Derby Birthday Bash Being Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Serious horse players and casual fans,  
party goers and party givers, will help celebrate the 125th 
Kentucky Derby at grand old Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many will barely get a glimpse of the race, but they will be  
there Saturday when the pounding hooves of 20 3-year-old 
thoroughbreds beat out ``Happy Birthday'' to an American 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The objects of their affection or scorn -- the reason they'll go  
home ``flush'' or without the rent money -- include Worldly Manner 
(an ``ex-patriot'' American colt representing Arab sheiks), a 
couple of fillies (Excellent Meeting and Three Ring) and a pair of 
geldings (General Challenge and Valhol). 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like winning the Kentucky Derby ... for  
horseman at least,'' said Arthur Hancock III, who will try to win a 
third Derby as co-owner of Menifee. ``It's hard to put into 
words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by the Excellent Meeting, General Challenge or Prime  
Timber would make trainer Bob Baffert the only person to win the 
Derby three straight years. He won with Silver Charm in 1997 and 
with Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, unbeaten in three starts this year, all  
against fillies, and General Challenge, the Santa Anita Derby 
winner, will run as a John and Betty Mabee-owned entry. Prime 
Timber, the Santa Anita Derby runner-up, is owned by Aaron and 
Marie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of horsepower, but we need a lot of luck a lot  
of luck,'' said Baffert, only the sixth person involved with a 
Derby horse to have a shot a third straight victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such Derby greats as trainer Plain Ben Jones (six Derby wins),  
owner-breeder Calumet Farm (eight wins) and jockeys Eddie Arcaro 
and Bill Hartack (five wins each) never had the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who won with Thunder Gulch (1995), was  
the last to take a shot, but he didn't have much horsepower in 1997 
when Deeds Not Words finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas will try to win his fourth Derby -- he also won with the  
filly Winning Colors in 1988 -- with Cat Thief and Charismatic, who 
will be his 34th and 35th starters in his 19th straight Derby. Cat 
Thief was third in the Florida Derby and second in the Blue Grass. 
Charismatic won the Lexington on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other trainers each will saddle two starters each: Saeed  
Suroor, Nick Zito and Elliott Walden. 
</P>
<P>
	Suroor trains Worldly Manner and Aljabr for Godolphin Racing  
Inc., managed by Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum, a member of the royal 
family of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner won three of four starts in the United States  
last year and was bought by Godolphin from the Mabees for $5 
million after the colt won the Del Mar Futurity on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Aljabr won twice in Britain and once in France in three starts  
last year. The Derby will be the first official start as 
3-year-olds for the two colts, who ran in trial races in Dubai this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a Middle Eastern tie to Desert Hero, a son of Sea  
Hero, the 1990 Derby winner. The colt, who has had only three 
starts, all this year, is owned by Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi 
Arabia. He races as the Thoroughbred Corporation and has a home in 
Bradbury, Calif., near Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito, who won the Derby in 1991 with Strike the Gold and in 1994  
with Go for Gin, will saddle Wood Memorial winner Adonis and 
Stephen Got Even, winner of the Gallery Furniture.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden will send out Blue Grass winner Menifee and Ecton Park,  
fourth in the Arkansas Derby, in his second Derby appearance. He 
finished second last year with Victory Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	Also back for his second Derby is Carl Nafzger, trainer of  
Florida Derby winner Vicar, who won in 1990 with Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by Excellent Meeting or Three Ring, winner of filly  
stakes in her last two starts, would make her the third member of 
her sex to win the Derby. The others were Regret (1915), Genuine 
Risk (1980) and Winning Colors (1988). 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge or Valhol would be the seventh gelding and the  
first since Clyde Van Dusen (1929) to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol pulled a surprise by scoring his first victory in only  
this third start in the Arkansas Derby, then became a subject of 
controversy. The purse money was withheld and an investigation 
began into whether jockey Bill Patin possessed an electrical device 
during the April 10 race. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in Little Rock. But last  
Tuesday an Arkansas judge ordered the purse distributed. Without 
the $300,000 first-place money, Valhol, owned by James Jackson, 
would not have had enough earnings to make the 20-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Martinez will ride Valhol in the Derby.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Baseball Defections Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Rey Ordonez scaled a 15-foot fence in Buffalo, N.Y. Rolando  
Arrojo slipped into a waiting car in Georgia. Livan Hernandez 
sneaked out of a hotel in Mexico. Orlando Hernandez simply floated 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	And three others made their break on a cold, dark night in a  
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, about 30 Cuban baseball players have defected in the  
last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	So, it's no surprise that the big question in Baltimore is not  
who will win Monday night's exhibition between the Orioles and 
Cuban all-star team. Instead, it's this: How many of the 25 Cuban 
players will be heading back to Havana after the game at Camden 
Yards? 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Joe Cubas has helped several star players defect in the  
past, and has already said he plans to be in Baltimore this weekend 
with the same intent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans kept their roster secret going into the weekend,  
along with the logistics of their visit. Several key players who 
did not take part in the Orioles' 3-2 win in Havana on March 28 
might be on this team, including flashy shortstop German Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa was the starting shortstop on the Havana Industriales when  
Ordonez was a backup. Ordonez later defected and became a Gold 
Glover with the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at some of the high-profile defections:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Ordonez. He was 20 when he left the Cuban team at the 1993  
World University Games in Buffalo. He left the athlete's village, 
climbed a fence and got into a friend's Cadillac before flying 
first-class to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Arrojo. Following a plan set up by Cubas, the pitcher got a  
late-night knock on his hotel door in Albany, Ga., where the Cuban 
Olympic team was preparing for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Cubas was 
in a car across the street and flashed its lights. Arrojo jumped in 
and they drove away. He now plays for Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Livan Hernandez. Without telling anyone, he walked out of a  
hotel in Monterrey, Mexico, where the Cuban national team was 
training in 1995. The future World Series MVP for the Florida 
Marlins headed to the airport and took a flight to Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Orlando Hernandez. In a daring escape a day after Christmas  
1997, El Duque and seven others left on a small boat from Cuba and 
were picked up a few days later on an island in the Bahamas by the 
U.S. Coast Guard. Hernandez later joined the New York Yankees and 
helped them win the 1998 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rene Arocha. Began the influx of top Cuban defectors in 1991  
when he walked away at the Miami airport, right before a flight 
home. A day earlier, the pitcher had met his father for the first 
time since he defected 12 years earlier. Arocha was 18-17 for St. 
Louis and San Francisco from 1993-97. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Osvaldo Fernandez. Slipped away in 1995 before the Cuban  
national team played a game in Millington, Tenn. The pitcher 
traveled to Miami to watch Arocha and the Cardinals, and later 
signed with San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Roberto Colina. In 1996, he defected with two other players  
during a tournament in Mexico. They walked out of their hotel and 
met Cubas late at night in a graveyard. Colina is a first baseman 
in Tampa Bay's minor league system.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Wins Kentucky Oaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- ``The move'' worked again for  
Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	Going three wide on the turn for home, Bob Baffert's super filly  
cruised to an easy two-length victory over Dreams Gallore TODAY in 
the Kentucky Oaks. Silverbulletday won her seventh straight and 
10th in 11 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1-9 favorite rewarded the confidence of an Oaks-record crowd  
of 101,034 by going 1 1/8 miles in 1:49 4/5. Her easy victory will 
only encourage speculation that she is the class of this year's 
crop of 3-year-olds, Saturday's Kentucky Derby result 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Mike Pegram won the Derby last year with the  
Baffert-trained Real Quiet and had said he didn't want 
Silverbulletday in the crowded Derby, which expects 19 starters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason she wasn't in the Kentucky Derby is we want to take  
care of her and today she showed she wants to take care of us,'' 
Pegram said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second race in a row, Silverbulletday won with a  
three-wide surge, the same that won her the Ashland Stakes at 
Keeneland earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Gary Stevens kept Silverbulletday wide and out of trouble  
around the first turn and along the backstretch, waiting to make 
his move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt more pressure today than I probably felt in any horse  
race in 20 years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the pack compressed toward the rail around the second turn,  
Stevens urged Silverbulletday forward, and she responded, passing 
Marley Vale and Sweeping Story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like riding a turbo-horse,'' the jockey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday earned $341,620 and gave Baffert, who will have  
three horses in Saturday's Kentucky Derby, a shot at a rare 
Derby-Oaks double. 
</P>
<P>
	The last trainer to win both races in the same year was Ben A.  
Jones, who saddled winners Real Delight in the Oaks and Hill Gail 
in the Derby in 1952. Jones also turned the trick in 1949, with 
Ponder in the Derby and Wistful in the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday paid $2.20, $2.20 and $2.10. Dreams Gallore paid  
$4.40 and $2.10 and the show horse, Sweeping Story, paid $2.10, 
finishing 6 3/4 lengths off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Happy Hopper was fourth, followed by Marley Vale, Positive  
Gal and Gold From The West. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday is now five-for-five lifetime at Churchill  
Downs, including a win last November in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies. Her only loss was last August in the Del Mar Debutante, 
when she finished fourth, 7 1/2 lengths behind stablemate Excellent 
Meeting, who'll start the Derby on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, Silent Eskimo ($13.80) beat 1-2 favorite Lu Ravi  
by 1 1/4 lengths in the Louisville Breeders' Cup Handicap. Silent 
Eskimo covered 1 1-16 miles in 1:43 4-5 and earned $169,415 from 
the $268,250 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Favored Howbaddouwantit ($6.40) caught the leaders in the middle  
of the stretch and went on to a one-length victory in the $115,300 
Turf Sprint Stakes. Mike Smith rode the 4-year-old over five 
furlongs in 57 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Rocket ($7.60), briefly blocked behind horses at the top of  
the stretch, got clear to win the $115,400 American Turf Stakes by 
a half-length over Haus of Dehere in a $115,400 turf race. Air 
Rocket ran 1 1-16 miles in 1:42 3-5.

<HEADLINE> Autistic Softballer Gets To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASTORIA, Ore. (AP) -- Anna Inskip missed a pop fly, bobbled the  
ball and made a weak throw, allowing the batter reach second base 
standing up. Still, her performance was a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday's game, school officials told the 18-year-old  
junior her autism put her and other students at risk. They said she 
could practice with Astoria High's softball team, but not play in 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	She sued, citing the Americans with Disabilities Act. Before  
ruling on the lawsuit, a federal judge issued a temporary order 
that Anna be put on the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrie Young watched as her daughter got to bat twice, striking  
out once and walking. Anna's fielding error didn't bother her one 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited. I want her to play and not screw up, but I just  
want her out there,'' Ms. Young said. ``I say if you miss the ball 
don't worry about it. Watch them. They all miss it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Anna: ``It was kind of scary a little. I've never stood out  
like that before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diagnosed with a moderate form of autism when she was 12, Anna  
finds it difficult to hold conversations, control fine motor skills 
and has almost no concept of numbers or time. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's concerns about liability date to 1992 when she  
had a seizure in gym class, but her doctor cleared her to play. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, the 5-foot-4 junior with short-cropped black hair  
can make one-handed catches and throw overhand. 
</P>
<P>
	Softball isn't Anna's first love. For two years she played  
basketball in the Special Olympics and was on Astoria's swim team 
last year. She never misses a school football or basketball game 
and is a rabid Miami Dolphins fan. 
</P>
<P>
	She got turned on to athletics by horseback riding. Over the  
past four years, she won more than 20 showmanship medals. She can 
groom her favorite Arabian, throw on the saddle, bridle him up and 
take him for a trot -- all by herself. 
</P>
<P>
	When it came to softball, her mother contacted the Oregon  
Advocacy Center, which agreed to champion Anna's case, seeking 
$200,000 in damages. Meantime, U.S. District Judge Garr King in 
Portland granted a restraining order this week, giving Anna a spot 
on the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is one of the few rulings for disabled athletes who  
want to compete in the mainstream. Another notable case was in 
1998, when golfer Casey Martin won a court order allowing him to 
use a motorized cart in professional tournaments because he has a 
leg disability that prevents him from walking long distances. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after winning her order, Ann didn't know if she would play.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to play as many people as we can,''  
Principal Steve Giere said. ``Regardless of her handicap, we're 
going to play whoever allows us to win in a highly competitive 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with Banks High leading 6-2 in the third inning, coach  
Shanna Davis sent Anna to right field. Anna stood there wearing 
mirrored wrap-around sunglasses, socking her glove with her right 
hand -- and waited. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the pop fly over first base -- and the miss. Winless  
Astoria lost 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna next goal is getting a big yellow ``A'' for varsity  
softball to put on her purple high school jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see others walking around in it with badges from other  
sports,'' she said. ``It is like a real uniform.''

<HEADLINE> Airline Again Cancels Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines is blaming what it calls an  
illegal slowdown by its mechanics' union for delays in repair and 
maintenance that have forced cancellation of more than 200 flights 
since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanics are taking longer than expected to repair planes,  
leaving aircraft unready for takeoff, said airline spokesman Jack 
Evans in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the delays, 35 flights were canceled Tuesday, 52  
Wednesday, 46 Thursday and 31 by mid-morning today, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancellations usually number about five a day.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the mechanics' union -- the Airline Mechanics  
Fraternal Association -- did not immediately return a call for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Alaska has been able to accommodate passengers from the  
canceled flights on other airplanes, Evans said, adding that 
travelers are being asked to double-check arrival and departure 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based airline has maintenance bases in Seattle and  
Oakland. It schedules nearly 500 departures a day on its West Coast 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
	AMFA has been in contract talks with the airline since last  
summer. At an April 16 rally, union members complained about the 
slow pace of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's contract came up for amendment in 1997, when the  
mechanics were represented by the International Association of 
Machinists, Evans said. Since then, the mechanics have certified 
AMFA to represent them, and talks with that union resumed last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides recently requested a federal mediator, Evans said,  
and talks with the intermediary are to resume in late May.

<HEADLINE> Horry May Be Forgotten No More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Robert Horry has been the forgotten man  
for the Los Angeles Lakers this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After what he did against the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday  
night, that might change. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry made six 3-point shots and scored a season-high 22 points  
as the Lakers overpowered the Pacific Division-champion Blazers 
108-89. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert Horry played a great game,'' said Lakers center  
Shaquille O'Neal, who wasn't bad himself, equaling a season-high 
with 38 points. ``That's the Robert Horry I know. He's been taking 
a lot of heat, a lot of criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So has the entire team, and it's difficult to say it hasn't been  
deserved. The Lakers had lost their previous two games, at San 
Antonio and Houston, by a total of 49 points. The win over Portland 
was just their third in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	So after playing two of their worst games of the season, the  
Lakers played one of their best. Considering the playoffs are a 
week away, it couldn't have come at a better time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a total team effort,'' said Horry, who played 27  
minutes -- eight over his average. ``These last two days have been 
really good for us, we've been able to talk to each other and find 
out what's wrong with our defense and offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of their two one-sided losses in Texas, the Lakers  
spent nearly 2 1/2 hours behind closed doors Tuesday before taking the 
practice floor. They had what coach Kurt Rambis called their best 
practices of the year Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry, 28, played a prominent role on championship teams in  
Houston in 1994 and 1995, and made 71 starts and averaged over 31 
minutes of action for a Lakers' team that went 61-21 and reached 
the Western Conference finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a different story this year -- he's started only five  
games, and was held out of two games by Rambis midway through the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry's playing time diminished when the Lakers signed  
seven-time NBA rebounding champion Dennis Rodman in late February. 
It's been increasing since Rodman was waived two weeks ago, but 
J.R. Reid has been starting recently at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite what Horry did against the Blazers, some of them sounded  
unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times do you expect Horry to hit all those 3's? They  
just had a good night,'' Portland guard Isaiah Rider said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've got Shaq going, there's pressure to defend him in  
the post and double-team him,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. 
``And some of Robert's shots, I mean, it wasn't like they were even 
open looks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not, but they went in.  
</P>
<P>
	Horry hadn't made more than two 3-point shots in a game this  
season, and entered the game having made 55 of his 123 attempts 
from 3-point range. He was 6-of-8 against the Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first one felt good, the second one felt even better,  
that one I shot from way downtown felt even better,'' Horry said 
with a smile. ``Sometimes when you get that feeling, you have to 
keep shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, I tried to do the little things. Now, I figured,  
`Keep looking for your shot, stay on the outside, and keep looking 
for your shot, and try to make it easier for Shaq and the rest of 
the guys.' ''

<HEADLINE>  Author of Chernobyl Virus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The author of the Chernobyl computer virus  
told investigators that he created the bug hoping to humiliate and 
take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software 
providers, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted he didn't expect it to cause worldwide damage, a  
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen Ing-hau, 24, looked nervous and was speechless when he was  
mobbed by reporters after being summoned for police questioning on 
his involvement in a case that caused at least 600,000 computer 
meltdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chernobyl virus -- known in Taiwan as the CIH, for Chen's  
initials -- had even pressed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to 
study antivirus programs to prevent it from invading its computers, 
the police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of  
computer engineering at the Institute of Technology. Chen has since 
graduated and has been undergoing Taiwan's mandatory two-year 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen had spent long hours playing computer games since entering  
college and was a frequent victim of computer viruses when 
downloading video games and other software from the Internet, the 
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he created the highly vicious virus that could avoid  
detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool 
of the software providers, from whom he had bought antivirus 
programs that proved useless,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact. He  
regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26,  
the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to 
erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system 
settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Taiwanese law, someone convicted of spreading computer  
viruses can face up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say whether Chen will be charged. Computer  
experts said Chen might not be charged because he did not intend to 
spread the virus. But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking 
millions of dollars of damage compensation.

<HEADLINE> Steelers, Stewart Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bill Cowher says Kordell Stewart will be his  
quarterback as long as he coaches the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
Apparently, that will be until at least 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite watching Stewart's production drop precipitously as they  
went 7-9 last season, the Steelers apparently have worked out the 
details of an extension that will run at least three more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said several days ago that a new contract was imminent.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart already is set to make $2.05 million this season and  
$2.5 million in 2000, though his base salary could drop next year 
to reflect a signing bonus of about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers did not confirm Friday that a deal has been  
reached, although the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that terms 
already have been filed with NFL offices in New York. The contract 
will not be signed until Stewart's agent, Leigh Steinberg, returns 
from a European vacation in about 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher and Steelers president Dan Rooney both said recently they  
wanted to reaffirm their commitment to Stewart, who led them to the 
AFC championship game in his first year as a starting quarterback 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers did not replace any of their quarterbacks --  
Stewart, Mike Tomczak and Pete Gonzalez -- during the offseason 
despite stumbling last season to their worst record since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was a major reason for the Steelers' dropoff as his  
production declined from 32 touchdowns (21 passing, 11 rushing) in 
1997 to 12 (11 passing, one rushing). His passer rating dropped 
from 75.2 to 62.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's decline was a major reason why offensive coordinator  
Ray Sherman was eased out after one season and former Chargers 
coach Kevin Gilbride was brought in as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, it was a stressful season, and that's not one I  
want to dwell on, but I look forward to the future,'' Stewart said 
during the Steelers' rookie camp on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and Sherman clearly did not develop the same close  
working relationship that former offensive coordinator Chan Gailey 
and Stewart did. Stewart and Sherman also disagreed over Stewart's 
role, which transformed from scrambler to stay-in-the-pocket 
thrower who rarely took off running. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thing is to get a coach in here who's going to massage my  
skills and call the plays around my game and how I play and not try 
to make me something I'm not,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not immediately known, but it likely  
will allow the Steelers to pay Stewart, 26, a lower base salary in 
2000, giving them more room under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was buoyed during the offseason when he learned of the  
strong support offered by Cowher and Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt at one time I couldn't get the job done,''  
Stewart said. ``To sit here and say we're not going to extend 
Kordell's contract or think about Kordell because of last season, 
we all should be cut. We all had a part in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play well, but Mr. Rooney is stepping up and saying  
this is the guy we'd like to have, and Coach Cowher and (director 
of football operations) Tom Donahoe and everybody else, they want 
me to be here and they have all the confidence in the world in 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Contract Advice Plentiful for James </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A group forged by friendship and family will  
be advising first-round draft pick Edgerrin James as he wades 
through contract negotiations with the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team Edgerrin'' is in the process of selecting an agent to  
represent the fourth overall pick in upcoming contract talks aimed 
at providing financial security for the running back and his 
family. The team includes James, his half-brother Ed German, 
attorney Tyrone Williams and friend Pierre Rutledge. 
</P>
<P>
	James is the only first-round pick without an agent and he's  
been receiving heavy attention from those offering their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The collective bargaining agreement requires that a player  
either negotiate his own contract, a rare occurrence, or have 
someone certified by the NFL Players Association represent him. No 
member of James' team is certified by the NFLPA and there are no 
plans to have any of them become certified, Williams said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the process of interviewing some agents who have  
stepped forward recently,'' Williams said, adding that the fee the 
agent will receive is a part of the interview process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average agent charges between 2 and 3 percent,'' said  
Williams, explaining that that fee usually is agreed to January and 
the agent provides services starting with the signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, the agent coming in is only going to have to  
negotiate the contract. Everything else has been done, so I feel 
based on that the fee arrangement should be quite different,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of dollars are involved. Last year's No. 4 pick was  
defensive back Charles Woodson, who reportedly signed a six-year 
deal worth $14.5 million with Oakland. Chicago signed Curtis Enis, 
who like James was the first running back selected in the draft, as 
the fifth overall selection and he reportedly signed a three-year 
contract worth $5.6 million with a $3.6 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pierre and I are not being paid for our roles, there's no  
compensation at all,'' Williams said. ``We're doing it because 
we're friends. We've all known each other. Pierre and I have been 
friends for 14-to-15 years. Everything in life isn't based on 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, money will certainly produce major changes in the lifestyle  
of James, who previously spent summers harvesting watermelons to 
raise money to assist a family that had to rely on food stamps to 
get by in the rural farming community of Immokalee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	James passed up his senior year of college eligibility at Miami  
to help support his 22-month-old daughter and his mother, a high 
school cafeteria worker at Immokalee High School. His mother raised 
six sons on her own, never earning more than $17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the money will change Edgerrin at all. If he was  
going to change, he had ample opportunity after he decided to turn 
pro. All the agents were coming after him with all the glamour, the 
glitz, offering trips, offering bizarre credit lines, cars and all 
those other toys that come with increased money,'' Williams said. 
``He has remained the same person and hasn't been lured into all 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said James is concentrating on preparing for his rookie  
season and plans to report to the Colts' complex on May 16 when he 
is allowed by league rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no timetable for reaching a contract agreement. I  
understand that is usually done in June or July before training 
camp begins,'' Williams said. ``We haven't discussed a timetable 
with the Colts and anticipate no problems.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Wants Bigger Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole is calling for an extended free  
trade zone that includes Central and South America and for bringing 
China into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has failed to put its muscle behind  
free trade since the North American Free Trade Agreement was 
adopted five years ago, Mrs. Dole, who is weighing a bid for 
president, told an Economic Club of Detroit luncheon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, since the bipartisan success of NAFTA, the great  
sucking sound we hear is the administration's international 
leadership vacuum,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore press secretary Chris Lehane said the administration  
has a strong record on free trade: ``What you're really hearing is 
the sucking sound of a sputtering campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also called on Congress to give President Clinton  
fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals. That authority would 
provide for a rapid review of trade agreements by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every president from Gerald Ford to George Bush has had  
fast-track authority,'' she said. She said Congress should give it 
to Clinton ``and to his successor, whoever she may be,'' drawing 
whoops and applause with her gender reference. 
</P>
<P>
	She also called for a Western Hemisphere free trade zone, saying  
the inclusion of Central and South America would promote stability 
and freedom. NAFTA covers the United States, Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's also time, under the tough conditions just negotiated,  
that the United States move forward toward the entry of China into 
the World Trade Organization,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic ``evil personified,''  
Mrs. Dole said she backs stepped-up air attacks on Yugoslavia and 
the stationing of ground troops nearby for possible future use.

<HEADLINE>  WNBA and Union Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time this month, negotiators for  
the WNBA and its players association reached agreement Thursday on 
their first collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year deal was submitted to players with ratification  
expected to be completed by Friday. The league made plans to 
conduct its player draft next Tuesday, with the season expected to 
start on time, June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a milestone for our league to have its first  
collective bargaining, the first of its kind in women's team 
sports,'' WNBA president Val Ackerman said. ``It speaks volumes how 
far women's sports have come. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement reflects the commitment made to providing a  
first-class working environment for players. I'm glad we can get 
back to work and focus on our upcoming draft and our plans for the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract has a re-opener clause after three years, with both  
sides agreeing to no-lockout, no-strike clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	It sets a salary scale for draft picks of $50,000 for the first  
four players chosen, $44,000 for the fifth through eighth players 
and $37,500 for the rest of the players selected in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-round picks get $30,000, third-rounders $27,000 and  
fourth-rounders the rookie minimum of $25,000. The deal includes 
increases of 5 percent per year in those scales. 
</P>
<P>
	Minimum base salaries for veterans go to $30,000 this season and  
to $40,000 in the final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosters can include three players from the folded ABL, except  
for the expansion Orlando and Minnesota franchises, which will be 
permitted five former ABL players each. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this year, it will be a slowed absorbtion of ABL  
players,'' Ackerman said. ``The agreement provides for up to 40 
players to be eligible to play, three per each of the existing 10 
teams and five for each of expansion teams. It's a one-year 
restriction, a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very much want to have the best players in the world in the  
WNBA and we believe this agreement will ensure that. With no 
restrictions next year, we expect to have an even better talent 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players will receive a guaranteed percentage of all royalties  
from the sale of player-identified licensed products, with a 
minimum payment of $100,000 to be made each year to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also includes provisions for a 401K plan,  
year-round health and dental insurances and paid maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and union agreed to a contract earlier this month,  
but the deal fell apart a week ago when both sides insisted the 
other attempted to change the terms at the last minute. That caused 
the league to postpone the draft, which had been scheduled for 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks Monday and Tuesday resolved most of the outstanding  
issues, with the final deal reached in a four-hour meeting 
Thursday. The parties also agreed players would be allowed to 
participate in up to two not-for-profit, charitable events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so excited at this point,'' Pam Wheeler, executive  
director of the union, said. ``Our players are very excited. This 
is a process all of us looked forward to, because it was important 
for obvious reasons. At the same time, we're glad it's over.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Coach Alf Ramsey Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUFFOLK, England (AP) -- Sir Alf Ramsey, who coached England's  
soccer team to its only World Cup title, is dead after a long 
illness. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey had a stroke last June. He was later admitted to a  
nursing home and died this week, a spokesman for his former club, 
Ipswich, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey is considered England's most successful international  
manager. He coached the national team to a 4-2 overtime win over 
West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley. 
</P>
<P>
	His team was renowned for its innovative tactics, helping make  
Ramsey one of the most radical soccer thinkers of his era. 
</P>
<P>
	He was knighted in 1967 and remained England's manager until  
1974, when he was fired after his team failed to qualify for the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave England the greatest moment in its sporting history,''  
Prime Minister Tony Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who takes an interest in football will be saddened by  
the news and will never forget him or the wonderful moments he 
brought in 1966.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Bobby Charlton, a star of the 1966 World Cup-winning team,  
said he was devastated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't be more upset if it was family,'' Charlton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Alf Ramsey gave all of us in the football business the  
greatest moment we have ever had as players, as coaches, as 
managers as fans and as officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was professional to his fingertips and as popular with the  
players as any manager I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a player, Ramsey was regarded as a tenacious defender,  
playing 32 times for England's national team, including three games 
as captain. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur before becoming  
Ipswich manager in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over as England's manager in 1963 after guiding Ipswich  
from the old Third Division competition to the First Division 
title.

<HEADLINE>  NBA's Female Ref Feels Accepted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Dee Kantner was on her way to do a Hornets  
game in her hometown when a guard stopped her at the back gate of 
the Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to referee the game,'' Kantner told the man.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, sure,'' he replied. ``So am I.''  
</P>
<P>
	After proving she really was about to officiate an NBA game,  
Kantner got through the door. Seventeen months after she and Violet 
Palmer became the league's first two female referees, there are 
still barriers to cross. 
</P>
<P>
	But, near the end of her second season, Kantner says those  
barriers are fewer and less imposing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's delusion or not, I feel pretty much accepted -- as  
much as a referee can be accepted,'' Kanter said after an 
appearance as a panelist at the Women's Sports Foundation summit. 
``I don't feel singled out being a woman. ... From the fans, every 
once in a while you hear something gender specific, but you 
tolerate that from fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things weren't so low key during Kantner's first few games, when  
her mere presence seemed big news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid to scratch,'' she said. ``Every time I turned  
around there was a camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kantner's appearance at the summit was a rare chance to see the  
vibrant personality behind the polyester-dressed, pony-tailed 
official on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA generally does not make referees available for  
interviews, so everything about the 38-year-old woman -- the brown 
hair flowing past her shoulders, the rings on the fingers, the 
quick wit and behind-the-scenes stories -- was new to much of the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did I want to be an NBA official?'' she said, throwing a funny  
face. ``No! Absolutely not. I'm an engineer by vocation. I worked 
13 years in the corporate life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kantner moonlighted most of those years working women's college  
basketball, including NCAA Final Four games. The NBA called in 1995 
and invited her and Palmer to camp. After being assured it wasn't a 
publicity gimmick, Kantner showed up and had to deal with her 
novelty value right away when a player cursed her twice in her 
first game on her first day. 
</P>
<P>
	The first offense drew a technical foul. Then the player said,  
profanely: ``What's a women doing on the floor anyway?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer stayed calm and said: ``I am. You're not. You're gone.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I threw him. I had to. It was the first time in 15 years I had  
thrown someone out of a game,'' Palmer said. ``He was testing me. 
They were testing me. What's a woman doing at an NBA camp anyway? 
</P>
<P>
	``Word got out quickly. I didn't have to be tough anymore. They  
realized I had a sense of humor. We had fun. By the end of camp, 
they were calling me `Legs' and who knows what else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years on, Kantner is simply one of the crew.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even notice her,'' Washington guard Chris Whitney  
said after Kantner worked a Cavaliers-Wizards game Thursday night. 
``I think the referee does a good job when you don't notice they're 
out there, and we didn't notice her tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Kantner's horror stories come mostly from her college  
days, when male referees would show her up by making calls in her 
area or patronize her with comments such as ``I'll protect you, 
little lady.'' More than once, there were heated exchanges in the 
officials' locker room at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is everyone going to be wonderful to you? Absolutely not,''  
she said. ``You have to figure out who will be, who won't be, and 
take control of things you can take control of yourself -- know the 
rules, maintain fitness, get your reports in on time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kantner took out an eye chart and a ``three blind refs'' T-shirt  
that friends had given her at a college game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internally, I think it's very important to have a sense of  
humor,'' she said. ``You take yourself too seriously, you're not 
going to last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she never dreamed of being an NBA ref, Kantner says she  
has an ``incredible passion'' for the job and would like to see 
more female colleagues join the ranks. Her advice to her audience: 
Climb the ladder the right way -- with hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't need to flirt with the guys to get an assignment,''  
Kantner said. ``Nothing will drive us crazier. Those of us who have 
worked our butts off and sweated and done all the right things, 
you're setting us back. We don't want women to be recognized for 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Terrorism Toll Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Terrorism took a record toll last year, with  
741 people killed and 5,952 injured. Most of the casualties were 
the result of bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks in Kenya and Tanzania and then the indictment of  
Usama bin Laden, a longtime sponsor with ties to groups in several 
countries, reflect the changing face of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	While state-sponsored terrorism remains a grave problem,  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday, ``direct 
government involvement in committing such acts continues to 
decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, this progress has been countered by the rise of  
terrorist groups that are less directly dependent on states,'' she 
said in a statement. ``Some have broad geographical reach and have 
found ways to support themselves through criminal enterprises, such 
as drug smuggling, kidnapping and extortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of the attacks worldwide last year -- 111 of  
them -- were aimed at U.S. targets. Seventy-seven were bombings of 
multinational oil pipelines in Colombia in which 71 people, 
including 28 children, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian terrorists kidnapped seven American citizens and the  
group FARC has not accounted for three missionaries it kidnapped in 
1993, the State Department said in its annual report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The department made no changes in listing seven countries --  
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria -- as sponsors 
of terrorism. This makes the seven ineligible for U.S. support in 
seeking assistance from international financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States maintains active diplomatic relations only  
with Syria among the seven and has tried for years to engage Syria 
in American peacemaking efforts in the Middle East. President 
Clinton has met with President Hafez Assad to encourage him to 
negotiate peace terms with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the diplomatic front, the Clinton administration is in  
the midst of talks with North Korea designed to bring a formal end 
to the Korean conflict. The United States also is seeking to keep a 
cap on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Huge shipments of 
food have been sent to economically beset Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the United States keeps an icy distance from  
Iraq and maintains sanctions against Libya even after Tripoli 
decided to turn over two suspects for trial in The Netherlands in 
the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba remains on the list even though the report said Fidel  
Castro's government no longer actively supports armed struggle in 
Latin America or elsewhere. Cuba also has dramatically reduced its 
support to leftist revolutionaries since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union in 1991, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Cuba continues to maintain close ties to other state  
sponsors of terrorism and to leftist insurrectionist groups in 
Latin America, including Colombia's two main groups, the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombings at the U.S. Embassy in Kenya last August killed 291  
people, including 12 U.S. citizens, and wounded about 5,000 people. 
The bombing in Tanzania killed 10 people and wounded 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, there were 273 terrorist attacks last year, a decline  
from 304 in 1997 and the lowest total since 1971, the department 
said. There were no acts of terrorism on U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, a Saudi who founded the group al-Qaida while in  
Afghanistan in the U.S.-backed resistance against the invasion by 
Soviet troops in 1979, his military commander, Muhammad Atef, and 
four others were indicted in a U.S. court in New York last November 
in connection with the bombings at the embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States last August struck a purported terrorist  
training camp in Afghanistan with missiles and also destroyed a 
pharmaceutical factory in Sudan that was said to be connected to 
terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Afghanistan is not listed as a sponsor.  
</P>
<P>
	Taliban, which controls most of the territory, was host to bin  
Laden and his group, the report said. But it has not formed a 
government recognized by the United Nations or the United States.

<HEADLINE>  Zimmer May Leave After Torre Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- After 51 years, today could be Don  
Zimmer's last in professional baseball. Or maybe it'll be Saturday 
or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer has decided to leave the New York Yankees whenever Joe  
Torre is healthy enough to return as manager. Torre, who is 
recovering from prostate cancer surgery, could decide to take over 
as soon as tonight in Kansas City, although general manager Brian 
Cashman said that's not likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is not coming to Kansas City to manage Friday night;  
Friday night is not an option,'' Cashman said Thursday. ``I'd be 
surprised if it was in Kansas City, but I wouldn't rule it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who wants to leave to rest his aching right knee, was to  
talk things over with Torre this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe says he's managing (tonight), I'll go home,'' Zimmer  
said. ``If he says it'll be another week, I'll stay another week. 
... I don't want him to come back before he's ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said Torre will watch the Royals series from a luxury  
box until he decides he's physically ready to return to the dugout. 
He's being cautioned not to try coming back too soon for fear of 
getting worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's down, tired and fatigued, he's not going to be at his  
best to take the reins,'' Cashman said. ``No matter when he comes 
back, we'll say, `Wow, he came back fast.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer gathered his team in the clubhouse following Wednesday  
night's 8-6 loss to the Texas Rangers and announced: ``After 
tomorrow's game, I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He amended it Thursday to say he'd be around until Torre is  
back. Nonetheless, the Yankees went into last night's game knowing 
it could be their last with their beloved ``Popeye'' in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch led off with an inside-the-park homer and Tino  
Martinez added a three-run shot as New York beat Texas 5-3. It was 
the Yankees' fifth victory over the Rangers in six games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to see him (Torre) here,'' said Bernie  
Williams, who went 2-for-4 with an RBI and a run. ``Zim has done 
great, but it's been tough on him because of his knee. He's got to 
take care of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro Mendoza (3-1) cruised through eight innings, allowing an  
RBI double by Rusty Greer in the third and a two-run homer to 
Rafael Palmeiro in the eighth. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for 
his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mendoza would probably be the ace on most staffs,'' Rangers  
manager Johnny Oates said. ``He is a quality pitcher in my mind and 
he kept us off-balance most of the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morgan (4-1), who lost his bid to become baseball's first  
five-game winner, left after being hit on his right shin by Derek 
Jeter's line drive in the fifth. He's likely to make his next 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, was New York's bench coach the last three years  
until being asked in mid-March to serve as interim manager. He's 
guided them to first place in the AL East with a 14-6 record 
despite several key injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all miss his presence on the bench and in the clubhouse,  
his knowledge and insight,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ``He 
has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said the knee is 90 percent of the reason he's ready to  
leave. He classified the other 10 percent as personal. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he's had problems with team owner George  
Steinbrenner, Zimmer paused for more than 10 seconds, then slowly 
said: ``I'm not going to ruin my life by making bad statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his voice cracking and his bottom lip quivering, Zimmer  
added, ``I've been lucky enough to be in this game for 51 years. 
... I came in strong, quietly and that's the way I'd like to go 
out, not to burn any bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said everyone in the Yankees organization, including  
Steinbrenner, is thankful to Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, he appreciates what Zim has done,'' Cashman said.  
``You can't say anything about it but high praise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he's not calling this departure a retirement and he  
won't say he's quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say I'm going home,'' Zimmer said. ``I don't know what  
that means except I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Knoblauch's leadoff homer was the 19th of his career. It  
was only the second inside-the-park homer at The Ballpark. Kansas 
City's Michael Tucker had the first on Aug. 16, 1996. ... Greer has 
an eight-game hitting streak, Texas' longest of the year. ... The 
Yankees put Roger Clemens on the disabled list with a strained left 
hamstring and called up left-handed reliever Tony Fossas. They also 
activated Brosius and sent outfielder Shane Spencer to Triple-A 
Columbus.

... I don't want him to come back before he's ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said Torre will watch the Royals series from a luxury  
box until he decides he's physically ready to return to the dugout. 
He's being cautioned not to try coming back too soon for fear of 
getting worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's down, tired and fatigued, he's not going to be at his  
best to take the reins,'' Cashman said. ``No matter when he comes 
back, we'll say, `Wow, he came back fast.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer gathered his team in the clubhouse following Wednesday  
night's 8-6 loss to the Texas Rangers and announced: ``After 
tomorrow's game, I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He amended it Thursday to say he'd be around until Torre is  
back. Nonetheless, the Yankees went into last night's game knowing 
it could be their last with their beloved ``Popeye'' in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch led off with an inside-the-park homer and Tino  
Martinez added a three-run shot as New York beat Texas 5-3. It was 
the Yankees' fifth victory over the Rangers in six games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to see him (Torre) here,'' said Bernie  
Williams, who went 2-for-4 with an RBI and a run. ``Zim has done 
great, but it's been tough on him because of his knee. He's got to 
take care of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro Mendoza (3-1) cruised through eight innings, allowing an  
RBI double by Rusty Greer in the third and a two-run homer to 
Rafael Palmeiro in the eighth. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for 
his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mendoza would probably be the ace on most staffs,'' Rangers  
manager Johnny Oates said. ``He is a quality pitcher in my mind and 
he kept us off-balance most of the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morgan (4-1), who lost his bid to become baseball's first  
five-game winner, left after being hit on his right shin by Derek 
Jeter's line drive in the fifth. He's likely to make his next 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, was New York's bench coach the last three years  
until being asked in mid-March to serve as interim manager. He's 
guided them to first place in the AL East with a 14-6 record 
despite several key injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all miss his presence on the bench and in the clubhouse,  
his knowledge and insight,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ``He 
has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said the knee is 90 percent of the reason he's ready to  
leave. He classified the other 10 percent as personal. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he's had problems with team owner George  
Steinbrenner, Zimmer paused for more than 10 seconds, then slowly 
said: ``I'm not going to ruin my life by making bad statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his voice cracking and his bottom lip quivering, Zimmer  
added, ``I've been lucky enough to be in this game for 51 years. 
... I came in strong, quietly and that's the way I'd like to go 
out, not to burn any bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said everyone in the Yankees organization, including  
Steinbrenner, is thankful to Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, he appreciates what Zim has done,'' Cashman said.  
``You can't say anything about it but high praise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he's not calling this departure a retirement and he  
won't say he's quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say I'm going home,'' Zimmer said. ``I don't know what  
that means except I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Knoblauch's leadoff homer was the 19th of his career. It  
was only the second inside-the-park homer at The Ballpark. Kansas 
City's Michael Tucker had the first on Aug. 16, 1996. ... Greer has 
an eight-game hitting streak, Texas' longest of the year. ... The 
Yankees put Roger Clemens on the disabled list with a strained left 
hamstring and called up left-handed reliever Tony Fossas. They also 
activated Brosius and sent outfielder Shane Spencer to Triple-A 
Columbus.

<HEADLINE>  WNBA and Union Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time this month, negotiators for  
the WNBA and its players association reached agreement Thursday on 
their first collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year deal was submitted to players with ratification  
expected to be completed by Friday. The league made plans to 
conduct its player draft next Tuesday, with the season expected to 
start on time, June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a milestone for our league to have its first  
collective bargaining, the first of its kind in women's team 
sports,'' WNBA president Val Ackerman said. ``It speaks volumes how 
far women's sports have come. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement reflects the commitment made to providing a  
first-class working environment for players. I'm glad we can get 
back to work and focus on our upcoming draft and our plans for the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract has a re-opener clause after three years, with both  
sides agreeing to no-lockout, no-strike clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	It sets a salary scale for draft picks of $50,000 for the first  
four players chosen, $44,000 for the fifth through eighth players 
and $37,500 for the rest of the players selected in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-round picks get $30,000, third-rounders $27,000 and  
fourth-rounders the rookie minimum of $25,000. The deal includes 
increases of 5 percent per year in those scales. 
</P>
<P>
	Minimum base salaries for veterans go to $30,000 this season and  
to $40,000 in the final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosters can include three players from the folded ABL, except  
for the expansion Orlando and Minnesota franchises, which will be 
permitted five former ABL players each. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this year, it will be a slowed absorbtion of ABL  
players,'' Ackerman said. ``The agreement provides for up to 40 
players to be eligible to play, three per each of the existing 10 
teams and five for each of expansion teams. It's a one-year 
restriction, a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very much want to have the best players in the world in the  
WNBA and we believe this agreement will ensure that. With no 
restrictions next year, we expect to have an even better talent 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players will receive a guaranteed percentage of all royalties  
from the sale of player-identified licensed products, with a 
minimum payment of $100,000 to be made each year to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also includes provisions for a 401K plan,  
year-round health and dental insurances and paid maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and union agreed to a contract earlier this month,  
but the deal fell apart a week ago when both sides insisted the 
other attempted to change the terms at the last minute. That caused 
the league to postpone the draft, which had been scheduled for 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks Monday and Tuesday resolved most of the outstanding  
issues, with the final deal reached in a four-hour meeting 
Thursday. The parties also agreed players would be allowed to 
participate in up to two not-for-profit, charitable events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so excited at this point,'' Pam Wheeler, executive  
director of the union, said. ``Our players are very excited. This 
is a process all of us looked forward to, because it was important 
for obvious reasons. At the same time, we're glad it's over.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Advance; Corn Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybean futures advanced Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and soybean futures early in the session were pressured by  
heavier-than-expected deliveries of supplies for the May contract -- 
a sign that farmers are settling for lower prices amid fears 
matters will become worse in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But wheat later rose on marginal export demand and news the  
government made another large purchase for donation to needy 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans found some support on conflicting forecasts  
for weather next week in Midwest growing regions. The National 
Weather Service is calling for above-normal rainfall, which could 
delay farmer fieldwork. But some private forecasters are saying 
skies will remain clear at least through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.68 a bushel; July  
corn was unchanged at $2.18 3/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.18 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 2 cents to $4.86 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork bellies futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .07 cent to 62.82 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .17 cent to 71.15 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .50 cent to 59.07 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .05 
cent to 59 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Group Heavy on Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Partners in Mario Lemieux's bid to buy the  
Pittsburgh Penguins include a fireworks maker, a car dealer, two 
realty companies and a former owner of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux on Friday revealed the names of his 10 partners as he  
tries to get creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to approve his $50 
million bid. The team is operating with court protection from 
creditors including Lemieux, the former star center who is owed $32 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Each member of the group has invested $2 million to $20 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Campbell, Lemieux's attorney, would not break down each  
member's contribution. Court documents show Lemieux would own 16.66 
percent of the team and put no cash down up front because he 
intends to forgive $10 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners are: Ronald Burkle, Robert Brooks, Angelo Falconi,  
Mark Hofmann, Robert Hofmann II, Anthony Liberati, William 
Kassling, Madison Realty Group, Millstein Industries and Bruce 
Zoldan. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Realty recently purchased the Frick and Westinghouse  
buildings in Pittsburgh, and Millstein Industries owns property 
around Pittsburgh. It is not affiliated with Howard Milstein, the 
New York developer who recently tried to buy the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberati, a Pittsburgh banker, had a stake in the Penguins when  
mall developer Edward DeBartolo owned the team and will be part of 
Lemieux's management team. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoldan runs a fireworks company in Youngstown, Ohio, and was  
once a target of mob extortion, according to reports in the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Plain Dealer in Cleveland. He did 
not return a telephone message left at his office Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hofmanns own a Pittsburgh food warehouse. Kassling and  
Brooks are executives at Westinghouse Air Brake Co. in suburban 
Pittsburgh. Falconi is a Washington County car dealer, and Burkle 
has investments in grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz said  
creditors can vote on Lemieux's plan, which the NHL has endorsed. 
No vote has been scheduled, however, and time is short. 
</P>
<P>
	Several attorneys and the judge raised the prospect at the  
half-day hearing that the team's last game in the playoffs this 
year might be its last as the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The league could move the team or dissolve the franchise if it  
is not reorganized by May 31, and the deadline loomed large at 
Friday's hearing on fine-tuning Lemieux's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be mindful of the potential for an unhappy ending  
and that the worst will occur,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league needs to schedule the Penguins for next year. The  
team needs to begin selling season tickets, explore free agency and 
prepare for the draft, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were happy that the league set this deadline. We've  
realized from the start of the bankruptcy proceedings of the 
possibility of dire consequences, and we see this as a way to force 
the issue and get things done,'' said team spokesman Tom McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the team's lease at the Civic Arena, which it calls  
the worst in the NHL at the oldest rink in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux wants not only to renegotiate the lease, which is worth  
$24 million to holder SMG of Philadelphia, but also to get a new 
arena for the Penguins by the 2003-04 season. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG is concerned Lemieux's plan mentions the potential for a  
government takeover of the lease, mentions rejection of the lease 
and provides nothing for SMG at any new arena, said Daniel Shapira, 
its attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Penguins are obligated to play at the Civic Arena  
until 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a clear and distinct possibility that the lease will  
remain in effect as it currently stands,'' Shapira said. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't work, Campbell responded. The lease dispute now  
threatens to bring the whole deal down. Markovitz on Friday 
appointed a mediator, bankruptcy Judge Bruce McCullough, to be 
available to both sides outside of court. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you make a mountain that is too high to climb, it won't be  
climbed and we will be watching some other city enjoying our hockey 
team,'' Markovitz told Shapira. ``We will be attending rock 
concerts at the arena next year instead of hockey games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the NHL players' union objected to Lemieux's plan  
to classify former teammates who are owed deferred salary by the 
Penguins with the same creditors who supply the team's pucks, 
towels, hot tubs, tickets and skates. 
</P>
<P>
	The union argued that Luc Robitaille, Ron Francis, Ken Wregget,  
Kevin Stevens and others deserve more standing in court -- and a 
larger percentage of what they are owed -- than others in the 
bankruptcy dispute because they are covered by the league-wide 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux plan would group the players with the so-called  
``unsecured creditors'' who are owed $77 million but have less 
rights than the IRS and creditors holding Penguins collateral, such 
as banks.

<HEADLINE> NASA Unveils New Atlantis Cockpit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA has unveiled a modern, Boeing  
777-style cockpit inside the space shuttle Atlantis, an improvement 
that astronauts say could save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the usual array of dials and knobs and three  
old-fashioned screens, Atlantis' cockpit now has nine 
high-resolution, liquid-crystal computer screens, thus the moniker 
``glass cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle pilots say they will be able to obtain information much  
more quickly during the crucial 8 1/2-minute climb to orbit. In 
addition, the data will be easier to read because of its 
organization and color coding. 
</P>
<P>
	They say this will help them deal better with emergencies.  
</P>
<P>
	``It really helps the crew analyze and react quicker,'' said  
Andrew Allen, a former shuttle commander who now works for United 
Space Alliance, the primary shuttle contractor. ``And in this 
business, on something that's as dynamic as an ascent, milliseconds 
can make a big difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters this week were granted unprecedented access into the  
space shuttle, being readied in the hangar for a December flight. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest and most visible example of NASA's continuing  
improvements to the space shuttle fleet, said Elric McHenry, 
manager of shuttle program development. Other upgrades include 
lighter fuel tanks, more sophisticated sensors, and more efficient 
and sturdier main engines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shuttle is the most capable and reliable and safe space  
transportation system in the world today, and we intend to keep it 
that way and we intend to improve it,'' McHenry said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA spent just over $200 million to develop and test the new  
cockpit system and to install it in Atlantis and training 
equipment. Engineers kept some of the switches and organized the 
screens so it wouldn't be too drastic of a change for the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other space shuttles will be outfitted with glass  
cockpits over the next two years at a cost of almost $9 million 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA expects to keep flying its space shuttles for the next 10  
or 20 years, or until something better comes along. An extended 
life is possible only if the shuttle systems are updated, McHenry 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia made the first shuttle flight 18 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dismissed in Carnival Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A murder indictment was dismissed Friday  
against amusement company executives, workers and inspectors over 
the death of a girl who was thrown from a carnival ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they needed more time to investigate, but the  
amusement company said the case never should have gotten so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that the murder indictment was inappropriate from  
the very day it was issued,'' said Sam Bassett, who represents ride 
owners Robert Dale Merten Sr., his wife, Shara Merten, and their 
son Robert Merten II. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also have a strong opinion that nobody involved in the  
running of the carnival or the ride committed any crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motion to dismiss came from prosecutors, and was granted by  
State District Judge Wilford Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This additional investigation may very well lead to new and  
different charges being filed against new or different parties,'' 
District Attorney Ronnie Earle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment accused people connected with Yuma, Ariz.-based  
B&AMP;B Amusements and Florida-based inspection company Bob Gill and 
Associates of ``knowingly and intentionally'' causing 15-year-old 
Leslie Lane's death. 
</P>
<P>
	She was catapulted from the Himalaya ride in March 1998 at the  
Austin-Travis County Livestock Show and Rodeo, struck a wall and 
died.

<HEADLINE> GM Plans Ads During 2002 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is moving ahead with plans  
to use the Olympics as a marketing platform to boost its slumping 
U.S. market share. 
</P>
<P>
	This is despite revelations that Salt Lake City officials bribed  
members of the International Olympic Committee. The controversy 
surrounding the games has driven some sponsors, including Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson, away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen anything on the horizon that devalues the  
Olympics,'' Phil Guarascio, GM's vice-president for advertising and 
corporate marketing, told The Detroit News for a story published 
Friday. ``Our original vision to use the Olympics as a marketing 
platform is still valid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM signed a $1 billion pact in July 1997 to become the official  
car and truck of the U.S. Olympic Committee and 41 governing sports 
groups through the 2008 Olympic games. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, GM will concentrate its Olympic marketing and  
sponsorship support on teams and athletes. The automaker plans to 
unveil details of its latest Olympic-themed television and print 
advertising on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad campaign will open this summer, 18 months before the 2000  
summer games in Sydney. The bulk of GM's spending will be for 
commercials on NBC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Oldsmobile and Chevrolet divisions plan to use Olympic  
magic to boost their image. 
</P>
<P>
	Oldsmobile disclosed plans Thursday to provide more than $1  
million in prize money to sponsor nine beach volleyball tournaments 
starting in May. Beginning in 2000, the Olympic rings will be 
featured in Oldsmobile advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games are an important springboard to reinvent  
Oldsmobile,'' Michael Sands, advertising and sales promotion 
director for the Oldsmobile Alero, told the News. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Chevrolet extended its sponsorship of the U.S. Ski,  
Snowboard and Hockey Olympic teams through 2004, and is negotiating 
to extend its sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic figure skating team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is on what we feel will endure -- the athletes and  
competition that will unfold on the rink and on the slope,'' said 
Mac Whisner, Chevrolet's director of truck advertising and 
promotion.

	HAVANA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Boys Choir and Men's Chorale  
began a tour of Cuba on Friday with a visit to a school for young 
music students. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Carmen Rosa Lopez welcomed the group of 87 boys and 25  
men at the Alejandro Garcia Caturla, a specialized public school 
for children with musical aptitude. The Americans arrived in Havana 
Thursday on an invitation by the Cuban Music Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Although other American performing groups have visited Havana,  
this is the first to actually tour the country since the 1959

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- When kids play soccer in the streets of  
Mexico City, it could now be their parents who get hit by the 
penalty card. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a law approved Thursday by the municipal assembly, playing  
soccer on the street without neighbors' approval is punishable by a 
fine of up to $111 and up to 36 hours in jail, the newspaper 
Reforma reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Minors are spared punishment for their first soccer offense, but  
on a second foul the penalties could be applied to their parents or 
guardians. 
</P>
<P>
	Street soccer is an old tradition in this soccer-crazy nation,  
but it often irks residents whose windows are sometimes broken as a

Laredo, died in a hospital after being shot repeatedly Thursday. 
</P>
<P>

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The former head of Brazil's Central  
Bank, arrested for refusing to testify under oath at a Senate probe 
about alleged irregularities, now says he will answer questions 
that don't incriminate him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel is investigating reports that some banks  
received insider information from a Central Bank source to reap 
profits from the January devaluation of the currency, the real, 
which took place during Francisco Lopes' 20-day stint heading the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Lopes had appeared on Monday for questioning by the  
Senate panel, but he refused to sign a document committing him to 
tell the truth. He was immediately arrested, then released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by a subsequent Supreme Court order saying he could not  
be forced to answer questions that could incriminate him, Lopes 
said, through his attorneys, he was willing to testify.

	The 1,056 pounds of cocaine were found Sunday in the department  
of Junin, 200 miles east of Lima, on a rustic river boat headed to 
Brazil, police said.

	The drug bust was the second major cocaine seizure this year.  
Police in April seized 2.3 tons of cocaine hidden under frozen fish 
in a warehouse in Lima.

	Peru is one of the world's largest growers of the coca leaf used  
to make cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Seminole Mascot May Become Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Nearly 80,000 people in full war chant  
and spurred by the low beating of drums whoop and holler at the 
sight of Chief Osceola, adorned in war paint, as he rides forth on 
his appaloosa horse and throws a flaming spear into the ground, 
taunting the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the football game tradition of the Florida State University  
Seminoles, not a ritual of the Indians the army fought in Florida 
in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people want those images and the school's Seminoles  
nickname retired to history, saying they're insensitive to Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who want the traditions and Seminoles name to stay at  
Florida State have found an ally in FSU alumnus Jim King, who also 
happens to be a state senator from Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	King, a Republican, has proposed an amendment to a minor bill  
that names university buildings. The amendment would put into state 
law that FSU's teams are the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's arrogant and disgraceful,'' said Suzan Shown Harjo,  
president of The Morning Star Institute, a Washington-based Indian 
rights group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name Seminole is the name of the native nation of people  
still alive,'' she said. ``It's also stupid. If I started a 
university, it would never occur to me to call it the France or the 
French.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But those who want to keep the name have another ally: the  
Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not offended, why should they be offended?'' asked Jim  
Shore, a Seminole and the lawyer for the 2,500 member tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	Shore said the tribe has no objections to the university using  
its name or other characterizations, even if they aren't always 
historically accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he has recently spoken to the tribe's leader, Chairman  
James Billie, who told him the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``At what point does the chairman of the Seminole tribe get his  
way?'' King asked. ``His way is `I want to be identified, I want to 
be related.''' 
</P>
<P>
	King said Billie ``loves FSU.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are comfortable with their own oppression,'' Harjo  
said. ``Osceola died because he stabbed a removal treaty and said 
`We're going nowhere' ... That's how strongly he felt about not 
compromising -- not being complicitous in his own oppression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to putting it in the law that FSU's sports teams are  
called the ``Seminoles,'' the amendment also makes the school's 
mascot legally ``Chief Osceola riding atop an appaloosa horse named 
`Renegade.''' It also puts the school colors of garnet and gold 
into statute. 
</P>
<P>
	If it becomes law, someone would have to go before the  
Legislature, which has several FSU graduates, to change the name. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he thinks the amendment will go through and the bill  
will pass. It is on a bill in the House, which is controlled by FSU 
grad John Thrasher. 
</P>
<P>
	Many college and professional teams have been pressured to  
change their Indian-related names and mascots. Protesters who find 
the Cleveland Indians' cartoonish ``Chief Wahoo'' logo offensive 
demonstrated outside the World Series in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups are suing the NFL's Washington Redskins in an  
effort to force the team to change its name. 
</P>
<P>
	Some universities have changed nicknames in recent years. The  
Marquette Warriors became the Golden Eagles; Eastern Michigan 
dropped the Hurons and are now the Eagles; St. John's switched from 
the Redmen to the Red Storm and Miami University of Ohio went from 
the Redskins to the RedHawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana University of Pennsylvania reached a compromise of sorts  
by continuing to call its teams the Indians while adopting a new 
logo depicting a bear.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Chase Title for Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks don't want to get left behind  
by the other hometown teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball Braves have a streak of seven straight playoff  
appearances, while the NFL Falcons made a stunning run to the Super 
Bowl in January. Now, the Hawks are in position for their first 
division title since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``The door is open for us,'' said Dikembe Mutombo, who has led  
the Hawks with 18-point, 18-rebound performances in each of the 
last two games. ``I don't want to let this pass me by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks take a seven-game winning streak heading into  
tonight's critical contest against struggling Indiana, which leads 
the Central Division by a half-game after an overtime victory over 
Charlotte on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers were touted as an NBA title contender at the  
beginning of the season. With less than a week to go, they're 
simply trying to hold off Atlanta to win the division and capture 
at least a No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at a real confident team,'' Hawks forward Alan  
Henderson said. ``Management has done a great job putting this 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just a couple of weeks ago, the Hawks were a floundering team,  
closer to falling out of the playoffs than they were to gaining 
home-court advantage in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta had a four-game losing streak after a 91-84 defeat at  
Milwaukee on April 13, falling to sixth in the East. In the tightly 
bunched field, there was a possibility the Hawks could miss the 
playoffs for the first time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. The Hawks haven't lost since that Milwaukee game  
and hold a tiebreaker edge over the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks are a deeper team than past seasons, making several  
key moves to bolster their reserves. They re-signed Tyrone Corbin 
and brought in free agents Anthony Johnson and Grant Long. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbin, the starting small forward for two seasons, filled in  
capably at shooting guard when Steve Smith twice went to the 
injured list with ailing knees and former first-round pick Ed Gray 
floundered. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, who spent two years in purgatory at Detroit, has been very  
helpful at strong forward with Henderson experiencing an 
up-and-down season. The Hawks won the first six games on their 
streak with Henderson sidelined by a bruised tailbone. 
</P>
<P>
	The most surprising player is second-year forward Chris  
Crawford, who hardly played last season and didn't seem to have 
much of a future in Atlanta after the signing of LaPhonso Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis struggled to mesh with the offense, then was diagnosed  
with a hernia that ended his season after only 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, who averaged less than five minutes per game prior to  
Ellis' injury, has been a major presence during the winning streak, 
averaging 13.1 points. He has brought much-needed energy and 
athletic ability to the Hawks, whose three core players -- Mookie 
Blaylock, Smith and Mutombo -- are all over 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt if he got a year under his belt, he could develop into  
a good role player,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said. ``I didn't know it 
would mushroom like it has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their success, the Hawks are still a team saddled with  
glaring weaknesses and the burden of never getting past the second 
round of the playoffs since moving to Atlanta in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to win a championship,'' general manager Pete Babcock  
said. ``We're working hard to get to the point where we're a true 
contender. We haven't gotten past the second round. That's a fact 
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blaylock has trouble beating most point guards off the dribble  
and is a major reason the Hawks rank next-to-last in assists. 
Smith, the team's leading scorer, is playing on gimpy knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is averaging only 86.3 points -- more than eight points  
below the next-lowest figure in team history -- and Wilkens would 
love to have ``a drop-dead outside shooter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, in the post-Michael Jordan era, the Hawks are one of  
several teams that believe they can make a run at a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hitting on all cylinders now,'' Crawford said. ``There's  
no doubt we can do some damage in the playoffs.''

<HEADLINE> Date Set for Trial of Kurd Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey set a date Friday for the treason  
trial of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying its case 
against the nation's No. 1 enemy would begin May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Turgut Okyay ruled during a pre-trial hearing that only 90  
people, including lawyers, journalists and spectators, will be 
allowed to attend Ocalan's trial on charges of treason and 
separatism. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreigners will be banned from participating in any official way  
to prevent interference with Turkey's justice system, Okyay said. 
Ocalan has several foreign lawyers, and international human rights 
groups have already expressed concerns about whether he will get a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawyers (of Ocalan) are clearly impeded from preparing  
their defense,'' said Wesley Gryk, an American lawyer with Amnesty 
International. ``The defense has been seen as a symbol of the 
defendant and his crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's lawyers have long complained that they were not being  
allowed to confer with their client alone to prepare the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's hearing, Ocalan's lawyers were often interrupted  
by relatives of soldiers and others who died during the 15 years of 
fighting between the Turkish army and Kurdish separatists in the 
southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives shouted obscenities, draped themselves in Turkish  
flags, and held pictures of loved ones who died in clashes with 
guerillas in Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Ocalan's lawyers were punched when they walked into the  
courthouse, prompting police to take the legal team downtown in 
armored cars after the hearing. But the lawyers said police punched 
and kicked them when they got out of the cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan, the sole inmate on the prison island of Imrali, is  
widely expected to get the death penalty if convicted. For security 
reasons, his trial will take place on the heavily guarded island in 
the Sea of Marmara. The island was emptied of inmates when Ocalan 
arrived following his capture in February by Turkish forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike standard, lengthy Turkish trials, which are often  
interrupted for months between sessions, Ocalan's trial will be 
carried out without interruption, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ocalan is sentenced to death as expected, the far-right  
Nationalist Movement Party has said it will push parliament to 
approve the execution. Parliament has not given permission for an 
execution since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The party's campaign posters in the recent election depicted  
Ocalan as a devil devouring a child, and they contained the slogan, 
``Turkish nation made its decision: Execution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he is hanged, my tears will never cease. I lost my  
son, my only son,'' said Sami Sulun, father of a commando, Hamza 
Ali, who was killed by Kurdish rebels four years ago at the age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The government blames the PKK rebels for the deaths of more than  
9,800 civilians, soldiers, police officers and government-paid 
village guards. The rebel losses since 1984 stand at around 27,000 
people.

<HEADLINE> Thai Co., Dow Chemical Open Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Siam Polyethylene Co., a joint venture  
between Siam Cement and U.S.-based Dow Chemical, announced Friday 
that it has opened one of the world's largest polyethylene 
production plants in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Siam Polyethylene said the $100 million plant, located in  
Thailand's eastern seaboard industrial zone, has an annual capacity 
of 300,000 tons of polyethylene, an ingredient in plastics. 
</P>
<P>
	Output will be sold regionally, the company said.  
</P>
<P>
	The plant initially will produce low-density polyethylene  
resins, with Dow Chemical's trademark DOWLEX polyethylene coming 
into production toward the end of the year, it said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Siam Cement, Thailand's largest industrial conglomerate, and Dow  
Chemical have worked together for more than a decade, producing 
chemicals, plastics and related products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are proud to open this world-scale polyethylene production  
facility, which is our first in the Asia-Pacific region,'' said Dow 
Chemical, which is headquartered in Midland, Mich.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Extend Gains Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices of contracts for future delivery of crude  
oil rose today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, extending a 
rally that has lifted oil prices to 16-month highs. 
</P>
<P>
	But some petroleum product contracts fell in commodity trading  
as traders took profits on recent sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally in crude oil has been helped by declining supplies,  
reflecting production cutbacks promised by the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries in an attempt to bolster prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude oil for delivery in June rose 13 cents to  
close at $18.66 a barrel on the Nymex. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in June  
rose 12 cents to $16.57 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit-taking sent petroleum products falling on the Nymex.  
</P>
<P>
	May contracts for heating oil fell 0.32 cent to 44.47 cents a  
gallon, May unleaded gasoline slipped 0.75 cent to 54.47 cents a

<HEADLINE> New Zealander Nominated To Head WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Former New Zealand Prime Minister Mike Moore was  
nominated today as the new head of the World Trade Organization in 
a close race that pitted him against Thailand's deputy prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Mchumo, chairman of the WTO's decision-making council, told  
council members he formally proposed Moore because he had support 
from 62 nations, three more than Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the considered opinion that Mr. Moore faced less  
opposition to his candidacy,'' said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was adjourned to let members weigh the nomination.  
</P>
<P>
	With a new round of trade talks looming and a ministerial  
conference coming up in Seattle in November, the role of WTO 
director-general is regarded as key. The organization is 
responsible for pushing through agreements to liberalize global 
commerce and set free trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether Asian nations would seek to  
veto Moore's nomination. The United States supported Moore's 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries argued it was vital to avoid a leadership vacuum  
at a time when the WTO is caught up in high-profile disputes 
between the United States and European Union over bananas and 
hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the leadership headaches, the WTO's four deputies  
were also expected to leave at the same time as Renato Ruggiero, an 
Italian who has been the WTO head for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 50, is a supporter of free trade, but also an advocate  
for the underprivileged and less powerful, smaller nations.

<HEADLINE> Airline Again Cancels Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Unusually slow repair work prompted Alaska  
Airlines to cancel flights for a sixth straight day today, but by 
late afternoon, airline officials said they were optimistic that a 
suspected six-day slowdown by mechanics was over. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 flights have been canceled since Sunday, as the  
airline blamed an illegal slowdown by its mechanics' union for 
delays in repair and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday afternoon, it appeared the problem was being resolved.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the slowdown is starting to speed up,'' said  
airline spokesman Jack Evans. A total of 34 flights were canceled 
by noon, but by late afternoon, just four more had been scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said in a letter to the airline that ``they  
neither orchestrated nor were aware of any illegal job action,'' 
Evans said. The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association's Local 14 
in Seattle said in a recorded telephone message that leadership 
``does not condone nor do we support a work slowdown of any kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The repair problems mark the second time in two weeks that  
Alaska Airlines' labor force has stalled operations. The carrier 
schedules about 500 departures daily. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 16, Alaska canceled 28 flights after 175 ticket agents  
and baggage handlers called in sick. The International Association 
of Machinists, which represents those workers, said there was no 
organized job action. Some workers have been suspended pending 
investigation, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the airline's unions are negotiating updated contracts  
except its pilots, whose most recent package was signed in 1997. 
Workers have complained that the talks are progressing slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, passengers affected by the repair-related cancellations  
have been given seats on other flights, though they've been delayed 
an average of 1 1/2 to two hours. Alaska also is consolidating some 
flights to ensure travelers reach their destinations, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancellations are running at five to 10 times the typical rate,  
the carrier says. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines ``is exploring every option available to protect  
it and the traveling public, up to and including disciplinary 
action and the court system,'' the company said in a news release.

<HEADLINE> NATO Attack Leaves Belgrade Stunned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's war against Yugoslavia came  
to a quiet residential district of the capital Friday in an errant 
missile strike before dawn that injured at least nine people and 
left a jumble of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Houses rocked from the explosion and a burst pipe sent a  
foot-high torrent of water pouring through the street in Belgrade's 
Vracar district. A car lay crushed under massive chunks of concrete 
as rescue workers picked through the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like a hundred earthquakes,'' said Dragica Savic, 66.  
``We could be dead even before trying to get to a shelter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A moderate earthquake did shake Belgrade several hours later,  
causing no casualties but further upsetting residents still jittery 
from the night's bombardment. The Serbian Seismological Institute 
said the epicenter of the 5.5-magnitude quake was 37 miles south of 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	During the airstrikes, two houses were blown apart, one with a  
small corner cafe, and several other small one- and two-story homes 
were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said one of its missiles had veered off course during its  
fiercest assault ever on the Yugoslav capital overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The neighborhood is located less than a mile from the army and  
police headquarters downtown that were also hit and damaged. A 
policeman and two other people were killed and a total of 40 people 
were injured in the round of strikes on Belgrade, authorities said. 
Strikes in the smaller Yugoslav republic Montenegro and in Kosovo 
killed eight people, including two young girls, local media reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	During more than five weeks of bombing, a residential  
neighborhood in Belgrade has been hit only once before, when NATO 
targeted one of President Slobodan Milosevic's homes elsewhere in 
the city. That April 22 strike demolished the house -- Milosevic was 
not there at the time -- and no other damage in the area was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite NATO's statement that one missile went awry, Vracar  
residents said there were two explosions several minutes apart. 
Mrs. Savic said when her neighbor prepared to evacuate after the 
first explosion, the second knocked him against a wall and fire 
from the blast singed his hair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this was the safest area in Belgrade since there are  
no military or police targets anywhere close to here,'' she said. 
``But nowhere is safe here anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An elderly man stumbled through the wreckage of one of the homes  
Friday afternoon, poking through kitchen pots and jars of pickled 
vegetables and jams miraculously untouched by the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is incredible. I couldn't expect this from our friends,''  
Zivko Novakov told reporters during a visit to the neighborhood by 
civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. ``They (NATO) will say again, 
'Sorry, it was a mistake.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of yards away stood Svetla Djeric, her eyes filled with  
tears. With her hand shaking, she held out something wrapped in a 
handkerchief. It was a piece of the missile that destroyed her 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God we are alive,'' she whispered. ``I don't know how we  
managed to jump out of the windows, it was a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bora Filipovic said he and his family, who live next to the  
destroyed cafe, were jarred awake by the first explosion and fled 
when their house was badly jolted by the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We jumped out of the window. Me, my wife, my daughter and my  
son. My son broke his leg,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav army spokesman Col. Milivoje Novakovic accused NATO of  
pursuing the ``pathological destruction of the Yugoslav capital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the blast, stunned residents held handkerchiefs over  
their noses to protect themselves against a thick, white cloud of 
dust that rose from the ruins. A child cried as her mother picked 
through rubble to find her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	People stumbled through the wreckage, some looking frozen with  
shock. Ambulances rushed to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town, people on their way to work Friday gazed silently  
at the tangle of concrete and steel at Yugoslav Army headquarters 
while bulldozers cleared away the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Women wept watching the scene.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are destroying us, one by one, piece by piece,'' said  
Jasminka Radovanovic, 30. ``What do they want from us?''

<HEADLINE> Survey: Sex More Important Than Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans regard family, money and religion as  
more important than sexual satisfaction, but sex ranks ahead of 
happiness on the job, according to a survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, designed to assess the attitudes of Americans toward  
sexual health, found that 82 percent of 500 adults rated a 
satisfying sex life as important or very important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loving family relationships'' was ranked as important or very  
important by 99 percent of those surveyed, while financial security 
was a point behind at 98 percent. In third place was religion and 
spiritual life at 86 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Job satisfaction was last in the survey, rated as important or  
very important by only 79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the telephone survey ``show the importance the vast  
majority of American adults place on sexual health and 
relationships,'' said Dr. Marianne J. Legato, director of the 
Partnership for Women's Health at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	``This survey is a 'snapshot' in time that looks at how American  
adults view issues related to sexuality and sexual problems as a 
whole,'' she said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was conducted for a symposium on gender and human  
sexuality co-sponsored by Columbia University and the Office of 
Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health. 
The survey is based on opinions from 500 adult Americans, aged 25 
and older, selected by random-digit telephone dialing, and has a 
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The genders 
were equally represented in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Age was not considered a factor in the importance attached to  
sex, the results show. The survey found that 94 percent, almost 
equally divided between men and women, agreed with the statement: 
``Enjoyable sexual relations add to a person's quality of life, 
even when they grow older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sex problems were frequent for 6 percent of those surveyed,  
occasional for 16 percent and rare for 30 percent. Forty-six 
percent said they never have sexual problems while 2 percent 
refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	When there are sex problems between partners, 47 percent agreed  
with the statement that the woman would be blamed more often than 
the man, while 42 percent disagreed. Among women in the survey, 57 
percent thought women would be blamed more often for sex problems, 
while only 37 percent of the men said that. 
</P>
<P>
	There was widespread concern among respondents about what might  
happen if they went to a doctor about sex problems. Seventy-six 
percent said they were concerned there would be no medical help for 
their problems; 71 percent feared their doctor would dismiss the 
problem, saying it was in the patient's head, and 68 percent were 
concerned that their physician ``would be uncomfortable'' talking 
about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Among women, 81 percent feared the doctor would blame sex  
troubles on a ``head'' problem. This concerned only 60 percent of 
the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charlotte A. Gaydos, a professor of public health at Johns  
Hopkins University School of Medicine, said the survey shows that 
people expect to continue sexual happiness ``right into the golden 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As America ages, it is going to be more important that older  
people have some place to go to get help,'' said Gaydos. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, she said, the survey shows ``there is no place that people  
feel comfortable in seeking help for sexual problems'' because the 
respondents feared a doctor would think they had an emotional or 
psychological problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need more education about where people who are having  
sexual problems can find help,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found Americans believe other problems in life can be  
linked to sexual difficulties. Depression, extramarital affairs and 
divorce can all be caused by poor sex, said 91 percent of the 
respondents, while 93 percent thought sexual problems could cause 
emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	With whom would they discuss sex problems, such as impotence,  
pain during intercourse or lack of interest? Fifty-three percent 
said they would talk to their spouse or partner and 30 percent 
would go to a doctor, while 5 percent said they would talk to a 
friend and 5 percent wouldn't discuss it with anyone. Two percent 
said they would talk to siblings. The mother, father or clergy 
would be contacted by 1 percent each.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Fixing Missile Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Maverick missile is supposed to roar out from  
under the wings of American military aircraft and blast ground 
targets as far as 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	But the military has removed more than 5,000 missiles built  
early in the decade from service as Raytheon Co. works to correct 
defects that have caused them to miss their targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The malfunctioning missiles have also sparked a lawsuit against  
the Massachusetts subcontractor Raytheon claims supplied faulty 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the Maverick missiles that are the subject of the  
lawsuit have been identified, and they are in the process of being 
repaired, or are being stored by the government awaiting repair,'' 
Raytheon spokesman David Polk said Thursday. ``None are being 
deployed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, the Lexington-based Raytheon claims Helix  
Technology Corp. of Mansfield, supplied defective cryoengines, a 
$2,100 part that helps regulate the missile's temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Helix denies manufacturing faulty parts.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were not defective. The cryoengines went through a series  
of inspections by Helix personnel prior to release,'' said the 
company's lawyer, Craig Stewart. ``When the last of these 
cryoengines left our facility in March of 1994, they were in 
perfect condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said that before the parts left Helix's factory, they  
were inspected by representatives of Raytheon and the Department of 
Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have control after that point,'' Stewart said,  
adding that Helix no longer supplies parts to the Maverick program. 
</P>
<P>
	Various generations of the Maverick missile have been in service  
since 1972, but the defect has been found only on missiles from one 
production lot. The Maverick is carried under the wings of F-15E, 
F-16 and A-10 jets and is used to destroy surface targets like 
tanks and armor, air defenses, ships, transportation equipment and 
fuel storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavericks can be launched from high altitudes to tree-top level  
and can hit targets ranging from a distance of a few thousand feet 
to about 15 miles. The missile has ``launch-and-leave'' capability 
that enables a pilot to fire it and immediately take evasive action 
or attack another target as the missile guides itself to the 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force discovered the problem during routine testing in  
1994, said Col. Bob George, head of the armament division and 
program manager for surface to air munitions at Hill Air Force Base 
in Utah. He said 44 percent of the missiles in a batch produced 
under a 1991 defense contract were found to have the defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The missiles were manufactured at a former Raytheon facility in  
Bristol, Tenn., but they are being repaired in Tucson, Ariz., said 
Polk. 
</P>
<P>
	He said American forces fighting in the Balkans still have  
access to properly functioning Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile is used primarily by the Air Force, although the  
Navy has a supply as well. Mavericks have been sold to American 
allies, but Polk said all the defective missiles are under American 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a very small percentage of the total  
number of Mavericks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk would not say what damages Raytheon was seeking from Helix.

	Civil Rights Leader Meets U.S. POWs  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three U.S. soldiers held prisoner by  
Yugoslavia today recounted their days of isolation to civil rights 
leader Jesse Jackson, their first public remarks since they were 
captured a month ago. ``Sorry I put you through so much pain and 
agony,'' one said in a message to his family. Jackson, who is 
expected to meet tomorrow with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, flew to Belgrade in an attempt to win their release. But 
Assistant Foreign Minister Nebojsa Vujovic said their release 
wasn't on the agenda. 

</P>

	US Says Yugoslavia Has Little Fuel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said today Yugoslavia's troops  
are running dangerously low on fuel and other supplies and that 
President Slobodan Milosevic is on a course that will only lead to 
a ``dead end.'' Meanwhile, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael 
Ryan said he had ``no reservations'' about NATO's air strategy, 
which some retired military officers have criticized as a form of 
gradualism akin to the approach the United States took in Vietnam, 
with disastrous results. He also defended the performance of Air 
Force crews and said they still face high risk from Serb air 
defenses. Nonetheless, he said, ``We're going to keep at it until 
they are completely disintegrated.''

	NRA Protesters Marching in Denver  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Students, gun-control groups and lawmakers have  
planned a day of protests tomorrow to tell the National Rifle 
Association it's not welcome. The group had scheduled its annual 
meeting in Denver for May 1, long before the Columbine High 
massacre. ``When a community is grieving and going through a 
mourning ... you shouldn't have a meeting that talks about selling 
more guns,'' Denver Mayor Wellington Webb said. But the NRA scaled 
back its meeting ``out of respect for the community.'' Fifteen 
people were killed during the April 20 rampage in Littleton, Colo, 
about 15 miles away.

in central London. Authorities believe the blast was linked to two 
bombings in minority communities in the past two weeks. Gay 
businesses were put on alert after those attacks, and some victims 
in tonight's blast appeared to have nail wounds. The two previous 
bomb attacks have been claimed by an extreme right-wing group

	Staid Finland Ready To Party  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Police today erected riot fences and  
first-aid workers were summoned to duty in Finland's capital in 
preparation for the nation's annual bacchanal, Vappu. Celebrated on 
May 1, Vappu is the holiday when masked Finns take to the streets 
with alcoholic beverages, defying their taciturn image. The name 
Vappu derives from St. Walpurgis, whose feast day is observed May 
1. The eve of the feast is considered a night when witches and evil 
spirits come out en masse. But it's also developed an ugly side 
marked by robberies, alcohol poisoning and public urination.

Judge Stanley P. Klein banished Nikita, a Siberian husky and Max, a 
Doberman pinscher, from Virginia and bordering states. Jonathan 
Fouche, the ostrich breeder, said the ruling was fine. ``As long as 
they're going to be kept from doing it again,'' he said.

	Deal To Move Pats To Conn. Off  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The New England Patriots today nixed deal to move  
to Connecticut's capital because a stadium could not be built fast 
enough. Gov. John Rowland promised legal action against Patriots 
owner Robert Kraft and possibly the NFL as well. In December, Kraft 
signed a deal with Rowland to move the team after the state offered 
to build a $380 million stadium in Hartford. Under a plan designed 
to keep the Patriots in Massachusetts, the state would pay $70 
million for infrastructure supporting a new stadium in Foxboro, the 
team's current home. But Kraft would have to pay for the stadium. 
The announcement comes two days before Sunday's deadline for Kraft 
to back out of the deal with Connecticut without financial penalty.

<HEADLINE>  War Gives Albania Chance To Impress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- A Balkan war that is bedeviling almost  
every participant is likely to produce at least one surprising and 
clear-cut winner: tiny, impoverished and long-neglected Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades after World War II, Albania was closed off from the  
outside world, a Stalinist enclave so primitive and isolated that 
it scarcely seemed part of its continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in the full glare of the international media spotlight,  
Albania plays earnest host to more than 370,000 Kosovo refugees and 
welcomes NATO troops by the thousands to wage war on Yugoslavia. 
The new national motto seems to be: Come On In. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of begrudging the throngs of refugees, or griping over  
NATO pushiness, Albanians are rolling out as much of a red carpet 
as possible in a country where most roads are riddled with potholes 
and most buildings are in disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a saying that every bad thing has a good side,'' said  
Information Minister Musa Ulqini. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen the terrible images of what has happened in Kosovo,  
and it's difficult for us as a poor country to take in so many 
refugees,'' he said in an interview. ``But it has positive aspects 
-- Albania has showed the world its good side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Communist dictator Enver Hoxha, Albanians couldn't show  
the world much of anything. Few foreigners were allowed in, and few 
Albanians allowed out as the country wallowed in state-controlled 
backwardness. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist rule ended in 1991, but Albania's image problems  
persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Riots erupted in March 1997 as thousands of Albanians lost their  
life savings in the collapse of pyramid investment schemes. 
Government facilities were looted; an estimated 800,000 automatic 
weapons and 1 billion rounds of ammunition were snatched from 
security-force warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	More riots broke out in the capital of Tirana last year after a  
popular opposition leader was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime, corruption and tax evasion remain rampant, but the  
country has suddenly found a keen sense of national purpose because 
of the forced expulsion of the ethnic Albanian majority from 
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. There has been minimal bickering over 
the government's pivotal decisions -- to allow an unchecked influx 
of refugees and give NATO free rein to use Albania as a staging 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albania's politics is usually not unified,'' said Remzi Lani,  
a political analyst in Tirana. ``On this, support is 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A vast military and relief operation is unfolding. Some 100  
planes a day are landing at Tirana's modest airport, and activity 
has more than doubled at Durres, the main port. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees -- equal to about one-eighth of Albania's 3-million  
population -- are being accommodated in some 200 camps, as well as 
in thousands of private homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us in government expected Albanians would do what they  
did,'' Ulqini said of the remarkable hospitality. ``In the first 10 
days, while we were trying to make the international community 
aware, no one died of hunger or lack of medicine. It makes me very 
proud to be an Albanian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian leaders stress that their decisions arose from a sense  
of moral obligation to the refugees and NATO, not from a 
calculating desire for economic aid. But they are optimistic that 
aid will expand, and that seemingly impossible dreams of one day 
joining NATO and the European Union will henceforth seem less 
far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
	Western governments don't want to fuel unrealistic expectations,  
but they agree that the Kosovo war has enabled Albania to remake 
its image after the 1997 debacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an unbelievable second chance for Albania, in a very  
weird and twisted sense,'' said one Western diplomat in Tirana, who 
discussed developments on condition he and his government not be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Albanian politicians and the public, there is anticipation  
of a massive Western aid program for the Balkans, comparable to the 
Marshall Plan that rebuilt Western Europe after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is getting to know the spirit and the dignity of the  
Albanian people,'' said Myrvet Domnori, 50, owner of a Tirana 
pharmacy and host to three Kosovo refugees at her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are so pleased that the Marshall Plan will be  
implemented,'' she said. ``It would be such a shame if the world 
did not do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A note of caution was sounded by Zef Preci, director of  
Albania's first independent economic think tank. He said foreign 
aid might breed over-dependency and won't won't help Albania in the 
long run as much as institutional reforms to reduce corruption, 
fight crime, improve the banking system and streamline the 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of improving the business culture,'' he said.  
``We need to change the old-fashioned way of thinking -- of waiting 
for the government to suggest the solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate is probably double the official figure of  
17 percent, Preci said, and an estimated 60 percent of the economy 
is the so-called informal sector that produces virtually no tax 
revenue. Though potentially capable of feeding itself, Albania is 
importing 80 percent of its food because of its economic disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a controlled economy, it's not a free-market  
economy,'' Preci said. ``It's a survival economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lani, who directs a media institute aimed at improving the  
quality of Albanian journalism, said any regional reconstruction 
plan must be accompanied by reconciliation and diminished 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot have a Marshall Plan and at the same time treat each  
other as the enemy,'' he said. ``We can't be teaching history with 
the same old textbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those old books, Lani noted, was written by Hoxha: ``The  
Anglo-American Threat to Albania.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the United States and Britain are in the front lines to  
help us,'' he said. ``It's a good lesson, though a bitter lesson, 
that our friends of the last 60 years -- Yugoslavia, Russia and 
China -- are all against us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lani said Albania's current president, Rexhep Meidani, is the  
right man for the times, a low-key former professor with little 
zest for partisan power politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Balkans, we are tired of heroes,'' Lani said. ``Our  
heroes have been disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At no point during the Kosovo conflict has there been any  
serious push in Albania for taking charge of post-war Kosovo or 
forming any sort of ``Greater Albania'' -- a vague concept feared in 
some neighboring countries with Albanian minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is not to create a greater Albania, but to create a  
region in the Balkans that could be part of an integrated Europe,'' 
said Ulqini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albanians want to be part of European civilization, but for  
500 years it wasn't possible,'' he said. ``Now is the time... We 
dare to look beyond today. We dare to be optimistic.''

	For decades after World War II, Albania was closed off from the  
outside world, a Stalinist enclave so primitive and isolated that 
it scarcely seemed part of its continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in the full glare of the international media spotlight,  
Albania plays earnest host to more than 370,000 Kosovo refugees and 
welcomes NATO troops by the thousands to wage war on Yugoslavia. 
The new national motto seems to be: Come On In. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of begrudging the throngs of refugees, or griping over  
NATO pushiness, Albanians are rolling out as much of a red carpet 
as possible in a country where most roads are riddled with potholes 
and most buildings are in disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a saying that every bad thing has a good side,'' said  
Information Minister Musa Ulqini. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen the terrible images of what has happened in Kosovo,  
and it's difficult for us as a poor country to take in so many 
refugees,'' he said in an interview. ``But it has positive aspects 
-- Albania has showed the world its good side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Communist dictator Enver Hoxha, Albanians couldn't show  
the world much of anything. Few foreigners were allowed in, and few 
Albanians allowed out as the country wallowed in state-controlled 
backwardness. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist rule ended in 1991, but Albania's image problems  
persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Riots erupted in March 1997 as thousands of Albanians lost their  
life savings in the collapse of pyramid investment schemes. 
Government facilities were looted; an estimated 800,000 automatic 
weapons and 1 billion rounds of ammunition were snatched from 
security-force warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	More riots broke out in the capital of Tirana last year after a  
popular opposition leader was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime, corruption and tax evasion remain rampant, but the  
country has suddenly found a keen sense of national purpose because 
of the forced expulsion of the ethnic Albanian majority from 
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. There has been minimal bickering over 
the government's pivotal decisions -- to allow an unchecked influx 
of refugees and give NATO free rein to use Albania as a staging 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albania's politics is usually not unified,'' said Remzi Lani,  
a political analyst in Tirana. ``On this, support is 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A vast military and relief operation is unfolding. Some 100  
planes a day are landing at Tirana's modest airport, and activity 
has more than doubled at Durres, the main port. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees -- equal to about one-eighth of Albania's 3-million  
population -- are being accommodated in some 200 camps, as well as 
in thousands of private homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us in government expected Albanians would do what they  
did,'' Ulqini said of the remarkable hospitality. ``In the first 10 
days, while we were trying to make the international community 
aware, no one died of hunger or lack of medicine. It makes me very 
proud to be an Albanian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian leaders stress that their decisions arose from a sense  
of moral obligation to the refugees and NATO, not from a 
calculating desire for economic aid. But they are optimistic that 
aid will expand, and that seemingly impossible dreams of one day 
joining NATO and the European Union will henceforth seem less 
far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
	Western governments don't want to fuel unrealistic expectations,  
but they agree that the Kosovo war has enabled Albania to remake 
its image after the 1997 debacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an unbelievable second chance for Albania, in a very  
weird and twisted sense,'' said one Western diplomat in Tirana, who 
discussed developments on condition he and his government not be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Albanian politicians and the public, there is anticipation  
of a massive Western aid program for the Balkans, comparable to the 
Marshall Plan that rebuilt Western Europe after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is getting to know the spirit and the dignity of the  
Albanian people,'' said Myrvet Domnori, 50, owner of a Tirana 
pharmacy and host to three Kosovo refugees at her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are so pleased that the Marshall Plan will be  
implemented,'' she said. ``It would be such a shame if the world 
did not do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A note of caution was sounded by Zef Preci, director of  
Albania's first independent economic think tank. He said foreign 
aid might breed over-dependency and won't won't help Albania in the 
long run as much as institutional reforms to reduce corruption, 
fight crime, improve the banking system and streamline the 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of improving the business culture,'' he said.  
``We need to change the old-fashioned way of thinking -- of waiting 
for the government to suggest the solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate is probably double the official figure of  
17 percent, Preci said, and an estimated 60 percent of the economy 
is the so-called informal sector that produces virtually no tax 
revenue. Though potentially capable of feeding itself, Albania is 
importing 80 percent of its food because of its economic disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a controlled economy, it's not a free-market  
economy,'' Preci said. ``It's a survival economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lani, who directs a media institute aimed at improving the  
quality of Albanian journalism, said any regional reconstruction 
plan must be accompanied by reconciliation and diminished 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot have a Marshall Plan and at the same time treat each  
other as the enemy,'' he said. ``We can't be teaching history with 
the same old textbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those old books, Lani noted, was written by Hoxha: ``The  
Anglo-American Threat to Albania.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the United States and Britain are in the front lines to  
help us,'' he said. ``It's a good lesson, though a bitter lesson, 
that our friends of the last 60 years -- Yugoslavia, Russia and 
China -- are all against us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lani said Albania's current president, Rexhep Meidani, is the  
right man for the times, a low-key former professor with little 
zest for partisan power politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Balkans, we are tired of heroes,'' Lani said. ``Our  
heroes have been disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At no point during the Kosovo conflict has there been any  
serious push in Albania for taking charge of post-war Kosovo or 
forming any sort of ``Greater Albania'' -- a vague concept feared in 
some neighboring countries with Albanian minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is not to create a greater Albania, but to create a  
region in the Balkans that could be part of an integrated Europe,'' 
said Ulqini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albanians want to be part of European civilization, but for  
500 years it wasn't possible,'' he said. ``Now is the time... We 
dare to look beyond today. We dare to be optimistic.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cholesterol Spread Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new spread touted as the first to contain a  
soybean extract that can help promote healthy cholesterol levels is 
heading to store shelves, after the government reviewed research 
showing the key ingredient is safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it had evaluated  
materials submitted by Lipton, the manufacturer of Take Control, 
and did not question the conclusion that the ingredient was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton says Take Control is the first butter-margarine  
substitute to contain a soybean extract called plant sterols that 
helps promote healthy cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency has no questions at this time regarding Lipton's  
conclusion that vegetable oil sterol esters are generally 
recognized as safe under the intended conditions of use,'' the FDA 
said in a letter to Lipton. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law says that new food ingredients must either win FDA  
approval or be certified by qualified experts as a generally safe 
substance. The company agreed earlier this year to submit studies 
and information from an independent panel of experts supporting the 
assertion that the product was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA, while reviewing this material, noted in its letter to  
Lipton that it did not do its own research on Take Control's 
ingredients to determine whether it was generally recognized as 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton also worked with the FDA to come up with appropriate  
language to describe the product's claim that it helps promote 
healthy cholesterol levels, said David Blanchard, the company's 
vice president of research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA places strict requirements for scientific proof before  
allowing companies to claim their products help prevent or treat 
disease. The law, however, allows more vague claims about how a 
food supports bodily ``structure or function'' without supporting 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanchard said Take Control will benefit people trying to manage  
their cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first entry for the company, based in Englewood,  
N.J., into the market of ``functional foods'' -- those said to 
include new ingredients that promote good health.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Sign Meares To Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pat Meares' first six games in the National  
League must have impressed the Pittsburgh Pirates -- they signed him 
today to a $15 million, four-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares reached terms only a week after returning from a  
three-week layoff with an injured left wrist and 4 1/2 months after a 
contract impasse caused him to part ways with the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares, who is making $1.5 million this season, will be paid  
$3.75 million a year from the 2000 through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat Meares is the guy we wanted playing shortstop for the  
Pittsburgh Pirates,'' general manager Cam Bonifay said. ``He's been 
a big addition to the ballclub and he's the type of player who can 
help make us a championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longterm contract is the second given a Pirates regular  
since funding was approved in February for a new ballpark that will 
open in 2001. First baseman Kevin Young signed in March a $24 
million, four-year deal that is the richest in team's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares' contract is the third most expensive signed by the  
Pirates, surpassed only by Young's contract and Jay Bell's $17.5 
million contract in 1993. The Meares deal is worth more than the 
$14 million the Pirates paid their entire roster last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it here and wanted to stay here,'' Meares said. ``I  
heard Pittsburgh was like the Twin Cities and my wife and I really 
liked it up there. The people here have been very welcoming, very 
friendly and I look forward to playing shortstop here another 4-5 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meares, 30, didn't really want to leave after five years with  
the Twins, especially after driving in 70 runs last season. But, 
amid a round of off-season salary slashing, the Twins balked at his 
request for $4 million a year and subsequently failed in late 
December to offer him a 1999 contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The move left Meares a free agent but, with most teams'  
off-season moves already completed, the Pirates were the only team 
that offered a chance to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the thing, I wanted to play every day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meares' signing muddies the future of one-time Pirates shortstop  
heir apparent Abraham Nunez, who began the season in Pittsburgh but 
was sent to Triple-A Nashville once Meares was activated on April 
23. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abraham Nunez will be a starting shortstop in the major  
leagues sometime soon -- either for the Pirates or some other 
team,'' Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares took a .259 average, no homers and two RBIs -- and no  
errors -- into Friday night's game against Colorado.

</P>
<P>
	The book, set in 1939 St. Paul, Minn., is the story of a  
photographer who finds himself suspected of committing two murders. 
The author said he was stunned by the award because he never 
intended it as a mystery. 
</P>

	``I'm just so flabbergasted that I won this thing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Other winners named Thursday were: Steve Hamilton's ``A Cold Day  
in Paradise,'' for best first novel by an American author; Rick 
Riordan's ``The Widower's Two Step,'' for best paperback original; 
Carlton Stowers' ``To the Last Breath,'' for best fact crime; Robin 
Winks and Maureen Corrigam's ``Mystery and Suspense Writers,'' for 
best critical or biographical work; Tom Franklin's ``Poachers,'' 
for best short story; Nancy Werlin's ``The Killer's Cousin,'' in 
the best young adult category; and Wendelin Van Draanen's ``Sammy 
Keyes and the Hotel Thief,'' for best children's mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Law &AMP; Order'' took home two awards; ``Out of Sight'' won  
for best movie; and television producer Steven Bochco received a 
special citation. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1946, Mystery Writers of America is an organization  
dedicated to promoting the genre. It represents more than 3,000 
writers, editors, agents, booksellers, librarians and others with 
an interest in mystery writing.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Avoids State Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Lawmakers in the Live Free or Die State  
have come up with a school funding plan that will allow New 
Hampshire to avoid imposing a dreaded state income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of issues we still need to resolve, but today  
we're going to celebrate,'' Gov. Jeanne Shaheen said Thursday after 
signing the $825 million plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ends a long saga that tested the tax-hating reputation  
of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers were forced to come up with the plan after the state  
Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that financing for public schools was 
unconstitutional because it relied on local property taxes, which 
varied widely. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal reached Thursday relies primarily on a new statewide  
property tax. It also increases business, cigarette and property 
sales taxes and contains a new tax on car rentals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a watered-down, hodgepodge of competing political  
interests. It may solve the short-term, immediate concerns, but it 
doesn't solve the problem,'' said Tom Connair, chairman of the 
five-town coalition that brought the original lawsuit against the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, about three dozen towns would pay higher school  
property taxes, sending some of the money to the state for 
redistribution. But the plan softens the blow by phasing it in over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal allows New Hampshire to maintain, for now, its status  
as one of only two states with no general income or sales tax. 
Alaska is the other. Eight other states have no state income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said it couldn't be done and we did it. We resolved the  
education funding crisis without an income tax,'' said House 
Speaker Donna Sytek, a longtime income tax opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been elected governor of New Hampshire for three  
decades without taking ``The Pledge'' to veto any broad-based tax.

<HEADLINE> Fans Protest Yankees-Royals Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- About 3,000 fans walked out of Kauffman  
Stadium during the Kansas City Royals' 13-6 win over the New York 
Yankees on Friday night to protest baseball economics that pitted 
one of the richest teams against one of the poorest. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans, wearing shirts that read ``$hare the Wealth'' had  
gathered hours before the game to drink beer and line up for 
general admission tickets as the sponsoring radio station broadcast 
a call-in show live from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans filled the left field bleachers, turning their backs 	
when the Yankees were at bat. They chanted ``Share the wealth'' and 
``Let's go Royals'' before leaving when New York's Derek Jeter 
grounded into a forceout for the first out of the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
       One fan waved a sign that read ``George Steinbrenner  Death of 	
Baseball.''  
</P>
<P>
	It took nearly 15 minutes for the protesters to empty the left  
field seats. Some other fans not taking part filled some of the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the fans littered the left field corner with fake $100  
dollar bills as they left. 
</P>
<P>
	They went from the stadium about a half-mile to the parking lot  
of a hotel where big screen televisions were set up for them to 
watch the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That group of people think it's important to bring it to  
everyone's attention,'' Royals manager Tony Muser said. ``They are 
doing what they think is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams was a particular target  
of the fans. Williams, whose $9.5 million salary was nearly double 
the $5,465,000 paid the Royals' starting nine fielders, was booed 
as the team bus arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about the Yankees, it's about the payroll  
disparity in baseball,'' David Utz, 32, said. ``There is no way for 
us to even compete. It's not against the Yankees, it's just that 
they are the poster boys for the big money in baseball. We just 
can't compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans waved fake bills at the Yankees players in a protest  
organized by KCTE, an all-sports station. 
</P>
<P>
	The station is in a ratings war, but sports director Kevin  
Kietzman said the protest was not a programming stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every idea we have was generated by callers,'' Kietzman said.  
``The shirts, the posters with the skeletons, where we're going 
when we walk out -- fans said we need to go somewhere with big 
screen TV's. We asked the fans. The fans have never been heard from 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans left small posters with skeletons on their seats as  
they left. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Yankees players took the pregame gathering in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	``The best way for them to support the Royals is to come out and  
be at the games, and not criticize us for what we're doing,'' Jeter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The start of the four-game series with the Yankees was symbolic  
-- these two teams had a bitter rivalry in the late '70s that 
culminated in George Brett's dramatic three-run homer in Yankee 
Stadium off Goose Gossage in 1980 that put the Royals into their 
first World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals are just a poor relation now in a sport in which  
proposals for revenue sharing have gone nowhere and the luxury tax 
is of little help. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals were hopelessly outclassed last year in losing all 10  
games to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has 17 players with million-dollar salaries, while the  
Royals have six -- and they desperately want to cut costs by trading 
two of them, Kevin Appier and Jeff King. 
</P>
<P>
	It puts Kansas City, trying to get below $20 million in payroll,  
near the bottom. The Royals started the season 25th among the 30 
teams at $23.8 million, trailed only by Montreal ($17.3 million), 
Florida ($18.8 million), Minnesota ($19.1 million), Pittsburgh 
($22.2 million) and Oakland ($22.8 million). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very conservative and I believe the free market applies,''  
said Mark Kennedy, one of the fans who planned on joining the 
walkout. ``But this is not a normal business situation. There is a 
finite number of teams. If another team can't get in the market, 
then the normal rules don't apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``If George Steinbrenner wants to say he doesn't care about  
other teams, that's ignoring that nobody wants to see the same 
teams in the playoffs and the World Series all the time. Nobody 
wants to see the New Yorks, the Chicagos, the Los Angeleses, the 
Bostons playing each other all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city, an AL member since the Royals were formed in 1968 by  
Ewing Kauffman, faces the possibility of losing its franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, who works as a project manager for one of the largest  
employers in the city in Sprint Corp., said losing a baseball team 
could be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Kansas City loses the Royals, it would have a huge impact  
on the city economically and in terms of being a big league city,'' 
said Kennedy, who planned to walk out on what was a beautiful day 
for baseball in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in the free market, so this is really against my  
general principles. But this is not a normal business situation.''

<HEADLINE> Torre Delays Return To Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- With Joe Torre still too weak to return  
to the dugout, Don Zimmer remained as the New York Yankees' interim 
manager Friday night instead of going home to tend to his ailing 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who had colon cancer surgery March 18, joined the team on  
the road for the first time since the regular season began, but 
said he's still too weak to handle the stress and pressure of 
managing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you ask me again in two weeks,'' Torre said before  
the Yankees opened a four-game series against Kansas City. ``That's 
what I'm thinking about. I've never been through this so I don't 
know what the timetable is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, 58, led the Yankees to two World Series titles in three  
years, leading the team to an AL record 114 wins during the 1998 
season. Zimmer had hoped his friend would be able to return to the 
dugout Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hunger for it. But I know better right now,'' Torre said.  
``I feel good, but it's the stamina. I get tired in the evenings, 
and most of our work is in the evening. It's just that the days are 
a little too long sometimes. I'll be here through the weekend, just 
taking it as it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, has promised to stay as long as Torre needs him even  
though he underwent arthrocopic surgery eight weeks ago on his 
right knee and is using a bat as a cane. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been hurting for two months,'' Zimmer said. ``Another  
month ain't going to hurt any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees went into Friday night's game atop the AL East with  
a 14-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've kept this thing going pretty good for him when he does  
come back,'' Zimmer said. ``I didn't want him to come back too 
early, which he won't do, because I'm hurting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who's been in the major leagues for 51 years, has  
refused to say he's retiring when Torre returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not quitting and I'm not retiring. I'm going home,'' he  
said. ``There's nobody who has to feel sorry for me. The game goes 
on. Sandy Koufax quit. A .235 hitter like myself, if I go home, I 
go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said it would be unfair to the team if he returns before  
he's strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's admit it, in order to manage in this game, you've got to  
care,'' he said. ``There's a lot of passion involved. And when you 
win and when you lose there's a lot that goes into that. You 
understand how frustrating it gets. However, I can't relate to what 
Zim's going through because of the pain he's gone through the last 
two months. Since the surgery eight weeks ago, it's been torture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre and the New York players were booed as they entered  
Kauffman Stadium by fans protesting the disparity between small- 
and large-market clubs. New York began the season with an $85.05 
million payroll, tops in the majors. Kansas City started 25th among 
the 30 teams at $23.8 million.

<HEADLINE> US To Bring 7 New Cases Before WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is targeting  
countries from Argentina to South Korea in seven cases before the 
World Trade Organization in an effort to knock down barriers to 
American exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration announced Friday it was bringing two cases  
against the 15-nation European Union, two cases against South Korea 
and one case each against India, Canada and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade actions involve use of a process known as ``Super  
301,'' which President Clinton renewed two months ago under an 
executive order. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign countries have long complained about the Super 301  
process, which they view as American bullying. It allows the 
administration to bring cases against other nations without waiting 
for U.S. industries to file complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo Paemen, the EU's ambassador to the United States, said in  
an interview that the administration had not given the EU ``the 
slightest early warning'' that it would be bringing these cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration renewed the Super 301 process as part of its  
effort to respond to congressional complaints that it has done too 
little to counteract a trade deficit that hit a record $169 billion 
last year and is projected to climb even higher this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Absent from the targeted countries were the two nations with  
which the United States is suffering its biggest deficits -- Japan, 
with an imbalance of $64 billion, and China, where the deficit hit 
a record $57 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Japan and China were not targeted  
because the administration is involved in aggressive market-opening 
negotiations outside the Super 301 process. 
</P>
<P>
	When Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi visits Washington on  
Monday, the administration plans to propose measures to further 
deregulate the Japanese economy to help expand sales opportunities 
for American companies. It also is pressing Tokyo to take new steps 
to pull the nation out of a persistent recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. officials are trying to reach a broad  
market-opening package with China as part of that country's bid to 
join the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, announcing the  
seven new trade cases, said they had been selected in an effort to 
ensure that countries were abiding by commitments made in previous 
global trade negotiations before a new round of talks begins in 
Seattle this November. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move toward the launch of a new round of global trade  
negotiations ... it is critical that our trading partners fully 
implement their Uruguay Round commitments,'' Barshefsky said, 
referring to the last round of talks, launched in Uruguay in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States made these allegations in the cases it will  
bring before the Geneva-based WTO: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A case against the 15-nation European Union that contends  
Europe is unfairly subsidizing Airbus Industrie, the world's No. 2 
maker of airliners and chief rival to Seattle-based Boeing, through 
government support of a new flight management system designed for 
Airbus planes. U.S. officials said this could the first of a number 
of cases brought against the EU on the subsidy issue. 
</P>
<P>
	--A second case against the EU alleging unfair treatment for  
American cheese and wine products because of European copyright and 
trademark practices that violate WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	--A charge that India is imposing unfair requirements on American  
automakers seeking to set up operations there. 
</P>
<P>
	--A case charging South Korea with unfairly restricting the  
ability of American construction companies to bid on airport work. 
</P>
<P>
	--A charge that South Korea imposes unfair import restrictions  
against American beef. 
</P>
<P>
	--A contention that Canada is unfairly restricting the time  
American products can receive patent protection, limiting it to 17 
years instead of the 20 under WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	--A case charging Argentina with failing to provide proper patent  
protection for U.S. pharmaceutical products.

<HEADLINE> Angelos Is Force Behind Cuba-Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Peter Angelos already knew plenty about Cuba  
when he sat down to dinner with two men who wanted the Baltimore 
Orioles to play the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, eager to ease the tension between the communist country  
and the United States, immediately embraced the ambitious plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter expressed sympathy for Fidel Castro. He said, `For  
crying out loud, Kennedy tried to invade the island and tried to 
kill him,''' Saul Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Landau, who has produced four documentaries on Castro, and Scott  
Armstrong, an author and journalist who had visited Cuba over the 
years, made the unusual presentation to the Orioles' owner in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, the Orioles became the first major league  
team to play in Havana since 1959. On March 28, Baltimore beat a 
collection of Cuban all-stars 3-2 in an 11-inning exhibition game. 
The return match is Monday night at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong first pitched the idea of a baseball game between  
Cuban stars and the Orioles to former team owner Edward Benne 
Williams in the early 1980s. He also discussed the concept with 
then-baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti and union head Donald 
Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Angelos who followed through.  
</P>
<P>
	``Peter Angelos was the only guy to stand at the plate to take a  
swing at this,'' Armstrong said. ``Edward Bennett Williams laughed 
at me because he had a position on Ronald Reagan's advisory board, 
and that administration would have nothing to do with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giamatti had a vision -- he was definitely interested -- but he  
died before we could act on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994 players' strike and hoped to  
stage a game between the Cubans and a collection of major league 
stars. But the plan ended after baseball was denied an antitrust 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, however, was relentless.  
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that he would go through the expense, the red tape  
and the inconvenience was never a question,'' Armstrong said. ``He 
just thought it was a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebuffed in his first bid in 1996, Angelos didn't quit. Staying  
in touch with the State Department and the White House, he got a 
break in January when President Clinton loosened restrictions 
against Cuba. Even then, it took several weeks of negotiations and 
an all-night session in March to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter was the dominant party in the room,'' Armstrong said.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the series suggest that Angelos was looking for  
publicity or angling to give the Orioles an advantage tapping into 
Cuban talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos refused several interview requests by The Associated  
Press. Both his sons, however, insisted that the owner's motivation 
was not self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always had an interest in politics, especially foreign  
policy. That, and his involvement with baseball, made it a natural 
thing,'' said Orioles executive vice president John Angelos. ``It's 
always been a nonpolitical issue with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The connection was baseball, America's national pastime and a  
way of life for the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt that something could be achieved by the people getting  
together and playing a baseball game,'' said Louis Angelos, who 
works in his father's law offices. ``He said, `Why not just go and 
play? Nothing bad can come from it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban dissidents don't see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
	Groups of anti-Castro protesters from Miami and the New York-New  
Jersey metropolitan area plan to travel to Baltimore by bus to 
protest outside the stadium Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Basulto, president of Brothers to the Rescue, a Miami-based  
Cuban democracy group, said the games will only serve to provide 
revenue and positive public relations for the Castro government 
that has caused Cuba's people to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are prolonging that suffering by engaging in this,''  
Basulto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations  
in the commissioner's office, worked side by side with Peter 
Angelos in the negotiations and saw no indication of a hidden 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``His interests were selfless. He was not looking for a  
competitive advantage for the Orioles,'' Alderson said. ``I think 
he was driven by a strong feeling that baseball was the key to the 
cultures of two countries that have been separated a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of Angelos' effort, other major leagues teams might  
one day travel to Havana to play. The Anaheim Angels have already 
filled out the necessary papers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Baltimore Orioles will always be known as the ones who  
started it. 
</P>
<P>
	 *End Adv for May 1-2

<HEADLINE> Grand Prix Meet Set for Edwardsville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States will have a second Grand Prix  
track and field meet this year, with the U.S. Open scheduled for 
May 22 at Edwardsville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Foster, athlete representative for Elite International  
Sports Marketing in St. Louis and a three-time world champion in 
the 110-meter hurdles, said Friday that U.S. Track &AMP; Field had 
replaced Elite as the meet organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elite organized the event last year when it was called the U.S.  
Open, A Farewell to JJK -- a tribute to the retiring Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee, a six-time Olympic medalist and world record-holder 
in the heptathlon. This year's meet originally was to be called the 
JJK World Track and Field Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're backing out because of sponsorship,'' Foster said.  
</P>
<P>
	He added that USATF wanted to keep the meet to retain its Grand  
Prix status. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. Grand Prix meet is the Prefontaine Classic at  
Eugene, Ore. May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open, to be held from 4 p.m. EDT to 7 p.m. EDT, will be  
televised by ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be 12 events -- the 200 meters, 110 hurdles, 1,500,  
pole vault, long jump and discus for men, and the 200, 800, 1,500, 
400 hurdles, high jump and shot put for women.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Youth Violence Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration is pushing for dialogue on  
school violence, ranging from President Clinton's invitation to the 
nation's leaders for a White House strategy session to a top 
education official's plea for students to talk to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the rush to use pagers, cell phones, fax machines and the  
Internet, let's listen to what we are really trying to tell each 
other,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley, who met Friday 
with dozens of parents, students and teachers at Walt Whitman High 
School in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton touted a grassroots approach to the school violence  
problem in his Friday announcement of the May 10 strategy session. 
Pressed by some members of Congress after the Colorado school 
shooting to summon Hollywood executives to the White House, Clinton 
said he was inviting a broad cross-section of leaders -- from 
government, the clergy, the entertainment and Internet industries, 
in addition to those who ``produce explosives and weapons, and 
those who use them lawfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's bury the hatchet and build a future for our children  
together,'' said Clinton, who asked the nation to ``unite in 
action'' against school violence, just like earlier campaigns 
against drunken driving and promoting seatbelts. He offered the gun 
lobby a seat at the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked later if that included the National Rifle Association,  
which has bitterly fought Clinton on gun-control legislation, White 
House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed hedged and said the 
invitation list had not been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., announced earlier in the week a ``National 
Conference on Youth and Culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton emphasized that no single factor -- neither the violence  
on the Internet and in children's entertainment, nor the 
availability of firearms -- is to blame for last week's shootings at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have united in grief, now we should unite in action.''  
</P>
<P>
	Last October, after shooting broke out at other schools, Clinton  
convened a White House conference on school safety with about 800 
educators and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the president announced initiatives to hire 2,000  
police and school security officers in high-risk areas, revamp the 
Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program, and a federal response team to 
deal with outbreaks of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Wiethorn, 18, a senior at Walt Whitman, asked Riley about  
addressing the hatred and prejudice she believes leads to school 
violence: ``The government doesn't do enough about that. There's so 
much they don't say about hate, especially to young kids.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Media Violence Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says many factors could be  
contributing to the recent rash of school shootings and he won't 
limit any White House youth violence summit to the influence of the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``What should we do about guns? What should we do about culture?  
What should we do about the schools? How can we help the parents? 
And, what is government's responsibility? Those are the big 
questions. We should ask and answer all of them -- not just one,'' 
Clinton said in an interview for broadcast today on NBC's ``Today'' 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress asked Clinton earlier this week to convene  
an emergency summit of entertainment industry executives to address 
the kind of youth rage that erupted at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in the NBC interview if he would call such a summit,  
Clinton said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to bring some high-level folks from the entertainment  
industry and from other sectors of our society that I think can be 
active here together at the White House in the near future and then 
figure out how we can put together the elements of a national 
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the entertainment industry must have ``a big part'' of any  
solution to youth violence, Clinton said, he indicated he believes 
that the National Rifle Association also has a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a mistake for the people who don't want to offend  
the NRA to blame Hollywood and the people that don't want to offend 
Hollywood to blame the NRA,'' Clinton said.
