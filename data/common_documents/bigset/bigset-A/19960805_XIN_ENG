<HEADLINE> Scientists Conduct New Research into Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- British scientists are urgently
conducting fresh research into the safety of cow's milk amid
allegations that previous experiments held to show milk cannot be
infected with BSE are unreliable and inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
New tests, in which calves are being fed with milk from
BSE-infected cows, are under way at the Ministry of Agriculture's
laboratory, according to the Observer report today.
</P>
<P>
The experiment, the fifth into SBE and milk carried out by the
scientists since 1990, is intended to show whether calves are at
any greater risk of contracting BSE after prolonged feeding with
milk from their mothers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier experiments, on which the Ministry bases its claim
that milk is safe to drink, have been attacked as "worthless".
</P>
<P>
The Ministry says that there is no evidence BSE can be passed
on through milk and that the infective agent has not been found
even in milk from cows known to have the disease.
</P>
<P>
However, its assurances have been dismissed by some leading
scientists who say that the experiments were poor and
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said the new research had been going on for many
months. "Depending upon the outcome, further research may be
necessary, but if the findings are negative we believe that it
would give a further assurance over the safety of milk. We remain
of the view that milk is completely safe."

<HEADLINE> Asia Emerges Mighty Giant in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- With the title-winning rank
unprecedently expanded, the long-time European domains being
encroached upon, Asia, the world's most populous continent has
emerged as a mighty giant in world sports.
</P>
<P>
Nine Asian countries and regions stroke gold in Atlanta, four
more than at the Barcelona Games, six more than in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Over half a century leading to the Los Angeles Olympics, Asia
had ramained a sports dwarf, totalling just 110 golds since Japan
and India produced Asia's first gold medalists in the 1928
Helsinki Games.
</P>
<P>
Asia, with the fastest growing economy in the world, has beefed
up its sports with big money and high technologies, and it has all
paid off.
</P>
<P>
In the recent four Olympics, Asia has garnered 124 gold medals,
more than the total it had registered in the previous 14 Games.
</P>
<P>
Born agile and flexible, the Asians swept all four golds in
table tennis, three in diving, four in badminton and six in judo
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Among the Asian haul of 34 gold, -- silver and -- bronze medals#,
these three in athletics weigh heaviest -- Chinese Wang Junxia's
5,000 gold plus her 10,000 silver and Syrian Ghada Shouaa's
history-making gold at heptathlon.
</P>
<P>
Wang, hailed as "Oriental Mystery Deer", beat the runner-up by
more than 40 meters in the 5,000 meters final to lift the Asian
women's first Olympic distance running gold.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chinese, the only runner entered for both the
5,000 and 10,000 meters here, picked up the silver in the longer
distance of 10,000 meters race, Asia's first ever medal for the
event.
</P>
<P>
Shouaa broke the American and European domination of the
heptathlon, winning the first-ever Olympic gold for Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria wasn't the only Asian country or region to end its Olympic
gold drought in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong got the first taste of Olympic gold medal since it
made the first appearance in the 1952 Olympics, as Lee Lai Shan
triumped at the women's boards sailing.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, making an Olympic debut as an independent nation,
landed two golds here -- one from Aleksandr Parygin in modren
pentathlon and the other from Yuriy Melnichenko at Greco-Roman
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
China, South Korea and Japan remained vanguards for Asia,
taking 16, eight and three golds respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese kept their dominance in table tennis and diving and
shone in shooting and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
World top women's table tennis player Deng Yaping, whose
aggressive game held all opponents in awe, repeated her
singles-doubles glory to become the only woman to successfully
defend two titles in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mingxia, who became the youngest Olympic champion at age of 14
in Barcelona, hit a gold double in the women's platform and
springboard diving events.
</P>
<P>
South Korea underlined its prowess in archery, badminton and
judo by winning two golds from each event.
</P>
<P>
Archer Kim Kyung-Wook turned out a heroine for South Korea. She
scored six 10s en route to winning the highly-pressured 12-arrow
women's final and then anchored the South Korean side to the top
podium of the team event.
</P>
<P>
Japan, dethroned by China as Asia's No. 1 sports power in the 1984
Los Angeles Games, showed its depth in judo with three gold
medals t their credit in the Atlanta Games.

<HEADLINE> Aidid's Son Succeeds Late Somali General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Leadership Council of the
late Somali General Mohammed Farrah Aidid today elected his son
Hussein Mohamed Aidid as "president".
</P>
<P>
According to South Mogadishu Radio which supports the late
Aidid, the council and the cabinet unanimously elected Hussein
Mohamed Aidid as the "President of Somalia" under the
transitional charters article 16 paragraph 4.
</P>
<P>
The nomination followed a series of meetings by the two
administrational bodies of the late Aidid's government at the
request of the United Somali Congress of Somali National Alliance
(USC/SNA).
</P>
<P>
The radio declared that the new president will have all powers
according to the charter as the chairman of the Leadership
Council and of the Ministerial Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The radio did not say when and where the new president will be
sworn in, nor was the voice of Hussein Mohamed Aidid heard
on the radio.
</P>
<P>
But there has been wide speculation that he may give his first
speech tonight.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe Hussein will be working under the
guidance of his late father's political advisors. This may make
him "a paper tiger".
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Ali Mahdi Mohamed have described the move as an
unfortunate act. "We thought the death of General Aidid will
bring about peace in Somalia, but the nomination of his son is
now further complicating any possible solution of Somalia's long
standing political crises," said Mudey Ahmed Adde, a Somali
political analyst.

<HEADLINE> Sports Minnows Bang Upon Centennial Olympic Doors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Since the gates to the Centennial
Olympic Games swung open for all 197 IOC members here two weeks
ago, minnows in sports have been making history with their
national anthems echoing over this southeastern American city.
</P>
<P>
Greece, cradle of the modern Olympics, ended its 100-year
Olympic medal drought in gymnastics when Ioannis Melissanidis
stepped onto the victory podium as the winner of the men's floor
routine.
</P>
<P>
Despite complaints about biased scoring by judges, Melissanidis
has gone down in history as the first Greek gymnast to be crowned
since the first modern games in 1896 when Ioannis Mitropoulos won
the rings on home soil.
</P>
<P>
Ghada Shouaa augured a new sport era for Syria as she became
the first Olympic champion in her country. She received a personal
telegram of greetings from the Syrian president after her victory
in the women's heptathlon on July 29.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 24, Shouaa, a former cager, came out from nowhere
to beat a star-studded field, putting herself into the spotlight
as the most outstanding female athlete in track and field both in
the world championships and in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Fatuma Roba, a policewoman from Ethiopia, is the first
African to win the Olympic women's marathon, an event adopted at
the Olympics in 1984.
</P>
<P>
She cruised to her victory with the largest margin of two
minutes in the Olympic marathon history.
</P>
<P>
From the Centennial Games, the Ecuadoreans back home danced in
the streets after Jefferson Perez won the men's 20-kilometer walk.
No Ecuadorean athlete had won any Olympic medal, let alone the
coveted gold.
</P>
<P>
President Sixto Duran-Ballen declared Perez a "national hero"
and a commemorative stamp bearing Perez's image is reported to be
issued soon.
</P>
<P>
The first ever gold medal was also won by Claudia Poll for
Costa Rica in the women's 200-meter freestyle, who beat
top-favored German Franziska van Almsick to second place, and by
Venuste Niyongabo for Burundi in the men's 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong, windsurfer Lee Lai Shan became the first Olympic
champion in 44 years when she clinched the gold medal in the
women's Mistral class sailing on July 28.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also strode into the gold tally for the first time
when their men shuttlers Rexy Mainaky and Ricky Subagja triumphed
in the men's badminton doubles.
</P>
<P>
Bahamas, Moldova and Mozambique also had their colors hoisted
for the first time in the Olympic competition venues, a
justification that any athlete, regardless of race, sex or age,
could achieve his or her best under the Olympic motto of being
faster, higher and stronger.
</P>
<P>
Other minor sports nations who have won either silver or bronze
medals at the current Games include Namibia, Trinidad and Tobago,
Puerto Rico, Mongolia, Uganda, India, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand, Israel and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
As an individual, Irish woman swimmer Michelle Smith became the
talk of the Games after she emerged as the sole Olympian with
three gold medals from individual events -- the 100- and 200-meter
individual medlays and the 400-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
While suspicions fanned by the envious hosts about her drug
taking were making the round, the Irish swimmer dismissed them
with an open mind and went home the victor as all her urine tests
were cleared by the Medical Commission of the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
With the Games curtains to close in a few hours, sports fans
and authorities remain confident that more minnows will make their
mark on the Olympic boulevard sooner or later.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Could Destroy Remaining Tropical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of Earth's
remaining 2 billion hectares of tropical forests could be lost to
agriculture, says a new report by the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of tropical forest loss is not diminishing,
despite rising global awareness and efforts, the report says.
Some 29 hectares of tropical forest are lost every minute, or 15.4
million ha per year.
</P>
<P>
"There is no magic bullet to saving the world's tropical
forests," says Ismail Serageldin, the CGIAR chairman and World
Bank Vice President, "What is needed is a comprehensive effort to
attack the root causes of deforestation -- poverty, rising
population, bad natural resource management and distorted forest
policy."
</P>
<P>
The report says the main threat to tropical forests comes from
poor farmers who have no other option to feeding their families
other than slashing and burning a patch of forest and growing food
crops. Slash-and-burn agriculture results in the loss of 10
million ha of land per year.
</P>
<P>
According to data from CGIAR research institutes, some 350
million people in tropical countries are forest dwellers who
derive half or more of their income from the forest. Forest
provide directly 10 percent of the employment in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
CGIAR is the would's largest international consortium for
agricultural research and is jointly sponsored by the World Bank,
the United Nations Development Programme, the Food and Agriculture
organization and the United Nations Environment Programme.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Arrests Two Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's security authorities have
arrested two extremists in the latest crackdown on suspected
Moslem fundamentalist militants.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the Interior Ministry was quoted by the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency as saying today that the two
extremists, identified as Ahmed Mahmoud Mohamed al Khouly, 31, and
Hani Mohamed Mansour, 19, belong to the military wing of Al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya (the Islamic Group), Egypt's largest Moslem militant
group.
</P>
<P>
The group has been blamed for much of the violence against the
government since 1992, when Moslem militants launched a violent
campaign in an attempt to overthrow the secular government and
replace it with strict Islamic rule in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It claimed responsibility for a bloody attack in Cairo on April
18, in which 18 Greek tourists were killed.
</P>
<P>
The security authorities have fiercely cracked down on
militants and succeeded in containing their activities. Recently
there have been only sporadic attacks by Moslem militants in
villages in southern Egypt, mainly on policemen and Christians.

ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Croatia defeated Sweden 27-26 in
a thrilling match between two European powerhouses in the gold
medal game of the men's handball tournament here today.
</P>
<P>
The victory brought the Croatians their first gold medal at the
26th Olympic Games, which close this evening.

The Swedish opened the score, but missed several following
shots, including a penalty shot. The Croatians scored six
consecutive goals to lead the Swedish 7-6 with 20 minutes into the

The Swedish made a surge, but were only able to cut their
deficit to four goals. At the end of the first half, the Croatians
scored another goal, finishing with 16-11.

In the second half, the Croatians expanded their lead to 20-13

Croatians were within their striking distance.

In a tense atmosphere, the two teams traded goals. The
Croatians scored a goal to lead with 27-25 with 26 seconds left in

<HEADLINE> PNA Official Condemns Hamas Leaders Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) official today sharply condemned leaders of
Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, accusing them of creating
tensions in the Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Amin Al-Hindi, head of the Palestinian
general intelligence service, as saying that Hamas leadership
abroad had sent instructions to the organization's activists to
oppose the PNA rule.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hindi said that he had intercepted messages from abroad,
which instruct people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to stage
riots and take actions against the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hindi's remarks came after Friday's violent confrontation in
the West Bank town of Tulkarm between Palestinian police and Hamas
demonstrators, who demanded the release of Hamas prisoners.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed and 15 others injured during the riot when
Palestinian police guarding the Tulkarm jail clashed with
stone-throwing protesters who stormed the prison for a short
period of time.
</P>
<P>
Hamas said Ibrahim Hadayeh was killed by the Palestinian
police during a "peaceful" demonstration, while Palestinian Radio
shifted responsibility for Hadayeh's death, saying he was shot
dead by armed Hamas activists.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in the Palestinian streets was very tense after
the death Wednesday night of Mahmoud Jumayal, a Fatah activist,
who was tortured to death in a Palestinian jail.
</P>
<P>
Hamas issued a statement Saturday, calling PNA President
Yasser Arafat "a collaborator," and called for an "intifada"
(uprising) against the PNA and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to ease the tensions in the West Bank,
Palestinian police, under the order of Arafat, today released 15
Hamas detainees in Tulkarm, who did not flee from the prison
during the riot Friday.
</P>
<P>
Another four prisoners were also freed on health reasons, as
well as several others who are relatives of Hadayeh, while 50
detainees who tried to escape Friday were caught and sent back to
their cells in the prison.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian police arrested another 200 people
involved in Friday's disturbance, the first of its kind since the
Palestinian self-rule started three years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli army commanders in the West
Bank have been ordered to beef up their troops, but not to
interfere in the troubles among the Palestinians, according to the
Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops were also instructed to help the Palestinian
police to treat the wounded people, but to let the Palestinian
police themselves deal with any violent demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The army had already declared Nablus and Tulkarm as closed
military zones immediately after the violence broke out, barring
Israelis from entering the two West Bank towns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residents in Tulkarm said that the Palestinian
police imposed a curfew on the town briefly Friday, the first time
the PNA has ever done on a Palestinian town.
</P>
<P>
Israel had handed over Nablus and Tulkarm, as well as Jenin,
Kalkilya, Ramallah and Bethlehem in the West Bank to the PNA by
the end of last year, in accordance with the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli security source told Israel Radio that Israel
was willing to see stability in the Palestinian autonomous areas
and the continuation of the rule of PNA President Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Asia Emerges Mighty Giant in Olympics (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- With the title-winning rank
unprecedently expanded, the long-time European domains being
encroached upon, Asia, the world's most populous continent has
emerged as a mighty giant in world sports.
</P>
<P>
Ten Asian countries and regions struck gold in Atlanta, five
more than at the Barcelona Games and seven more than in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Over half a century leading to the Los Angeles Olympics, Asia
had remained a sports dwarf, totalling just 110 golds since Japan
and India produced Asia's first gold medalists in the Helsinki
Games in 1928.
</P>
<P>
Asia, with the fastest growing economy in the world, has beefed
up its sports with big money and high technologies, and it has all
paid off.
</P>
<P>
In the four recent Olympics, Asia has garnered 125 gold medals,
more than the total it had registered in the previous 14 Games.
</P>
<P>
Born agile and flexible, the Asians swept all the four golds in
table tennis, three in diving, four in badminton and six in judo
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Among the Asian haul of 35 gold, 49 silver and 33 bronze medals#,
these three in athletics weighed heaviest -- Chinese Wang Junxia's
5,000 gold plus her 10,000 silver and Syrian Ghada Shouaa's
history-making gold at heptathlon.
</P>
<P>
Wang, hailed as "Oriental Mystery Deer", beat the runner-up by
more than 40 meters in the 5,000 meters final to lift the Asian
women's first Olympic distance running gold.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chinese, the only runner entered for both the
5,000 and 10,000 meters here, picked up the silver in the longer
distance of 10,000 meters race, Asia's first ever medal for the
event.
</P>
<P>
Shouaa broke the American and European domination of the
heptathlon, winning the first-ever Olympic gold for Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria wasn't the only Asian country or region to end its Olympic
gold drought in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong got the first taste of Olympic gold medal since it
made the first appearance in the 1952 Olympics, as Lee Lai Shan
triumped at the women's boards sailing.
</P>
<P>
Thailand opened the medal account through its boxer Somluck
Kamsing, who won the 57 kilograms category on the final day of
the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, making an Olympic debut as an independent nation,
landed two golds here -- one from Aleksandr Parygin in modren
pentathlon and the other from Yuriy Melnichenko at Greco-Roman
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
China, South Korea and Japan remained vanguards for Asia,
taking 16, eight and three golds respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese kept their dominance in table tennis and diving and
shone in shooting and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked women's table tennis player Deng Yaping,
whose aggressive game held all opponents in awe, repeated her
singles-doubles glory to become the only woman to successfully
defend two titles in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mingxia, who became the youngest Olympic champion at age of 14
in Barcelona, hit a gold double in the women's platform and
springboard diving events.
</P>
<P>
South Korea underlined its prowess in archery, badminton and
judo by winning two golds from each event.
</P>
<P>
Archer Kim Kyung-Wook turned out a heroine for South Korea. She
scored six 10s en route to winning the highly-pressured 12-arrow
women's final and then anchored the South Korean side to the top
podium of the team event.
</P>
<P>
Japan, dethroned by China as Asia's No. 1 sports power in the 1984
Los Angeles Games, showed its depth in judo with three gold
medals t their credit in the Atlanta Games.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions Against Iran, Libya to Harm Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
expected to sign Monday a congressional act aimed at toughening
sanctions against Iran and Libya, two countries accused by
Washington of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The act, often called d'Amato Act in reference to its main
advocate Republican Senator Alfonso d'Amato, authorizes U.S. to
punish any foreign oil company that invests more than 40 million
U.S. dollars in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This act, passed in the name of fighting terrorism, will
inevitably worsen the tension between Washington and its European
allies, who have great investments in oil industry of the two
Middle East countries with 20 percent of their oil consumptions
coming from them.
</P>
<P>
When Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act authorizing
extra-territorial sanctions against foreign businesses having
commercial ties with Cuba, he met strong opposition from European
countries and was forced to suspend some of the articles of the
law on sueing foreign companies buying or selling Cuban assets
that used to belong to U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
This time, the d'Amato Act authorizes the same function of
extraterritoriality extending a U.S. law to international trade,
which will no doubt arouse strong protest and even lead to
reprisals by European countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-European split over the issue was shown at the Group
of Seven most industrialized nations ministerial conference on
terrorism held last week in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The final declaration of the conference and the 25 measures it
adopted to combat terrorism did not mention international
sanctions against Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan, the four countries
finger-pointed by Washington for supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The French government has made it clear that it will not
support any action mixing the fight against terrorism with
international trade, and has indicated that it will maintain a
dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States intensified its campaign against
Iran in the past week, hinting that it was behind the bomb attack
on an American base in Dahran, Saudi Arabia in late June.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) said that Teheran is more and more
in the "collimator" of Washington, but added that the Europeans
know that this new act is closely linked with the present
presidential election in the U.S., with Clinton and Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole contesting each other over the
issue of fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said at the beginning of the year that he was totally
opposed to extraterritorial measures in imposing sanctions.
However, the attack on U.S. base in Saudi Arabia and the
mysterious explosion of the TWA Boeing 747 on July 17 above New
York have changed the political context, said AFP.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls on Arabs to Normalize Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today called on Arab leaders to realize
normalization of relations with Israel, saying peace with what he
termed as "undemocratic countries" only started with their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks when talking at an Israeli Bonds
meeting today about the country's relations with its Arab
neighbors, including Egypt, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the prime minister as claiming that he did
not expect the "democratization" of the Middle East in the
foreseeable future, "therefore the security aspect has to be
insisted upon."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he demanded the Arab leaders make a "conscious
decision" to normalize ties with Israel, saying peace "must come
from atop."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of seeking both peace and
normalization, praising Jordan's "clear commitment" in this
aspect. Netanyahu will go to Jordan Monday on his first official
visit to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel and Egypt have yet to further normalize their
relations, Netanyahu said, he was confident about the future as he
received a clear commitment from President Hosni Mubarak when he
visited Cairo two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, but
the pace of normalization of relations has been relatively slow
due to differences over the peace process and other bilateral
issues.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli-Palestinian ties, Netanyahu said he intended to do
the same. However, he pledged to insist on the security issue in
dealing with the Palestinians to prevent the repetition of
"terrorist attacks."
</P>
<P>
He urged PNA leader Yasser Arafat to explain to the
Palestinian people that "the idea of war with Israel is over,"
and that Israel and Palestinians should make peace.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli-Syrian peace talks, Netanyahu said Israel must
insist on both peace and security. He added that despite all the
differences, the two sides could hold negotiations on all
concerns without imposing views on each other.
</P>
<P>
Finally, he expressed the hope that "peace with security"
would be reached, and that "normalization would be down the
line."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Arab peace process has been fully stalled since
the May 29 Israeli elections, despite repeated calls from Arab
countries for immediate resumption of the process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, the hardline Likud leader, has adopted a tougher
line toward the peace process by rejecting the land-for-peace
principle. He also erected three so-called pillars in future
peace process: security, reciprocity and democratization of Arab
countries.

<HEADLINE> AL Condemns Israel's Decision to Lift Ban on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League today condemned the
Israeli government's decision to lift a ban on expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member league said in a statement that the decision is a
big obstacle to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet voted unanimously Friday to lift the
building restrictions on construction of the Jewish settlements in
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions were imposed by Israel's late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin four years ago to pave the way for peace
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The recent decision proves the Israeli government's intention
to Judaize and seize Palestinian lands, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Arab League called on countries concerned with
the Mideast peace process, particularly the United States, Russia
and members of the European Union, to adopt a serious stance in
the face of Israel's policies that run counter to international
principles.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia are the co-sponsors of the peace
process. The Arabs are seeking a more active European role in
pushing forward the Arab-Israeli peace drive.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns World of US Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
warned the international community of the latest U.S. military
threats to Iran.
</P>
<P>
This came when Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
submitted a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
via Iran's permanent representative to the U.N. Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister cautioned against what he called
"threatening behavior by the American government" toward Iran,
according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Velayati urged the U.N. chief to take all necessary measures
to prevent the dangerous consequences caused by the
U.S. irresponsible acts for the world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, he conveyed the deep concern of the Iranian
government about the continued hostile remarks of officials of
the United States and it's policies vis-a-vis the Islamic
Republic in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the "alarming and threatening" dimensions of the
statements made by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, he
called the statements as blatant examples of political
manipulation of public opinion already apprehensive about the
recent tragic events.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said in an interview with
National Public Radio Friday that Iran was "possibly" behind the
June 25 bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen at Dhahran in
eastern Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
However, Velayati dismissed the allegations as an affront to
the sovereignty of his country.
</P>
<P>
Perry's warning that those responsible would have to pay a
heavy price was widely interpreted in the U.S. media as an
indiction that the United States could launch a military strike
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He termed U.S. threats of use of force against Iran as an
"arrogant and callous disregard" for the most basic principle of
the rules of international law and the charter of the United
Nations and a clear example of "state terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized Iran believes that the U.S. government may be
seeking an excuse to embark on adventurism against and
confrontation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reminded the U.N. secretary-general that
prevention of such potentially dangerous consequences is the
primary responsibility of the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Curb Labor Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 4 (Xinhua)-- Kuwait will implement new
measures in curbing manpower traffic as well as protecting
expatriate laborers' rights in the country, which attracts most of
its manpower from other countries.
</P>
<P>
A decision issued Saturday by Kuwaiti Social Affairs and Labor
Minister Ahmad Al-Klaib indicated that the Kuwaiti authorities
would allow the establishment of private labor agencies for the
recruitment of foreign manpower from outside and inside Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A set of regulations for organizing the functioning of the
recruitment agencies will come into effect after two months.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, the agencies will act as mediators
between laborers and employers in accordance with official
binding contracts.
</P>
<P>
The agencies and employers should sign contracts which should
include the number of employees wanted, their qualifications and
experience.
</P>
<P>
The amount of charges to be paid by the employers, wages of
laborers and the period during which the agencies will provide
the required employees would also be specified.
</P>
<P>
The decision said that agencies are totally banned from taking
any direct or indirect charges from laborers and those found to
be charging laborers for either recruitment or maintaining their
jobs will risk closure and withdrawal of commercial license.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 1.2 million foreign nationals in Kuwait, most
of them laborers from about 130 countries, accounting for 83
percent of the Kuwaiti labor market, according to statistics by
the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, labor traffic has been rampant in the country
and labor Mafia brought foreign laborers into the country
charging hundreds, even 1,000 Kuwait dinars (3,300 U.S. dollars)
per head just for a visa.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, Those who open a recruitment
agency must submit a bank guarantee worth 30,000 Kuwait dinars
(99,000 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier on Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti said here today that Jordan's national economic and
social reform has produced real growth in the gross national
product (GNP) by nearly 7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said in his address to a session of the Lower House of
Parliament that the reform, which started in 1989 with the help of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), also reduced the budget
deficit to 4 percent in the GNP compared with 24 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
He said the success of the reform has also helped Jordan
rebuild its foreign currency reserve and maintain the stability of
the exchange rate of dinar.
</P>
<P>
It has also reduced the inflation rate to 4 percent this year
from 26 percent in 1989, and the foreign debt to less than 100
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) from 200 percent in
1989.
</P>
<P>
The House session today was devoted to discussion of
reallocation of wheat subsidies so that only the citizens who
deserve the subsidies would be entitled to it.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said ever since the government adopted
national restructuring program, it has been eager to maintain the
stability in the general level of prices so as to maintain the
standard of living at acceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
The government, said Kabariti, has done so by subsidizing
basic commodities despite the fact that the prices on world market
have risen.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the rise in the international prices and the
accompanying increases in quantities consumed have in turn
produced the increase in the amount of subsidy, which reached some
180 million dinars (252 million U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the amount of subsidy allocated in the general
budget this year totaled 38 million dinars (53.2 million dollars)
only.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said the government decided to change the form of
subsidy "from indirect to direct" cash subsidy to ensure that
those who deserve the subsidy are benefiting from it.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has failed so far to convince the
public that the "rechanneling" rather than "lifting" of the
bread subsidies will not further reduce their standard of living.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, interests groups and various
professional unions strongly oppose the government's plan of
lifting the subsidies on wheat while compensating the citizens
with 15 dinars (21 dollars) per capita a year.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one lawmakers out of the 80-member of the Lower House
even threatened to seek a no-confidence vote in the government if
the government goes ahead with the plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is expected to carry out the plan in
the face of the strong protests.
</P>
<P>
"I am exercising my powers as prime minister under the
Constitution and the parliament has the right to exercise its
rights by voting confidence in the government if the deputies are
not convinced by the government's views," said Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
The government had planned to announce the decision last
Wednesday but postponed until after today's session of the Lower
House in a bid to avoid direct confrontation with the deputies.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to announce the decision in a few
days.

<HEADLINE> Serb Leader Promises to Do Utmost for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian Serb leader said today
the Serb authorities were doing their utmost to ensure that the
first post-war elections would be held as planned and most
people, especially refugees, would be included in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The Serb parliament speaker Momclo Krajisnik made the remarks
in a statement to the local radio station in the central Serbian
town of Kragujevac.
</P>
<P>
He complained that Muslims and Serbs were not in the same
position because the vote would be taking place in embassies of
the Muslim-Croat federation in those countries that have sheltered
Bosnian refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of this, everything has been done for elections to
take place, primarily because the Dayton accords envisage that
sanctions against Yugoslavia will be lifted 10 days after the
elections take place," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million Bosnian people have become refugees and
displaced persons. All the refugees above 18 years of age have
rights to cast ballots during the elections. They can vote in the
current country they are staying now or they can go back to Bosnia
to vote.
</P>
<P>
"We do not fear the elections because our people have opted to
preserve Republika Srpska. The only thing with which the
international community is blackmailing us is the issue of Brcko,
where elections are trying to be postponed in a way, although
there is no justification for this, nor can we agree to it,"
Krajisnik said.
</P>
<P>
Both Serbs and Muslims claim sovereignty over Brcko, a
controversial town in northeastern Bosnia. Under the Dayton
accords, only a special arbitration commission will determine the
line of separation in the wider area of this town located on the
bottleneck of the corridor linking eastern and western parts of
Republika Srpska.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, China Sign Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and China signed a protocol
on economic and trade cooperation, which provides for expansion of
cooperation in the economic, trade and scientific fields.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed by Shi Weisan, Director General of the
West Asia and Africa Department in the Chinese Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Ministry and Hatem Mara'i, undersecretary of
the Iraqi Ministry of Trade.
</P>
<P>
The protocol shows the desire of the Chinese enterprises to
offer foodstuffs and medicines to Iraq under the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food formula signed in May.
</P>
<P>
It also ensures the development of cooperation between the two
countries in areas such as health, transportation, communication
and agriculture as well as exchange of expertise.
</P>
<P>
It also revives the Sino-Iraqi ministerial committee for trade,
economic and scientific cooperation, which is expected to convene
its ninth session in China late this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the protocol would open new horizons for the
development of the bilateral trade relations, according to the
Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member Chinese trade delegation led by Shi Weisan
arrived here on July 28 and left today for home after a one-week
visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest Chinese trade delegation to visit Iraq since
the signing of the U.N.-Iraqi deal which allows Iraq to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars of oil in a period of six months to buy food
and other supplies for its people hard hit by the six-year-old
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say They've Found Earlist Sexual Differentiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese biologists have found
indications from organic material that sexual differentiation
occurred as early as 620 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yun, a professor of biology at Beijing University
revealed the news today to participants at the 30th International
Geological Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some biologists say they believe this is the only reliable
evidence so far of sexual reproduction of multicellular organisms
in the Precambrian period.
</P>
<P>
The matter indicates that a distinction between sexes and
sexual reproduction may have been the direct cause of the
occurrence of animal and plant species some 570 million years ago
during the Cambrian period.
</P>
<P>
In southwest China's Guizhou Province, Prof. Zhang found
fossils of multicellular plants with signs of sexual
differentiation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang explained that, for a long period of more than one
billion years before the Precambrian, the highest form of life on
earth consisted of only one cell that had no sexual
differentiation, something like chlorella or an amoeba in modern
times.
</P>
<P>
That sexual differentiation made the reproduction of living
things more complex and increased their genetic information, so
that it provided the potential of biological evolution.
</P>
<P>
"After sexual differentiation appeared, the pace of biological
evolution accelerated," he said, and "men and women appeared, and
then love and ensuing outstanding cultures."
</P>
<P>
But from the point of view of biology, sexual distinctions and
other phenomena related to sex are simply resultant from
biological evolution, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The water level of the Yangtze
river is rising, while some parts of Yellow and Huaihe rivers are
already at flood stage, the State Flood-Control and Drought-Relief
Headquarters reported today.
</P>
<P>
Following a gradual drop, the level of the Yangtze River in the
middle and lower reaches has risen again since August 1 because of
typhoon and subsequent torrential rains in east China's coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Cheng Jiling, a hydrometric station on
Dongting Lake in the river's middle reaches, is 1.2 to 1.67 meters
higher than the danger level.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the excessive amount of rainfall, the trunk
streams of the Yellow River are also flooding, with a total volume
of 7,600 cubic meters passing through the Huayuankou Hydrometric
Station at 14 hours today, the biggest since 1985. The water
level of the station reached 94.73 meters, 0.4 meter higher than
the record level of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Some tributaries of the Huaihe river have also reported the
biggest flooding since 1963, also because of rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
Government organizations, engineering task forces and military
forces along these rivers are actively involved in the anti-flood
and relief work during the major flooding period, usually from
early July to late August.

CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian
Legislative Council Ahmed Korei has termed as very dangerous the
Israeli government's decision to lift a ban on expansion of Jewish
settlements in the Palestinian territories.

In an interview with the Cairo-based Sawt Al Arab (Voice of

building restrictions on construction in the Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions were imposed by Israel's late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin four years ago to pave the way for peace
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the interview broadcast today, Korei called for a firm Arab
stance to prove that there would be neither peace nor
normalization of relations between Israel and the Arabs if the
Jewish state continues its settlement activities in the

<HEADLINE> Worst Drought in 50 Years Hits Lower Normandy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The worst drought in 50 years in
France has hit the region of Lower Normandy, seriously affecting
the traditional cattle rearing industry in an area known for its
green fields.
</P>
<P>
Water consumption in three areas of Normandy is rationed, the
result of little rainfall since October last year. The area of
Calvados has had less than 7.1 millimeters of rain in July, says
the local press.
</P>
<P>
One of the worst hit areas of Normandy is in the west where
there is no grass and cattle have been fed winter supplies of
silage.
</P>
<P>
"I have never used winter stocks to feed my 60 milk cows in
summer as I am doing now...This hurts my heart really badly and we
are going to buy grass stocks even though we are rationing the
cows' food and we don't have much money." said Jacques Hedouin, a
43-year-old cattle breeder at Gouville-sur-Mer.
</P>
<P>
"The drought adds to the mad cow crisis. This is a real
catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
He said he was going to sell some of his cows at 9-13 francs a
kilogram and expected a 100,000 franc loss.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable growers of Lower Normandy are as worried as
cattle breeders. Things were made more difficult after a local
government in Lingerville banned the use of irrigation from 13:00
to 17:00 hours, the hottest of the day.
</P>
<P>
"I can use my electrical irrigation system which does not
bother my neighbors at night as diesel pumps do. But the watering
is not enough and 30 percent of the vegetables are unsellable,"
said Daniel Mahe, a local farmer.
</P>
<P>
According to official forecasters, the mean rainfall rate in
Lower Normandy was expected to be 50 percent down this year, and
it could be 85 percent down in worst-hit areas like Calvados and
Deauville.

<HEADLINE> Death Demanded for Former South Korean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean prosecutor today
demanded the death penalty and a 278 million U.S. dollar fine for
former President Chun Doo-hwan charged with mutiny, treason and
bribery.
</P>
<P>
In the 27th trial session held at the Seoul District Court for
Chun, another former president, Roh Tae-woo, and their followers
for their roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and
the brutal suppression of the uprising on May 18, 1980, senior
public prosecutor Kim Sang-hee also demanded that Roh be sentenced
to life in prison and fined 355 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Life in prison was also asked for former First Army Corps
commander, Hwang Young-si, and former Special Warfare Forces
commander, Chung Ho-yong. Fifteen year prison terms were sought
for eight other defendants including former defense minister, Choo
Young-bock.
</P>
<P>
It was demanded that a former commander of the 30th Security
Group, Chang Se-dong, receive 12 years in prison, while a 10-year
prison term was sought for three other former officers including a
commander of the Army's 20th Division, Park Jun-byung.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the court, the prosecution asked the bench to hand
down severe punishment to the defendants as provided by law.
</P>
<P>
The 16 former South Korean officers including Chun and Roh have
been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both. The mutiny and
treason charges stem from their roles in the 1979 military revolt
and the 1980 suppression of the uprising in Kwangju, capital of
South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation
until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for graft. They allegedly received huge illegal
funds from businessmen while in office.

<HEADLINE> State To Combat Epidemics In Flood-Stricken Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Peng Peiyun
today urged government officials in flood-affected areas in China
to concentrate on preventing and controlling the outbreak of
epidemic diseases while trying to hold losses from the disaster to
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national telephone conference on disaster relief
and epidemic control, Peng said all relevant government
organizations and the Red Cross should provide prompt
transportation of aid, medicines, medical apparatuses and
instruments, and other necessities to disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
The public should be provided with more knowledge about
sanitation to protect themselves from diseases, she said.
</P>
<P>
Since the summer set in, central China's Hunan, Hubei, east
China's Jiangxi, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, and Guangxi and
Guizhou provinces in the south and southwest have been seriously
affected by flooding.
</P>
<P>
But the epidemic situation as of June was not bad, with rate of
incidence and mortality from 25 epidemic diseases across China
having dropped by 6.07 percent and 6.66 percent respectively from
the same period last year, and the incidence of gastro-intestinal
diseases rising in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels should improve the basic health care
system and pay close attention to epidemic disease control, the
conference was told, and special aid should be provided by the
central government disaster-relief fund for prevention and
treatment of epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring of the disinfecting of drinking water and protection
of food should be beefed up, while measures should be taken to
protect people in flood-stricken areas from the danger of
ingesting pesticides, industrial salts, and polluted foods by
mistake, the conference was told.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Launches Polio Immunisation Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe today
launched the Zimbabwe national immunisation days (NIDS) by giving
several children the oral polio vaccine at a ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
This was part of a worldwide campaign to eradicate polio from
the planet by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, Mugabe said the NIDS were an important
event in the fight against preventable diseases through
vaccination and toward the ultimate eradication of poliomyelitis
in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
''May i take this opportunity to urge all parents and
guardians to present and have all their children vaccinated
against polio, taking advantage of the vaccination centers during
the national immunisation days, whether or not the child has
previously been immunised against poliomyelitis,'' said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said since independence the Zimbabwean government had made
great strides in the provision of basic health to children.
</P>
<P>
He said the expanded program on immunisation was one of the
primary health care programs that had tremendous impact in
reducing infant and child mortality and morbidity from serious
childhood diseases which could be prevented by immunisation.
</P>
<P>
He said according to the 1992 census, infant mortality had
been reduced from 88 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 66 percent
per 1,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe should continue the surveillance of poliomyelitis and
conduct follow-up investigations on all suspected cases in order
to eliminate the remaining risk of permanent paralysis through
poliomyelitis, he said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israel Ready to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said here today that his country is ready to resume the
peace talks with Syria "in the near future" only if the Syrians
want to do so.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with King Hussein of Jordan after
their talks in Royal Palace here this morning, Netanyahu said his
government would like to discuss with Syria - the main foreign
power broker in Lebanon where it maintains 35,000 troops - on
Israel's new option of "Lebanon-first," under which, Israel would
unilaterally withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister told reporters that his country
"has no territorial claims to south Lebanon," adding that Israel
wants to seek security and peace along its common borders with
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, neither Netanyahu nor King Hussein disclosed Syrian
President Hafez Al Assad's view toward the option, which the
Syrian press denounced Saturday as "an attempt to sow divisions
between Syria and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the solution of Lebanon would give confidence
to Syrians.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel hopes to develop "relations of trust,
relations of stability and relations of confidence" with Syria
and seek an "agreed-upon" framework with Syrians.
</P>
<P>
To seek peace with all the Arab countries is the final
goal of his government, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
On Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, the Israeli prime minister
said that before he left Tel Aviv for Amman this morning, he
discussed with his defense minister on further easing the
closure of the Palestinian self-rule area in order to allow
thousands more Palestinians to work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated his government's stands vis-a-vis the holy
city of Jerusalem, saying that Jerusalem will remain as a united
capital for the Jewish State.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Minister of Infrastructure Sharon's view toward
the agreed-upon Aqaba airport project represents the government's
policy, Netanyahu said the project is "a very good stimulus" to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that his government will carry out the plan
once the feasibility study is finished.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports here said that Sharon, the rightest in the
Israeli new government, voiced his objection to an agreement
reached on converting the Aqaba airport as a joint facility to
serve both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister emphasized the unity of his
government and its commitment to the peace process, saying that
"we have one government and one policy for peace."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is here on his first official visit to Jordan
since taking office in June and the third to the kingdom since
the signing of the 1994 peace treaty, will visit the Rose-Red
city of Petra before returning home later today.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Praises Patriotism of Chinese Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- It has been more a competition of
psychology, willpower and spirit of the athletes at the 26th
Olympic Games in Atlanta than skills and abilities, says an
editorial to be carried in tomorrow's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the Chinese athletes in the games, the
newspaper says, has been a victory of their stamina and skills,
and still more an exploration of their courage and qualities.
</P>
<P>
"With their behavior they have demonstrated their lofty ideals,
which place the motherland ahead of anything else," it says.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, Chinese athletes won 16 gold medals, 22
silver, and 12 bronze in the games, and every medal expresses a
touching story of hard work, and every match is a song of
life. The medals embrace one common topic -- patriotism, the
editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
"The grandeur of the courts is part of painful hard work," it
says. "If one wants to reflect the glory of the motherland and the
expectations of the people, with the raising of the national flag,
one should hold firm to winning honor for the country and be ready
to work industriously until that is achieved."
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic Games are eternal, and the spirit of patriotism is
eternal. It is the eternal spirit of patriotism that continues to
make the Olympic games attractive," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It is also the patriotism, collectivism and revolutionary
heroism of Chinese athletes that inspire the patriotic enthusiasm
of the Chinese people, either in China or abroad, the editorial
says.

KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudis are the biggest
consumers of gold as they buy 44.5 million pieces of gold and
jewelry annually, costing up to 3 billion U.S. dollars, Saudi
daily Arab News reported today.
</P>
<P>
This means 17 million people of high annual income in the
kingdom purchase 174 tons of gold every year, the largest
individual average of gold purchase in the world. This amounts to
an annual spending of 1,400 U.S. dollars on gold for every buyer.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Saudi Arabia constitutes the major market of
gold and jewelry in the Middle East region, and it has become one
of the major countries in the world dealing in gold.
</P>
<P>
There are 40 major gold factories in the kingdom with an
annual production capacity of one to ten tons. There are also
300 small workshops making jewelry, 50 wholesale gold dealers and
about 3,000 retail shops selling gold and jewelry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Cattle Safe From Lung Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Veterinary Services Director
Stuart Hargreaves said here today that Zimbabwe's cattle are safe
from the deadly lung disease which has broken out in neighboring
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
He said the disease in the north-western parts of Botswana is
bound to affect Namibia more than Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We are fairly safe because of the area where the disease has
broken out from," he said.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the disease has caused concern among South
African farmers because of the speed with which it spreads.
</P>
<P>
Hargreaves, however, said as a precautionary measure, any
cattle that cross the border from Botswana will have to be put on
quarantine and burnt.
</P>
<P>
The South African Transvaal Agricultural Union said at the
weekend the lung disease poses a more serious threat to its
members than the madcow disease.
</P>
<P>
Although the disease has been eradicated in South Africa eight
years ago, its outbreak in Botswana poses a new threat.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation and contacts between
China's largest metropolis and Hong Kong have grown dramatically
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A large picture exhibition, "Hong Kong: History and
Development", was on display today, with the fifth part, "Shanghai
and Hong Kong Join Hands For Coming Century", attracting a lot of
attention.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that, as July 1, 1997 draws closer and
sovereignty over Hong Kong returns to China, cooperation and
contacts between the two cities will be given greater impetus.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has become Shanghai's largest trade and investment
partner, and bilateral cooperation extends to science, education,
culture, publication, sports, radio and TV.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Hong Kong had invested in 5,870
projects in Shanghai, putting it in first place in overseas
investment in the city. Bilateral trade has been an annual
increase of over 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, more than 84 troupes, with 533 artists, exchanged
visits for traditional Chinese opera, dance, and song
performances. Radio, TV, and film exchanges are also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The two cities have also jointly sponsored five annual
publishing conferences and by the end of last year had signed 203
copyright agreements for 332 works.

<P>
Iftikhar Ali Malik, Vice President of ICCI said on the occasion
that Pakistan has most favorable balance of trade with Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has held a number of commercial exhibitions and has
sent trade delegations to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan for the
expansion of trade, he added.

<HEADLINE> Premier on Reform of Higher Education Administrative System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li called on officials at all levels to consider the country's
overall economic and political situation in helping improve higher
education and training more qualified personnel who can cope with
the demands of the new century, and said that more importance
should be placed on reforming the management of college education
in China.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li, who is also a Standing Committee member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, made the remarks on the last day of a national
conference on reform work concerning the higher education
administrative system, which opened here August 2.
</P>
<P>
Li said local education officials should tighten controls and
work out ways of restructuring administrative system, and that the
relevant central government departments should improve
coordinations in the reforms to let them develop in a still
healthier way.
</P>
<P>
Although fairly big strides have been made in reforming the
higher education administrative system over the years thanks to
efforts of the State Education Commission and other departments,
he said, its progress in reform still lags behind economic
restructuring and social development, and fails to be in line with
the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he went on to say, "we should, on the basis of the
experiences and achievements that have so far been scored, speed
up the pace of reform and overcome difficulties and examine
priorities."
</P>
<P>
China has more than 1,000 universities and colleges, but the
number of institutions of higher learning in relation to the
population is still quite small.
</P>
<P>
Li acknowledged that greater efforts are required to get the
management of colleges to respond to the socialist market economy
and keep to the policy of revitalizing the country with science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
He also called on central government departments to take a
closer look at educational institutions with inferior qualities.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and vice-premier of the State Council, also spoke at the
conference.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Geologists' New Theory on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists say they
believe that the fast growth of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the
result of isostatic adjustment of the plateau's crust and the
expansion of terrestrial heat.
</P>
<P>
The theory was advanced today by Xiao Xuchang, a professor with
the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, at the ongoing 30th
International Geological Congress (IGC) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The plateau has risen about 10,000 m in the past two million
years, and Qomolangma, or Mount Everest, rose 37 cm in the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
As opposed to traditional theories of terrain collision and
double crusts, the new theory is believed to be the most developed
way to explain the plateau's swelling.
</P>
<P>
Xiao and geologist Li Tingdong separate the plateau's swelling
into three periods: slow swelling of less than two millimeters a
year from 65 million to 40 million years ago, moderate swelling of
two to three mm a year from 40 million to two million years ago,
and fast swelling of up to five mm a year over the past two
million years.
</P>
<P>
They say they believe the motivity of the slow swelling period
came from the collision of the Indian terrain. It is here where
their view is the same as traditional terrain theory.
</P>
<P>
But about five million years ago, the terrain moved slower and
slower toward the north. It moved 50 to 60 mm a year 65 million
years ago, and five to eight mm a year over the past two million
years.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, at the same time, is growing faster
and faster, indicating that terrain collision is no longer the
major motivity factor, they explain.
</P>
<P>
Their studies show that terrestrial heat under the highlands
plays an important part in the swelling.
</P>
<P>
Xiao explained the isostatic adjustment resulting from the
weakening of the Indian terrain's collision by pointing to how a
rubber ball will try its best to swell as soon as the power of a
finger upon it is relaxed.

<HEADLINE> Stricter Management Of Extra-Budgetary Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The management of extra-budgetary
funds must be improved and the misuse of these funds must be
halted immediately, according to the State Council, China's
cabinet, in a decision that it released here today.
</P>
<P>
Extra-budgetary funds have been expanding over the years, it
said.
</P>
<P>
"The use of extra-budgetary funds has escaped the overview of
the People's Congress and misuse of the funds has run rampant
because of lax management," the decision said.
</P>
<P>
"This problem has helped breed unhealthy tendencies and
corruption," it noted, adding that it has also resulted in
dispersion of state funds and disorder in public.
</P>
<P>
All areas, departments and units must implement the Budget Law
strictly and never turn budget funds into extra-budgetary funds,
the State Council said.
</P>
<P>
Fees collected and funds must be better managed to control the
size of budgetary funds, it said, noting that "collecting and
drawing extra-budgetary funds must be done in strict accordance
with laws, rules and, stipulations."
</P>
<P>
"No locality is authorized to approve funds nor is it allowed
to set up funds in the disguise of collecting fees for
administrative purposes," the decision warned. Fees and funds that
violate rules and regulations must be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
The State Council also urged all areas and departments to set
up a supervisory system and one of penalties for extra-budgetary
fund matters, and said that governments are subject to the
supervision of the local people's congress in the case of
extra-budgetary funds.
</P>
<P>
"Violators of management regulations on extra-budgetary funds
will be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and rules,"
the State Council said.
</P>
<P>
In May, China launched a campaign to tighten supervision over
extra-budgetary funds that is scheduled to last through
September. The Ministry of Finance also announced a telephone
hotline for the public to phone in when they have knowledge of
authorities' misuse of extra-budgetary funds.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that more than 400 calls to the special
"dial-a-cheat" hotline were received in the first month of
operation.
</P>
<P>
Jin Lianshu, a senior official with the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, has said
that extra-budgetary funds are often used to buy luxury cars and
houses, or to speculate in real estate and stocks, and that some
even end up in private hands.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process in Snags in S. Leone: Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Although "active consultations
are going on daily with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in
Abidjan," recent attacks in eastern and southeastern Sierra Leone
are fuelling fears that the peace process is not working.
</P>
<P>
This was observed here today by west African diplomats
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone government said in a statement that it is
"working on a program to create the conditions for the conclusion
of a durable peace agreement with the RUF" but did not explain
how or what form it is taking.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned "the public that durable peace is
unlikely to be achieved overnight in a savage conflict that has
lasted over five years."
</P>
<P>
A government critic, former presidential candidate for the
National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP), Yayah Sillah said in
an interview "the government should have achieved something more
concrete and meaningful after more than 100 days in power instead
of the precarious and often violated ceasefire agreement."
</P>
<P>
According to assessments made by west African diplomats, the
peace agreement ranks high in the priority list of the majority
of Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
Recent rebel attacks have resulted in the death or serious
injury of over 100 civilians.
</P>
<P>
In one attack over the weekend, rebels matcheted a treasury
clerk David Mafinda at Kainkordu in Kono district in the east,
local journalists reported.
</P>
<P>
One survivor was quoted as saying "the rebels went about the
attack in a casual way, first greeting civilians who welcomed
them as government troops and then opened fire."

<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China has invested more than 100
billion yuan in locating 160 types of minerals over the past four
decades with more than 90 percent of deposits having been
verified, putting it behind only the US and Russia in resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources,
China has exploited 132 kinds of mineral resources, and the
verified deposits of 20 mineral resources rank first in the world.
</P>
<P>
China has found 200,000 deposits, three-forths of which have
proven reserves, making China one of the few countries in the
world to have a wide variety of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The combined output of ore per year is 5.8 billion tons,
accounting for six percent of the country's total industrial
output value. Mining provides job opportunities for more 14
million people across the country. There are more than 300 cities
with mining as the pillar industry.
</P>
<P>
Iron ore production bases have been built in Anshan, Baotou,
and Panzhihua cities, and in Hainan province. Nonferrous metal
deposits are scattered in various parts of China, and Bayan Obo,
in north China's Inner Mongolia, leads the world in rare earth
output.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The American Embassy in
Kuwait has adopted new security measures as a precaution against
possible terrorist attacks following two bomb explosions in Saudi
Arabia during the past seven months that killed 24 American
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
A new concrete security fence around the embassy compound
located in Bayan area, Kuwait city, was seen built up in recent
days. Several police cars were also found patrolling the area in
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat of the embassy said the security fence was a
precautionary measure that was decided after a fuel truck bomb
killed 19 U.S. servicemen and injured more than 200 others at a
military housing complex in al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia in June.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat said they had not received any new threat
against the embassy, but several other security measures by the
embassy had been implemented, he added but refused to reveal them.
</P>
<P>
Huge slabs of concrete were laid around the embassy 20
meters away from the compound wall Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The American Embassy in Kuwait was struck on December 12, 1983
by a car bomb which caused the casualty of around 100 persons,
but none of them were Americans.
</P>
<P>
The embassy asked the 6,000 Americans living in Kuwait to
take caution after the bombing in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
No strikes have occurred targeting the U.S. interests and
installations in Kuwait since 1992 when the allied forces led
by the U.S. army liberated Kuwait from the occupation by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops in the adjoining Saudi Arabia have been hit
twice in seven months. So far no group has claimed responsibility
for the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Refuting Human Rights Watch/Asia Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A leading official from the China
Society for Human Rights Studies today said that an account by
Human Rights Watch/Asia in its July 10th report "China: the Cost
of Putting Business First" was "sheer lies."
</P>
<P>
"Human Rights Watch/Asia's unwarranted attack on China in the
Tibet issue and the crackdown on crime was 'deliberately
fabricated' and confused right with wrong," the official told a
Xinhua reporter.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Human Rights Watch/Asia gratuitously
slandered China with its accusation in a report published on
January 7, about the situation of children in Chinese child
welfare institutions.
</P>
<P>
Since that time, the official said, Chinese departments and UN
organizations that understand the actual situation of Chinese
children, along with many US adoption agencies, as well as
individual citizens who visited Chinese child welfare homes, have
refuted the lies and slanders of Human Rights Watch/Asia with the
true facts. As a result, Human Rights Watch/Asia has been
embarrassed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A closer examination of the Human Rights Watch/Asia report
published in July revealed that it was no different from the
January report, fabricating rumors and distorting the facts, the
official said, pointing out that the contents and individual cases
in the report are "do not at all tally with the actual
situations", and referring to some of them as "slanderous rumors,"
and others as "deliberate misrepresentations".
</P>
<P>
In the report, Human Rights Watch/Asia fabricated stories,
saying that "In February 1996, the Chinese government issued a
directive to close politically active monasteries", clearly
referring to the Tibetan issue, the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the relevant Chinese departments, the government
never issued such a directive, the official pointed out, noting
that Tibet now has a total of more than 1,400 monasteries and
nunneries of various kinds, and not one was closed this year.

<P>
The report also had an exaggerated account of the prison life
of Xi Yang, a former reporter for the Hong Kong newspaper Ming
Pao, saying that "he cannot eat much, vomits often, suffers from
diarrhea, has heart palpitations and skin ailments, is dizzy, and
has chronic headaches," and that "he never sees the sun."
</P>
<P>
The fact is, the official said, that when he was jailed for
stealing state secrets, Xi Yang explained in his own words that he
had certain problems with headaches and indigestion, but a
physical examinations indicated that he had no serious illness and
that all vital signs were normal.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that during his two-year prison term, Xi
Yang was in a good condition all the time, and nothing abnormal
was found. The cell Xi lived in had windows, was sun-lit, and was
well-ventilated. In addition, prisoners often participate in
outdoor activities, and Xi Yang jogged every day and often took
part in basketball and table tennis matches. Judging from these
facts, the official said that the accusation that Xi Yang "never
saw sun" in prison is a complete lie.
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Watch/Asia report also attacked China's
"strike hard" campaign (crackdown on crime), saying that it
appears "to be more concerned with numbers than evidence," that it
"has implicitly targeted all dissidents", and that "Those arrested
in the 'strike hard' campaign are not tried before independent
judges."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, China's struggle to deal in a lawful
manner with criminals who seriously endanger public security, from
the very beginning focused its efforts on the most heinous crimes
of violence, particularly those involving the trafficing in
narcotics and trade in firearms and dangerous gangs, the official
said.

<P>
The campaign also targets drug-trafficking, illegal firearms
dealing, kidnapping of women and children, and frequent robbery --
crimes that threaten as many residents, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that most of the criminals arrested and
tried in the crime crackdown have been involved in murder,
robbery, transportation of or trade in firearms, destruction of
property, drug-running, abducting and selling women and children,
and gang-related activities.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out the "strike hard" campaign strictly in
accordance with laws, not only as they are written, but also as
they are carried out, the official said.
</P>
<P>
As the public security departments, judicial and procuratorial
organs have adhered to the principle of strict law enforcement
with socialist ethics, the official noted, all the cases were
properly handled during the whole "strike hard" campaign.
</P>
<P>
The "strike hard" campaign won nationwide support from the
Chinese people after a number of high-profile criminals, including
some who sold nearly 600 kilograms of heroin and others who were
convicted in four murder cases, have been punished severely, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
In general, people have shown a positive reaction and extensive
support to the strike hard campaign, indicating that public
security has been greatly improved, the sense of safety increased,
and human rights guaranteed, the official said,
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch/Asia vigorously voices its complaints
against crime and criminals in China, and yet continues to blame
China for its severe punishment of criminals and for its actions
to safeguard human rights for the vast majority of the people, the
official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This shows that what Human Rights Watch/Asia is concerned about
is not the human rights of the Chinese people, but the "rights of
a tiny minority of criminals to disturb the public order, to
endanger the state security and to overturn the Chinese legitimate
government," the official said, adding that it seems that Human
Rights Watch/Asia itself should be watched.

<P>
The leading human rights official said that it appears not to
be accidental that Human Rights Watch/Asia has invented individual
criminal cases, and has concocted a report that rashly criticizes
human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1985, Human Rights Watch/ Asia has
maintained a hostile attitude against China, stirred up disputes
over human rights issues, fabricated rumors to attack and slander
China, and played henchman for Western forces that oppose China,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
While some Western nations were drafting the human rights bill
to oppose China at meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights
held early this year, Human Rights Watch/Asia crafted an alleged
report on the situation of children in China's welfare homes, a
document that framed up lies and spread rumors that attacked the
situation of children in China and heightened the Western
countries' opposition to China's human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
The report was aired by some major media, including the Voice
of America and BBC, providing new opportunities to criticize
China, the official said.
</P>
<P>
When some Western powers rushed to create a human rights bill
against China during meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights
in March, Watch/Asia published a follow-up report to accuse China
of potential criminal neglect in the country's child welfare homes.
</P>
<P>
There is much evidence to show that Watch/Asia's actions are
neither isolated, nor accidental, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that some human rights organizations,
called "non-governmental organizations," often take the lead in
the movement to oppose China, and are closely linked with some
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs have, in general, played an increasingly important
role in the aspect of human rights in recent years, the official
noted, adding that this is mostly a positive trend.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the NGOs are spreading lies and rumors to
viciously attack other countries, the official said, calling on
all nations to closely monitor this activity.
</P>
<P>
The official urged NGOs in human rights to promote the
international exchange and cooperation in human rights, enhance
the mutual understanding between countries and advance world peace
and development.

WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Michael Chang
downed second seed Dutchman Richard Krajicek in straight sets to
claim Infiniti open tennis title in Los Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his fourth trip to the final, the speedy American raced past
the eighth-ranked Wimbledon champion 6-4, 6-3 in 72 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, a two-time winner of this event, seemed lethargic in
dropping his serve in the opening game. And his big serve failed
him again in the seventh game. He managed to break back to pull
within 3-5 but Chang, using his remarkable speed to chase down
everything, served out the set.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Chang broke Krajicek at love for a 4-3
lead. He sealed the win with another break in the final game on a
cross-court volley winner.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is making diplomatic
efforts to resolve pending issues with Pakistan, including the
sharing of assets.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question in parliament Sunday, Bangladeshi
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said that Bangladesh demanded a
due share of more than 24 billion Pakistan rupees (about 780
million US dollars) in 1971 after the country was independent from
the then Pakistan and the issue has been discussed at various
levels since then between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that more than one million non-Bengalis
remained stranded in the country in the wake of Bangladesh's
independence in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Out of them, more than 500,000 people have been granted
citizenship of Bangladesh after they applied for it, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue of the remaining 540,000 non-Bengalis has
not been resolved though they have expressed their desire to be
repatriated to Pakistan, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He assured MPs at the parliament session that the government is
still making diplomatic efforts for expeditious repatriation of
the stranded Pakistanis.

<HEADLINE> Review Shows Low Crime Rate in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's crime rate of 1,484
 per 100,000 people is one of the lowest in the world for similar
sized or larger cities, local police said today.
</P>
<P>
Hui Ki-on, commissioner of Hong Kong Police, said in the
just-released 1995 review of the local police that last year
violent crimes such as robbery, homicide, blackmail and criminal
intimidation were all down from the 1994's figures.
</P>
<P>
The detection rate remained steady at 52 percent, "which is
very high by international standards", Hui added.
</P>
<P>
"Although the total number of crimes reported was up 4.6
percent to 91,886, this was mainly due to increases in
miscellaneous theft, wounding, serious assaults and detected drugs
 offenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hui attributed the achievement to the enactment of new
anti-crime laws in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the battle against crime was helped by the
"excellent and increasingly important relationship" with Chinese
law enforcement agencies which also helped the Hong Kong Police's
investigations, especially in regard to drug trafficking,
smuggling and vehicle theft.

<HEADLINE> Ali Mahdi Frowns on Hussein Aidid's Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- North Mogadishu faction leader
Ali Mahdi Mohamed today characterized the nomination of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid as the president of Somalia as "stupid, selfish and
provocative." It means the situation in Somalia may deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in his office in north Mogadishu, Ali
Mahdi said he and his ally Osman Hassan Ali Atto may revoke the
unilateral ceasefire they announced after late general Aidid died
in south Mogadishu on August 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi has called on the supporters of late Aidid to
refrain from any kind of violence, saying ''that will only
further devastate the deteriorating humanitarian (situation) in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
Mahdi noted it was the civil war that ended the life of late
general Aidid after he was gunned down and wounded in armed
conflicts in Medina neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
According to Mahdi, all the forces of his faction are put on
high alert immediately after the nomination of Hussein Mohamed
Aidid was officially announced yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A president for Somalia should come democratically on the will
of the vast majority of the people, Mahdi said, "Presidency of a
country is not a personal property to be inherited by the
children.''
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his militiamen will not fire until they are
fired upon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a spokesman for the faction of Osman Atto
said his faction calls on all Somali people to further respect
the ceasefire that is currently holding in Mogadishu and
elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to comment about the nomination of
Hussein Aidid, saying, ''it's no difference from the nomination
of his late father 14 months ago in south Mogadishu.''
</P>
<P>
Hussein Mohamed Aidid was sworn in last night to succeed the
post vacated by his late father, General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the radio, Hussein Aidid said he is planning to
put into practice all that is written on the transitional charter
and will destroy what he called "both the internal and external
enemies."
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid is currently addressing his supporters in
Mogadishu stadium. Thousands of people are gathering there to
support the new nomination of Hussein Aidid.

<P>
DAMASCUS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
held a meeting at noon today with his Lebanese counterpart Elias
Hrawi as soon as the latter arrived here.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in the Syrian capital believe that the
Syrian and Lebanese presidents are expected to examine the latest
developments of the conditions in the region, including the the
so-called "Lebanon First" proposal put forward by the hardline
Israeli Likud government.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli proposal calls for an unilateral Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon in exchange for a disarmament of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or the Party of God, and a mechanism to
guarantee the security on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon have rejected the Israeli proposal out
of the suspicion that the proposal was aimed at driving a wedge
between the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President al-Assad will brief Lebanese President Hrawi
on the outcome of the talks he had Saturday with King Hussein of
Jordan on ways of securing Arab solidarity, in addition to the
developments of the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Changdao County Most Affluent in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Changdao County, China's largest
offshore island county in east China's Shandong Province, has
become the country's most affluent county, with its per-capita
gross domestic product (GDP) reaching 12,600 yuan by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of 48.6 percent over the same
period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Made up of 32 offshore islands, Changdao is at the top of the
list of the country's 12 offshore island counties and more than
130 counties in Shandong Province in eight key economic
indexes. Of these categories, Changdao's per-capita GDP and
per-capita total savings all rank the first among China's counties.
</P>
<P>
The county's per-capita GDP is expected to exceed 30,000 yuan
this year.
</P>
<P>
Located in the offshore area between the Jiaodong and Liaodong
peninsulas, Changdao County boasts a vast surrounding sea area and
more than 200 varieties of marine life. It has a population of
more than 40,000.
</P>
<P>
Fishery is the county's leading industry. In 1995, Changdao's
total output of aquatic products reached 284,000 tons. The output
of artificial breeding stood at 200,000 tons, pushing its
per-capita quota to the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
The county now has a 4,000-hectare breeding area in its
42,000-hectare sea vicinity.
</P>
<P>
Changdao has set up 30 ponds where artificial breeding of
salted fish fries is conducted, and more than 200 breeding
facilities for a variety of fish. There are about 100 million fish
in the county's waters.
</P>
<P>
Changdao has developed more than 30 varieties of marine
medicine and food, which sell well in both domestic and overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with rapid economic growth, the county has formed
five industrial groups involved in food processing, marine
medicine, shipbuilding, plastic products production, and light
industry and textiles. In 1995, its total industrial output value
reached 680 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Changdao has invested more than 700 million yuan to build
infrastructural facilities. It has constructed two 1,000-ton
roll-on/roll-off docks, opened sea transportation lines linking
Changdao to Japan and the Republic of Korea, and initiated a
marine products wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
The county has established more than 70 foreign-funded
enterprises, whose earnings from exports exceeded 30 million US
dollars in 1995.

is considering scrapping the national government's plan to
relocate capital functions out of Tokyo, Kyodo News Service
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A committee of experts has been set up by the Tokyo
metropolitan government to persuade the public that transferring
administrative, legislative and judiciary functions away from
Tokyo would be a waste of time and money, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, a National Land Agency panel issued a
report urging the construction of a new city to take on the
capital functions from 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report envisaged a city with a population of 600,000,
located between 60 kilometers to 300 km from Tokyo and called for
candidate sites to be chosen within the next two years and for the
Diet to move there by 2010.
</P>
<P>
A capital relocation bill calling for a council to be set up to
pick candidate sites was passed in June.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources say discussions at the council may be
contentious if the Tokyo metropolitan government succeeds in
getting places on it for experts opposed to relocation.

<HEADLINE> 7 Nigerians Crushed Dead Celebrating Soccer Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Tragedies over the weekend in
Nigeria trailed the country's display at the centennial Olympics
-- the clinching of the prestigious soccer gold, the first by an
African nation.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Daily Champion newspaper, a luxury bus
rammed into a crowd of jubilating youths at a Moslem-dominated
settlement in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, early Sunday, killing
four persons instantly.
</P>
<P>
The enraged youths then ordered the passengers out and set the
bus on fire.
</P>
<P>
In a village not far away, a trailer, carrying tens of
jubilant youths wielding leaves and shouting victory slogans and
songs, ran into another crowd celebrating the historic feat,
killing three persons in the process.
</P>
<P>
The two Kaduna incidents occurred at about 2:00 am on Sunday,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, an electrician in Lagos, determined to
bring electricity from a neighboring building to his house to
watch the final match between Nigeria and Argentina at a power
outrage, was electrocuted and died in hospital that night.
</P>
<P>
This was the second of soccer related tragedy in the country
in three days as an automobile mechanic also died Thursday in
Kaduna after the Brazil-Nigeria semi-final match. The cause of
death was said to be heart attack, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Attracts More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Hangzhou, the capital city of
east China's Zhejiang Province, has approved 2,204 jointly-funded
enterprises since the start of 1995, with total contractual
foreign investment reaching 2.4 billion U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Hangzhou, a well-known scenic city in
China, had 180 large joint enterprises, each of which involves at
least 10 million U.S.dollars of investment.
</P>
<P>
Joint enterprises in Hangzhou have shown marked performance and
played an increasingly important role in the city's economy in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that joint enterprises in Hangzhou have
contributed some 15 percent of the city's gross industrial output
value in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the joint enterprises established in 1995, more than
80 percent of the city's joint enterprises made profits last
year.
</P>
<P>
"More and more state enterprises of the city are interested in
finding foreign partners, not only for seeking foreign investment,
but also for updated technical know-how and products, and the
level of cooperation has been upgrading consistently," said a
senior official with the city.

<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Ghana and Japan have signed three
grant agreements totalling 1.8 billion Yen (about 17 million U.S.
Dollars) for three different projects in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
A report obtained here today said about 9.1 million Dollars of
the total amount will be used for the construction of small-scale
bridges, some 3.6 million Dollars for increased food supply while
3.8 million Dollars for rural water supply.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ghana's foreign minister Obed Asamoah as
saying that the construction of small-scale bridges formed part
of his government's plan in rehabilitating and building an
excellent road network in the country.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement for increased food production would help
Ghana in achieving self-sufficiency in food production and
increased efforts at curtailing imports of basic food items, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the third facility was aimed at making life
more comfortable for rural dwellers, reducing water-borne
diseases and minimizing rural-urban migration.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Daily denounces Israel for Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian newspaper "al-Baath,"
mouthpiece of the ruling party, denounced Israel in its editorial
today for expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab
territories.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of declaring its commitment to the peace process, the
Tel Aviv government makes decisions that are quite far from the
(Middle East) peace process," al-Baath said.
</P>
<P>
"He who does really want and seek a genuine peace has to go
back to the Madrid (Conference) principles and foundations and to
declare he is committed to implementing them," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"But for Israel it is undoubtedly not intended to achieve a
genuine peace in any way to start a new process of wide-scale
expansion of settlements, to refuse to withdraw from the Golan
(Heights) and the other occupied Arab territories and to consider
Jerusalem it capital for ever. All that interests Israel is to
expand the Jewish settlements at the expense of the Arabs," the
daily added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet decided last Friday to end the four-year
ban, imposed by the previous Labor government, on settlement
construction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described
the move as a step to "correct the discrimination against Jewish
settlement" in the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baath said what the Arab citizens need at present is to
adhere to their national and nationalist rights and not to
surrender any of them at all by hammering out a unified Arab stand
to keep the enemy from achieving any of their objectives.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic language daily said Syria would do its best to
establish a fair and overall peace in the region, urging the
hardline Israeli Likud government to abide by the peace process,
and not to insist on its own prejudices.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa has filed a lawsuit against the Siam Post over the
daily's allegations that his party had received bribery from a
Swedish submarine builder.
</P>
<P>
The Siam Post published a report late last year, saying the
Swedish submarine builder, Kockums, had given bribe money to some
senior members of Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party in
order to win a contract to sell two submarines to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Banharn denied the allegations, saying the allegation could
damage his party's image.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said he had never known that submarines would be bought
before the general election on July 2, 1995, according to the Thai
news agency today.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency did not say when the lawsuit was lodged.

<HEADLINE> Granite Statue of Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian excavators have unearthed
a granite statue of Ramses II, one of ancient Egypt's most famous
pharaohs, a local English-language newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
After months of routine scrapping and digging at the foot of
the Pyramid of Mycerinos, the smallest of the three great pyramids
in the Giza plateau, excavators found the 3.5-ton statue showing
an unidentical set of Ramses twins, according to the Egyptian
Gazette.
</P>
<P>
"This discovery is important from an artistic, religious and
historical point of view and will help show us what in reality was
going on in Giza," Ali Hassan, an Egyptian archeologist, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The great pyramids at Giza, some 10 kilometers southwest of
Cairo, were constructed during the reigns of kings Cheops,
Chephren and Mycerinus from 2613 to 2494 B.C..
</P>
<P>
Ramses II ruled in the 13th century B.C. for 67 years. During
his reign, he built more monuments and colossal statues than any
other Egyptian king.
</P>
<P>
The unfinished double-headed statue is almost 3.4 meters tall,
The Egyptian Gazette said.
</P>
<P>
"The statue could have been left unfinished for artistic
reasons, they could have changed their mind for political reasons
and then left it unfinished for us to discover in 1996," Hassan
said.

PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Iran is more and more in the shooting foresight of the
United States. The U.S. troops in the Gulf area are on full alert
after the Pentagon has warned of an "imminent" terrorist attack.
Speculations grow that the U.S. is planning to launch an air
strike against Iran similar to that it did against Libya in 1986.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union is considering withdrawal from the
Bosnian city of Mostar over a possible failure to persuade Croats
to join its municipality with a Muslim majority which was elected
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian Hamas group made an outcry of revenge after
a Palestinian demonstrator was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in
the West Bank town of Tulkar last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S., French and British troops in the Gulf area have
doubled their vigilance after U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry
said he has information of an imminent terrorist attack on
them. Tension is mounting between Washington and Teheran after
Perry accused Iran of supporting the terrorist attack on an
American base in Dhrahran, Saudi Arabia in late June.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is reportedly planning to launch a raid to
capture former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by sending a
helicopter commando into the Serb territory in Bosnia. The plan is
reportedly opposed by Implementing Force commander Leighton Smith,
who described it as too risky.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli ultra-orthodox rabbis want to impose more strict
Judaist laws of Shabbat on Israeli society. Each week, clashes
take place on the street between rabbis and laymen opposing
them.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lack of Funds Hinders Drug Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Although Thailand has achieved
considerable success in reducing narcotics production, lack of
funds, staff and legal power has kept plans to set up drug
rehabilitation centers in the country as remote as ever.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 1.2 million drug addicts in the country,
Thailand needs to establish at least 10 rehabilitation centers
throughout the country, costing roughly 2 billion baht (80 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since the rehabilitation of drug addicts act was passed in
1993, the Department of Probation has made annual requests for
budget, totaling 54.6 million baht (2.18 million dollars), but it
has never received a budget allocation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the department does not have money for building
even one single center.
</P>
<P>
Beside the lack of funding, land for building these centers is
not yet available. The Treasury Department has not provided land
for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
What the Department of Probation has so far gained for the
execution of the rehabilitation program is only an agreement to
provide seven staff members.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the Office of Judicial Affairs is responsible
for establishing the centers, and in practice the task is supposed
to be carried out by the Probation Office, which, however, has
since been upgraded to a department and is no longer under the
Office of Judicial Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lack of cooperation among various government agencies is
another problem. Although the act stipulates that the
rehabilitation centers must be administered by the director
generals and secretary generals from various agencies, such as the
police and the Food and Drug Administration, there has never been
any discussion among these relevant parties.
</P>
<P>
Some drug control officials said that the act cannot be
enforced properly because the government does not pay enough
attention to the problems of drug addicts.

<P>
When it comes to this issue, the government is too
economic-minded. They think it is useless to spend money on this,
said Jaran Pukditanakul, secretary general of the Office of
Judicial Affairs.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the act also needs amendments to tighten the
consumption of drugs to cover people who are addicted to
amphetamine and glue-sniffing.

<HEADLINE> Recession Persists in France in Second Quarter of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- French economy continued to recess
in the second quarter of 1996, with a 0.1-percent drop in its
Gross National Product (GNP), according to an official economic
indicator published here today.
</P>
<P>
The Administration in Charge of Investing and Lending Public
Money (CDC) said the recession is mainly attributed to a fall in
industrial output and a rise of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The CDC estimated at the beginning of June a 0.2-percent
growth of the GNP. Industrial production fell by 2.5 percent in
May, and unemployment rate rose by 0.7 percent in June alone.
</P>
<P>
However, the CDC is optimistic that France will have a
0.4-percent growth in the GNP in the third quarter of the year and
a 0.2-percent growth in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
As to the reasons, the CDC said that "a good orientation of
short-term interest rates" has been adopted by French banks and
the GNP of the United States has gone up in the first quarter of
the year, which has direct repercussion on the French economy.
</P>
<P>
The official statistics of the GNP for the second quarter will
be published by the Institute of Statistics and Economics Study in
early September.

<HEADLINE> UK Denies BSE-Milk Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain has denied that it is
doing research into the possibility that BSE, or mad-cow disease,
might be passed on in milk.
</P>
<P>
The claim followed the disclosure last week that BSE can be
passed from mother to calf, and that the mechanism of such
"vertical transmission" is unknown.
</P>
<P>
The Observer newspaper said on Sunday that scientists were
urgently conducting fresh research into the safety of cow's milk
amid allegations that previous experiments held to show milk
cannot be infected with BSE are unreliable and inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry Sunday called the
reports of experiments with cows' milk "absolute rubbish."
</P>
<P>
The ministry has never funded any studies to investigate
whether milk could transmit BSE to calves. "Observations in the
field support the hypothesis that it cannot," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The ministry bases its confidence on research carried out by
scientists from the Institutes for Animal Health in Edinburgh and
Berkshire, and the Central Veterinary Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that no signs of the disease appeared in
any of the mice.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry's assurances have been dismissed by some
leading scientists who claim that the experiments were poor and
inconclusive.

KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Parliament Speaker
Abdullah al-Ahmar held talks with Saudi Arabian Second Deputy
Premier Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz on Sunday night in the Red
Sea port city of Jeddah to discuss a host of the issues of common
interest, official Saudi Press Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not give any details of the talks, only said the
Yemeni speaker arrived at Jeddah, where the Saudi leaders spend
their summer times, on Sunday on an unannounced visit.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan and al-Ahmar are the co-chairmen of the higher
committee of the two countries, which was set up according to a
memorandum of understanding signed between Sanna and Riyadh in
February last year in a bid to settle border disputes and help
develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee is in charge of the work of six
sub-committees set up to review aspects of border re-demarcation
and development of relations. The higher committee held its first
meeting in Riyadh last December, during which both sides agreed
to hold periodical sessions every three months at each country's
capital alternatively.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmar's visit followed the signing of two agreements in
Jeddah last week between the two countries which were aimed at
combating drug trafficking and other crimes as well as protecting
security situation along the borders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The interior ministers of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, after
signing the agreements, said the agreements would boost bilateral
relations and cooperation between the two Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The strained relations between the two countries have seen
relaxations in recent years. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
visited Saudi Arabia in June last year, his first tour to the
Kingdom in five years.

<HEADLINE> Asia, Africa Seek Cooperation in Desert Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Asian and African
countries and the United Nations gathered in Beijing today to
probe ways to fight desertification on the two continents, and to
improve their cooperation for the project.
</P>
<P>
About 30 officials participating in the Asia-Africa Forum on
Combating Desertification will hear countries report on their
efforts to prevent desertification in China, Mali, India and
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
During the six-day event, the leaders are expected to create a
framework that will guide Asian-African cooperation in the fight
against desertification.
</P>
<P>
They also are scheduled to visit desert control projects in
Inner Mongolia in north China on August 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
Xu Youfang, Minister of Forestry, told the forum, which is
jointly organized by United Nations, Japan and China, that Asia
and Africa have the largest and most severely-affected areas of
desertification.
</P>
<P>
He said many Asian and African countries have become
knowledgeable about the problem, and have developed many techniques
during their prolonged efforts to curb desertification.
</P>
<P>
"The present Asia-Africa forum is a major action taken by the
Asian and African countries to implement the UN Convention to
Combat Desertification and to carry out regional cooperation in
the Asian-African region," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Over one billion people in the world are directly threatened by
desertification, and 135 million of them are likely to lose their
land in the immediate future, the minister quoted the Secretariat
of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 million people in China are threatened by
desertification, and desertified area in China accounts for one
third of the country's total, Vice-minister Zhu Guangyao told the
forum.
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the desertified area is expanding at
2,100 sq km each year, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, China started construction on the "three north"
shelter belt project across northwest, north and northeast China,
in an attempt to ward off the problem.
</P>
<P>
China has since afforested 16.63 million ha of land in those
regions, which has provided protection for 11 million ha of
farmland.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Deficit Expands in First Half of '96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit,
excluding diamonds, reached 5.8 billion U.S. dollars in the first
half of this year, a 10.3 percent rise over the same period last
year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total trade deficit, 3.4 billion dollars was built up
with the European Union (EU), 1.3 billion dollars with the U.S.,
and 500 million dollars with its Asian trade partners, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the deficit with the U.S. increased by 70
percent, while smaller increases were registered with the EU and
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the deficit with Asian countries shrank by some 15
percent, as exports increased by 10 percent in relation to
imports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's total imports, also excluding diamonds, stood at 12.7
billion dollars in the first half of this year, approximately half
coming from the EU and a quarter from the U.S., it said.
</P>
<P>
The imports increased by 1 billion dollars over the same period
of last year, comprising a rise of 550 million dollars from the
U.S., 400 million dollars from the EU and 120 million dollars from
Asia. Within Asia, however, imports from the Far East reduced by
some 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this country's exports excluding diamonds reached 7
billion dollars in the first half, 40 percent of which went to the
EU, 25 percent to the U.S., and 13 percent to Asia, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The exports increased by 420 million dollars over the same
period of last year, due mainly to a 200 million dollar increase
in exports to Asia. But exports to EFTA countries shrank by 37
million dollars, and to the U.S. by 26 million, it added.

<HEADLINE> Elephant Population Grows in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The elephant population in Zambia
had grown steadily to 24,232 from 20,824 in 1994, thanks to the
major successes scored by the Department of Wildlife Services in
the fight against poaching.
</P>
<P>
Although the department cannot eradicate poaching completely,
it has managed to bring it under control in most areas of the
country, wildlife services public relations officer Tennyson
Musimuko said on Sunday at the Zambia agricultural and commercial
show in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Musimuko said that the department has just completed training
six officers to run intelligence unit which was created in
September last year to boost the fight against the scourge.
</P>
<P>
"You can't completely eradicate poaching but we have managed
to control it as can be seen from the growth in elephant
population. We have also stepped up control of human encroachment
in game management areas," Musimuko said.

<HEADLINE> Shift to Indirect Financial Macro Control Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A maturing market economy and a
rapidly-developing banking sector have combined to enable China's
central bank to shift from direct to indirect macro-financial
control.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that in recent years, the People's Bank of China
has been working to make such a switch.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions for such a shift have now become ripe, thanks
to the establishment of a market economy system, financial
development and an improving macro-economic control method," an
expert said.
</P>
<P>
Increases in the number of financial institutions and
instruments have brought down the proportion of loans by
specialized state-owned banks in the overall social credit scale,
the expert explained, adding that the proportion was down from 75
percent in 1993 to 62 percent in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's role in bill discounting and open market
operation in treasury bonds, coupled with the formation of a
unified national interbank money market and others, has made
indirect financial macro control a viable choice, experts say.
</P>
<P>
As specialized state-owned banks turn into commercial entities
and financial competition toughens, the commercial banks will
become more sensitive to the central bank's monetary policy
signals, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a modern enterprise system will also make
Chinese firms, the target of macro financial control, more
sensitive to the central bank's policy signals, they add.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Arrives in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu arrived here today for a one-day official visit to
Jordan, his first after taking office in June.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher said today that
Netanyahu's talks in Amman will be important both for the Middle
East peace process and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is interested in pushing forward the peace process and
resuming peace negotiations on all tracks as soon as possible, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The information minister added that many bilateral issues will
be discussed during the visit, especially Jordan's trade
cooperation with the West Bank and Israel and the water issue.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is expected to discuss with the Israeli prime
minister the outcome of talks he held with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad in Damascus Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No details have emerged from the five-hour talks in the Syrian
capital, because most of the discussions were held between the
two leaders behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that one of the key topics that King
Hussein and President Assad discussed was a so-called "Lebanon
First" option under which Israel is reportedly offering a
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The king told reporters upon his return home that he was not
carrying any message from President Assad to Netanyahu but he
stood ready to offer whatever help he could offer if asked to do
so in the cause of comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to local media and Israeli press reports, Netanyahu
outlined the "Lebanon First" option to the king during a secret
meeting in London 10 days ago, and asked the king to mediate with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
But Damascus, the main foreign power broker in Lebanon where
it maintains a force of 35,000 troops, publicly rejected the
option Saturday, describing the deal as "an attempt to sow
divisions between Syria and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian-Israeli front, Jordan will raise the issue
of an Israeli government decision last Friday to lift restriction
on building settlements in the West Bank and seek explanations
from Netanyahu, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral ties, Jordanian officials expected real
promises and tangible results from the summit meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
"Much ground has already been covered in advancing the
implementation of the provisions in the Jordanian-Israeli peace
treaty," said an official, quoted by today's English-language
daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
"We expect definite decisions to emerge during Mr. Netanyahu's
visit," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The official did not elaborate, but he was obviously referring
to the delay in fulfilling Israel's obligations to Jordan under
the October 1994 peace treaty, particularly in providing water to
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is also concerned about reports that the government of
Netanyahu might backtrack on an agreement on converting Aqaba
airport as a joint facility to serve both countries.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks, King Hussein and Netanyahu are expected
to discuss bureaucratic obstacles that Israel has placed in the
way of Jordan's trade with the Jewish State as well as the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Television over the weekend,
Netanyahu implicitly admitted that there were such hurdles but
said they need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Comments by Jordanian officials here indicated that they were
highly optimistic that significant progress could be made in all
the outstanding issues on a bilateral level during today's talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister has visited the Kingdom twice since
Jordan and Israel signed the peace treaty in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Exports to Japan Continue to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania should make more
efforts to increase the quantity of its exports to Japan and
improve its quality, a Japanese official said.
</P>
<P>
The Japan Export Trade Organizaton (JETRO) representative to
Tanzania, J. Katamiya said in a statement here recently
that Tanzania should also look afresh into its manufacturing
industry in order to balance its trade with Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to the JETRO statement made available to Xinhua
today, in the three years up to 1994, Tanzania's exports to
Japan grew at an annual rate of 20.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Tanzania's exports to Japan were worth 64.7 million
US Dollars, compared to 49.3 million US Dollars in 1994, while
Japan sold goods to Tanzania worth 107.7 million US Dollars
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Tanzania's exports to Japan
mainly consist of agricultural products like coffee, cloves and
sesame seeds. Other products included fish and beeswax.
</P>
<P>
Among them, coffee is the leading export crop to Japan,
fetching Tanzania 37.8 million US Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in coffee exports has been attributed to the rise
in beverage consumption and to price increases of coffee
beans as the frost affected the crop in Brazil, the biggest
coffee producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
The export of sesame seeds fetched 9.1 million US Dollars, a
116 percent increase from 1994 earnings of 4.3 million US
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The export of fish fillets earned Tanzania 7.7 million US
Dollars last year, which is an increase of 931.1 percent from
1994 earnings.
</P>
<P>
Other products exported to Japan include gemstones and cloves.
Last year, Tanzania fetched a total of 2.1 million US Dollars
from the export of gemstones.
</P>
<P>
The Sale of sisal hemp fetched 473,986 US Dollars making
Tanzania the second highest supplier of the product to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is the biggest supplier of beeswax to Japan covering
29.3 percent of the total beeswax imports into Japan.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Proposes Economic Strategy for Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has proposed to the
Bangladeshi government a four-step strategy to help it
re-establish a sound macroeconomic framework, including realistic
programs and flexible foreign exchange management.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was contained in the World Bank's recent report --
"Bangladesh: an Agenda for Action" -- which was published here
today.
</P>
<P>
The bank urged the Bangladeshi government to maintain a steady
increase in fiscal revenues and to keep the annual development
program in a realistic size and ensure the high quality of
projects.
</P>
<P>
The report said the government's monetary policy must strike a
right balance between containing inflation and not holding back
the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
It said that the government's management of the foreign
exchange rate must remain flexible and sensitive to the country's
international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank urged the government to refrain from the
temptation to re-establish ad hoc control in areas such as trade
and investment policies, where market-based approaches are already
in place.
</P>
<P>
The bank requested the Bangladeshi government to commit as soon
as possible to a three-year policy framework in coordination with
the bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ensure the
consistency and correct sequencing of the four steps.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Protests Israel over Lifting Ban on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today protested the Israeli
government's decision to lift ban on settlement construction,
the local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Arafat expressed his concern about the fate of future
peace process in light of Israel's decision to lift the freeze on
settlement activity in the Palestinian territories, Israel Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The local Hebrew newspapers reported that Arafat also hoped
that the Israeli forces would redeploy soon from the flashpoint
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
This is the first reaction from Arafat since the Israeli
Cabinet decided Friday to end a four-year freeze, imposed by the
previous Labor government, on construction of settlements.
Netanyahu described the move as a step to "correct the
discrimination against Jewish settlement" in the territories.
</P>
<P>
The decision has aroused grave concerns from the international
conmmunity, especially from the Arab world which warned against
the serious damage on the future peace process.
</P>
<P>
Members of the PNA discussed the Israeli government's decision
Friday hours after its announcement. PNA Member Saeb Erekat
warned that settlement expansion "is a de facto cancellation of
peace".
</P>
<P>
Israel said it had informed the U.S., Jordan and Egypt of its
plan on the settlement. But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
warned the peace process could be in danger if the settlement
construction plan was implemented.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to calm the anger at the decision on settlement, the
Israeli Foreign Ministry has drawn up a document aimed at
explaining to foreign governments the need to expand Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The ministry claimed the decision was made to meet the
increasing housing demand as a result of the natural growth of the
Jewish population in the territories. It also promised that the
new decision would not lead to new appropriation of Palestinian
lands.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has yet formalized a plan on the
question of pulling troops out from Hebron, though it has signaled
its willingness to honor the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo agreements, Israeli forces were to have
completed redeployment by the end of March. But Israel delayed
its pullout after the Islamic fundamentalist militants launched a
series of suicide bombing attacks that killed 58 people inside
Israel from late February to early March.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Bombard Israeli Position in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party of God, bombarded today a position
of Israeli forces in its self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon, causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, announced that its fighters attacked the Israeli
position located between the villages of Beit Yahoun and Barashit
with rocket-propelled grenades (RPG) this morning and "directly
hit the targets."
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that more than 10
RPGs fired by the Shiite Moslem guerrillas exploded inside the
Israeli position.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed that one Israeli soldier was wounded in
exchange of fire with Lebanese guerrillas in the eastern sector
of the buffer zone this morning.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the attack, the Israeli occupation forces
from their positions in the 15-kilometer-wide border strip opened
fire with mortar shells and heavy machine guns at Jibal Rafih in
Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, according to the security
sources.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Israeli soldiers have been killed in sporadic clashes
on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict since
 a U.S.-brokered cease-fire understanding between Lebanon and the
Jewish state last April, which ended a 16-day Israeli blitz in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a five-state cease-fire monitoring
committee on south Lebanon is to hold its first meeting in Cyprus
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut daily An-Nahar said this morning that the committee
is to meet for the first time after France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria
and the United States completed the nomination of their
representatives to the committee.
</P>
<P>
Their first meeting will be limited to discussions on the
group's regulations of work, its missions and the observers to be
sent to south Lebanon, according to the report.

and local news media across the country, including Xinhua News
Agency, "People's Daily," "China Daily" and China Central
Television.
</P>
<P>
The "May 4" Prize, named for the Youth Day celebration held
annually in China on that day, honors the year's outstanding
journalistic reporting that focuses on youth. This is the second
year the prize has been given.
</P>
<P>
Judges from the Central Committee of Communist Youth League of
China (CYLC), the All-China Journalists' Association (ACJA), the
Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, the Press and Publication Administration of
China, and major media received nearly 300 entries recommended by
48 local and national media representatives.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tanqiang, a contest judge, said at today's news conference
to announce the winners that the overall quality of the reports,
which were selected from across the country, was good.
</P>
<P>

young people and also illustrate China's reform and opening up
drive. He said that several of the reports would have a great
influence on the country's youth.
</P>
<P>
Liu Peng, secretary of the CYLC Central Committee's
secretariat, said that efforts to work for the betterment of
China's youth can be positively guided by the media, and in turn

<HEADLINE> Coffee Disease Outbreaks in C. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A coffee disease devastated
several plantations in central Uganda, a report reaching here
today said.
</P>
<P>
The deadly disease rampant at Kiboga, some 130 kilometers
northwest of here, is similar to the common armillaria#,but is
more destructive than it, Stiphen Mubiru, Kiboga agricultural
department officer, said.
</P>
<P>
The disease breaking out now at Kiboga causes the rotting of
the root system, degeneration of the plant, fading of color in
the leaves and wilting as well as eventual dying of the tree in
four to seven days.
</P>
<P>
Kiboga agricultural sector had advised farmers to uproot the
infected coffee trees, but the farmers refused.
</P>
<P>
Uprooting and burning of the infected coffee trees is the
only way to save the others, Mubiru said, adding that the
affected trees cannot be cured. Replanting is normally done after
a minimum of 24 months.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the number one foreign exchange earner in Uganda,
which is the second largest coffee exporter in Africa, just after
Cote d'Ivoire.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitoring Committee on S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A five-state committee in charge
of overseeing the cease-fire in south Lebanon, which was
established by an understanding reached between Lebanon and
Israel last April, is to meet in Cyprus Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut conservative daily An-Nahar said this morning that
the cease-fire monitoring committee is to meet for the first time
after France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States
completed the nomination of their representatives to the
committee.
</P>
<P>
France, Israel and the U.S. appointed both diplomatic and
military representatives while Syria and Lebanon refrained from
appointing diplomats on the grounds of the security nature of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department official, David Krinly, is to preside
at the committee meetings in accordance with an agreement between
Paris and Washington on a five-month rotation of the chairmanship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Their first meeting will be limited to discussions on the
group's regulations of work, its missions and the observers to be
sent to south Lebanon, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The April understanding was brokered by the United States
following a 16-day-long Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in which
more than 200 Lebanese, most of them civilians, were killed and
400 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Lebanese
Hezbollah, or Party of God, were banned from firing horrible
Katyusha rockets at the Jewish settlements at the Galilee
panhandle in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The understanding also prohibited the Israeli forces and
Hezbollah guerrillas from attacking from or at civilian areas in
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down On Phony Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- As Chinese Renminbi yuan enjoys
greater international prestige, criminal cases related to making,
selling and spending counterfeit versions of the currency have
increased.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police solved over 5,000 counterfeit money-related
cases in 1995, confiscating phony banknotes with a combined face
value of about 100 million Renminbi yuan, a rise of 31 percent
over the previous year, according to the information disclosed by
the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qing, section chief of the Department of Economic
Protection of the ministry, said that most of the fake money is
made overseas, especially in Taiwan, and transported to the
Chinese mainland through underground channels.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is scheduled to intensify its crackdown on phony
money deals in the southeastern coastal areas, southwestern border
areas and certain provinces in central China, where counterfeiting
is rampant, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress Standing Committee, China's top
legislature, adopted the Decision on Punishing Criminals
Disrupting Financial Order on June 30 last year, which stipulates
the penalties for selling, possessing and using phony bills, and
provides a better legal basis for the police to control the fake
money-related activities.
</P>
<P>
In light of worsening phony money crimes, the Ministry of
Public Security set up a special agency to help organize,
coordinate and direct the anti-counterfeiting effort across the
country, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also made surveys and investigations in
regions where counterfeiting crime occurs most, and has collected
considerable first-hand data that will aid police in their battle
against such crimes.
</P>
<P>
Counterfeiting reaches all areas of life, Chen said, so the
Ministry of Public Security has intensified cooperation with
departments of finance, industry and commerce, customs and
communications.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese police will also strengthen its
cooperation with Interpol and police organizations in the regions
of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to fight against counterfeiters, so
as to prevent phony money from being smuggled into the country.
</P>
<P>
A campaign that aims to teach citizens how to distinguish phony
bills from the real thing is expected to be implemented soon, Chen
said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Launch Further Offensives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
launched another major offensive against rebels of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), security sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources reported "slow but satisfactory" progress of the
new offensive, code-named Sathjaya (Certain Victory) II, nine days
after operation Sathjaya I during which the strategic town of
Parantha was recaptured.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels were putting up tough resistance with mortars,
rocket propelled grenades and small arms but the troops have been
advancing with no casualties so far, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The troops, backed by tanks, artillery and air cover, were
moving deeper into the rebel-controlled area in a bid to seize
Kilinochchi town. The rebels moved their operational headquarters
to the town in April after the military retook Jaffna city.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that during Sathjaya I, the LTTE lost 54
cadres while the military lost 16 men.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Net Income Up in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The per capita net income of
farmers in east China's Fujian Province soared to 1,239 yuan
(149.2 US dollars) in the first half of this year, a 6.4 percent
increase over 1995's January-June period.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Fujian is approaching its goal to help
farmers live a relatively comfortable life by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistical Bureau has set 16 norms to evaluate the
living standards of rural residents. They include the possession
of durable goods, life expectancy, living space and the number of
educated adults.
</P>
<P>
Increasing farmers' income was placed at the top of the
government's agenda. To achieve this, the Fujian government
stepped up investment in agriculture, raised the purchasing price
of grain, developed fruit and vegetable growing and aquatic
production and accelerated rural industry.
</P>
<P>
To abide by its policy of achieving common prosperity, the
province has increased government allocation for its 500,000
people with a per capita annual income of less than 750
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Children Grow Taller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese school children are on
average five to six centimeters taller than they were 10 years
ago thanks to improved diet and the eradication of a
growth-inhibiting disease, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
The youngsters' growth co-incides with the 10 years of economic
renovation and reform carried out in the country and, says the
report, is heartening news for a nation long consigned to the
bottom of the height league among southeast Asian countries due to
continual war and associated poverty.
</P>
<P>
This 10-year period is the first time growth in average height
among Vietnamese children has been recorded since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Nutrition, which carried out the
report, said the findings are encouraging for the Ministry of
Education and Training which has set a national adult average
height target of 165 cm for men and 160 cm for women, an increase
over the current averages of 160 cm for men and 152 cm for women.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the spurt in children's height include an
improved diet, at least in many urban areas, and most
significantly an eradication of xerophthalmia, a condition caused
by vitamin A deficiency and which can stunt growth.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in history, Vietnam has become
xerophthalmia free," said a doctor from the National Institute of
Nutrition. "The desire to be tall, strong and healthy is not only
an official concern, but also the people's wish," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined that Vietnamese should be taller
after years of war and associated poverty, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese, Syrian Presidents to Meet in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi is
to leave here this morning for Damascus to meet with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad, the second meeting between the two
leaders in 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources in Beirut said that Hrawi and
al-Assad will discuss the latest developments in the region and
the upcoming parliamentary elections in Lebanon, which is to start
on August 18.
</P>
<P>
The summit is to be followed by a visit to the Syrian capital
by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri where he will meet
Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam. Hariri is coming back
from a trip in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers noted that the consultations between
the Syrian and Lebanese leaders come amid intensive contacts
between regional leaders on the so-called "Lebanon First"
proposal put forward by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The proposal provides for an unilateral Israeli withdrawal
from the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon in exchange
for a disarmament of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party
of God, and a mechanism to guarantee the security on the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla
warfare against the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
the Lebanese leaders refused the "Lebanon First" proposal out
of a suspicion that the proposal was aimed at driving a wedge
between the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of the peace negotiations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
After a visit to Damascus Saturday, Jordanian King Hussein is
to hold a meeting today with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in
Amman.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein denied that he had been asked by the Syrian
president to convey a message to the Israeli prime minister, and
declined to make a comment on the "Lebanon First" proposal.
</P>
<P>
Another summit is reportedly to be held in Cairo in two days
between Syrian President al-Assad and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Zimbabwe's Textile Jobs Now Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zimbabwean textile
jobs are now safe after South Africa agreed to slash tariffs on
Zimbabwean textiles and clothing from up to 90 percent to no more
than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The daily Herald paper said today the textile and clothing
industry welcomes the concessionary agreement so much that it
will be translated into the amended Zimbabwe-South Africa
bilateral accord for implementation in early September.
</P>
<P>
The deal, struck at the weekend after years of protracted
negotiations, effectively reopens the South African market to
those Zimbabwean manufacturers who are able to compete on price,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Harare yesterday, Zimbabwe's Minister of
Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira described the weekend
agreement as a "breakthrough in our relations with South Africa".
</P>
<P>
Jonee Blanchfield from Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries
heaped praises on Shamuyarira, saying he had done a "sterling
job" for the Zambabwean clothing and textile industry.
</P>
<P>
She said the agreement will see new energy being put back into
the industry to enable it to return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
Some 31 Zimbabwean clothing firms have gone out of business
since January last year, leaving more than 3,000 people jobless.

COLOMBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to give relief to shrimp farmers to help them overcome
losses in the outbreak of the incurable "white spot" disease,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The relief, a total of 6.4 million U.S. dollars, will be
granted to over 870 shrimp farmers in an area of 6,000 acres, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
These shrimp farmers, making an annual income of 36.4 million
U.S. dollars, provide employment to 40,000 people.
</P>
<P>
As the disease is irremediable, affected farms have to be
dredged up and refilled with fresh water.
</P>
<P>
Some farms have already closed down because of high costs to
fight the disease, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that further relief is being considered in the form
of re-scheduling bank loans for the shrimp farmers and a
10-percent duty waiver on shrimp feed.

<HEADLINE> Nine Islands "Missing" From Jakarta's Tourist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- At least nine islands among the
the Thousand Islands, a popular tourist attraction in north
Jakarta, are now gone due to widespread disregard of the
environment and ecology, the Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Jakarta Governor Surjadi Soedirdja as saying
recently that the islands are gone because of constant fishing
using dynamites and lethal chemical substances, coral poaching,
mining activities, oil dumping and cutting of mangrove trees.
</P>
<P>
The cluster of islands, or the Thousand Islands in the north of
Jakarta, consists of 120 isles.
</P>
<P>
Soedirdja did not name the "missing islands."
</P>
<P>
To better preserve the Thousand Islands, one of Jakarta's
popular tourist destinations, the Jakarta municipality will
install among others a high-technology waste treatment system in
north Jakarta to prevent the area's waste from flowing to the sea
and affecting the islands, he said.
</P>
<P>
Soedirdja also called for more active conservation activities
in the islands concerned.

<HEADLINE> Ricoh Makes More Low-priced Digital Cameras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 5 (Xinhua)-- Japan's Ricoh Co. has increased the
monthly output of its new-version digital still cameras to 25,000
units, over 3.5 times more than the present output of 7,000,
according to Kyodo News Service here today.
</P>
<P>
Ricoh, one of the leading precision instrument makers in Japan,
entered the digital camera market in April 1995 with the DC-1
camera, which stores data on a 24-megabit flash memory chip. The
camera can transfer still, moving images and audio data onto
personal computers (PC). It can also be linked to a television set
to monitor still and moving scenes with sound.
</P>
<P>
As more and more people use PCs and the global PC communication
network, Internet, there is a growing demand for digital cameras
worldwide. To meet the demand and cut cost, Ricoh last month
launched the DC-2 with all features of the DC-1 except for the
functions of storing data on a memory chip. The DC-2 sells for
69,800 yen (640 U.S. dollars) per unit, only half the price of the
DC-1.
</P>
<P>
The company is making the 35-millimeter digital still cameras
at its manufacturing base in Taiwan but sells them in the Japanese
market. It plans to start the sale of the hi-tech cameras in the
United States in October, with a monthly sales target of 5,000
cameras.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Medicine to Target Global Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China will soon launch the
"Hongyang Project," a national program to accelerate the entry of
traditional Chinese medicine into the world market, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission and the State
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine are carrying out
research to determine working principles and appropriate actions,
the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The research will be carried out to enhance the quality of
traditional Chinese medicines and to create some best-brand
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The completed program will later be submitted to the State
Council for final approval.
</P>
<P>
Policy makers anticipate that at least two kinds of new
medicines developed from traditional Chinese medicines will be
officially registered in Western countries by the end of the
century. They also hope that traditional Chinese medical theory
will be accepted in these countries.
</P>
<P>
In the draft program, the State Science and Technology
Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese
Medicine suggest the central government allocate special funds or
make a loan to support the project.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a special office composed of officials and experts
from all related departments should be established to provide
guidance.
</P>
<P>
With fewer side-effects than many Western medicines and its
success rate in treating some chronic ailments like cancer,
cardiovascular disease and AIDS, traditional Chinese medicine has
attracted more and more foreign enthusiasts in recent years, said
the official who is now in charge of the "Hongyang Project"
research.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily" reported that China has established exchanges and
co-operative relations in the field with more than 30 countries
and regions worldwide. Each year, about 1 billion US dollars worth
of traditional Chinese medicine, mostly medicinal materials, is
exported to 130 countries and regions, mostly to Japan, and Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions.
</P>
<P>
Yet, due to differences between the theory of Western and
traditional Chinese medicines, the latter are not allowed to be
registered in some Western nations.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Opens Bill Re-discounting to Nearby Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, has become the first in
the country to open bill re-discounting to clients from other
cities.
</P>
<P>
Starting this month, Shanghai has opened bill re-discounting to
nine major cities in the Yangtze River Delta -- Nanjing, Wuhan,
Changsha, Chengdu, Nanchang, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Hefei and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
In the past, bill re-discounting in China was restricted to the
same administrative region.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the latest move indicates that Shanghai is
emerging as a financial center in the Yangtze River Delta and
also in China.
</P>
<P>
It will promote economic and financial cooperation between
Shanghai and the Yangtze River Delta, one of the most
economically-dynamic areas in China, observers say.
</P>
<P>
They also say that opening bill re-discounting to neighboring
areas will greatly speed up capital circulation and help provide
more funding for large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the value of bills discounted by banks in
Shanghai grew by a net 2.18 billion yuan (about 260 million US
dollars) in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Not to Renew Friendship Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad Sunday told the parliament that the new government will
not renew the existing Bangladesh-India friendship treaty to be
expired on March 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government of Awami League (AL) feels that there is no
necessity to renew the 25-year friendship treaty in view of the
prevailing regional and international political context, the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The contentious friendship treaty, signed by the then AL
government shortly after the independence of Bangladesh from
Pakistan in 1971, is described by the opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party as an "accord of slavery".
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister denied the accusation, saying that there
is nothing secret in the treaty and it was discussed in the then
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Samad Azad also said that the new government had taken a bold
initiative to resolve the water-sharing problem with India and
will be able to realize the "right share" of the Ganges water.
</P>
<P>
"It's an issue of national importance," he called upon all
political parties, including the opposition in parliament, to
extend cooperation in resolving the long-standing problem.

ROME, August 4 -- Weekend traffic accidents killed 24
holidaymakers on their way to beach and mountain destinations,
local media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who died were under 35 years old, reports said.

<P>
Police attributed the high death toll to a growing number of
holidaymakers eager for a few weeks of relaxation in popular
resorts as the peak summer holiday season began.
</P>

Some 130 traffic accidents were reported on highways between
Friday and Sunday as 20 million cars and trucks took to the roads,
leading to traffic jams and tailbacks of up to 10 kilometers in
some areas of southern Italy.

<HEADLINE> Incentives Urged to Lure Indonesia's Geothermal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Geothermal
Association has called on the government to provide tax incentives
for investors to build geothermal power plants to accelerate the
country's energy diversification program.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post today quoted Chairman of the association
Prijanto as saying that "we hope the government will provide tax
incentives to encourage investors to develop geothermal energy.
But it will be even better if the government can grant them tax
holidays."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been trying to diversify its commercial energy
away from oil which still dominates the country's energy sources.
</P>
<P>
Prijanto said that using geothermal energy to produce 1,000
megawatts (mw) of electricity can save about 300 million barrels
of oil.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, investors' main concern is the high
capital costs and the high risks in developing geothermal power
plants.
</P>
<P>
He said that until now only 309.5 mw of Indonesia's total
potential capacity of 19.600 mw of geothermal sources have been
developed by three geothermal power stations in Java.
</P>
<P>
According to him, four projects are being negotiated by
state-owned Pertamina oil company and state electricity company
with private investors.
</P>
<P>
"If all the projects start operating at their full capacity by
the end of 1999, the total capacity of geothermal power stations
will reach 1,500.5 megawatts," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's electricity demand grows at 12 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned electricity company, which has offered private
investors the chance to develop power stations under
build-operate-and-transfer schemes, plans to raise its generating
capacity from the current 13,129 mw to around 39,000 mw by 2004.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Denies Tapping of Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda Sunday told a delegation of senior Congress party leaders
that there was no element of truth in reports that their
telephones were being tapped and their homes were under
surveillance by intelligence agencies, the Hindustan Times said
today.
</P>
<P>
Stoutly denying the reports, Gowda assured the leaders,
including former minister of external affairs Pranab Mukherjee,
that he had checked up with his office and there was not truth in
such reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports which appeared in a local publication said that the
personal telephones of Congress party President P.V. Narasimha Rao
and other party leaders considered close to him were being tapped
by the intelligence agencies on the orders of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Gowda's meeting with the Congress party
delegation, Home Secretary K. Padmanabhaiah denied in a statement
the reports on phone tapping, calling such reports as a "total
fabrication."
</P>
<P>
He said there was no element of truth in the reports and "these
are mischievous and motivated."
</P>
<P>
The Congress party leaders said following the prime minister's
assurance, they had decided not to further press the matter.
</P>
<P>
They said "we have to go by the prime minister's word although
we are not fully satisfied."
</P>
<P>
Deve Gowda's prompt initiative in dealing with the issue of
surveillance and telephone tapping was believed to have helped
lower the temperature which was rising sharply over growing
tensions between the ruling United Front and the Congress party
which is supporting the government from the outside.

<HEADLINE> Manila Relaxes Local Borrowings by Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Central Bank has
decided to lift the ceiling on local borrowings by foreign
companies to allow them more leeway in obtaining funds from local
financial institutions starting January 1997, local reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Central Bank Gabriel Singson said in a
statement that the lifting of the borrowing ceiling will align
monetary policies with the deregulated financial environment and
the government's program to attract more foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government had formerly required foreign
companies to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio (d/e) of 70-30
percent or 60-40 percent, depending on their industry categories,
in determining the amount of loanable funds that these firms can
source from local banks and nonbanks.
</P>
<P>
This rule was meant to prevent foreign firms from crowding
local corporations out of the limited resources in the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
However, recent studies by the Central Bank indicated that
foreign companies are relying less than expected on local banks
for loans, which, monetary authorities said, justifies the easing
of the regulation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lifting of the ceiling on peso borrowings,
the government has also liberalized repatriation of investments
and remittance of profits or dividends, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' International Reserves Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' net international
reserves (NIR) surged by 52 percent to 8.4 billion U.S. dollars in
the first semester of 1996 from 5.5 billion U.S. dollars in the
same period last year, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank attributed the substantial growth
to more inflows than outflows in the country's banking system.
</P>
<P>
The NIR is composed of the Central Bank's assets which include
its gross international reserves and its reserve position with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) minus its short-term liabilities
and IMF drawdowns.
</P>
<P>
A continued uptrend of the NIR gives the Central Bank more
elbow room in managing surges in foreign exchange flows in the
country, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Central Bank said the high NIR level for the
first half of the year gives the country a greater capacity to pay
off its foreign loans and finance imports.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Philippines experienced a fall in NIR in the
first semester to roughly 5.9 billion U.S. dollars as
international investors pulled out from emerging markets due to
Mexico's currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> Manila, MNLF Resolve Stumbling Blocks to Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Muslim MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF) have reached
agreement in principle on two contentious issues hindering a final
peace pact, the local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was a major fruit of the "meeting of minds" between
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres and MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari in
Sulu, Mindanao, on July 31, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two stumbling blocks are to the creation of a regional
security force and the integration of MNLF regulars into the Armed
Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police
(PNP).
</P>
<P>
A few days before the July 31 meeting, the government had
already conceded to the MNLF's demand for the integration of 5,500
MNLF regulars into the AFP and another 2,000 Muslim rebels into
the PNP.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides also agreed in principle on the
creation of a special regional security force in the Autonomous
Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) by 1999, which was also attended
by members of the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC).
</P>
<P>
The consensus on the integration and regional security has
paved the way for the government and the MNLF to proceed to
discuss a final peace agreement in the Indonesian capital of
Jakarta in August, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
It also allows the two parties to finalize the creation of the
Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD),
the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta meeting is likely to be held in the third or fourth
week of August after the Senate concludes its inquiry into the
Mindanao peace process.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Stock Reaches 2.7 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's total rice stock has
reached 2.7 million tons, with 1.2 million tons of domestic rice
procurements, said an official of the state logistics agency
BULOG, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Semarang in Central Java on Sunday, BULOG's Deputy
Director for Supervision Irfansyah expressed optimism that the
agency will be able to achieve the procurement target of two
million tons for the current 1996-97 fiscal year, which ends next
March.
</P>
<P>
Irfansyah said Indonesia's current rice stock of 2.7 million
tons -- of which some 1.5 million tons came from imports -- is
enough to guarantee food security in the country before the
upcoming general elections in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this year, domestic procurement is expected to
reach 1.5 million tons. I am optimistic that this can be
achieved, especially with the start of the government's
one-million hectare rice field megaproject," Irfansyah said.
</P>
<P>
Under the megaproject, one million hectares of peat land in
central Kalimantan will be converted into agricultural land, most
of which will become rice fields.
</P>
<P>
BULOG, established in 1967, is charged with maintaining the
price stability of basic food commodities such as rice, sugar and
flour, through buffer stocking and market interventions.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, a major rice producer in the world, turned to
imports in late 1994 after unfavorable weather conditions hit
domestic harvests. The country first achieved self-sufficiency in
rice in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Indonesia produced 49 million tons of unhusked rice,
compared with 46.4 million tons in 1994 and 48.14 million tons in
1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Drug-related crime in Germany rose
82 percent in the first half of this year, as more addicts turn to
crime to pay for their habit, a German official said today.
</P>
<P>
An average of 14 crimes a day related to drugs took place in
the first six months of 1996, Eduard Lintner, commissioner of the
federal drugs bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The number of people dying from drug abuse rose 10 percent to
753 in the first half of this year and the number of heroin
addicts also rose 10 percent to 5,472, government statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Lintner said the high price of drugs has led many addicts to
ruin, and such people try every way they can to satisfy their
addiction, including turning to crime.
</P>
<P>
The German government and local authorities are now considering
changing the current policy on the control of drugs.
</P>
<P>
They have called on society, especially the mass media, schools
and families, to enhance their sense of social responsibility to
try to stem the growing tide of drug users, particularly among the
young.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Centennial Olympic Games
closed here Sunday night with the Olympic flag passed to Sydney,
the host city of the 2000 games, amid Australia's traditional
kangaroo dance.
</P>
<P>
The closing ceremony began with the marathon victory ceremony
as Mario V. Rana, a member of the International Olympic Committee,
presented the gold medal to Josia Thugwane of South Africa, winner
of the marathon race held Sunday morning to celebrate the
centennial of its birth.
</P>
<P>
In a tribute to all the athletes who participated in the Games,
local music groups as the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra and the
Morehouse College Glee Club performed rock music, when 3,500
performers, including roller-bladers, skate-boarders and cyclists,
displayed their skills before a packed 83,000-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
"I declare closed the Games of the 26th Olympiad, the
Centennial Games," said IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
"And, in accordance with our tradition, I call upon the youth of
the world to assemble four years from now at Sydney, Australia, to
celebrate with us the Games of the 27th Olympiad, the first Games
of the new Millennium."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch also asked the audience to join together in a moment
of silence to honor the victims of an explosion in the Centennial
Olympic Park that left two dead and 110 injured.
</P>
<P>
"While we celebrate the success of these Games, we have not
forgotten the tragic explosion of last week, nor have we forgotten
the victims," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell returned the 1920 Olympic flag to
Samaranch, who then handed it over to Sydney Mayor Frank Sartor,
before a colorful presentation staged by the Sydney Olympic
Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The presentation, featuring the kangaroo dance, flower girls,
spirit women and cockatoos, gave the world a taste of what is to
be expected four years later in Sydney.

The Olympic flame was extinguished amid the song, "The Flame,"
by American country singer Trisha Yearwood.

<HEADLINE> U.S.A. Beats Brazil to Win Olympic Women's Basketball Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States women's
basketball team brought home the gold medal by a brillent vicotry
of 111-87 in the final on the closing day of the Atlanta Olympic
Games here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil finished with the silver and the bronze medal went to
Australia, a 66-55 winner over Ukraine earlier.
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leslie scored a game high 29 points for the United States
who also grabbed a team high six rebounders. Ruthie Bolton and
Sheryl Swoopes added 15 and 16 for the United States respectively.
</P>
<P>
Brazil was led by Janeth Arcain with 24 points and Sooza sobeal
Marcari Oliva hit 19 and 11 respectively.
</P>
<P>
After tailing 1-0 in the first minute, the Americans jumped
ahead 3-1 on a three pointer by Bolton and never looked back on
the way to a 57-46 lead at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
The inspired Americans never slowed down their pace in the
second half and extented the leading margin to 21 points at 10:21
with 76-55.
</P>
<P>
Staley Dawn came from the bench with her magic dribbling skills
which turned the game into a showcase of no-look passes and
Americans fastbreaks. the American players outside the court
started to celebrate their victory when they were 92-62 ahead with
only 5:51 left on the clock.
</P>
<P>
Amerincan head coach Tara VanDerveer rested all her starters in
the final four minutes and let the Brazilians reduce the gap to 24
points.
</P>
<P>
VanDerveer thought it was her team's defense that held off the
attacking of the Brazilian team, which got 16 turnovers and
allowed the U.S. team 12 steals.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense was the key to win. Our defense was good and our
subs were good," said VanDerveer, the only female head coach among
the 12 women's teams.
</P>
<P>
The veteran-paced Brazilian team seemed to be outrun by their
younger rivals. World Championship MVP Hortencia, regarded as one
of the greatest women basketball players, was held to just 11
points in 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Even we lost, we shot the ball really well in the first half,"
said Brazilian head coach Miguel Angelo. "In the second half, we
had a difficult time getting back on defense and this hurt our
games."
</P>
<P>
"I got tired. Our team did what we could. We still scored 87
points," said Hortencia, the oldest women basketball player in
Atlanta at 37.

<HEADLINE> Court of Arbitration Reinstates Russian Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian athletes were
reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport Ruling (CAS) here
Sunday, and would retain their bronze medals stripped early by the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) for drugs.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, CAS reaffirmed its anti-doping fight and
strict liability for doping offenses, but granted Russian athletes
the benefit of the doubt because of insufficient scientific
evidence.
</P>
<P>
CAS Secretary General Jean-Philippe Rochat said his panel
accepted the appeal filed by swimmer Andrei Korneyev and wrestler
Zafar Guliyev on July 29 after being tested positive for
bromantan, and they would get their medals back.
</P>
<P>
Bromantan was a new substance which the IOC Medical Commission
characterized as a stimulant banned under the Medical Code.
</P>
<P>
The athletes appealed to CAS, arguing that the Russian
delegation used this drug to strengthen the athletes' immune
system, especially for a competition held in a hot and humid
climate, not to enhance performance.
</P>
<P>
In addition to hearing the parties, CAS appointed a neutral
scientific expert professor Holbrook of Mercer University,
Atlanta, who gave detailed evidence on the properties of
bromantan.
</P>
<P>
The expert concluded that from the scarce scientific literature
available, bromantan may well be a performance-enhancing
stimulant.  However, he could not rule out the possibility that
it is used for the sole purpose of strengthening the immune
system.
</P>
<P>
On this basis, the CAS panel decided that it was not proven
that bromantan is a stimulant to a standard sufficient to justify
a sanction as severe as the withdrawal of their medals from the
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, they granted the athletes the benefit of doubt.
</P>
<P>
However, the panel also urged the Russian Olympic Committee to
discontinue the use of bromantan by Russian athletes as long as
the doubts cast on its properties are not removed.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Centennial Olympic Games
concluded here Sunday to be remembered for sporting excellence as
well as the first terror attack since the 1972 Munich Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four world marks tumbled in the 16-day sports gala,
which was marred by undesirable transport and sports results
services and a bomb explosion that left two dead and 110 injured
in the Centennial Olympic Park which was hailed as a symbolism of
peace and unity.
</P>
<P>
Weightlifing was the biggest record smasher with 15 world
marks rewritten. Four world records were broken in swimming, two
in track and field, and one apiece in archery, cycling and
shooting.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Donoran Bailey smashed the men's 100 meters world
record with a time of 9.84 seconds, adding the Olympic title to
his world championship.
</P>
<P>
American sprinter Michael Johnson became the first man to
achieve the 200/400 meters double. He also sliced 0.34 seconds
off his own world record of 19.66 seconds in the 200 meters final.
</P>
<P>
The world sports map has changed in Atlanta as the United
States topped the medals table for the first time in the Olympics
neither boycotted by itself or the former Soviet Union since the
Americans came first overall in the 1964 Tokyo Games.
</P>
<P>
The host country collected 44 gold, 32 silver and 25 bronze
medals. Russia finished second in a 26-21-14 record.
</P>
<P>
No longer as strong as its eastern half in the Seoul Olympics,
nor as a united nation in Barcelona, Germany hang on to its third
spot in the medals standings with an unimpressive 20-18-27
collection.
</P>
<P>
China consolidated its status as the top Asian sports power by
coming fourth overall with 16 golds, 22 silvers and 12 bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Wang Junxia took Asia's first women's Olympic distance running
title from the 5,000 meters final, while table tennis player Deng
Yaping and diver Fu Mingxia both hit a gold double.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 teams struck gold in Atlanta, 16 more than in
Barcelona and 22 more than in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Hong Kong, Thailand, Ecuador, Burundi, Croatia and Costa
Rica ended their gold droughts in Atlanta, while Kazakhstan,
Belarus, Slovakia and Armenia opened their Olympic gold accounts
in their debut as independent nations.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The 495-strong Chinese contingent
have much to hail for and, to some extent, regret as the
Centennial Olympic Games came to a close here Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The silver-medal performance by their women's volleyballers
Saturday evening virtually wound up the Chinese medal hope for the
16-day competitions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese were ranked fourth overall here, with a medal haul
of 16 gold, 22 silver and 12 bronze to a medal tally of 50. In
Barcelona, they chalked up a medal credit of 16-22-16 for a total
of 54.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Games judo debutee Sun Fuming won China's first gold
medal at the Games when she overpowered Cuba's silver-medalist
from the Barcelona Games, Estela Rodriguez, in the women's
heavyweight class final.
</P>
<P>
"I had always regarded the gold as being set for me," she said
after the victory.
</P>
<P>
China's "mysterious deer", world champion Wang Junxia, won the
5,000 meters title and made her last effort when surpassed by
Portugese Fernanda Ribeiro 50 meters from the finish line in the
10,000 meters final. But The silver medal she won was praised
anyway by the media on hand.
</P>
<P>
"Wang won over the world with her smile," wrote an news agency
dispatch.
</P>
<P>
Ill-striken veteran shooter Wang Yifu defied a dizzy vision
during men's air pistol final and managed a silver medal on the
Games' opening day. Fainted right after the final shot, the
exhausted 36-year-old was taken as a hero of the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese' clean sweep of the table tennis titles once again
proved the depth and strength of the country in the swift sport.
And the victories of the team, trditionally built throught
collective efforts, were at once owed by the coaches and officials
to an all-round, well-schemed preparations.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of fructuated performance by her teammate and
pre-Games favorite Tan Shuping, world and Olympic plaform diving
champion Fu Mingxia made courageous effort in the women's
springboard final. Fu virtually took the gold medal of the event,
making her the first ever Olympic diving champion for both events
at the same Games since 1960.
</P>
<P>
As for the Chinese weight-lifters, unfavored food in the
Olympic Village did foil much of their pre-Games training. But
they managed to take two gold medals, which greatly encouraged the
whole team.
</P>
<P>
Secret for the victories? "Instant noodles," they jokingly
replied.
</P>
<P>
China's male swimmers made a breakthrough at Atlanta Games,
with Jiang Chengji and Zeng Qiliang becoming the country's first
ever finalists in men's events at any Olympic Games. They two
each broke the Asian records of their respective events twice, in
the heats and the final.
</P>
<P>
And the women's volleyballers, the silver-medalists at the
Atlanta Games, were given high appraisal for their recovery from a
disastrous failure in the past years. The team finished seventh
in Barcelona, eighth at the 1994 world championships and third at
last year's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping, the former ace striker and captain of the triumphant
Chinese national side during the 1980s, was thought to have played
a key role to pull the team together for what some Chinese media
described as a "rebirth".

<P>
But China's Olympic advance in Atlanta was not all plain
sailing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese swimmers, women in particular, had been tipped
generally as havinng an edge over others in many of the events.
But they bagged only one gold, three silver and two bronze medals,
a poor performance compared to the 4-5-0 record four years ago at
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
The sole triumph came in the women's 100 meters freestyle,
through the strength of its world champion and world record-holder
Le Jingyi.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most important victory for me as an Olympic gold
is the highest aspiration for any athlete," Le, China's ace
sprinter swimmer said.
</P>
<P>
Both women's butterfly world champion Liu Limin and China's
record-holding 4x100 meters freestyle relay squad failed in their
speciality events.
</P>
<P>
And world's top-ranked Chinese women Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan
even failed to make the final of the women's 400 meters individual
medley.
</P>
<P>
Poor timing of their peak forms for some swimmers, unfavorable
living conditions and mid-night fire alarms at their Olympic
Village dormitory, among others, have been blamed for their
unusually poor physical fitness even before the competitions
started.
</P>
<P>
Badminton is another sport where Chinese were favored to win
medals. But the competitions closed up with China, Indonesia and
Denmark each taking one gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Lack of moral and weak in mental fitness could explain some
Chinese players' under-par performance here. World number one
female player Ye Zhaoying and her male equivalent Dong Jung both
lost their second straight competitions this year, following their
lack-luster performance at the Thomas and Uber Cup events earlier
this year in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the prime goal of maintaining the fourth overall Olympic
Games ranking reached, officials of the Chinese delegation
expressed satisfaction and relief over their athletes today.
</P>
<P>
"We're happy that China has retained the position it took at
the last Olympic Games and scored progress in some sports and
events," said Yuan Weimin, Deputy Chief de Mission of the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"And the breakthrough scored in such influential sports as
swimming, athletics and women's volleyball are especially
encouraging," he said. "It's not just medals that count, it's the
team work and spirit of the athletes," he added.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Thailand
won their first-ever Olympic boxing gold medals on Sunday when the
boxing tournament ended.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan light heavyweight Vasilii Jirov, who was judged the
winner of the Val Barker Cup for the boxer with the best technique
during the tournament, claimed gold when he outpointed South
Korean Seung-Bae Lee 17-4.
</P>
<P>
Somluck Kamsing dedicated his gold medal -- Thailand's first --
to his king Brumiphol Adouldash on his golden jubilee year, after
getting an 8-5 points featherweight verdict over Bulgarian world
champion Serafim Todoro.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Vladimir Klichko ended Wolfgram's fairytale Olympics
with a 7-3 points decision in the super heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
Despite Duvergel's dramatic knockout, the Cubans finished the
leading team at the Olympics with four gold and three silver
medals.
</P>
<P>
However, David Reid's knockout punch of Cuban Alfredo Duvergel
salvaged American pride. An over the top right-hand from Reid with
35 seconds left in his light middleweight final earned the only US
gold medal of the competition, and avoided their first gold
drought since the 1948 London Olympics.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands defeated Italy
3-2 to take the gold medal of the Olympic men's volleyball
tournament Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, runners-up in both Olympics and world
championships, played up to their best form to beat the world
champions Italy 15-12, 9-15, 16-14, 9-15 and 17-16.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team, which finished fifth at Barcelona Olympics
four year ago, appeared nervous in the match and could not break
the tight blocking of the Dutch team.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team, which enjoyed an advantage of height and
strength over their Italian counterparts, had a very good start
and led all the way to take the first set.
</P>
<P>
The Italians played some real good volleyball in the second
set, out-spiking the Dutch team to win in 15-9.
</P>
<P>
But they lost the third set 14-16 to give their rivals a 2-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
Though the Italian again levelled the score at 2-2 after taking
the fourth set 15-9, they were almost exhausted after the long and
fierce competition.
</P>
<P>
The fifth set saw some dramatic changes as the Italian led
14-13 and seemed most likely to take the gold. But the Dutch team
turned the tide and scored three decisive points to win the set
and the match 17-16.
</P>
<P>
In the third place play-off held earlier on Sunday, Yugoslavia
beat Russia 3-1 to take the bronze medal.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of the Bosnian

with Yugoslavia should be established first of all in the
industries which used to cooperate in the past.
</P>

Muratovic told Radio Kragujevac in central Yugoslavia that

"The federation imports everything across its southern border.
It is aware that Yugoslav food processing industry is particularly
competitive compared to western-made products," Muratovic said,
adding that the federation wished to have access to the port of
Bar in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the present authorities throughout Bosnia --
both in the federation and in Republika Srpska -- were illegal and
that the forthcoming elections would pave the way for their
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The first post-war general elections will be held on September
14 which will vote the Bosnian presidency and leaders of both
entities in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Featherweight boxer Somluck
Kamsing beat Bulgarian world champion Serafim Todorov 8-5 Sunday
to win Thailand's first gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The Thai boxer led from the start and then floated for much of
the third round. The Thai boxer said later he would give his medal
to King Bhumibol Adulyadej who celebrates his 50th anniversary as
Thailand's monarch this year.
</P>
<P>
He led 2-1 after the first round and 5-2 after the second as
the Bulgarian, who beat the U.S. favorite Floyd Mayweather in the
semifinals, was frustrated by the Thai's nimble footwork.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has come close to boxing gold before, their most
recent in 1984 when light-welterweight Dhawee Umponmaha had to
settle for a silver medal.

<HEADLINE> Israel Orders Closure of Palestinian Legislator's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police today ordered a
Palestinian legislator to close his office in east Jerusalem,
saying he violated a ban on Palestinian official activity in the
self-claimed Jewish capital.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani issued the order by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Palestinian Council member
Abdel khader, demanding that he close the office at his home by
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the minister declined to elaborate on the measures to be
taken if the deadline misses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khader denounced Israel's action as "illegal,"
saying he was not a member of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA). He said that he would appeal against the order, because
the office provided him an opportunity to serve the voters who
elected him.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu today blasted the PNA for violating the bilateral
agreements preventing PNA's official activity in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian Authority has made a solemn commitment to
prvent the operation of any government activity in the Jewish
state, especially in the capital of the Jewish state...We are
witnessing the violation of that solemn commitment," he said in a
speech, referring to Khader's office.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem has been one of the major disputes
between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Israel has declared Jerusalem as the "eternal and indivisible
capital" of the Jewish state, denying any compromise on its
self-claimed sovereignty over the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA has insisted east Jerusalem should be the
capital of a future independent Palestinian state and urged
Israel to resolve the issue through the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel, under the previous dovish Labor-led government, started
the final-status talks with the PNA in early May, but the talks
soon hit a snag mainly due to hard-line Likud party leader
Benjamin Netanyahu won the Israeli May 29 elections.

<HEADLINE> Bailey, Johnson Burst into History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- With a bunch of athletic
superstars, the United States won the war of medals, but it is
Canada's Donovan Bailey and American Michael Johnson who rewrote
history through their fabulous feats in the Olympic athletics
competition.
</P>
<P>
After the nine days of thrills and surprises, the U.S.A. team,
which raked up 12 gold medals at the previous Games four years
ago, retained its world No. 1 status by taking 13 titles this
time, chalking up a 13-5-5 total in the 44-event sport.
</P>
<P>
Russia, first competing under its own banner in the Games
history, left way behind with a 3-6-1 collection, ahead of former
track giant Germany, 3-1-3.
</P>
<P>
The athletics competition saw 24 countries claim gold medals
and 45 nations write their names on the medal standing list. It is
the widest ever spread of medals in the Games history. The
previous figures were 18 and 35 respectively in Barcelona four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The most superb performance came from the the men's 200 meters
final, when Johnson, who bid to win an unprecedented double in the
men's 400m and 200m, shocked the world with a rocket-fast new
world record. The 28-year-old talent hit the tape in 19.32
seconds, shedding his own previous world record by 0.34 seconds.
With the 400m gold already in his pocket, Johnson completed his
double victory with a successful period.
</P>
<P>
The world also remebers another magnificent feat produced by
Bailey, Canadan world champion.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Jamaica-born-Canadian shocked the world like
what his compatriot Ben Johnson did in the 1988 Seoul Games,
incrediblelly improving his personal best to win the men's 100
meters in a world record smashing time of 9.84 seconds. But unlike
"big Ben", Bailey ran the eye-popping race clean, and proved that
his victory at the last year's world championships was not a
fluke.
</P>
<P>
Other superstars who performed brilliantly were Gail Devers of
the United States and Marie-Jose Perec of France. Each won two
golds as Johnson and Bailey did during the Games.
</P>
<P>
Devers, defending Olympic champion, beat Merlene Ottey of
Jamaica again with a photo finish in the women's 100 meters before
taking a 4x100m relay gold. The two had a dead-locked finish at
the 1993 world championships, and it was Devers who was announced
as the 100m winner.
</P>
<P>
Perec, who was mainly a 400m runner but shifted to try the 200
meters here, deprived Ottey of the chance to win the gold in the
half-lap final. The French sprinter, who had won the 400 meters
earlier, beat Ottey by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis, who had tarnished his name frequently in the past
three years, rose to do big again in the men's long jump, not only
winning his fourth straight Olympic long jump title, but also
becoming the joined fourth athlete who won nine Olympic golds in
history.
</P>
<P>
Also shining in the competition were Noureddine Morceli of
Algeria in the men's 1,500m, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia in the
men's 5,000m, Jan Zelezny of Czech Republic in the men's javelin,
Lars Riedel of Germany in the men's discus, Wang Junxia of China
in the women's 5,000m, Stefka Kostadinova of Bulgaria in the
women's high jump and Astrid Kumbernuss of Germany in the women's
shot put.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Zelezny, Riedel and Ghada Shouaa of Syria all retained
their Olympic titles successfully.
</P>
<P>
However, the competition also saw some big names suffer
disastrous defeats and the fall of these giants marked an end of
their legendary careers.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Joyner-Kersee of the United States, world record holder
who had dominated the women's heptathon in the past decade, was
hit by an injury again when she started her first multi-event
battle. The 34-year-old had to quit, just like what happened to
her at the previous Games.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Bubka of Ukraine, the world pole vault king who had beat
world records 35 times, also fell victim to an injury in Atlanta,
and had to pull out of the competition in dismay.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, 36, who had 17 Olympic and world championship medals
under her belt before the Games, again failed to gain an Olympic
gold. The eldest sprinter in the Games history wept saddly after
the 100m race, but the never-say-quit Jamaican is the only athlete
who won three medals here - two silvers from 100m and 200m and one
bronze from 4x100m relay.
</P>
<P>
Little-known athletes from small countries celebrated their
victories in many events. Jefferson Perez of Ecuador upset world
stars to win the first Olympic athletics gold in the men's
20-kilometer walk. It is the first Olympic title for Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Chioma Ajunwa of Nigeria upset world champion and Olympic
champion to win the women's long jump gold, adding another
giant-killing triumph for the third world countries as well as the
first Olympic gold for her country.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's unheralded marathoner Josia Thugwane beat a
world class field to win the last yet most gruelling event in the
athletics - the men's 42.195-kilometer race. It is also the first
Olympic title for his country.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the hot and humid weather, the level of the Olympic
athletics competition reached a new standard and the final results
have proved that the developing countries are catching up with the
traditional world powerhouses at a rapid pace.

<HEADLINE> Europe to Build its Own Global Positioning Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Unhappy with U.S. domination in the
world market of Global Positioning by Satellites System (GPS),
Europe is now planning to build its own version of GPS for aircraft,
ships, vehicles and even persons to decide their exact positions on
earth.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, the European Space Agency (ESA)
decided in late June with the European Commission and the European
Air Navigation Security Organization to launch by 1997 a satellite
navigation system tailered for civilian aviation, shipping and road
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The United States now has 24 "NavStar" satellites orbiting the
earth and making up a GPS that earns two billion U.S. dollars
annually. The NavStars were first built by Garmin, Trimble and
Magellan corporation at the orders of the Pentagon, which wanted to
use the system for "surgical strikes" against enemies.
</P>
<P>
When letting civilians use the GPS, the U.S. military has offered
only its interior technologies insufficient for professional
aviation, in order to avoid a "counter-blow" against U.S. troops by
enemies using the GPS.
</P>
<P>
ESA officials said that Europe does not plan to copy a NavStar,
but wants to improve the performance of such satellites by precising
their positioning capability to 5-10 meters. The project, baptized
"Egnos", is expected to cost 200 million U.S. dollars and enters
service for aircraft, ships and vehicles from 1997, said ESA
officials.
</P>
<P>
At the present world GPS market, a GPS receiver --which is as
small as two cigarette packs-- costs only 400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. President Bill Clinton announced in March that
civilians will be allowed to use the military part of GPS in near
future, it will take the U.S. military at least 10 years to build a
permanent system for shutting down GPS in some geographical parts of
the world that are at war, local media observed.
</P>
<P>
An ESA official said that one cannot rule out the possibility
that once a war breaks out, the United States will shut down the
whole GPS system. "The Egnos project is also a mock exam for Europe
to contribute to a world project of GPS," said Alain Pinglier,
coordinator of telecommunication programs of ESA.
</P>
<P>
However, Europe lacks a small satellite launcher to send GPS
satellites into the orbit, as the Ariane rocket caters only for big
satellites. This problem casts a shadow over the "Egnos", which is
described by local media as a gamble of Europe to enter the
lucrative and newly developing GPS market.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Beats Sweden to Win Men's Handball (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Croatia defeated Sweden 27-26 in
a clash between two European countries in the gold medal game of
men's handball tournament here today.
</P>
<P>
The victory brought the Croats their first Olympic gold at the
26th Olympic Games, which close this evening.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy. We wanted the gold from the first day and we
worked to win it," said Velimir Kljaic, head coach of the Croatian
team. "I am not surprised at all."
</P>
<P>
The Swedish opened the score, but missed several goals,
including a penalty shot, in the first minutes. The Croats scored
six consecutive goals to lead 7-6. The Swedes made a surge, but
were only able to cut their deficit to four goals. At the end of
the first half, the Croats scored another goal, finishing 16-11.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the Croats expanded their lead to 20-13 in
the first 10 minutes. But the Swedes made a late game surge to cut
their deficit to one goal with three minutes to go. The Croats
were within their striking distance.
</P>
<P>
In a tense atmosphere, the two teams traded goals. The Croats
scored a goal to lead 27-25 with 26 seconds left and the Swedes
returned a goal before the end, missing the gold medal by one
goal.
</P>
<P>
"During the whole game, we were the better competitor, leading
by five goals most of the game," Kljaic said. "Our victory was
supposed to be more convincing, but the Swedish goalkeeper at the
end of the game made great blocks, making it a closer game."
</P>
<P>
Han Hansson, team leader of the Swedish team, said, "I think we
lost the match in the first 10 minutes of the game. We scored one,
Croatia scored six."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today in the bronze medal game, Spain beat France 27-25
to win the third place in the men's handball tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the women's tournament, Denmark upset defending champion
South Korea Saturday to capture the gold medal. South Korea,
two-time Olympic champion, received the silver. Hungary took the
bronze after triumphing over Norway in the bronze medal game.
China was the fifth after defeating the United States and Germany.
