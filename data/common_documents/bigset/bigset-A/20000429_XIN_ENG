<HEADLINE> Jiang's Six-Nation Tour Successful, Says Chinese Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister
Ji Peiding said on Friday that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's six-
nation tour is successful and of great importance.
</P>
<P>
Jiang returned home Friday after ending his state visit to
Israel, Palestine, Turkey, Greece and South Africa, during which
he also met with Egyptian President Muhammed Hosni Mubarak in
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Jiang paid a state visit to Israel, Palestine, Turkey, Greece
and South Africa at the invitation of the leaders of the five
nations from April 12 to 27.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for a Chinese head of state to visit
Israel, Palestine, Greece and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ji said that Jiang's six-nation tour marks a significant
diplomatic move by China toward West Asia, southern Europe and
Africa in the new century.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Jiang reiterated China's peaceful and
independent foreign policy as well as China's views on the current
important international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the leaders of the six countries on the policy
and strategies of China's socialist modernization and reforms and
opening up.
</P>
<P>
Ji said the visit helped improve understanding, friendship and
cooperation between China and the six nations, with a series of
accords signed on the cooperation in economy, culture, education,
marine transportation and other fields.
</P>
<P>
He said China formed a new type of cooperative partnership with
Turkey by signing a joint communique. It also signed the Pretoria
Declaration on the Partnership between China and South Africa,
which marked a new stage of the development of the bilateral
relations as well as deepened ties between China and the
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the six nations agreed that Jiang's visit provides a
new impetus to the development of bilateral ties in a new era.
</P>
<P>
Ji said Jiang's visit is vital to the unity and cooperation
between China and the developing countries as the Chinese foreign
policy gives priority to strengthening the relations with the
developing nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the third time Jiang visited an African country after
his two previous visits to this continent in 1996 and 1999. The
visits show that China pays great importance to Sino-African
relations, Ji said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to South Africa, President Jiang lauded the
idea of "African renaissance" advocated by South African President
Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed China's sympathy and support for the strong
wishes of people of African countries for rejuvenation and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang put forward China's policy of developing relations with
African countries in the new era, stressing that China is willing
to, under the banner of South-South cooperation, deepen its
cooperation with African countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the 2000 Beijing ministerial conference
of the Sino-African Cooperative Forum, which is scheduled for
October, is a pioneering work in history of China's relationship
with Africa and in China's diplomatic history.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed China's hope to discuss with African countries
about how to promote Sino-African economic and trade relations to
a new high; how to promote the establishment of a fair and just
world order in an effort to safeguard the interests of the
developing countries, according to Ji.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has exchanged views on major international and regional
issues with leaders of the six countries during his tour, Ji said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that in the current world, the world peace could
not be safeguarded and common development could not be achieved
unless the five principles of peaceful co-existence, the
principles of the U.N. charter and other universally recognized
norms governing international relations are strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that internal issues of different countries should
be settled by governments and peoples of these countries
themselves and hegemonism and power politics should be opposed.
</P>
<P>
On ethnic and religious issues, Jiang pointed out that the
proper handling of these issues is of great significance to
maintaining world peace and stability because many hot issues are
related to ethnic and religious issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as the world is colorful, the diversities and
disparities among different nationalities, religions and
civilizations should be respected.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with their mutual relations, Jiang said, tolerance,
communication, dialogue and coexistence should be advocated while
discrimination, exclusion, confrontation and conflicts be opposed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit has improved the understanding of China's
domestic situation by leaders and peoples of the six countries, Ji
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Ji said President Jiang took every chance during his tour to
brief people on major achievements China has made during the years
after it adopted the policy of reform and opening up to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has also briefed them on the blueprint of China's trans-
century development and the opening up of the western part of
China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also reiterated China's stances on issues related to
Taiwan and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the six countries spoke highly of China's
achievements in sticking to the policies of reform and opening up,
maintaining world peace and stability, developing economy and
national reunification.
</P>
<P>
They also lauded China's moves to open up its own way of
development according to its own situation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit has not only promoted the development of the new
century-oriented friendly relations between China and the six
countries, but also expanded China's international influence, Ji
said.
</P>
<P>
The visit will produce deep impact on the establishment of a
new international political and economic order, the promotion of
the lofty cause of human peace and development, he added.

<HEADLINE> IOC, WTO to Strengthen Links Between Sport and Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) and the World Tourism Organization (WTO) have
pledged to strengthen links between sport and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed on April 27 in Barcelona, Spain
between IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, WTO Secretary
General Francesco Frangialli, President of the Autonomous Region
of Catalunya Jordi Pujol and Barcelona Deputy Mayor Jordi
Portabella, the first World Conference on Sport and Tourism will
be held on February 22-23, 2001 in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
In a press release on Friday, the IOC said that the objectives
of the conference are to draw attention to the close links that
exist between sport and tourism and their mutually beneficial
impact on society, in terms of sustainable economic development
and the promotion of peace and human understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic Games and sport competitions at world and
continental levels generate development projects and significant
revenues for the countries and cities which are hosting them",
said the IOC President.
</P>
<P>
"The movement of athletes and spectators from countries to
countries around the globe also open new horizons of learning the
civilization and culture of different communities and promote
human understandings," he added.
</P>
<P>
The program of the World Conference on Sport and Tourism will
include speakers from the organizers of past and future Olympic
Games to tourism ministers, leaders of international Sport
Federations, broadcasters and tourism promotion experts.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that mega-sporting event such as the Olympic Games
generate a huge amount of travel and help build the image of the
host city and country so that further tourism is encouraged," said
WTO Secretary General Francesco Frangialli.
</P>
<P>
The World Tourism Organization is carrying out new research for
this conference that will attempt to quantify the relationship
between mega-sporting events and tourism and to demonstrate how
they combine to stimulate development.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be structured around four main theme areas:
Sport and Tourism in the Economy; The Business of Sport and
Tourism; Human Values fostered by Sport and Tourism; and Marketing
and Promotion of Sport and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
In addition to featuring the Olympic experiences of Barcelona,
it will include the examples of other Olympic cities including
Sydney, host of this year's Olympic Games. The tourism potential
of other sporting events such as the soccer World Cup, golf and
tennis competitions will also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 participants from all over the world are expected to
take part in the conference.

<HEADLINE> Reformists Calls for Clarification of Tehran Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian reformist coalition "the
May 23 Front" on Saturday urged the conservative election watchdog
Guardians Council to clarify the result of Tehran constituency in
the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The coalition's spokesman Behzad Nabavi said that the fate of
Tehran polls is still unclear and the Guardians Council should
announced the results of vote-recounting as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of reporters, Nabavi rejected possible vote-
rigging in the constituency, the biggest and most important one
with 30 seats in the 290-member Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
"The matter of vote-rigging in Tehran is out of the question,
because representatives of the Interior Ministry and the Guardians
Council were monitoring the elections while the votes were being
cast, and they were also present during vote counting," he said,
quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Nabavi said that in case the results of Tehran polls are
annulled, it would be an unprecedented action since Tehran has not
experienced nullification of elections both before and after the
1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council has nullified the results in 12
constituencies, preventing nine reformists from entering the Majlis
and forcing others to the runoff to be held on May 5.
</P>
<P>
It claimed on Tuesday that serious errors had been found in the
vote counting in Tehran constituency following the third recount
last week. The previous results showed that the reformist allied
with President Mohammad Khatami had won 29 out of a total 30 seats
in the Iranian capital.
</P>
<P>
The reformist spokesman, who is believed to be one of the
reformist candidates for the future Majlis Speaker, also rejected
as rumor that the reformist camp has made a compromise with the
Guardians Council to keep mum on the closure of the pro-reform
dailies in return for confirmation of Tehran election results.
</P>
<P>
The reformist camp had protested the closure of the dailies in
statements already released, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the recent week, the conservative judiciary shut down almost
all the major reformist papers, which played an important role in
the reformists' sweeping success in the first round parliamentary
polls in February.
</P>
<P>
The conservative move was seen as aimed at silencing the
victorious reformists voice in the runoff campaign kicked off on
Thursday to decided the remaining 66 seats in 52 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Nabavi said that the reformist camp has actively started
election campaign to win those seats in the run-off despite the
closures.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian state minister heading
a delegation arrived in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Saturday
evening for a visit to promote trade ties between Egypt and Iraq,
the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Mukhtar Khatab, Egyptian state minister for
public business sector, is expected to meet Iraqi Trade Minister
Mohammad Mehdi Salah and other Iraqi officials on ways to develop
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade cooperation between the two countries has been greatly
expanded in the last few years, said Khatab in remarks.

<P>
He said he will also participate in the inauguration ceremony of
the Egyptian Products Fair which starts here from Sunday and will
last for one week.

Trade volume between Iraq and Egypt, within the framework of the
United Nations oil-for-food program, has been steadily increasing

TEHRAN -- Iran's hard-line judiciary on Saturday closed down
another reformist daily Jebhe (Front), bringing to 17 the number of
publications banned this week.
</P>
<P>
The state-run radio quoted an informed source as saying that the
daily was ordered to suspend its publication by the branch 1410 of
the public court, amid a stepped-up crackdown by the powerful
conservatives on the reformist allies of President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The conservative move of banning 13 dailies and 4 periodicals
within a week left the reformist camp without a voice for the
second round of the parliamentary elections on May 5. The campaign
for the runoff started on Thursday in 52 constituencies to run for
66 seats. (Iran-Daily-Closed)

<HEADLINE> UK Growth Slowdown Reduces Pressure On Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The UK economy slowed sharply in
the first quarter of the year as the manufacturing recovery
collapsed under the weight of the pound.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the
first quarter of the year compared with 0.8 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1999, according to the latest figures released by the
Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the slowdown was driven by a fall in industrial
production and manufacturing output. Growth in the services sector
fell slightly owing to a decline in output of the computing sector.
</P>
<P>
The figures surprised the City, which had forecast a slowdown
to 0.6 percent. It forced some economists to change prediction of
the outcome of the meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee next week.
</P>
<P>
The British economy has now grown for 31 quarters in a row,
since the end of the recession in the second quarter of 1992.
Since then, GDP has risen 24 percent in total.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Policy Committee has raised interest rates from 5
percent to 6 percent in four stages since last summer.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in growth to below its long-run trend level, and
this week's rise in the value of the pound to DM3.40, increase the
pressure on the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Most forecasters had been expecting that interest rates would
rise next week, because of fears that the growth of domestic
demand was still unsustainably strong. But many now suspect that
the pause in rate rises will continue for another month.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Loynes, of HSBC Economics, said: "The GDP numbers
place a clear downside risk to consensus growth forecasts of 3
percent plus this year and, coupled with the strength of the pound
and the weakness of retail price inflation, will make it very
difficult for the MPC to justify an interest rate hike next week."

<HEADLINE> Violence Reduces Brazilian Men's Life Expectancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1999 Social Indexes Synthesis shows that the increase in
the number of violent deaths caused by homicides, suicides and
traffic accidents raised considerably the mortality indexes in
children, adolescents and young adults in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation, around two thirds of the
deaths of Brazilians aged 15 to 19 were caused by external causes
in 1998, meaning that they were not natural.
</P>
<P>
The South, Southeast and Center-West regions presented the
biggest incidences of violent deaths. The 49.3 percent of the
total decease in the Center-West region in the group of children
aged five to nine are related to violent causes, says the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The states of Roraima and Mato Grosso do Sul have the highest
rates of children killed by violence, 54.5 percent and 52 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The study underscores, however, that there was a marked
increase in the life expectancy of the Brazilian population, which
went from 62 years in 1980 to 68.1 years in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Population Growth Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The IBGE 1999 Social Indexes Synthesis published Saturday by
the local press said that the 1998 demographic growth rate was 1.3
percent per year, practically the same as in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The study foresees that the population growth index will be
reduced to 1.1 percent per annum in 2010 and 0.8 percent in 2020.
</P>
<P>
The fertility rate diminished, in general terms, to 2.4
children per woman, against almost 6 children registered in the
decades of 1960 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
The state with the lowest rate in 1998 was Rio de Janeiro, with
1.98 children per woman.
</P>
<P>
The investigation results show that the country is getting
older, because its senior population, estimated at 13.2 million (7.
8 percent) in 2000, will grow to 30 million in 2025.
</P>
<P>
Currently the largest Latin American country has a population

<HEADLINE> Cuba Cancels Application to Enter ACP Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque has told his counterparts of the 71 Africa, Caribbean,
and Pacific (ACP) countries, of the withdrawal of its application
to enter the new Agreement of Association between those countries
and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The decision is based, according to the letter published
Saturday in the Granma newspaper, on the European Union support to
the United States conspiration against Cuba in the Geneva Human
Rights Commission and on the hostility shown by some of its
members to the admission of the island in the ACP-EU new
Convention.
</P>
<P>
The EU would try to condition the admission of Cuba to the ACP-
EU Association Agreement to the realization of political, economic,
and social changes in the island, says the letter.
</P>
<P>
"This is a frank intervention in the internal affairs of Cuba
and an attempt to pressure this country," says the letter.
</P>
<P>
It says that the European attitude is unacceptable for Cuba
because of its interventionist and discriminatory character, and
it is a proof that the EU cannot, because of the United States
pressure, articulate an independent policy in relation to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
An example of the duplicity and the weakness of the European
policy is the understanding void of ethics or principles signed
between the EU and the United States in relation to the Helms-
Burton law, noted the Cuban foreign minister in his letter.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has attended as an observer for almost two years the
negotiations between the ACP Group and the European Union for a
new agreement in Lome.

ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's foreign currency
reserve has shown a remarkable growth since 1991 because of market
liberalization, Governor General Tekle-Wold Atnafu of the National
Bank said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign reserve has increased by 10 folds over
the last seven years following the launching of the new economic
policy, Tekle-Wold told a news briefing.

<P>
Instead of giving specific number of foreign currency Ethiopia
has reserved, the bank governor said that the foreign recurrency,
which could last only nine days in 1990, has now increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the stabilization of foreign exchange rate, the gap
between the country's legal and black market exchange rates has
been narrowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. dollar exchanges for about 8.12 birr in

<HEADLINE> Italy Airlifts Food to Help Drought-hit Somali State, Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy has begun airlifting
food valued at 250,000 U.S. dollars to assist the drought-affected
people in Somali State of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release jointly issued by the Italian
Embassy to Ethiopia and the United Nations World Food Program
(WFP) Saturday, the first flight of CSB ( a supplementary food
consisting of a corn-soya blend) arrived in Gode, some 600
kilometers southeast of Addis Ababa, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be followed by six additional aircrafts in the coming
four days, the release said, noting that the total amount of the
donation is 100 metric tons and is given to the WFP for
distribution.
</P>
<P>
The food aid is targeted at the most vulnerable of the people
of Somali State especially under five and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
CSB is a pre-mixed, pre-cooked blend of corn and soya bean,
sugar, salt, vitamins and minerals.
</P>
<P>
The latest contribution follows the agreement signed last week
by the Italian embassy and the federal Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission (DPPC) for the provision of food aid in
the form of wheat, valued at 1.5 million U.S. dollars, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
and the Belgium Medicines Sans Frontiers said they are currently
distributing emergency food aid, clothes and medicines for drought
victims in Gode areas of Somali State.
</P>
<P>
Gode is believed to be one of the most drought-affected regions
in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to Abubeker Abdi, head of the Disaster Prevention,
Labour and Social Affairs Bureau of Somali State, the two
organizations have been airlifting relief aid from Nairobi, Kenya,
and Brussels, Belgium, since last week.
</P>
<P>
Besides, blankets, plastic shelters and other relief items are
also being transported, he said.

SANAA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Public Health Ministry
received on Saturday 210,000 U.S. dollars worth of 15 automobiles,
15 computers, 20 facsimiles, 40 projectors as the aid of the World
Health Organization (WHO) to the health sector in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Following the delivery ceremony, Yemeni Health Minister Abdullah
Abdul-Walli spoke highly of continued WHO assistance to his country
specially in pediatrics, according to Yemeni News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The package would be distributed to the health affairs bureaus
nationwide to help fight epidemics, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said newly-found cases of polio in Yemen dropped
from 2,500 in 1992 to less than 20 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Those 20 cases were proved to be free from the wild polio virus
which leads to total paralysis, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that such progress would rank Yemen among the
wild-polio-virus-free countries, adding that all health monitoring
bureaus nationwide are asked to conduct regular check-ups to
discover the acute infantile poliomyelitis cases in early stages
and prevent their spread.
</P>
<P>
WHO representative in Sanaa, Hashim Zein, said the automobiles
and the sets would also help connect the various health bureaus
around Yemen with the headquarters in Sanaa and hence provide up-
to-date data.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Increase Oil Production and Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad
Rashid said on Saturday that Iraq plans to increase its current oil
production to about 3.5 million barrels per day, the level before
the United Nations sanctions started in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
Rashid said that the oil ministry will finish in the next few days
a program to raise its oil production as well export.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is expected to export oil valued at 8.5 billion U.S.
dollars during the current phase of the U.N. oil-for-food program,
said the oil minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. humanitarian program, now in its seventh phase
running from last December to mid-May, Iraq is allowed to export
limited amount of oil and use part of the revenues, under U.N.
supervision, to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods for
its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Rashid accused the delegates of the United States and Britain at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of deliberately putting on hold
contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to import spare parts
and equipment for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.N. Sanctions Committee only approved contracts
worth 250 million dollars for Iraq to import oil spare parts,
putting on hold contracts worth 500 million dollars, according to
Rashid.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has adopted a resolution to allow Iraq
to draw 600 million dollars from its revenues in six months to
import spare parts and equipment for its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Rashid has confirmed earlier this month that Iraq would increase
its oil production, which now stands at around 2 million barrels
per day.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Able to Get More Food Aid From WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has sufficient stocks to provide emergency food aid
to the victims of flooding in southern and central Mozambique
until mid June, according to a report by the Maputo daily
"Notocias" Saturday.
</P>
<P>
WFP officials told the newspaper that they expected more food
to arrive in May and early June, enabling the relief operation to
feed 650,000 people until September.
</P>
<P>
Many of those who require food aid are in isolated areas that
still cannot be reached by road, and therefore require airlifts.
</P>
<P>
The number of helicopters and light aircrafts available for
this work has dropped as of Saturday from 24 to just eight, five
of which are based in Maputo, and the other three in Beira city,
central of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
According to Silvano Langa, director of the National Disasters
Management Institute (INGC), the factors behind the reduction in
the number of aircrafts include the sheer exhaustion of the crews
involved for weeks in high risk operations, and shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
In total, he said, the aircrafts have put in 8,000 hours of
flying time, at an overall cost of 25 million U.S. dollars. To
this should be added a million U.S. dollars made available by the
Mozambican government for fuel.
</P>
<P>
Langa said: "We are talking of figures in the order of 3,000
dollars an hour". Figures like these, he added, showed why it is
crucial to reopen the roads that have been damaged by the floods.
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the rainy season, and with roads drying out,
we will be able to use trucks we have requested from South Africa
to reach areas that are still difficult", Langa said.

<P>
HARARE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
(ZCTU) Saturday announced that traditional workers' day
commemoration rallies will not be held this year in the country to
avoid possible politically- motivated violence.
</P>
<P>
This year's May Day falls on Monday and Zimbabwean workers, who
had over the past 20 years been converging at rallies addressed by
labor leaders, will for the first time spend the day at home.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Acting ZCTU
Secretary-General Isidore Zindoga said the country lacked
political tolerance which had rocked the communities resulting in
rampant violations.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The ZCTU General Council unanimously decided that May
Day rallies, which were due on Monday be called off and to direct
all workers to stay at home with their families and to think
deeply and pray for peace, progress and lasting solution to our
current problems."
</P>
<P>
He said the ZCTU demanded that the Zimbabwean government take
its responsibilities fully to guarantee peace and security to all
the people by upholding the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Should violence persist, he said, the ZCTU General Council
reserved its right to decide on appropriate course of action.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has asked the U.S.
business community to make use of the friendly and conductive
investment climate in the country and invest in various economic
sectors, according to sources reached here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete said that Tanzania is keen for a trade
partnership with the U.S. while speaking at a trade and investment
forum co-organized by Tanzania and U.S. in London, Britain, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete told the U.S. entrepreneurs attending the event that
Tanzania has done much to create an enabling environment for local
and international investors, saying the country would do more to
create more incentives.
</P>
<P>
"We have investment incentive regimes that are internationally
competitive. Therefore, you have everything to gain if you invest
and do business in Tanzania," said Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
He cited the incentives offered by the Tanzanian government as
tax concessions, including import duties, corporate taxes and
capital allowances.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, there could still be red tape in
facilitating investments, but the government under President
Benjamin Mkapa is seriously addressing bureaucracy with a view to
surmounting it.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian official figures show the U.S. investments in
Tanzania currently range between 15 million to 20 million U.S.
dollars a year. Investment sectors include tourism, manufacturing,
construction, transport, petroleum, fishing and agriculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
MUSCAT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The second advisory summit of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) concluded here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Following the one-day summit, chaired by Omani Sultan Qabus Bin
Said, GCC Secretary General Sheikh Jamil Al-Hujailan hailed the
summit as another evidence of the GCC leaders' keenness on
continued consultations so as to meet the expectations of their
people.
</P>
<P>
He said he read out the report of findings prepared by the GCC
tripartite committee over the land dispute between the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed last July and groups foreign ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, aims to help solve the dispute
between the UAE and Iran over three Gulf islands, Abu Musa and
Greater and Lesser Tunbs, now under Iranian control but claimed
also by the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders asked the committee to continue its efforts.
</P>
<P>
They expressed hope for a positive Iranian response over the
issue and stressed their interests in closer ties with Tehran based
on mutual trust, mutual respect and benefit, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs and good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed a Bahraini proposal on stronger inter-GCC
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders of the six-nation bloc expressed
satisfaction with the ties between Qatar and Bahrain following the
reciprocal visits by their emirs and talks on speedier cooperation
and closer relations.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain have been at odds over some sea and land
territories. They have handed over the dispute to the International
Court of Justice for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Al-Hujailan briefed the participants on most important
topics handled by the bloc since its 20th summit in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia late last November, including unified tariffs and a single
power grid, as well as the negotiations on a free trade zone with
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Kuwait Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-
Ahmad Al-Sabah, Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa,
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Emirate in
the UAE, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.

CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Saturday that he and his Syrian and Saudi counterparts
would meet in Damascus within the next two weeks to discuss Arab-
Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Fixing a date is underway and the meeting could take place

</P>
<P>
Moussa said his meeting with them would be "very important" as
it would tackle the Middle East peace process on all tracks and
discuss the coordination of Arab positions on the process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli proposals to postpone negotiations on the
questions of Jerusalem and refugees, the Egyptian minister said the
Palestinians "have every right to reject the idea."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli idea "would serve neither the Palestinian track, nor
the Mideast peace process, nor the negotiating process itself, nor
the goal of establishing a definitive peace," Moussa said.

HARARE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Minister of Home
Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa Saturday welcomed an agreement that white
commercial farmers and the country's liberation war veterans had

exercise to proceed in peace.

The minister told the Zimbabwe News Agency that Chairman of the

However, this did not suggest that the police had not been

veterans and landless villagers began in February, more than

"Most of these cases have been minor skirmishes that have been

investigated and where prosecution is necessary, the police will
do so,"he said.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you there is no case that will be covered up. Where
 necessary arrests will be made and people brought before the
courts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major cases include the killing of the two white farmers of
David Stevens in Macheke and Martin Olds in Nyamandlovu where
arrests have not yet been made.
</P>
<P>
"But as you know, there has been an arrest concerning the
killing of a policeman in Marondera and in a number of other
similar cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said people should understand the difference between
attending to unlawful acts of violence and being asked to drive
out politically- motivated demonstrators in the farms.
</P>
<P>
"This is a political protest that should be solved as such. We
have been calling on the war veterans not to engage in violence
and what they did with the farmers is what we have always wanted,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The white commercial farmers' union and the war veterans'
association agreed to let the war veterans and villagers remain
occupying more than 1, 000 white farms they have invaded, purely
as a demonstration to force the government to equitably distribute
fertile land.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans would not interfere with the farmers' work nor
temper with their property and staff.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the farmers promised to leave the war veterans alone
and both parties will keep dialogue open and work with the
government to ensure the success of a national land redistribution
program expected to be implement from mid May.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Scheme for Nigerian Journalists Under Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ)
has opened discussions with officials of the National Insurance
Corporation of Nigeria for the introduction of a national
insurance scheme for journalists in the country, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President of the NUJ Smart Adeyemi, who was in Umuahia, an
eastern city of the West African country, for a regional meeting
said that the scheme would kick off soon with a national
"identification and registration'' aimed at the ascertainment of
who is the genuine members of the profession.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a registration exercise, which would provide
a platform for further negotiations for the actualization of a
better welfare package for journalists, was imperative to weed
the profession of fakes and charlatans.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the problems which had bedeviled the profession
in Nigeria, were "all interwoven and inter-locking'' and needed to
be addressed one after the other, beginning with the re-definition
of who the real journalist is in the country.
</P>
<P>
Adeyemi expressed the determination of the union to enthrone a
genuine and true press freedom in the country, which he noted, had
been tempered with "by the prevailing poverty and corruption
syndrome in the county.''
</P>
<P>
"Until these two cankerworms are completely eradicated in the
country and the journalists well taken care of, such that they
will be proud and compete favorably in the comity of other
professionals," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Gets Politicians' Support on KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The trial of former Khmer
Rouge leaders must not damage the independence and sovereignty of
the nation, letters broadcast by state television TVK Saturday
evening stressed.
</P>
<P>
The letters, signed by some senators and parliamentarians, as
well as the General Secretariat of the National Police, Cambodian
Royal Armed Forces and the Phnom Penh municipality, said that they
support the stance stated by Prime Minister Hun Sen on the trial
of Khmer Rouge leaders in his letter to U.N. secretary-general
Kofi Annan on April 27.
</P>
<P>
"The trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders must comply with
Cambodia's Constitution drawn up in 1993 and respect the nation's
independence and sovereignty," they said.
</P>
<P>
The letters appealed to resolve the issue of the trial of the
Khmer Rouge in a right and proper way. "Otherwise," they pointed
out, "it will reignite the war in the country."
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Kofi Annan, dated Thursday, Hun Sen stated
that the Constitution of Cambodia clearly stipulates the
separation of powers between the executive, legislative and
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
"The request for the Royal Government of Cambodia to sign an
agreement with the United Nations right now will be tantamount to
putting pressure on the legislature and may lead to negative
reaction from the latter. This will not be acceptable to us," said
Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the supporting letters emphasized, "though we
should uphold justice to those victims, we must also maintain the
peace, stability and the unity of the nation for the sake of the
development of the country."
</P>
<P>
The support came shortly after U.S. senator John Kerry ended
his U.N.-requested mission to broke a compromise and left here
with Prime Minister Hun Sen accepting the U.N. proposal on
resolving the indictment disputes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Senate Poll Over, More Elections Expected  by Yang Qingchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's senatorial by-election
or the second round senatorial poll ended as scheduled Saturday,
with signs hinting that more rounds of by-elections are to come.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission, the supervisory body on Thai political
elections, said after the ballot was closed that the official
results of the poll will be announced within one week. The by-
election is to fill in 78 vacant seats of the 200-seat Senate,
after the Election Commission suspended the same number of winners
of the March 4 election.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission also vowed to stick to its policy of
holding the Senate elections "as many times as it takes" to ensure
a clean outcome, hinting at the strong possibility of another
round poll after the Saturday's by-election.
</P>
<P>
In view of the rising number of complaints about electoral
violations in the Saturday's election, Election Commissioner
Gothom Arya said, "I think there will be a third round of
elections -- but I hope there won't be a fourth."
</P>
<P>
There have been over 200 claims of election violation cases
since the Saturday's poll started at 8 o'clock local time in 35
provinces, according to midday news reports.
</P>
<P>
Latest news reports about the Saturday's election have pointed
to claims of indirect vote buying and irregular practices in
various forms in many aspects, reflecting that the third round of
election is inevitable if enough evidence is found.
</P>
<P>
As a new round of election seems possible, some Election
Commission members voiced concern that the rerunning of the poll
will lead to a constitutional dilemma.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled earlier this week the newly-
elected Senate could not function or open its first meeting unless
all of its 200 seats have been filled and unanimously endorsed by
the Election Commission. Thus, if the commission confirms any
violations in the election, there will be more elections and the
new Senate's opening will be postponed time after time.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has said that he would discuss
with the Election Commission to find an appropriate way out for
the functioning of the new Senate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Wan Muhammad Nor Matha said that
he believed an appropriate solution would be found before the
scheduled reconvention of the parliament in June.

<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France wants to bring food,
medicines and clothes to the hostages taken by Philippine Muslim
rebels last Sunday, said the French Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The French embassy in Manila, in coordination with the German
and Finnish embassies, are working to gather food, medicines and
clothes in order to bring them to the hostages detained for nearly
a week," said a spokesman of the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
A couple of French tourists, three Germans, a South African
couple, a Lebanese and a Finnish couple were among the 21 people
taken hostage on April 23 at the Malaysian resort island of
Sipadan. The other hostages are Malays and Philippinos.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the three embassies are contacting the
Philippine authorities to study the best conditions in which these
daily necessities can be brought to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
France has restrained from commenting on the report that the
hostages are in a state of "extreme weakness" and the hostage-
takers threatened to kill the hostages if the ambassadors of the
five foreign countries involved fail to hold direct negotiations
with them.

<HEADLINE> French Investors Keen on Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- French automaker PSA Peugeot
Citroen has announced it will invest an additional one billion
yuan (about 121 million U.S. dollars) in its plant in central
China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
This new investment will be added to the Dongfeng-Citroen
Automobile Co., Ltd., a joint venture of the Dongfeng Automobile
Company of Shiyan in Hubei Province and Citroen. Dongfeng holds
70 percent of the investment, while the remaining 30 percent of
the stake is that of Citroen, Societe Generale, and the Bank of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is designed to have an annual production
capacity of 300,000 cars and 400,000 engines, and will be finished
in two stages, and more than 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) has been spent for the first-phase construction.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months, the joint venture sold 10,682 cars,
up 40 percent from the same period last year, and made a profit of
215 million yuan (25.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Michel Allain, French general manager of the company, was
overjoyed at the news. "It proves our company is capable of making
profits."
</P>
<P>
The joint venture had been a loss-making monster since it began
production three years ago. Zhang Shiduan, Chinese general
manager, explained that the original investment budget was 10.3
billion yuan, but the actual investment was raised to 13.1 billion
yuan due to changes in exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The registered capital of the venture is only 2.19 billion yuan,
and more than 80 percent of the construction fees were dependent
on loans, which drove up the company's annual cost to over one
billion yuan, and they lost 1.3 billion yuan in 1997 and 400
million yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
They were on the verge of bankruptcy when the central Chinese
government and Chinese banks gave the needed support in time and
brought the joint venture out of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The company began to show a profits last September, and now the
market penetration of Citroen cars has risen to nine percent, from
one percent in the past.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the State Development Bank and
Dongfang Assets Management decided to swap 2.3 billion yuan debts
the joint venture owed them into equities, which brought down
their assets-to-debt ratio from 92 percent to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French investor, also decided to pump
1.023 billion yuan into the Sino-French company and to give more
support to marketing and developing new products.
</P>
<P>
"The injection of over three billion yuan will bring vitality
to the joint venture, " said one corporate executive, "It will
create favorable conditions for bringing Citroen cars to more
Chinese families."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tourism -- Major Contributor to APEC Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Travel and tourism, one of
world's largest industries and generators of quality jobs, makes a
significant contribution to the prosperity of APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the World Travel &AMP; Tourism Council (WTTC) indicated
that travel and tourism constitutes over 11 percent of the APEC
region's total GDP, and 9.5 percent of its employment. It is
expected to produce 2.4 trillion U.S. dollars of total demand in
related industries and 94.5 million jobs in 2000.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the fastest growing travel and tourism economies in
APEC will collectively produce 4.6 trillion U.S. dollars of total
demand and 146 million jobs, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The WTTC pointed out that travel and tourism is a high growth
industry, which is globally forecast to grow at a rate of 4.2
percent annually over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The APEC economies are expected to generate an average of 10.5
percent of direct and indirect GDP from travel and tourism in 2000,
and this contribution should total 11.3 percent by 2010, said the
WTTC.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, as tourism within the APEC region accounts for one
quarter of the world international visitor arrivals and more than
one third of the global international visitor expenditure, there
lies a huge potential for the APEC member economies to develop
economy through tourism.
</P>
<P>
To exploit this potential, the WTTC suggested the APEC member
economies make travel and tourism a strategic development priority
at national policy levels and says the APEC members economies can
use travel and tourism as a catalyst to assist economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The WTTC's suggestions were enthusiastically received by the
representatives from 21 APEC member economies who gathered here to
hold the APEC Tourism Forum Saturday. They exchanged views on the
sustainable development of tourism and the Tourism Charter to be
adopted at an APEC Ministerial Meeting in Seoul in July this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran's Khatami Vows to Continue Reform Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed Khatami
vowed to continue the reform process Saturday as the powerful
conservatives stepped up an unprecedented crackdown on his
reformist allies.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian people are revolutionary and will remain
revolutionary and no one can hinder the nation's process of
reforms," Khatami told a group of model workers on the eve of the
Labor Day, which falls on May 1.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian nation is a reformist nation who constantly wants
to improve the social state of affairs and strengthen the pillars
of its independence and freedom by relying on the Islamic values,"
Khatami stressed, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's remarks came as the conservatives were trying to
silence the reformers by shutting down their publications,
arresting activists and cancelling the results in some
constituencies of the February parliamentary elections, in which
the reformists won a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
Iran's hardline judiciary on Saturday suspended the weekly Jebhe
(Front), bringing to 17 the number of publications banned in a
week.
</P>
<P>
The conservative crackdown virtually left the reformist camp
without a voice in the campaign for the parliamentary run-offs on
May 5 to decide the remaining 66 seats in the 290-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Suffering a humiliating defeat in the parliamentary elections on
February 18, the conservatives, who still controlled most of the
state powers including the judiciary and the armed forces, were too
eager for revenge.
</P>
<P>
The reformist press, hated for its role in drumming up popular
support, bore the brunt of the conservative crackdown. The
Guardians Council, dominated by the conservatives, cancelled the
election results in 12 constituencies and deprived nine elected
reformists of their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
It so far refused to confirm the results in Tehran, the biggest
and most important constituency where the reformists won 29 out of
the total 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Khatami said "the Iranian society is reformist
from within," citing "independence and freedom" as the major goals
and pillars of the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled late pro-
West shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
The president called on the nation to leave behind the current "
sensitive stage" and safeguard "the blood of the martyrs and the
price the nation has paid for its independence and freedom."
</P>
<P>
The victorious reformists have expressed the fear that the
latest crackdown might be a part of a larger campaign or coup by
hardliners to end reformist process initiated by Khatami since he
came to power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reformist coalition "May 23 Front" said Friday night that "
there are ample evidences attesting to the emergence of a
suspicious current intending to foment crisis and to agitate the
current situation by provoking various segments of society."
</P>
<P>
The "illegitimate and unconventional" close of reformist
publications clearly shows that factional-political considerations
are involved, the front said, the reform process is under attack on
specific lines.
</P>
<P>
It called on the people, the youth and students in particular,
to exercise vigilance, preserve calm and confront insinuations and
provocative remarks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a student group on Saturday accused former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani of masterminding the crackdown as head of the
rumored "Crisis Headquarters" against the reformists.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the Islamic Union of University Students
and Educated said that Rafsanjani intended to create political
tension to repeat the coup in 1981 which toppled Abu Hassan
Banisadr, the first president of the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani currently chairs the State Expediency Council which
serves as an arbitrator between the parliament and the Guardians
Council and an advisory body for the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He suffered a shameful defeat in the February elections with his
name at the bottom of the list of 30 elected in Tehran constituency
as the reformists strongly opposed his run in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Iran Smashes Militant Opposition Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran said a three-member group of
the military opposition Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
smashed Saturday soon after they sneaked into Iran from
neighboring Iraq where they were based.
</P>
<P>
The state radio reported the MKO members were identified by the
people and security forces after they infiltrated into Abdanan, in
the western province of Ilam, around 11:00 local time (0630 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Being chased by security forces, two MKO members exploded a
house and committed suicide, the radio said, without mentioning the
fate of the third one.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, the main military opposition fighting against the
Islamic regime, has been more active in recent months as the power
struggle between Iran's conservatives and reformists escalated in
the wake of the parliamentary elections in February.
</P>
<P>
Iran's army said on Sunday that four MKO members in two groups
were also killed near the border when they were trying to creep
into Iran.
</P>
<P>
In February and March, the MKO launched two mortar attacks on
central Tehran, one of which was close to the Majlis (parliament)
premises and presidential office. 
</P>
<P>
A famous political-military group which fought against the late
shah's regime in the 1970s, the MKO was outlawed in 1981 and forced
to flee to Iraq after splitting with the ruling clergy brought to
power by the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Accused as a terrorist group by Tehran, the MKO carried out a
series of cross-border attacks and assassinations of senior Iranian
officials in recent years. In retaliation, Tehran launched several
air raids on MKO bases inside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> 2nd GCC Advisory Summit Opens in Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUSCAT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The second advisory summit of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) kicked off here on Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Political and economic issues which aim at greater GCC
cooperation are high on the agenda of the one-day summit, chaired
by Omani Sultan Qabus Bin Said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also attended by Kuwait Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah, Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa, Qatari
Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince of the Abu Dhabi Emirate in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan is expected to read out
a brief on the most important topics handled by the six-nation
council since the 20th GCC summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia late last
November.
</P>
<P>
The GCC-Iran relations will also be addressed in the summit as a
tripartite GCC committee on the UAE-Iran territorial dispute will
submit a report of findings this week.
</P>
<P>
The committee, grouping foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and Oman as well as the GCC chief, was formed last July to help
solve the islands dispute through contacts with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been locked in a long-running dispute with Iran over
the sovereignty of three small but strategically important Gulf
islands, now under Iranian control but also claimed by the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The GCC's first advisory summit was hosted by Abu Dhabi in
December 1998. It is an additional mechanism to the GCC on the
summit level.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia and Algeria started joint operations for
conducting oil surveys and explorations under an agreement reached
by the Tunisian Corporation for Petroleum Operations and Algeria's
Sonatrach company.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian corporation said that experts from the two
countries have recently met in Tunisia to exchange the results of
the exploration works carried out by Tunisian and Algerian
engineers in the region which is likely to be rich with oil and gas
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached a deal to extend a pipeline to carry
natural gas from the Algerian desert to Italy via Tunisia. They
also signed an agreement for technical cooperation in the fields of
exploration and preparing technical studies on the energy reserves
in the Shatt el-Garid area on the joint borders.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- Head of Gaza-based Federation of Handicrafts
Industries, Abdel Rehim Abu Sido, said the industries of bamboo,
glass coloring and other Palestinian crafts are prospering and
their exports to European countries, the United States and some
Arab states reached 90 percent of the total production.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sido said 35 companies and factories are operating in this
field, adding that plans are being worked out to revive the old
traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's
Association (TUSIAD) predicted in a report that growth of gross
national product (GNP) of Turkey in 2000 will be 4.5 percent, lower
than the government's 5.5-percent projection.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News reported on Saturday that the association also
forecast an inflation of 30 percent, above the government's 20-
percent target this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, however, the government would fulfill
its projection of 28.8 billion U.S. dollars in exports. But imports
would exceed the 46-billion target to reach 48.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Six consortia of Turkish and foreign companies on
Friday placed bids for a high-speed railway between Ankara and
Istanbul, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to shorten the travel time between the
two cities from 7.5 hours to less than five hours and the travel
distance from 577 kilometers to 416.
</P>
<P>
The best bidder appeared to be the Turco-Indian consortium
Limak, Mustafa Ozcan and Ircon, which offered 320.5 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Germany's AG Bank has acquired a 40-percent stake in
the Turkish brokerage house Bender Securities, reported Turkish
Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, which is subject to Turkish regulatory approval,
the German bank will manage Bender's operations in international
markets.
</P>
<P>
Bender, for its part, will make use of Germany's global equities
unit "aiming for leadership in Turkish capital markets."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Urges University Graduates to Take Up Jobs in Public Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has appealed to university graduates in the country to take up
employment opportunities currently available in the public
sector.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the appeal when addressing a public rally in
Mbarara municipality at the start of his referendum campaign in
the southwestern region of Uganda, according to a press release
from the President's Office obtained on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the only way forward in terms of employment
opportunities for the increasing number of Ugandan University
graduates lies in continued establishment of more industries in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The employment rate of university graduates registers roughly
at 60 percent in the country. According to the 1990 population
census, the labor force in Uganda is estimated at 8 million
people and growing at 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This means that the country should create 280,000 new jobs
annually, but actually only about 100,000 are absorbed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Redistribution Begins in Mid May: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
begin compulsorily acquiring white-held fertile land and
redistribute it to landless blacks in the second week of May.
</P>
<P>
Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Emmerson
Mnangagwa Saturday told the Zimbabwe News Agency that within the
next 10 days, President Robert Mugabe will invoke his Presidential
Powers to repeal the Land Acquisition Act to conform to the Land
Constitutional Amendment.
</P>
<P>
"Within 10 days the legal framework to take land and
redistribute it to the people will be in place and we will
immediately proceed to take and give it to the people," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Presidential Powers would be in force for six
months within which a new parliament would be elected and is
expected to ratify the new Land Acquisition Act and allow the
continuation of the land redistribution exercise, which by then
would be in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Mnangagwa's announcement is expected to please the liberation
war veterans and millions of black Zimbabweans who have been
clamoring for a speedy redistribution of land for past 20 years
since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans and some peasant farmers eking a living out of
rocky reserves they were pushed into by British colonial
governments, have since occupied more than 1,000 of the estimated
4,500 white-owned farms in a bid to force the government to give
them land.
</P>
<P>
However, if the government really goes ahead and start
redistributing land before the parliamentary elections scheduled
for mid May but now expected in late June or early July, it would
have spat in the face of Britain and other international donors
who have demanded that war veterans move out of farms first and
elections be held before land redistribution begins.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which caused impasse in ground-breaking land reform
talks with Zimbabwe in London on Thursday, has been threatening
not to release pledged 36 million British pounds and other
foreign aid for resettlement if these conditions are not met.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwean team at the talks, led by Local
Government and National Housing Minister John Nkomo told Britain
to "pay or shut up".
</P>
<P>
"Britain's stance is not our problem. It does not matter what
they think or say, we are going ahead with our plans whether they
like it or not, " said Mnangagwa.
</P>
<P>
This uncompromising mood of the government forced white
farmers, who have lost two of their members and millions of
dollars worth of property to militant former freedom fighters, to
sign a truce with the war veterans on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The white farmers agreed to let the war veterans continue
occupying their farms as a way to force the government to speedy
up land reform.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans promised to stop violence and allow farmers to
go on with their work in peace until the redistribution exercise
is over.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economy is agro-based and it is widely believed that
as long as the 12 million hectares of prime farming land remain
in the hands of 4, 500 white farmers, the rest of 12 million
population will not achieve equitable distribution of national
wealth.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Soldier Testifies to Truth of Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A former Japanese soldier
said here today that he wants more people to learn about the
history of the Japanese invasion of China as one way toward
gaining everlasting peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, one of the Japanese soldiers who massacred some
300,000 people in Nanjing in 1937, came to Shijiazhuang today from
Beijing to disclose the atrocities of the Japanese invaders in
China. The Japanese Supreme Court has overruled his appeal in
which he sought to acknowledge the invasion.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang, capital of north
China's Hebei Province, voiced encouragement and support for the
88-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
Students at the Shijiazhuang Post School held a long banner
with hundreds of signatures to welcome the former Japanese soldier.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro also attended an exhibition that described his
appeal in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibits have again aroused my indignation against the
Japanese soldiers, and I repent again to the Chinese people," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: China, HK Complementary in IT Field, Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's mainland and the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) can complement each other
in developing information technology (IT), a renowned Chinese
scientist said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The complementarity of the two economies in the IT sector is
obvious," said Vice President of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering Zhu Gaofeng, who is in Hong Kong to attend the two-day
forum "Prospects and Business Opportunities for Cooperation
Between the Mainland and Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The mainland has a good many of IT talents, and has made well-
based basic researches in the IT field, and its market demands are
also large, said Zhu. Hong Kong, on the other hand, has ample
funds supplies, business talents and well-established links with
the outside world, he said.
</P>
<P>
This makes Hong Kong and the mainland very complementary in
jointly developing the IT industry, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the IT development in China and Hong Kong, Zhu
said the scale of China's IT industry is the largest in the world
and the communications infrastructure is also comparatively
advanced.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics, there are a total of 43.238
million mobile phone users in China, amounting to 3.5 percent of
the total population. The number of domain names have reached 48,
695, ISPs reached 300 and Web sites 15,153. The number of desktops
is set at 3.735 million, and notebook computers at 237,000.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China's web infrastructure is good but the popularity
of web is not so satisfactory since the population is too large,
and only a limited number of people have access to the Web.
Besides, China's IT development is not so balanced.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas we have reached advanced level in the world but
in most areas we are lagged far behind," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
How to achieve a balanced development in IT sector is a major
subject facing the mainland and Hong Kong IT professionals, said
Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Now both the mainland and Hong Kong have the intention to
jointly develop IT but there are still some obstacles to
furthering mainland-Hong Kong IT cooperation, Zhu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Some obstacles are institutional and some lay in people's minds,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Only when people on both sides realize each other's advantages,
can the two set a good foundation for future cooperation, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) is set to
bring both opportunities and challenges to China's IT industry,
the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
After China joining the WTO, China's IT enterprises can enter
the outside world and learn advanced technology and experience
from their foreign counterparts, which will surely spur China's IT
development, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
But the challenges are also severe, said Zhu, warning that
China's IT industry should prepare itself for intensified outside
competition.
</P>
<P>
"They must develop and reform themselves to adapt to a more
competitive environment, otherwise they are likely to be losers,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK to Serve As Bridge Between Chinese, World IT Markets, Hau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong businesses should
serve as a bridge linking China's market with the international
market in the opening process of its telecommunications industry
after China's expected accession into the World Trade Organization
(WTO), a leading businessman said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial for Hong Kong's information technology (IT)
industry to shift its role and expand its cooperation with the
mainland in developing China's telecommunications and Internet
market," said Tony Hau, chairman and managing director of CM
Telecom International Ltd.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Hau, who is attending a
forum on IT industry in Hong Kong from April 28 to 30, said that
China's future accession into WTO will make it possible to
introduce foreign investment in the country's telecommunications
and Internet market.
</P>
<P>
"This will create unlimited opportunities for foreign and
domestic businesses including those in Hong Kong," Hau stressed.
</P>
<P>
With a sound service system and abundant experiences on world
market, Hong Kong's IT businesses can help their inland
counterparts build up their international competitiveness, Hau
said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the businesses in Hong Kong will make it
easier for overseas companies to know more about China since they
are more familiar with the inland market and the Chinese language
and culture, Hau said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the prospect of mainland IT ventures to use Hong
Kong as a fund raising center, Hau said, Hong Kong's Growth
Enterprise Market will serve as a platform for the inland hi-tech
firms to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
Also, Hong Kong is the home market for the financing of Chinese
enterprises, Hau said, adding that most Chinese firms listed
overseas chose Hong Kong as the venue.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that by March 2000, there were a total of 112
Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, accounting for 79 percent
of the total number of the Chinese companies listed in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hau said his company has lately become one of the 18
constituent stocks of the newly-launched information and
technology indexes, a benchmark for measuring the performance of
IT stocks listed on the Main Board and Growth Enterprise Market of
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 officials and experts from Hong Kong and China's
mainland gathered here to discuss the development and direction of
IT industry, which has topped the development agenda of both
places.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum, with the theme "Prospects and Business
Opportunities for Cooperation Between the Mainland and Hong Kong,"
placed emphasis on the outlook and business opportunities of
information technology in Hong Kong and the mainland after China
joins the World Trade Organization (WTO).

HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa on Saturday
called for support from the U.S. Congress to approve the granting
of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
Tung told a visiting U.S. presidential delegation that china's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) would benefit
world trade.
</P>
<P>
"According to various forecasts, following accession to WTO,
China's external trade and foreign direct investment in China will
double within six to seven years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities in the years ahead would be enormous and
this will definitely benefit the U.S., China and Hong Kong," Tung
stressed.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese mainland and the U.S. were Hong Kong's two
largest trading partners, a stable trade relations between them
would be very important to Hong Kong, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive also updated the U.S. delegation on the
economic recovery as well as the successful implementation of "one
country, two systems" policy in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
called on the nation to learn from the model workers and advanced
personnel who were commended at the Great Hall of the People today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a grand rally to commend the nearly 3,000
individuals, Jiang said that all of society should learn from and
promote the lofty spirit of these model and advanced workers, and
strive for the building of socialism with firm conviction and

<HEADLINE> China Tries to Block Auction of Looted Antiques (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China today formally decried
plans by Sotheby's and Christie's to auction off four national
treasures looted from a Beijing imperial palace 140 years ago, and
has asked the auctioneers to halt this action.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuguang, spokesman for the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage (SACH), said this evening that the SACH has sent
official letters to the Sotheby's and Christie's companies in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The SACH is attempting to stop the auction of a hexagonal vase
carved with flowers and patterns, and three bronze ox, tiger, and
monkey heads, three of the 12 zodiac sculptures in a water clock
designed by a French Jesuit in 1744 at the Yuanmingyuan Palace.
</P>
<P>
"If the auction houses insist on selling these treasures, they
will have to pay for their ill-advised choice," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Christie's plans to hold its Spring auction of antiques from
the Yuanmingyuan between April 30 and May 2, including the ox and
monkey heads.
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's lots feature the tiger head and the vase, which adorn
the front cover of the auction house's glossy Spring catalogue.
</P>
<P>
Auctioneers estimate that the three heads may bring more than
10 million Hong Kong dollars. And the vase, according to Sotheby'
s catalogue, is being offered as "estimate on request."
</P>
<P>
All four precious relics were taken by British and French
troops in 1860 when they invaded Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Later, the invaders transported the zodiac sculptures and other
national heritage items overseas.

"They are all looted antiques," said Yang Zhijun, chief of the
SACH's Relics Protection Section. "Many looted antiques in the
world have been returned to their original owners."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) in 1995 initiated an international principle
governing heritage protection.
</P>
<P>
All antiques looted or lost during wartime should be returned
to their motherland, with no time limit for recovery, according to
the UNESCO principle.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, China has the right to ask that the antiques be
returned, without regard to time," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said, "The Chinese people require that looted cultural
relics go back to the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"However," he said, "some auction houses continued to sell
antiques smuggled from China regardless of China's Cultural
Relics Law, and relevant international covenants."
</P>
<P>
"The auction houses' transactions in looted relics not only
stains their own reputation, but also affronts the Chinese people,
" Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The SACH said it will trace the auction lots and demand
repatriation of the treasures.
</P>
<P>
The latest row over China's treasures comes just weeks after
the auction in New York of an ancient Chinese marble sculpture,
sent from Hong Kong, was stopped by U.S. authorities after it was
reported stolen by Chinese officials.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Mori Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on
Saturday called for a broader political dialogue and economic
cooperation between their countries.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Russia's resort-port of St. Petersburg, the
two leaders discussed the strengthening of the global political
stability, the solution to economic and financial problems as well
as issues related to U.N. operations, Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov told the press after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Much attention was paid to preparations for the Group-8 (the
United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Japan and
Russia) summit scheduled for July in Japan's Okinawa, but the
territorial dispute between the two nations was not discussed,
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after a four-hour meeting with Mori,
Putin said that he is "developing a good personal relationship"
with Mori and they reached understandings on a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Japanese leadership for supporting Russia's
economic reforms and also expressed his appreciation for Mori's
move to break certain Japanese rules to make his first foreign
visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Mori's visit would make a "good contribution
to the development of relations" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Putin said he hoped that leaders of the
industrialized nations at the Okinawa summit would "confirm their
loyalty to security and disarmament issues" and find more fair
solutions to key international problems.
</P>
<P>
Mori described the talks with Putin as constructive, saying
that the two sides would continue the dialogue on a Japanese-
Russian peace treaty on the basis of the Tokyo Declaration and the
Krasnoyarsk accords.
</P>
<P>
Mori arrived in St. Petersburg on Friday for a three-day visit
to Russia, the first leg of his tour to the G-8 countries ahead of
the Okinawa summit. He is expected to leave Russia for Rome on
Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yang, who is also bureau chief of narcotics control under the
Ministry of Public Security, said that over that past five years,
China has established a responsibility system in combating opium
growing which, so far, has basically achieved its objective.
</P>
<P>
The vice director emphasized that localities should improve
their awareness of the problem, strengthen the leadership in the
fight against opium growing, and see to it that officials
concerned sign responsibility contracts.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, China had over 680,000 registered
drug addicts by the end of 1999, 14.3 percent more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among these, 80 percent were male, and 78 percent people

<HEADLINE> China's ban on Falun Gong Justified by Ugandan Tragedy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan cult mass suicide has
again proved that it is important and necessary for the Chinese
government to ban Falun Gong, a cult headed by Li Hongzhi,
according to a byline article released by the Xinhua News Agency
today.
</P>
<P>
More than 530 members of a cult called the Movement of
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God in Uganda were burned
to death in a church on March 17, and more bodies were found later
in other places, bringing the total number of deaths to 924.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy was another major crime committed by cults against
the human community, the article said, warning that cults are
extremely dangerous to society.
</P>
<P>
China's prompt action against Falun Gong has prevented the cult
from doing greater harm to the country which has maintained social
order, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The most direct danger from a cult is that it seriously
threatens the life and property of the people. Statistics show
that more than 1,500 people in China were led to death by
practicing Falun Gong, and over 600 practitioners suffer from
mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
It is fortunate that no larger tragedy has occurred because the
Chinese government was soon aware of the threat from the cult, and
banned it with resolute measures.
</P>
<P>
Cults often control its followers by cheating and instigation,
and order them to destroy public orders. Many practitioners of
Falun Gong have been tricked into abandoning social life and jobs,
and even told to violate the law to "protect" the "creed," which
is actually a collection of fallacies.

<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 4,193 Chinese citizens
nationwide were punished according to law for growing opium
poppies last year, a senior official from the National Narcotics
Control Commission disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fengrui, vice director of the Office of the National
Narcotics Control Commission, pointed out that although narcotics
control officers have brought the illicit growing of opium poppies
under control, sporadic cases still occur here and there,
especially in the hinterland areas.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that departments concerned have taken stern actions
to punish those responsible, particularly officials in charge of
the work, and some village heads have been fired for their
inefficiency,
</P>
<P>
The National Narcotics Control Commission held a national
teleconference on the eradication of opium growing recently, which
spelled out the objectives for this year.

<HEADLINE> Top Lawmakers Urged Study of Int'l Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislators have been
urged to learn about international law since they are in a
position to approve or cancel the country's treaties and important
agreements with foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, made the call here today during a lecture on
international laws and treaties. This was the 14th in a series of
lecture on law held by the Ninth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
International law plays an increasingly important role in
international affairs in a time of rapid development in the world
and increasing of contacts and exchanges among nations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
As an underdeveloped socialist country, China should be adept
at using international law to handle international affairs and
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China is a country that abides by its pledges
and obeys the international conventions it has signed up.
</P>
<P>
He urged more intense study of international law and greater
efforts to successfully handle the relationship between domestic
laws and international by giving great weight to China's actual
situation when considering legislation.

<HEADLINE> China's Ban on Falun Gong Justified by Ugandan Tragedy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ban on Falun Gong has helped people regain a normal life
and has guaranteed a stable social and political situation
necessary for economic development, the article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The spreading of Falun Gong and other cults among people
indicates that it is necessary to improve the education level and
scientific awareness of the people.
</P>
<P>
The cult "Movement of Restoration of the Ten Commandments of
God" was popular in some remote and backward rural areas in Uganda,
and many of its followers were people with little education.
</P>
<P>
But ignorance exists not only in people with little education,
and some with higher education also believe in Falun Gong, which
shows that knowledge does not necessarily mean a proper scientific
view of the world.
</P>
<P>
The article suggested that people should study the theories of
Marxism and dialectical materialism and historical materialism to
improve their ability to recognize superstition and pseudo-science.
</P>
<P>
The existence of cults in various forms has already become an
international problem, and it is the common responsibility of the
international community to combat them.
</P>
<P>
After the Uganda mass suicide, several countries have taken
measures to ban cults to avoid similar tragedies.
</P>
<P>
China has used resolute methods to ban Falun Gong. More than 98
percent of its practitioners finally became aware of the nature of
the cult and volunteered to quit, while a handful of people in
Falun Gong organizations, who have other vicious purposes, were
punished by the government.
</P>
<P>
China has contributed to the international campaign against
cults by banning Falun Gong, the article concluded.

the Interpretations on Clause Two, Article 93 of the Criminal Law

duty by officials at the rural grassroots level, according to
legal experts.
</P>
<P>
The interpretations clearly stipulate the detailed
administration duties of village officials.
</P>

They also stipulate that any article of the Criminal Law
applicable to public servants will be applicable to any village
official who commits a crime by ignoring his duty as listed in

<HEADLINE> New Museum Hall Draws Science-loving Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A new hall in China's only
national science and technology museum made its debut in Beijing
today, just two days before the week-long International Labor Day
holiday in order to host more science-loving vacationers.
</P>
<P>
Inside the new exhibition hall of the China Sci-Tech Museum,
more than 300 items from the fields of space, energy,
communications, new materials, information, life and environmental
sciences, as well as 250 examples of China's ancient sci-tech
achievements, are on display.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibits, visitors will see a sample of most advanced
micro-electronic technology made by Intel Corp., and the oldest
car made by the Ford Motors Co..
</P>
<P>
The "No Touch" signs which once were common in China's museums
have vanished from the hall, because the museum wants visitors to
feel the magic of science and technology for themselves, from
space-walking to virtual football.
</P>
<P>
"Our museum is approaching that of the most advanced science
centers in the world," museum curator Li Xiangyi said at the
opening ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
His comment was echoed by Intel's Vice President James Jarrett,
who described the opening of the new hall as a wonderful step
towards providing the public with greater scientific and
technological knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin encouraged the museum to play a
leading role in "carrying forward the spirit of science and
introducing knowledge, thinking, and the scientific method to the
public" by writing an inscription for the museum.
</P>
<P>
The Sci-Tech Museum, located in northern Beijing, was built in
1988 under the auspices of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 Chinese, mainly school children, visit the museum
every year. The new facility is expected to greet 1.5 million
visitors annually.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, U.N. Reach Common Ground on KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and the United
Nations have made compromise on resolving differences over the
trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders, a U.N. envoy said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Hun Sen has agreed to accept the U.N. proposal
which was put forward to him on April 18," U.S. Senator John Kerry
told reporters at Pochentong International Airport upon his
departure.
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts senator arrived here Friday on a U.N. mission
to broke a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia and the U.N. differed on the issue of how to resolve a
dispute between the co-prosecutors, one appointed by the U.N. and
one by Cambodia, on the indictments against suspects.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have moved slowly with Cambodia insisting on
effective control of the process on the grounds of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. proposal, a separate panel of three Cambodian
judges and two foreign judges would be set up to rule on
indictment disputes, but four out of five would be required to
block a case from proceeding.
</P>
<P>
"And in return, the U.N. has agreed that they will not request
an agreement signed before the (Cambodian) National Assembly (
passes the draft law on the tribunal)," Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on April 27,
Hun Sen said, "the request for the Royal Government of Cambodia to
sign an agreement with the United Nations right now will be
tantamount to putting pressure on the legislature and may lead to
negative reactions form the latter. This will not be acceptable to
us."
</P>
<P>
"We have reached an agreement in principle. The Cambodian
government now is waiting for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
official response on the issue," Om Yin Tieng, senior advisor to
Hun Sen, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Annan will send a person to Cambodia in order to reach,
not sign, an agreement with Cambodia on the trial of Khmer Rouge
leaders before June 15," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Kerry also met with Senate President Chea Sim,
National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Deputy
Prime Minister Sar Kheng, as well as opposition party leader Sam
Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
Kerry was optimistic that Both Cambodia and the U.N. would move
to complete the process by June 15. "The fundamental agreement is
in place," he said.

record to finish top in the Asia/Oceania Zone Pool B by beating
Chinese Taipei 3-0 in Osaka Saturday, setting up a play-off clash
with hosts Japan for a place in next year's Federation Cup tennis
World Group.
</P>
<P>
China topped the six-team Pool B with five straight wins, ahead
of Indonesia with a 4-1 record and Chinese Taipei with 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Li Na breezed past Tai Lan-lan 6-2, 6-0, while Yi Jingqian
needed a tough two hours 28 minutes to beat Janet Lee 6-4, 4-6, 6-
4 to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead over Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
In Pool A, Japan's Ai Sugiyama suffered two shock defeats as
her team crashed 2-1 against Thailand, but the hosts still
advanced to a Fed Cup playoff against China.
</P>
<P>
Shinobu Asagoe defeated Napaporn Tongsalee 6-1, 6-0, but
Sugiyama was unable to emulate the win in her rubber against
Tamarine Tanasugarn, losing 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Tamarine then teamed up with Benjamas Sangaram to beat Sugiyama
and Nana Miyagi 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 to silence the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
The results left Japan, India and Thailand with identical
records of three wins against one defeat in the five-team round
robin, but Japan took top spot by virtue of their better
percentage of the sets they won.
</P>
<P>
The winners between China and Japan Sunday will join the World
Group next season, while the bottom teams of the the two pools,
winless Hong Kong and Singapore, were relegated to Group Two.

<HEADLINE> Laws Should Be Improved for New Situation: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's top lawmaker has urged
revision and reinterpretation of existing laws in order to meet
the requirements of the new situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) and a member of the Standing Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political
Bureau, made the remark today at the closing of the 15th session
of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Many of the existing laws were stipulated with a special
historic background as China has been transforming from a planned
economy to a market economy, Li said, noting that some of these
laws are not appropriate now, and some are even contrary to
reality.
</P>
<P>
China is developing a socialist market economy and building
socialism with its own characteristics, which is a great cause
never before undertaken, he said.
</P>
<P>
The top legislator supported the government's efforts to enter
the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling it necessary for
deepening the country's reform, expanding the opening-up, and
building a socialist market economy, as for the country prepares
to participate in the great trend of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
China should adhere to its principles for joining the WTO in
order to benefit the country's reform and opening drive, safeguard
economic security, and promote the development of economic and
trade relations with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the removal of Cheng Kejie as a vice chairman of
the NPC Standing Committee, Li called it a full indication of the
CPC Central Committee's determination to strictly control the
Party, govern the nation by law, and severely punish corruption.

<HEADLINE> Another Iranian Reformist Daily Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's hard-line judiciary on
Saturday closed down another reformist daily Jebhe (Front),
bringing to 17 the number of publications banned this week.
</P>
<P>
The state-run radio quoted an informed source as saying that the
daily was ordered to suspend its publication by the branch 1410 of
the public court, amid a stepped-up crackdown by the powerful
conservatives on the reformist allies of President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The conservative move of banning 13 dailies and 4 periodicals
within a week left the reformist camp without a voice for the
second round of the parliamentary elections on May 5. The campaign
for the runoff started on Thursday in 52 constituencies to run for
66 seats.
</P>
<P>
The press has played an important role in the reformists'
overwhelming victory in the February parliamentary elections, which
humiliated the powerful conservatives, who still dominate most of
the sensitive state organs including the judiciary and the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to accept the defeat, the conservative-controlled
Guardians Council nullified the results of 12 constituencies in the
first round, depriving nine elected from entering the parliament
and forcing others to the runoff.
</P>
<P>
It has so far refused to confirm the result in Tehran
constituency, the biggest and most important one in which the
reformists won 29 out of the total 30 seats, arousing serious
concern on whether the new reformist parliament could be formed on
May 28 on time.
</P>
<P>
The victorious reformists have expressed the fear that the
crackdown on the reformist press might be a part of a larger
campaign or coup by hard-liners to end reformist process initiated
by President Khatami after he came to power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reformist coalition "May 23 Front" said Friday night that "
there are ample evidences attesting to the emergence of a
suspicious current intending to foment crisis and to agitate the
current situation by provoking various segments of society."
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the Islamic Republic News Agency on
Saturday, the front blast the closure of reformist closures as "
illegitimate and unconventional."
</P>
<P>
The move clearly shows that factional-political considerations
are involved and the reform process supported by the May 23 Front
is under attack on specific lines, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It called on the people, the youth and students in particular,
to exercise vigilance, preserve calm and confront insinuations and
provocative remarks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a student group on Saturday accused former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani of mastering the recent crackdown as head of the
rumored "Crisis Headquarters" against the reformists.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the Islamic Union of University Students
and Educated said that Rafsanjani intended to create political
tension to repeat the coup in 1981 which toppled Abu Hassan
Banisadr, the first president of the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani currently chairs the State Expediency Council which
serves as an arbitrator between the parliament and the Guardians
Council and an advisory body for the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He suffered a defeat in the February elections with his name at
the bottom of the list of 30 elected in Tehran constituency as the
reformists strongly opposed his run in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Fire in Ordnance Depot Destroys 10,000-ton Ammo in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fire, which broke out at 3 p.m. Friday at an ammunition
dump under India's Southern Army Command at Bharatpur in the
eastern part of Rajasthan, also claimed at least lives of three
civilians, injured about 10 people and forced residents within a
10-km radius to be evacuated, earlier media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were still struggling to extinguish the fire
completely even 21 hours after it broke out, the PTI reported,
adding that intermittent explosions were continuing although the
fire was generally under control.
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman was quoted as saying that the fire is
believed to have blown up almost 30 to 40 percent of war reserves
of the Southern Army Command as well as vital reserves of the
country's two strike corps, adding that Indian army's battle
preparedness could be affected.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, surface-to-air missiles like SAM-6 and SAM-7 and
anti-tank missiles Milan, which formed part of the armory at
Bharatpur, were not damaged in the fire, the PTI quoted army
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The exact cause of the fire was not yet known but it was
suspected that the fire, which emanated from the outside, had been
triggered by short circuit in the high tension wire fencing and
had spread inside due to very high velocity winds and extremely
high temperatures during the day, the army sources said.
</P>
<P>
Though the fire was still suspected to be accidental, army
authorities have not ruled out sabotage and on Saturday the army
headquarters in New Delhi ordered a Staff Court of Inquiry headed
by a major general to probe the cause of the fire, the PTI
reported.
</P>
<P>
After learning the news of the fire, Indian Defense Minister
George Fernandes cut short his visit to Jammu and Kashmir and held
a high-level meeting in New Delhi to discuss the situation, said
the PTI.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Fernandes left for Bharatpur for an on-the-spot
inspection and upon his return he would brief Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee on the fire, the PTI added.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Resume Formal Peace Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Formal peace negotiations between
the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF) are expected to resume on May 16 or 17, National Security
Adviser Alexander Aguirre said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said in a radio program that this was agreed upon by
the two sides during an emergency meeting Friday in Cotabato City,
the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Even before the formal negotiations resume, he said, the
technical working groups of the two panels would continue to meet
and discuss ways of accelerating the peace process between the
government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre also expressed confidence over the positive outcome of
the peace process with the MILF, saying that he believes the group
is working on forging a peace pact with the government.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the MILF is complying with the guidelines of
the peace process. But there are some incidents in which they have
no control over some of their field commanders who try to occupy
populated areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, he said, the government has no other
option but to deploy the military to protect the civilian
population in these areas and launch attacks on MILF camps where
terrorist activities are hatched.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a major rebel group in the Philippines, has been
fighting for an independent Muslim state in Mindanao in the past
two decades.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Malaysia Intensify Joint Border Patrols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Malaysia have
stepped up their joint border patrols to intensify their
cooperation against trans-border crimes and prevent a repeat of
the April 24 Sabah hostage-taking incident, an official said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio-TV program, Undersecretary Esteban Conejos
of the Department of National Defense said the Philippine military
has been closely coordinating with the Malaysian Navy to guard
against illegal activities in the country's southern borders
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, a group of kidnappers took hostage 21 persons,
including Filipinos and several foreigners from an island resort
in Sabah, Malaysia, and entered the Philippines' Jolo Island, Sulu
Province, where they are now believed to be hiding their captives.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this (hostage-taking) incident, we are intensifying
our joint patrol of the area with the Malaysian Navy," Conejos
said.
</P>
<P>
Manila has an existing defense cooperation arrangement with
Kuala Lumpur, which includes a joint border patrol agreement. It
also has a similar accord with Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Creates Learning Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
announced Saturday that his country will stage a two-week
Singapore Learning Festival between August and September this year
to anchor the current Learning Movement launched earlier by the
government in partnership with the private and people sectors.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the statement in his message marking
the Labor Day 2000 with focus on building greater recognition of
the need for continual learning and motivating the workforce
toward lifelong skill-improvement.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that to inculcate learning as a way of life is in line
with the New Economy environment in which retrenchments will no
longer be mere occurrence in waning companies or during economic
recessions but become common for companies, both firing and hiring
workers at the same time.
</P>
<P>
This is because under intense competitive pressure, companies
have to undertake constant restructuring, to adopt new technology
and update their operations to stay afloat, he said.
</P>
<P>
Companies often uninterruptedly lay off outdated or redundant
workers and at the same time employ new ones with modern skills,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emphasized that workers must be prepared to
train and retrain and continually learn relevant skills as the New
Economy offers tremendous opportunities to workers with requisite
qualifications or skills but poses great challenges to workers who
are under-skilled, or whose skills are rendered redundant by fast
changing technology.
</P>
<P>
Goh said under-skilled and redundant workers will find it
increasingly difficult to find a new job although workers who have
skills in the new technology are in huge demand but in short
supply all over the world and the bid for them has taken on a
global dimension, especially in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about three out of four new jobs created
in Singapore will require skilled workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh reaffirmed that his government has set aside 200 million
Singapore dollars (about 120 million U.S. dollars) to co-fund a
five-year training and skill-building programs for workers under
the Manpower Development Assistance Scheme.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100,000 workers are expected to be trained by 2003
under these programs, the prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Red Crescent Officials Charged with Malpractice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- six officials of Turkey's state-run
Kizilay (Red Crescent) have been charged with interfering in
bidding for medical supplies, Turkish Daily News reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The charges came after widespread criticism of the humanitarian
relief agency for its poor response to devastating earthquakes the
country suffered in August and November.
</P>
<P>
But the officials have denied any wrongdoing. Five officials
have been released pending trial while Hayati Kalkanoglu, formerly
in charge of buying and selling material for the agency, was still
detained and will face trial on charges of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
In December, 27 other officials of the organization were charged
with mismanagement and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The entire board resigned last year in the face of quake-related
criticism, which has included press reports alleging that agency
officials spent lavishly on a new headquarters but failed to invest
in up-to-date emergency equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Parliament is conducting its own investigation on
whether the agency made the best use its resources and prepared
adequately for natural disasters.

<HEADLINE> Food Poisonings Panic Turkish Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Suspicion of food poisoning among
students after eating hazelnuts has panicked schools in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Education Ministry ordered a complete halt to the
distribution of hazelnuts purchased by the ministry from the
Hazelnut Producers' Cooperative (Fiskobirlik) to schools across the
country whose hazelnut output ranks number 1 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Fiskobirlik is a governmental department in charge of carrying
out purchase of hazelnuts from farmers at subsidy prices and
selling them in domestic and world markets as well.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of food poisoning started Thursday in the
southeastern province Gaziantep. According to local sources, in the
worst hit province, 800 children were hospitalized after consuming
hazelnuts or figs given to them by their teachers.
</P>
<P>
Some of the children left hospital diagnosed without physical
illness, but hospitalization of such a high number of children
created tension among parents and children in other areas.
</P>
<P>
In total 12 provinces including Istanbul, several central and
western provinces, similar food poisoning incidents also took
place, although in much smaller numbers from dozens to 200.
</P>
<P>
Fiskobirlik executives, however, denied claims that the children
were poisoned by the hazelnuts and declared that tests have shown
that the nuts were not contaminated.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Fiskobirlik Cevat Aydin told reporters that in the "
500-year history of the hazelnut, there have not been any poisoning
incidents," adding that the hazelnuts do not contain any materials
which could cause food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The head said that Fiskobirlik have investigated the medical
reports on the children and determined that the incidents were only
psychological.
</P>
<P>
But students' parents complained that the hazelnuts had been
transported without packaging, and their warnings had not been
taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
They also lamented that tests on the hazelnuts had not been
carried out before they were distributed to schools.
</P>
<P>
Following the hazelnut alert in primary schools across Turkey,
several provincial governors have stopped the distribution of the
hazelnut to students' diet in schools while some governors also
ordered to collect the nuts which had already been distributed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government forces
continued to bombard with artillery fires rebel strongholds in
Maguindanao, Mindanao Saturday, official reports said.
</P>
<P>
The skirmishes started Friday after Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) rebels harassed the detachment of the 3rd Infantry
Battalion's Bravo Company in sitio Bubong, Maguindanao, according
to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
At present, concentrations of heavy fighting are in the
villages of Sapad, Upper Pinantao and Campo Uno located near the
Secretary Narciso Ramos highway, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that at least two rebel checkpoints were
dismantled by advancing marine and army troopers as they inched
their way along the so-called perimeter defense lines of Camp
Abubakar, the rebels main enclave that straddles in the
hinterlands of Matanog, Buldon and Barira towns.
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said that some 20 MILF guerrillas were killed
in the ongoing fighting.
</P>
<P>
"But we only managed to recover one body of a dad rebel," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The government, on the other hand, suffered two fatalities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over local radio station DXMS, MILF military chief Al
Haj Murad warned of an all-out MILF offensive in Mindanao once
Abubakar will be placed under heavy attack.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization is keeping its "defensive stance" over
the situation as they wait for the immediate reconvening of
government and MILF peace brokers to work out a truce in the area.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF, the main rebel group in the Philippines,
is fighting for an independent Muslim state in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Finds No trace of Hostages Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government forces have
not found trace of the 27 hostages when they reached the peak of
the mountain stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf in Sumisip, Basilan,
Friday, after a day long fierce gunbattle, a military official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Major General Diomedio Villanueva, commander of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines based in Zamboanga City, Mindanao, said
that he is hopeful that the hostage-crisis can be resolved
Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and pray that the hostages are safe and still alive,"
he said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he was optimistic that the other hostage-
crisis in Sulu where bandits with links with the Basilan-based Abu
Sayyaf extremists, would be resolved without bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Sulu hostages were seized by Filipino gunmen in a diving
resort of Sipadan in Sabah, Malaysia last Sunday and brought them
over to Talipao, Sulu two days later.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the release of the Sulu hostages have started
by Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM).
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said authorities have still to pinpoint the exact
location of the hostages who were reportedly divided into three
groups, spread either in Talipao and Patikul.
</P>
<P>
He said government troops have occupied about 80 percent of the
Abu Sayyaf stronghold, but found no traces of the 27 hostages held
captive by the Muslim extremist group since March 20.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf claimed they have beheaded two of the hostages
but this could not be confirmed by the military until now.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said there are still 27 hostages who are the object
of a rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that the Abu Sayyaf have secret tunnels in
the area which they used to escape during the heavy bombardment
and air strikes by the military.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Abu Sayyaf planted landmines in many areas to
prevent and slow down the advancing troops toward Camp Abdurajak.
</P>
<P>
Five government soldiers were killed and 31 others wounded
during the final assault of Camp Adurajak.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will build a new
Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) camp to upgrade the training and
skills of army commandos, Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The masterplan of the camp has been completed and will be built
under the Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001-2005), he told reporters
after a function in Pekan, Pahang state, according to Bernama news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The camp to be sited at Mersing in the southern state of Johor
was estimated to cost 250 million ringgit (65.789 million U.S.
dollars), the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed camp would have sophisticated training facilities
in efforts to upgrade the training and skills of army commandos,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with the performance of the army commandos, the
government would continue to give attention to boost the
capabilities of the Rapid Deployment Force, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicine Taps International Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese herbal medical
experts have urged to establish a national herbal medicine
laboratory to develop herbal medicines that meet international
demands.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts including Li Benyu from the China Medical
Sciences University and Yao Xixian from the Hebei Medical Sciences
University said that the laboratory should accelerate developing
traditional Chinese herbal medicines in new forms including
capsule, condensed pilular, minute pilular and cream to make them
convenient to carry and easy to take.
</P>
<P>
China holds only a very small share in the world herbal
medicine market although the nation has become increasing well-
known globally in herbal medical treatment of tumors, vascular
diseases and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Some other Asian countries, however, have become the world's
leading producers of herbal medicine after importing Chinese
ingredients, according to an official with the Ministry of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
China must do a lot more in developing its herbal medicines and
come up with medicines which are effective in curing diseases and
also acceptable internationally, according to the experts.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Nuclear Plan for Peaceful Purposes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has reiterated that Iran's nuclear plan is for peaceful
purposes and is endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite U.S. pressure, the Islamic Republic of Iran has made
good achievements in implementing nuclear projects for non-military
use like those for the agriculture sector," he said Friday night
upon return from the 6th summit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) in New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and some western countries have repeatedly accused Iran
of seeking access to weapons of mass destruction with assistance of
third countries. Washington has also imposed sanctions on several
Russian companies for cooperating with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran has always rejected the western accusation and stressed
that its use of atomic energy is for peaceful purposes and aims to
serve mankind and under the IAEA supervision.
</P>
<P>
Russia concluded the contract on the construction of the Bushehr
nuclear plant in southern Iran in 1994, defying the pressure of the
U.S., which has repeatedly attempted to convince Russia not to
cooperate in the project.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also underlined that security is achieved only when all
atomic weapons in the world are removed. "We must assure that this
treaty (NPT) is implemented multilaterally and in all dimensions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited Israel's nuclear program as a threat to the security of
the region, the Middle East and the world and stressed that the
Israeli regime must commit itself to the NPT and be disarmed
completely from its atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a NPT signatory and a member of the Nuclear Disarmament
Conference.

<HEADLINE> "Speak Good English Movement" launched in Singapore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A movement to speak good
English was officially launched Saturday by Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong with an aim to push Singaporeans to speak
standard English and reduce the usage of Singlish which is
difficult for foreign English-speaking people to understand.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the rally of launching the "Speak Good
English Movement" that it is important to speak good English as
Singapore is a hub city and an open economy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "If we speak a corrupted form of English that
is not understood by others, we will lose a key competitive
advantage."
</P>
<P>
English is the official working language in Singapore and is
the first language being taught at schools.
</P>
<P>
However, Singaporeans often use Chinese syntax and literal
translations of Chinese phrases while speaking English, which not
only make the sentences ungrammatical and truncated but also
incomprehensible, especially to foreigners. This has been labeled
as the language of Singlish.
</P>
<P>
In his national day speech last year, Goh highlighted the
problem arising from speaking Singlish and called for a movement
to speak good English.

<HEADLINE> Accra Declaration Adopted to Protect Children From Wars in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- West African foreign ministers on
Friday agreed to institute an annual truce week celebration in the
sub-region, as part of efforts to create awareness on the effect
of wars on children and the need to prevent wars, reported the
Ghana News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is to coincide with the Day of the African Child (June
16) and to raise public awareness about the plight of war-affected
children in the region", said a 23-point declaration dubbed "the
Accra Declaration" endorsed in Ghana's capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
The declaration adopted at the end of a two-day ministerial
conference of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) on war-affected children will serve as a blueprint for
moves to stop wars and re-mobilize, rehabilitate and reintegrate
war-affected children into society, said ministers attending the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also launched a plan of action for the implementation of
the ideals of the Accra Declaration in collaboration with civil
society, international organizations and donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
James Gbeho, Foreign Minister of Ghana and co-chairman of the
conference, who read the declaration, noted that the truce week is
also intended to give children in conflict areas, some breathing
space, with the view to eventually eradicating wars from region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called on armed groups in the conflict areas to
effect the immediate release of all children abducted and held
against their will.
</P>
<P>
Gbeho noted that information reaching the ministers indicates
that about 2,000 children, mostly girls, are still in the custody
of warlords in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The ministers urged all ECOWAS states to ratify the statute of
 international criminal court, to bring to justice, those who
commit violations against children.
</P>
<P>
They resolved to integrate child protection programs into
peacekeeping missions, and to ensure that all conventions on
children's rights are ratified by ECOWAS member states.
</P>
<P>
Gbeho said the declaration and plan of action would be presented
to President Jerry John Rawlings for subsequent consideration by
ECOWAS heads of state at their summit in Abuja next month.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ECOWAS heads of state to adopt the declaration and
the plan of action as the blueprint for the fight against wars in
the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Lansanna Kouyate, Executive Secretary of ECOWAS, assured the
minister of favorable consideration of the ideals of the
declaration and plan of action during the Abuja summit.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Isolate Member-states for Bad Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) said Friday that the organization has adopted
strategies to isolate member states, whose governments have bad
records of governance and democracy, from certain vital
negotiations, reported the Ghana News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of ECOWAS said in Ghana's
capital Accra that this move is to discourage member states from
violating the rules of good governance and democracy at the
expense of the citizens, especially women and children.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate made the remarks at the end of a two-day conference on
war- affected children in West Africa, jointly organized by the
governments of Ghana and Canada, under the auspices of the United
Nations and ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by foreign ministers of ECOWAS
states and Canada, as well as children's rights and conflict
resolution experts from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate noted that in the past, ECOWAS hesitated in taking
stringent measures against non-compromising countries on the
issues of good governance and democracy.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent times, the consequences of the attitude of
such governments are becoming unbearable, as manifested in rebel
leaders resorting to arms, apparently to restore democracy and
good governance with force.
</P>
<P>
"In the end, innocent women and children tend to be the most
victims of such wars, arising from bad governance and undemocratic
practices.
</P>
<P>
"We have, therefore, adopted measures that enable us to isolate
 recalcitrant governments from certain negotiations in the
sub-region, with the view to sanctioning them in the event of
protracted violation of the codes of good governance and
democracy."
</P>
<P>
Kouyate announced that as part of efforts to protect the
interest of war-affected children in the sub-region, the Canadian
government has provided 300,000 U.S. dollars for the
establishment of special units on the conflict resolution
mechanism of ECOWAS in the war zones.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Bus-Train Collision Kills Eight Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed
and more seriously injured Friday when a small passenger bus
rammed into a moving cargo train in Tanzania's northwestern
Shinyanga Region, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Shinyanga Regional Police Commander Wolfgang Gumbu was
quoted as saying that the cause of the accident was an attempt by
the bus driver to outrun the train at a railway crossing.
</P>
<P>
"The driver failed to pass through the crossing in time,
ramming into the engine of the goods train at full speed," he
said, adding that the moving train dragged the bus on the railway
line for about 100 meters before it came to a halt.
</P>
<P>
Five passengers died on the spot, another one died on the way
to the nearby Kahama District Hospital while two others were
pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The police authorities have appealed to relatives of victims to
go to the hospital to collect the bodies for burial as soon as
possible because the refrigeration at mortuary was out of order.

<P>
BELGRADE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav official has
called for undelayed implementation of the U.N. Resolution 1244
which provides for the return of Yugoslav army and Serb police
troops to Kosovo, the Tanjug news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Stanimir Vukichevich, chairman of Yugoslavia's Committee of
Cooperation with the U.N. administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), said
that only a full implementation of the U.N. resolution could
stabilize the situation in the region as he met with a delegation
of the U.N. Security Council in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the security outlook in Kosovo was grim and that
non-Albanian ethnic people were in a predicament, he stressed that
the root cause of the tension was that UNMIK and KFOR were not
seriously carrying out the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, head of the U.N. delegation Anwarul Chowdhury,
ambassador of Bangladesh to the U.N., called for close cooperation
between all parties concerned to strictly observe the U.N.
resolution and curb the violence in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns Have A Big Say in China's Economic Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Pixian County, in southwest China
's Sichuan Province, is famous for its construction of small towns.
</P>
<P>
Xipu Town in Pixian has invested more than 500 million yuan (
60.24 million U.S. dollars) in recent years in infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies and better services in the town have
attracted famous Chinese enterprises such as Datang
Telecommunications Co. Ltd and Shenlan Air Conditioner, and some
foreign big names such as Pepsi Cola.
</P>
<P>
A large number of local farmers have worked in enterprises or
have opened their own businesses. Xipu earns 1.8 billion yuan (217
million U.S. dollars) in industrial output value and 50 million
yuan (6 million U.S. dollars) in revenue annually.
</P>
<P>
Not far from the town, Hongguang and Wanchun towns have also
developed rapidly in a number of areas including high-tech,
agriculture and tourism. A large number of farmers pouring into
these towns has saved large areas of land from being used for
constructing houses.
</P>
<P>
China has 900 million farmers. Less arable land, a large number
of redundant rural laborers and low levels of intensive
cultivation have hampered the development of rural economy.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that through the construction of small towns, a
large number of rural redundant laborers will have, thus leaving
more arable land to farmers. In the long term, this will raise the
income of farmers and stimulate consumption in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> 51 Chinese Stowaways Repatriated from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-one Chinese stowaways have
been sent back to China from Japan and will face criminal charges,
police sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The stowaways, mostly residents from east China's Fujian
Province, were met by police at the Changle International Airport
in the province Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The stowaways, repatriated from Nagasaki in Japan, are under
police custody in Fuzhou, capital city of the province. This is
the second group of stowaways repatriated from Japan to Fuzhou
this year, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who attempted to illegally cross the
border at Fujian has declined considerably this year as well as
those stowaways repatriated from Japan, compared with the
corresponding period last year. This is due to the success of
Chinese police and a sluggish economy in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The police have been hunting "snakeheads," or people who
organized people to illegally cross border on a large scale since
the beginning of this year. In April alone, 58 snakeheads were
captured.

Addressing the Fourth Plenum of the 15th Communist Party of
China Central Committee held in Beijing in 1999, Jiang Zemin,
General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, reiterated that
the development of China's western regions and the construction of
small towns are all key strategic issues which bear great
importance on the national economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The significance of building small towns was also stressed at
the 15th National Congress of the CPC and the Third Plenary
Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Nongke Village, ten kilometers from Xipu Town, is a small

entertain tourists in their village.
</P>
<P>
The village now has 75 households engaged in planting flowers
and tourism activities. Last year, they received 800,000 visitors.
The income for local villagers exceeded 20,000 yuan (2,400 U.S.

China plans to build 4,000 small towns each with a population
of over 20,000 in the next five years. At the same time, 70,000
villages will also be built to remove 50 million surplus rural
laborers.

<HEADLINE> Black Sea Countries to Launch Anti-Pollution Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Six Black Sea states have signed
two agreements to back up a regional anti-pollution drive.
</P>
<P>
A Headquarters Agreement and a Privileges Agreement were sealed
at the end of a two-day meeting of the Black Sea and Danube River
Commission in Istanbul late Friday, reported the Anatolia News
Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Headquarters Agreement, Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey, was chosen as the venue of office of the permanent
secretariat of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Georgia will each
appoint a representative to this central office. Technical studies
regarding the Black Sea pollution will be carried out afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea and Danube River Commission was set up as the
executive body of the Convention on the Protection of Black Sea
from Pollution, which was signed within the framework of 1992
Bucharest Treaty.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that no serious steps had been taken since then
largely due to failure in forming a permanent secretariat to
coordinate implementation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that by setting up a permanent
headquarters the countries could expect international financial
institutions to provide financing for the implementation of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
Black Sea is an inner sea between southeast Europe and Asia
Minor, covering 400,000 square kilometers. Two large European
rivers, Danube and Dnieper, empty into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The growing river and sea pollution in recent years has caused
great concern of the littoral and neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Manila Not to Replace Negotiator for Hostage Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it will not replace Nur Misuari as its chief
negotiator for the release of 21 hostages held by the Muslim
extremist group Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Unless directed by President Joseph Estrada, the government
will not replace Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of
Muslim Mindanao, as the chief negotiator, National Security
Adviser Alexander Aguirre told reporters here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "mere propaganda" the threats made by the Abu
Sayyaf group Friday to behead foreign hostages if Misuari, former
leader of Moro National Liberation Front rebels, will not be
replaced as the negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado also said that no rebel group
could dictate the government who it wants to send as the
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf threatened Friday to behead some of the 21
hostages they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia, because they do
not want to talk with Misuari.
</P>
<P>
An Abu Sayyaf spokesman said that Nur Misuari is unacceptable
as the negotiator and his group wants to talk with the ambassadors
of the countries to which their captives belong.
</P>
<P>
The hostages are 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two
South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and a Filipino. The
hostages, who were abducted by the Abu Sayyaf in a resort in
Sipadan, Malaysia, Sunday night, are now in the Philippines' Sulu
Province.
</P>
<P>
"Misuari is trying to divide and rule us. Because if this we
decided tonight (Friday) to reject Misuari as the government
negotiator," the spokesman said. "Instead we demand the
ambassadors of the respective countries of these captives to
negotiate with us, and if they do not want, we will behead some of
the foreigners to teach them a lesson."
</P>
<P>
"We will execute the foreign captives and we will embarrass the
Philippine government," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said that it will exhaust all peaceful
means to resolve the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Acting Armed Forces Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim told reporters
that he received a lot of inquiries from foreign ambassadors based
in Manila asking about the condition of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said he assured them that the government will exert
all efforts for the safe release of the hostages as soon as
possible, but he refused to give a timetable.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to set a time frame when the hostages would be
freed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Calimlim, the hostages are being guarded by about
40 to 50 gunmen in Talipao in the southern Philippine island
province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim noted that government soldiers have sealed off the
area to prevent the kidnappers from escaping.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group, reckoned to number no more than 500, is
the most violent rebel group in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Severe Drought Warned in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will experience severe
drought due to insufficient rainfall, the Meteorological
Department in the country has warned.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily Saturday quoted a senior
meteorological official William Nyakwanda as saying that the
weather forecast system predicted the impending drought in most
parts of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
"Only parts of Western Province and the Coast region have so
far received rainfall, but we are afraid it might not be
sufficient," Nyakwanda said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told Kenyans to be prepared for hard times ahead as the
country is likely to experience serious famine.
</P>
<P>
The March to May rainy season failed to bring enough rainfall
this year. In most parts of Kenya, the short rain season was
delayed more than a month until mid-April.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of rains has lingered since last year, which
caused power rationing and difficult access to enough drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children Fund warned early this month that
some 700, 000 Kenyans were at immediate risk and an additional two
million people might be affected if the drought did not ease.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Police Search New Cult-Rented House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Police Friday
searched a house in Ndejje, off Kampala-Entebbe Road, which was
once occupied by members of the Movement for the Restoration of
the Ten Commandments of God, the New Vision daily reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Ndejje house, which belongs to Sgt. Julius Barigye of the
Uganda Peoples Defence Forces, was rented by the cult in 1998 for
seven months, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Seven policemen inspected the house this morning. They were
suspicious that bodies might have been hidden, but so far there
are no signs," Scholastica, Barigye's wife, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said that Kibwetere, the top leader of the cult, rented the
house through one of their friends only identified as Lwamutwe, a
cult member.
</P>
<P>
The cult paid 100,000 Uganda shillings per month in rent for
two bedroom house and moved out after demands to improve the house
were not met, she said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 55 bodies were exhumed from a house rented by the
cult members at the suburbs of Kampala, capital of Uganda, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cult burnt to death at least 530 followers in Kanungu in
southwestern Uganda on March 17. Since then mass graves have been
discovered on the properties of the cult leaders, bringing the
number of the dead to more than 1,000.

The proceedings began shortly after 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT),

WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson scored 24 points
as Philadelphia held off the Charlotte Hornets 81-76 in the

</P>
<P>
The Sixers were playing without starting point guard Eric Snow,

five series.

<P>
Philadelphia led by just two points with 4:26 remaining, but
Toni Kukoc nailed a 24-footer and Theo Ratliff had a tip-in and
two free throws that helped open a 73-66 bulge with 2:28 left.
</P>
<P>
Iverson knocked down a key 3-pointer with 1:55 remaining to
give Philadelphia a 76-68 lead. The Hornets made one last run at
the Sixers but Aaron McKie, Tyrone Hill and Kevin Olie made their
free throws down the stretch to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
The Sixers can close out the series with a victory at home on
Monday night.

<HEADLINE> China's Export Continues to Grow: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) --According to Chinese economists,
the country's foreign trade will continue to grow this year
following the steady monthly rises since the latter half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Their forecast is partly supported by the brisk transactions at
the 87th Chinese Export Commodities Fair, which ended Wednesday in
Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), 98,000 people attended the Fair, a 7.45
percent increase from that held last autumn.
</P>
<P>
Some 190 multinational corporations were also at the Fair, at
which Business deals worth 13.65 billion US dollars were clinched,
a 7.49 percent increase from 1999.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zenghui, deputy head of the China Import and Export Chamber
of Textile Industry, said the 87th Fair experienced brisk trading
on the very first day.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jie, Development Division Chief of MOFTEC, said the
success of the Fair is closely related to the improvement in the
overall economy and global trade, especially economic recovery in
Southeast Asia from the previous financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Due to the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis, in
the first half of 1999, China's exports was down by 4.6 percent
from the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, China's exports has been recovering since the latter
half of last year. In the first three months of this year, China
exported 15.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of commodities, up 39
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
More businesspeople from Southeast Asia attended the Fair. They
signed business deals worth 1.36 billion U.S. dollars with Chinese
enterprises. Information from Fair also shows that there was a
huge demand for Chinese commodities in European and American
countries.
</P>
<P>
Business deals signed between Chinese manufacturers and
businesspeople from the Middle East, Africa and Latin America also
increased marginally.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts warn that reforms in foreign trade should be
further expanded to make Chinese companies more competitive on the
international market.

confident of a 4.5-percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP)
this year,compared with a 3.2-percent increase last year, a senior
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we will attain the growth target we have
set for this year as we expect our economic fundamentals to
stabilize and their growth momentum to return to pre-crisis levels,
" said Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno at the forum of the
Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Cagayan de Oro, the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said the most likely sources of growth are the service
sector which is expected to take off from a growth of 4.4 percent
in the fourth quarter of 1999 to a rate of at least 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing will grow by at least 4 percent from a 3.1-
percent increase during the last quarter of 1999 and utilities
will accelerate to 5 percent to exceed its 4.7-percent jump in the
last quarter of 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the construction industry did not fare quite well last
year, Diokno said, the sector could return to its 1998 growth
level of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
"What we are really excited about are the normalization of the
agricultural sector and the promising growth of the mining and
quarrying sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The budget chief said the agricultural sector will return to a
normal path of 3- to 3.5-percent growth while the mining and
quarrying sector will return to its 1998 level of 8.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Introduce Strict Rules on Emission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
introduce more strict rules within one year to control emission
which has caused heavy air pollution in the capital valley,
according to the Ministry of Environment and Population.
</P>
<P>
Govinda Bhatta, secretary of the ministry, told the press here
Saturday that the new rules will include banning all the three-
wheelers other than electricity-operated ones, forbidding big
buses from entering the core city areas and creating no-traffic
areas in core city and heritage-protection areas.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the environment ministry will also introduce cleaner
vehicles and provide financial support and training to mechanics
to operate standard service to vehicle owners within the valley,"
Bhatta said.
</P>
<P>
Bhatta cautioned that environment regulation violators and
those failing to comply with stricter standards would be subject
to severe penalty in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
To step up its vehicle emission control campaign, the
environment ministry recently purchased two sets of equipment of
carbon monoxide measurement and two sets of smoke unit measurement
equipment along with four gas testers for vehicles with catalysts,
Bhatta said.
</P>
<P>
All the equipment will help implement EURO-I emission standards
set up by the European Union. The Nepali government decided last
year to apply the standards to all vehicles imported after
December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of polluting vehicles plying in the Kathmandu
valley have degraded the air quality in the valley and caused
damage not only to people's health, but also to the numerous
temples and monuments listed as heritage sites in the valley.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Troops Capture Abu Sayyaf Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops have
captured 80 percent of a camp of the Muslim extremist group Abu
Sayyaf, which is holding 27 hostages in Basilan, the southern
Philippines, a military spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Hilario Atendido, Southern Command spokesman, said
government troops succeeded in gaining control of 80 percent of
the terrain within the Abu Sayyaf camp at Ponoh Mahajid, Sumisip,
in Basilan, early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
"About 15 bunkers previously occupied by (rebel leader)
Khadaffy Janjalani and his control group were captured by the army
troops,"Atendido said.
</P>
<P>
About 50 bodies of Abu Sayyaf members have been buried by their
comrades in shallow graves in the vicinity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The remnants of Abu Sayyaf were also seen dragging bodies of
the recently killed and wounded comrades up the slopes of Mt.
Mahajid, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there is hope that the hostages are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
On March 20 Abu Sayyaf rebels took away more than 50 people
from two schools in Basilan as human shield after attacking a
government army post. But later the group freed more than 20
people and took the remaining 29 hostage.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demanded the release of two Abu Sayyaf members and
three others involved in the bombing of the World Trade Center in
New York in 1993.
</P>
<P>
When their demands were rejected, they claimed to have beheaded
two male hostages last week.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf, the most violent rebel group in the Philippines, is
also blamed for abducting 21 tourists from Sipadan,Malaysia,
Sunday. The hostages are now in the southern Philippine province
of Sulu.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ex-Freedom Fighters, White Farmers Agree to Fulfil Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's war veterans and white
commercial farmers Friday agreed to implement the peace deal
sealed last week to end violence on occupied farms and
immediately embarked on a tour of the farms.
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed to let the former freedom fighters remain on
the farms they have occupied until a program for orderly
resettlement currently being worked out is finalized, the Herald
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in Harare at Friday's meeting,
attended by representatives of the Commercial Farmers' Union
(CFU) and the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans'
Association.
</P>
<P>
The ex-fighters have occupied about 1,000 white farms since
February this year.
</P>
<P>
There have been clashes between war veterans and farmers in
recent months and, in some cases, fatal clashes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters at the end of their closed session, CFU
representative Nick Swanepoel said war veterans were expected to
stay peacefully on the farms until "we have worked out a program
to speedily resettle the people".
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel, a former CFU president, said farmers and war
veterans should work closely together as Zimbabweans and show the
world that "we can resolve the land issue on our own".
</P>
<P>
War veterans' leader Chenjerai Hunzvi described the meeting,
which lasted almost three hours, as fruitful.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We agreed to maintain the spirit to resolve the land
issue. This will be done through a program which should make it
possible to resettle people soon."
</P>
<P>
He called on all former freedom fighters to desist from
violence, adding that people who were purporting to be war
veterans and demanding bribes from farmers would be dealt with
severely.
</P>
<P>
He said no external influence would help Zimbabwe to resolve
the land issue.
</P>
<P>
The commercial farmers and the war veterans have had a series
of meetings in the last two weeks, including the initial one with
President Robert Mugabe, to find a lasting solution to the land
problem.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Economy Grows in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economy posted a
surprisingly strong expansion in the first quarter of this year by
growing more than 5 percent, The Nation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a projection by the Bank of Thailand, the report said
the economy will see a 4.5-percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in the economy, which was not broad-based, however,
could be attributed to a 30.4-percent growth in exports during the
first quarter compared with the same period of last year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing production index expanded by 8.8 percent in
the quarter compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Car production also recovered strongly by expanding 62.1
percent in the quarter, corresponding to a 97.3-percent growth in
car sales and a 68.8-percent jump in motorcycle sales.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, iron and steel production expanded by 26.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Export value continued to rise, increasing by 24.1 percent in
March from the same month last year while imports grew 24.8
percent, resulting in a higher trade surplus of 1.15 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus and gains of the service account contributed
to a current account surplus of 1.44 billion dollars in March. But
the capital account recorded a higher deficit due to foreign debt
repayment by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, foreign reserves stood at 32.3
billion dollars on April 21.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption had not yet strongly recovered, but trends
were improving on stronger sales by department stores, as well as
of cars and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Private investment showed positive signs in March as a result
of an increasing volume of cement sales, imports of capital goods
and number of commercial vehicles sold.
</P>
<P>
Failure of the economy to recover in a broad-based manner was
reflected in the ailing financial sector. The monetary base in the
first quarter of this year grew by only 1.8 percent while money
supply rose only 0.4 percent, lower than in the previous quarters.

<HEADLINE> China to Extend Loan for Dhaka Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China is to provide 9.5 billion
taka (around 190 million U.S. dollars) to Bangladesh for improving
water supply in Dhaka city, a Chinese diplomat disclosed here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Jinqi, economic and commercial counselor of
the Chinese Embassy here, the fund will be provided "on the
supplier's credit basis."
</P>
<P>
A five-member advance team from China has already conducted a
study on the project and expressed their interest in it. China is
expected to submit its final report to the Bangladeshi government
soon.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the project, as part of the Fourth Dhaka
Water Supply and Sanitation Project, is to increase the quantity
of water supplied to consumers by the introduction of a water
treatment plant and reduction of water losses through leak
detection and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The project proposal prepared by the project consultant said
the sanitation system in the Dhaka city area calls for immediate
attention with a view to preventing escalated environmental
degradation and epidemic outbreak of waterborne diseases and
checking rapid water sources pollution which at the present rate
is diminishing the chances of sustainable water supply in the city.
</P>
<P>
Besides China, Japan has already promised to provide 20 million
dollars for the project.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Service Sector Becomes Major GDP Contributor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The service sector in Bangladesh is
now contributing more than 49 percent to the gross domestic
product (GDP)after reorganization of different sectors under the
newly adopted national accounting system, The Financial Express
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources of the finance and planning
ministries as saying the relative contributions of the service and
industry sectors have increased over the years while those of
agriculture have declined.
</P>
<P>
The contributions of the agriculture sector dropped from about
30 percent in the early 1990s to 25.28 percent at present, but the
industry sector commanded 25.69 percent in the last financial year.
The contribution of the service sector stood at 49.03 percent in
the same year.
</P>
<P>
The share of the agriculture sector in the total GDP is
expected to be 25.47 percent, the service sector 48.86 percent and
the industry sector 25.67 percent at the end of the current
financial year.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that after improving the national accounting
system and increasing the number of sectors from 11 in the old
series to 15 in the new series, the latest sectored shares in the
GDP have been compiled.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the service sector has nine components
including wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants,
transport, storage and communications, financial intermediation,
real estate, renting and business activities, public
administration and defense, education,health and social work,
community, social and personal services.

<HEADLINE> India, China Begin Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A fresh round of border talks
between China and India started here Friday with the beginning of
the 12th session of the India-China Joint Working Group on the
Boundary Question (JWG-XII).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Indian delegations to the current JWG session,
which will last for two days, are headed by Chinese Vice Foreign
Minister Yang Wenchang and Indian Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Besides discussing boundary-related issues, the two sides will
also review recent developments in bilateral relations and
exchange views on regional and international issues, an Indian
External Affairs Ministry press release said.
</P>
<P>
The last session of the JWG was held in Beijing in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, Yang also had a meeting with Indian
External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh, during which the two
sides had a "friendly and candid" talk, sources with the Chinese
delegation said.
</P>
<P>
Singh was quoted as saying that as two major nations in the
world with a history of ancient civilization, India and China
shoulder grave responsibility, not only to their own peoples, but
also to the entire humanity.
</P>
<P>
Despite some differences between the two countries, both sides
should make efforts to promote their cooperation in various fields,
Singh said, adding that the Indian side will continue to work for
the improvement and further development of India-China relations
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed to the fact that it is a major component of China'
s foreign policy to actively develop a goodneighborly, friendly
and cooperative relationship with India, an important neighbor of
China's.
</P>
<P>
"A normal and friendly Sino-Indian relationship is not only in
the fundamental interest of people of both countries, but also
conducive to the promotion of peace, stability and development in
Asia and the whole world," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming state visit to China by Indian President K. R.
Narayanan will definitely lay a fine and solid foundation for the
further development of Sino-Indian relations in the new century,
he stressed.

BRUSSELS -- The euro sank to yet another record low against the
United States dollar Friday, its third within a week, despite
Thursday's increase of the benchmark lending interest rate by the
European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
The single currency once fell to 0.9030 dollars on the New York
foreign exchange market, compared with 0.9031 dollars a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the ECB raised interest rates by a quarter
percentage point to push its main lending rate up to 3.75 percent,
along with raising its other two key rates by a quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
The bank last increased its rates by a quarter-point on March
16 and enacted an earlier quarter-point hike on February 3 to beef
up the single currency now being used as credit units in 11 of the
15 European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the ECB's announcement of rate hike Thursday, the
euro hit a record low against the dollar of 0.9150 cents. (Euro-

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government asked a federal court Friday
to split Microsoft Corp. into two separate companies to curb its
monopoly power over the system that runs most personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, joined by 19 states, asked that the
giant software company be split into one company to produce the
Windows operating system and another to handle other software
applications, like spreadsheets and databases. The government
asked that the companies be barred from reuniting for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page proposal was submitted to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson after the close of financial markets this
afternoon. Jackson ruled April 3 that Microsoft repeatedly broke
federal antitrust laws intended to maintain fair competition by
using its monopoly power in computer operating systems to crush
rivals.
</P>
<P>
In advance of Friday's filing, Microsoft founder and Chairman
Bill Gates had said consumers will suffer if his company is broken
up by the government. "We wouldn't have Windows today if it hadn't
been for the Office group and the Windows group working together,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, if accepted by the judge, would bar Gates, and
officers and directors of the current company from owning stock in
more than one of the new companies.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said that "this is the right remedy
for the right time. Our proposal will stimulate competition,
promote innovation, and give consumers new and better choices in
the marketplace."
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has said it plans to appeal Jackson's ruling and
company executives have insisted that no laws were broken. (US-

Investors feared, therefore, the Federal Reserve Board would raise

ROME -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced Friday evening that
it was pulling out of its strategic alliance with Italian carrier
Alitalia, citing uncertainties surrounding the future of Milan's
troubled new airport Malpensa 2000 as the main reason for its
decision.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by KLM said that the Dutch carrier had
decided, "after careful consideration," to break its accord with
Alitalia, judged to be "unsustainable" because of the "continued
uncertainty" about Malpensa and the Italian airline's
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
It said that continuing the alliance would constitute an "
unacceptable business risk under the present circumstances, a risk
which would endanger the financial position of KLM, its
profitability and its attractiveness to other potential partners."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that, under the terms of the accord,
Alitalia was supposed to be privatized by June 30, 2000, but "the
Italian government has indicated that this will not be possible."
</P>
<P>
It also said that Alitalia would be "obliged" to return the 200
billion lire (about 102 million U.S. dollars) which KLM
contributed towards the costs of upgrading Malpensa, originally a
small military airport. (Italy-Airlines)

<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Olympic
Committee (AOC) has ordered all potential Olympians to sign
contracts containing the tough anti-doping clause.
</P>
<P>
According to the AOC, Australian Olympians who test positive
for performance enhancing drugs will be forced to repay all public
funding received for training in the build up for the Sydney 2000
Games.
</P>
<P>
AOC secretary-general Craig McLatchey said any athlete who had
not signed the pledge would not be selected for the Olympics.

More than 1,000 of the 1,200 potential Olympic competitors have
already signed the contracts. The remainder, mostly foreign-based
athletes, were expected to sign soon.

<P>
Athletes returning positive tests would have to repay all
funding provided by the AOC and its sponsors in the buildup to the
games plus any grants received through its medal incentive scheme.
Coaches and support staff face life bans from the Olympics if

<HEADLINE> Exporters from West China Encouraged by Export Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Exporters from the western
China region at the 87th China Commodity Exports Fair, which has
just concluded in this capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
are encouraged by an increase of export transactions.
</P>
<P>
Although total exports volume cannot compare to their
counterparts in China's east, higher growth margins were recorded,
indicating a great market potential.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, for example, clinched 148.
9 million U.S. dollars worth of exports contracts at the biannual
event, an increase of 12.9 percent from the previous spring
session.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province saw its exports volume increase by 75 percent,
Gansu 73 percent and Chongqing 63 percent at the country's largest
export fair. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region even had a jump
of 374 percent in exports.
</P>
<P>
A trade delegate from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region told
Xinhua that Ningxia's exports picked up by 24 percent to 340
million U.S. dollars last year, much higher than the country's
averaged eight percent export growth.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhongfeng, a trade official from Xinjiang, said that the
autonomous region covers a sixth of China's land area. However,
only a small amount of the rich local resources has been developed,
hampered by outdated infrastructure and outdated industrial
structure.
</P>
<P>
One of the major problems facing exporters in the western
regions is how to turn cheap raw materials into high value-added
export products.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's strategy to develop the western
regions on a large scale is to help upgrade the transport and
information infrastructure in these areas. This will no doubt give
a major impetus to rapid export growth in the west.

<HEADLINE> Australia Wants to Mend Relationship With Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia wants to mend its
relationship with Indonesia and would look to the future, not the
past, in doing so, Prime Minister John Howard said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he is interested in Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid's proposal for a meeting of the leaders of
Indonesia, Australia and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I am interested to read President Wahid's suggestion," Howard
told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio in France, the
third leg of his overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
"I will explore it. I don't reject it. I want to know more
about it, I want to know whether it is something that has been
thought through," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid earlier said he wanted to join Australian Prime
Minister John Howard and East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao in
talks to strengthen ties between Indonesia, Australia and East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
"My message to President Wahid is that I want to look to the
future, not to the past," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He added that If there are ways which the leaders of Australia
and Indonesia and Gusmao can come together, he would be happy to
explore them.
</P>
<P>
Howard said it was inevitable that the relationship between
Australia and Indonesia was strained following the events in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
He said he would visit Indonesia in the future, but has no
immediate plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
"My view is that the relationship was put under strain. That
was inevitable," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"I respect what President Wahid has done, I think he has done
very good things for Indonesia and I have been keen to see the
relationship rebuild, but it can't rebuild overnight," he said.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 24 persons were injured
in a train accident in South Jakarta on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to The Jakarta Post Saturday, a commuter train
heading for Bogor, about 60 kilometers south of Jakarta, careened

<HEADLINE> Former Malaysian DPM's Appeal Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's appeal against his conviction of
four corruption charges and a six-year jail term was dismissed by
the Court of Appeal here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Upholding the conviction and the sentence imposed by the High
Court on April 14, 1999, Court of Appeal President Justice Lamin
Yunus said the court found no valid reason to depart from the
findings of the High Court judge.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sentenced to six years in jail on each of the four
corruption charges of interfering in police investigations into
allegations of sexual misconduct against him. High Court Justice S.
Augustine Paul however ordered the sentences to run concurrently
with effect from that day.
</P>
<P>
Anwar filed the appeal thereafter against the conviction, for
which the Court of Appeal president sat with two justices at the
hearing of the appeal for nine days before handing down the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, is currently being jointly tried with his adopted
brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja, 39, a businessman, on
separate charges of sodomizing Azizan Abu Bakar, 39, the former
driver of Anwar's wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was dismissed as the country's deputy prime minister and
finance minister on September 2, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Holds Second Round of Senate Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Thais voted for the second time
Saturday for a new senate after 78 of the 200 winners in the
country's first senate election last month were found to have won
dishonestly.
</P>
<P>
Though criticized for the expenditure on the March 4 senate
election, the election commission said it would choose to hold
elections again and again rather than let even one cheat go to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
A fresh election would cost hundreds of millions of baht, but
the country could save hundreds of billions of baht in the future
if the parliament was free of corrupt legislators, election
commissioner Yuwarat Kamolvej said.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic that there would not be a third senate poll,
as all candidates should by now be afraid of suspension.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai pledged financial support for
the commission if it had to call further elections.
</P>
<P>
The government would also cooperate with the commission in
amending electoral rules to increase efficiency in fighting fraud,
Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Defense Ministry deployed 1,620
personnel from the army, navy and air force in all 35 provinces,
where campaign violations were found, to help keep peace and
order.
</P>
<P>
The election commission said the 78 winners had been
disqualified mainly because each of their victories had in some
way been tainted by vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
But the commission said it lacked evidence that the 78 would-be
senators had masterminded the vote-buying, so it could not prevent
them from running again in Saturday's election.
</P>
<P>
It said the violations included making promises to offer some
kind of benefit in return for votes, holding entertainment shows
for voters and using influence to intimidate voters.
</P>
<P>
The March 4 election was widely seen as the first test of the
country's political reform under its 1997 constitution, which
seeks to foster democracy and clean up politics.
</P>
<P>
Though tainted by vote-buying, the election was still billed as
a contest between the people's emerging power and traditional
money politics.
</P>
<P>
A local major newspaper called it "a watershed in the ongoing
democratic development in Thailand."
</P>
<P>
The election marked the first time since the country adopted
constitutional rule in 1932 that senators had been elected rather
than appointed.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, senators, who will serve six-year terms,
have the power to screen legislation proposed by the government,
question leaders and other officials and remove corrupt office-
holders, including the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Military Reserves Called to Active Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
called out all regular reserves for active duty with effect from
May 1, the Defense Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga who is also minister of defense,
announced Friday evening that members of the Sri Lankan Army, Navy
and Air Force Regular Reserve will be on active service with
effect from May 1 this year, the ministry said in an announcement.
</P>
<P>
They are requested to report for duty to the nearest service
camp or in case of the army to their respective regimental centers
between May 1 and 10, the announcement added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the Sri Lankan government has
called all reservists to active service since civil war broke out
17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels are trying
to recapture the northern Jaffna Peninsula, which was their former
stronghold,after they captured the key northern Elephant Pass army
base, a strategic military complex linking the peninsula to the
mainland, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The military forces have been reportedly suffering a shortage
of manpower in the past months as they faced increased pressure
from the Tamil rebels who have been fighting a war against the
government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and
east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Hearing on Immunity Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The three-day hearings to strip
Chile's lifetime senator Augusto Pinochet of his parliamentary
immunity entered its last day here Friday, with lawyers on both
sides giving their final arguments.
</P>
<P>
The proceedings began shortly after 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT),
earlier than previously planned, after the judges decided to allow
Pinochet's Defense Attorney Ricardo Rivadeneira 1.5 hours to
summarize his closing argument, rather than only one hour.
</P>
<P>
The seven plaintiff attorneys were to have a total of 30
minutes each, spanning Thursday and Friday, to explain their
charges against the 84-year-old former strongman.
</P>
<P>
Charges include accusations that Pinochet ordered the "caravan
of death" killings of at least 74 opponents of his regime in
October 1973, one month after he ousted President Salvador Allende
in a military coup.
</P>
<P>
The hearings will decide whether Pinochet should be deprived
of his immunity as a senator-for-life, a post he created for
himself in the constitution written by his 1973-90 regime.
</P>
<P>
If he is stripped of immunity, he might stand trial for the
killings and other criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile from Britain last
month after British authorities decided he was unfit in terms of
health and age to stand trial. He was detained for 16 months in
London.

SHENYANG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Anshan Iron and Steel
Company (Angang), one of China's steel giants based in Liaoning
Province in the northeast, exported 280,000 tons of rolled steel
in the first quarter of this year, 12 times that a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange earnings from exports reached 59 million U.S.
dollars, said company officials, who attributed the good economic
results to the company's large-scale technical renovation and
adjustment of product mix over the last few years.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Smokers Obey No-smoking Rule: Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A recent surprise inspection of
smoking in Beijing's public areas found smokers are not puffing in
places with no-smoking sign, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The surprise examination, covering Beijing's Xicheng and
Changping districts, was conducted by the Standing Committee of
the Beijing Municipal People's Congress (BMPC).
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of our local regulation forbidding smoking
in public places in fairly good," said Lu Laishun, a BMPC official.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, in effect since May 15, 1996, stipulates that
public places should have no-smoking signs posted. Persons
ignoring the no-smoking rule can be fined 10 yuan (1.20 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result of the regulation, in the past four years,
the population of Beijing's smokers has decreased by about ten
percent each year, said Tian Xianyang, an expert with the Beijing
Municipal Health Education Institution.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the BMPC Standing Committee will launch other
surprise inspections, especially in governmental buildings.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Calls Banking System Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said the
Philippine banking system is sound and stable despite a run on
several local banks following the closure of the Urban Bank this
week and asked the public to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
"Depositors need not worry about their cash placement in the
banks as the local banks are not in any trouble at all," the
Central Bank of the Philippines said in a statement published here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Albeto Reyes, deputy central bank governor, said some local
banks which suffered heavy withdrawals are very solvent and their
management is very competent.
</P>
<P>
The present problem for these banks is part of wild rumors
spread by irresponsible people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Jose Pardo also said Friday that the entire
banking system in the Philippines remains sound and there is no
systemic risk.
</P>
<P>
The Urban Bank's closure stemmed from panic withdrawal of
nearly half its deposits since last month, following its downgrade
from a commercial bank to a thrift bank.
</P>
<P>
To prevent further runs on deposits, the government and
commercial banks would set up separate funds to support cash-
strapped banks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Bankers' Association of the Philippines, an umbrella body
for about 50 local banks, said Friday that it will set up a
liquidity pool to support financial institutions which may require
such funds.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will also open a special funding facility to
help banks hit by high withdrawals, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seeks Swiss Help to Find Soeharto Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman Friday repeated his appeal to the Swiss
government to help the Indonesian authorities find former
President Soeharto's financial wealth which might be hidden in
that country.
</P>
<P>
"Up to the present time, the Indonesian Embassy (in Switzerland)
has been making special cooperation (with local officials) to
search for the wealth," Darusman was quoted by national newspapers
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the government was awaiting reports from
Indonesian embassies on foreign assets owned by the former first
family.
</P>
<P>
Time magazine of the United States reported in May last year
that 9 billion U.S. dollars of Soeharto's fortune was transferred
from Switzerland to a nominee bank account in Austria.
</P>
<P>
But the Attorney General's Office, which is investigating
Soeharto on corruption charges, still has not found a dime.
</P>
<P>
Darusman admitted that Soeharto's money may have been laundered
abroad. Therefore, he said, the Attorney General's Office is
strengthening its audit forensics team.
</P>
<P>
Darusman said the Attorney General's Office itself is
concentrating its work on possibly seizing the former first family
's assets in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope all these efforts will be successful in the near
future,"he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reluctance of his office to confiscate the
Granadi Building in South Jakarta, where Soeharto's charity
foundations were based, Darusman said his office cannot seize the
building yet, as preparations are still under way.
</P>
<P>
Two days after obtaining approval from the South Jakarta
District Court to seize the Granadi Building, five state
prosecutors confiscated documents relating to activities of the
Supersemar Foundation, one of seven charitable foundations chaired
by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Darusman said his office delayed the seizure of the land and
the building to avoid misunderstanding that would likely come from
several parties, including Soeharto's lawyers and supporters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if Soeharto is proven guilty, all of his
assets could be confiscated.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Up in Ecuador Despite Dollarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Ecuador rose sharply
despite the dollarization of the economy, in force since April 1,
said the Ecuadorian National Institute for Statistics and Census (
INEC) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
INEC director German Rojas said that April's inflation index
was 10.2 percent, double that of the same month last year, and
also three points above last month.
</P>
<P>
The INEC data also showed that accumulated inflation of the
first four months of this year reached 49.1 percent, which
according to Rojas, means that inflation is accelerating instead
of slowing.
</P>
<P>
The INEC estimates show that the sector that caused the jump in
prices was food, especially beef and chicken, as well as beverages,
transportation, clothes and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The family "basic basket" was rated this month at 245.00 U.S.
dollars, while the average income of Ecuadorians was 113.70 U.S.
dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian cities that contributed the most to April's
inflation were Loja and Guayaquil, capitals of the Loja and Guayas
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The increase of salaries and stipends ordered by the government
have also showed a positive impact on purchasing power, said the
INEC.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Grand Master (GM) Judit Polgar of

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The government of Jilin
Province in northeast China plans to invest over 109 million yuan
(about 13 million U.S. dollars) to protect the Xianghai Nature
Reserve, an important wetland for red-crowned cranes and white
storks.
</P>
<P>
A scheme aimed at improving the ecological environment around
the wetland has recently been approved by the provincial
government. And the project will be carried out in three phases
before its completion in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Xianghai nature reserve in western Jilin is located where
the Inner Mongolian Plateau and the Northeast China Plain meet.
Covering more than 100,000 hectares, it is home to 253 species of
birds, including red-crowned and white cranes, white storks, and
gold and gray vultures. The site was designated as a national
reserve in 1986 and a nature reserve by the United Nations
Wildlife Fund in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jilin has spent a total of 80 million yuan (9.
6 million dollars) to build telecommunications, communications and
other infrastructure facilities in the nature reserve in a bid to
attract tourists. The reserve now receives more than 40,000
visitors each year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Group Threatens to Kill Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Muslim extremist
group Abu Sayyaf has threatened to behead some of the 21 hostages
they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia because they do not want to
talk with a government negotiator.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Zamboanga City, the southern
Philippines,an Abu Sayyaf spokesman told Radio Mindanao Network
Friday night that Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region
of Muslim Mindanao, is unacceptable as negotiator.
</P>
<P>
He said his group wants to talk with the ambassadors of the
countries to which their captives belong.
</P>
<P>
The hostages are 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two
South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino. The
hostages,who were abducted by Abu Sayyaf in a resort in Sipadan,
Malaysia,Sunday night, are now in the Philippines' Sulu Province.
</P>
<P>
"Misuari is trying to divide and rule us. Because of this we
decided tonight (Friday) to rejected Misuari as the government
negotiator," the spokesman said. "Instead we demand the
ambassadors of the respective countries of these captives to
negotiate with us,and if they do not want, we will behead some of
the foreigners to teach them a lesson."
</P>
<P>
"We will execute the foreign captives and we will embarrass the
Philippine government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine government said it will exhaust all
peaceful means to resolve the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Acting Armed Forces Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim told reporters
that he received a lot of inquiries from foreign ambassadors based
in Manila about the condition of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said he assured them that the government will exert
all efforts for the safe release of the hostages as soon as
possible, but he refused to give a timetable.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to set a time frame when the hostages would be
freed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Calimlim, the hostages are being guarded by about
40 to 50 gunmen in Talipao in the southern Philippine island
province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim noted that government soldiers have sealed off the
area to prevent the kidnappers from escaping.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group, reckoned to number no more than 500, is
reportedly the most violent rebel group in the Philippines.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee announced
Friday that it will postpone a hearing on the federal raid to
snatch Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The hearing, scheduled for Wednesday, was put off to an
undetermined date after the Justice Department informed the
committee it could not meet a Friday deadline to supply all
documents related to the surveillance of the home, the possibility
of weapons in the home, the obtaining of search warrants and the
conduct of the operation.
</P>
<P>
Federal agents forcefully seized Elian from the home of his
Miami relatives on April 22 and reunited him with his father Juan
Miguel Gonzalez. Elian and his father are staying at an estate at
Wye River east of Washington.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate Republicans criticized Attorney General Janet Reno
for the forceful seizure and demanded hearings to examine the
legal implications of the raid.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a Republican from Texas, Friday
accused the administration of "character assassination designed to
discredit" Elian's Miami family.  (US-Congress-Elian)

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government asked a federal court Friday
to split Microsoft Corp. into two separate companies to curb its
monopoly power over the system that runs most personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, joined by 19 states, asked that the
giant software company be split into one company to produce the
Windows operating system and another to handle other software
applications, like spreadsheets and databases. The government
asked that the companies be barred from reuniting for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page proposal was submitted to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson after the close of financial markets this
afternoon. Jackson ruled April 3 that Microsoft repeatedly broke
federal antitrust laws intended to maintain fair competition by
using its monopoly power in computer operating systems to crush
rivals.
</P>
<P>
In advance of Friday's filing, Microsoft founder and Chairman
Bill Gates had said consumers will suffer if his company is broken
up by the government. "We wouldn't have Windows today if it hadn't
been for the Office group and the Windows group working together,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, if accepted by the judge, would bar Gates, and
officers and directors of the current company from owning stock in
more than one of the new companies.(US-Court-Microsoft)

MOSCOW -- New Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori arrived in
Russian city of St. Petersburg on Friday evening for a three-day
working visit and will hold an informal meeting with Russian
President-elect Vladimir Putin on bilateral ties Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first overseas trip by Mori after coming onto post
of cabinet head earlier this month. Before Mori, none of Japanese
prime ministers selected Russia as the first state to visit.
</P>
<P>
Putin, accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Culture
Minister Mikhail Shvydkoi, Trade Minister Mikhail Fradkov and
Communication Minister Leonid Reiman, also arrived in St.
Petersburg on Friday evening, reported Russian media.

The two leaders will also discuss cooperation between the two
states in economic, trade, military and high-tech fields, he said.

ROME -- Italy's new Prime Minister Giuliano Amato won a
confidence vote in the Lower House Friday evening with 319 ayes to
298 noes and five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Before a make-or-break Lower House confidence vote in his
government, Amato delivered a speech in which he stressed that he
was not driven by ambitions to lead the center-left at next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
The former Socialist, who was sworn in as premier by President
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi Wednesday, told the Lower House after a 13-
hour-long confidence debate that a system which confuses premier-
ship with leadership is a sick political system. "I can assure you
that I don't care what my role will be," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amato was chosen to lead the center-left through to the end of
its legislature in April 2001 after the resignation of Massimo D'
Alema, who quit in the wake of the coalition's humiliating defeat
in regional elections held on April 16.
</P>
<P>
Amato also softened his line on electoral reform, ahead of May'
s referendum on abolishing proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
If won, the referendum would require parliament to remove the
present 25 percent of the Lower House elected proportionally,
thereby strengthening the two-party system, boosting government
stability and diminishing the power of smaller parties. (Italy-

<HEADLINE> FA Adopts Rugby Rule  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England will adopt the "10-yard rule" used in rugby in an effort
to stamp out dissent.
</P>
<P>
The new rule, which allows the referee to move the free-kicks
on 10 yards if players show open disagreement, will apply to the
Premiership and from the first round of the FA Cup proper.
</P>
<P>
The FA and the FA Premier League have agreed to adopt the
experimental 10-yard advancement rule next season
</P>
<P>
The Football League is likely to follow suit, meaning that the
provision could be in effect for the first Nationwide League
matches of next season, starting on August 12.
</P>
<P>
From next season, any player who dissents, fails to retreat or
deliberately throws the ball away when a direct or indirect free-
kick is awarded must be booked and the ball moved forward by 10
yards.
</P>
<P>
But unlike rugby, the ball will be moved towards the centre of
the goal posts rather than parallel to the touchline.
</P>
<P>
Free-kicks will not convert into penalties if moving the ball
takes it inside the penalty area. This will result in direct free-
kicks in the area for the first time.
</P>
<P>
However, the ball cannot be placed inside the six-yard box.
</P>
<P>
Unlike rugby, referees will not be able to move the ball more
than once towards the goal. Rugby referees can repeatedly move the
ball on and take play to within five yards of the try-line if
dissent persists.
</P>
<P>
Instead, football referees will be allowed to hand out a second
yellow card.
</P>
<P>
The rule has already been tested with some success in Jersey,
the Central Midlands Football League and the Auto-Windscreens
Shield.
</P>
<P>
A review will take place at the end of the 2000-2001 season to
assess how effective the rule is.
</P>
<P>
An FA statement said: "The FA and the FA Premier League have
agreed to adopt the experimental 10-yard advancement rule next
season. It is expected that, in the next few weeks, the Football
League will also adopt it."

<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy
could be out for as long as a year, after sustaining another
injury to his knee in training.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch international ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament
on Friday and PSV Eindhoven have confirmed he could be out for
between eight and 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Van Nistelrooy was set to join Manchester United in a record 18.
5 million pounds move on Tuesday before he failed his medical.
</P>
<P>
PSV spokesman Pedro Salazar-Hewitt said: "A new injury has
occurred which has caused a rupture of his anterior cruciate
ligament. In the next few weeks a decision will be made on when an
operation will take place."
</P>
<P>
"After that operation he will have to wait a minimum of eight
months before he can be fit again. He is out for the rest of the
year and it could be a year before he is back again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United have said they are monitoring Van Nistelrooy'
s condition and have yet to rule out a move, but this latest twist
is almost certain to scupper the Premiership champions' interest.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Policing Bill Draws Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Nationalists and hard-line
unionists in Northern Ireland Saturday reacted angrily to the
leaked copy of the policing bill which confirms the change of the
name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic and Labor Party deputy leader Seamus
Mallon called on the British government to "grasp the policing
nettle" by implementing change and not to hide behind legislation.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein accused the government of backtracking on changing
the RUC's badge.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Unionist Party said the government should never
have considered changing the force's name, which the Bill proposes
should be the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists have already expressed their opposition to
the name change, but have not yet reacted to the bill.
</P>
<P>
The original recommendations of changes that the RUC should
undergo were outlined in the Patten report on the future of
policing in Northern Ireland, after the commission chaired by the
former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten, consulted widely last
year.
</P>
<P>
The 50-page Police Northern Ireland Bill obtained by the BBC
says the Northern Ireland Secretary is to consult the RUC chief
constable, the Police Association and the new policing board on
the design of emblems and flag for the new police service.
</P>
<P>
Mallon said that ran counter to the government's promise to
implement the Patten report in full.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party recently adopted a policy which would
prevent it going into a new power-sharing government with Sinn
Fein if the RUC name is not retained.

<P>
However, state organizations revealed that the FARC military
chief ordered attacks "to shake the oligarchy," without regard for
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The movement, which for the time being will be underground, was
launched by the FARC in the zone of distension in the south of the
country.
</P>
<P>
A document said the FARC military chief Jorge Briceno is
organizing "a strategic plan," that contemplates attacks and the
increase of men "to back the conversations with force."
</P>
<P>
The FARC, the biggest and older guerrilla organization in the
country, has been holding peace talks since October, after the
government demilitarized an area of 42,000 square kilometers in
five municipalities in the departments of Caqueta (in the south)
and Meta (in the east of the country).
</P>
<P>
Colombia Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Tapias said
that the political movement "lacks an ideology and it only moves
for profit."
</P>
<P>
The army accused the FARC of recruiting children and old
peasant men and of threatening them with evicting them of their
hometowns if they do not enter the movement.

<HEADLINE> German Archaeologists Study Axumite Civilization of Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of German
archaeologists are undertaking researches on Ethiopia's Axumite
civilization which can be traced back to about 2000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The team leader Helmut Ziegert told reporters here Saturday
that their research, funded by the German Hamburg University, has
incorporated extensive excavation works as well as thorough
historical analyses and interpretations.
</P>
<P>
The archaeological mission has conducted surveillance on
untouched sites interlocked with environmental features that would
serve as an impetus for further researches in the area, Ziegert
said.
</P>
<P>
The birthplace of the Axumite civilization is situated in Axum,
a town of about 620 kilometers north of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
According to Ziegert, they are going to focus on untouched
sites in a bid to discover "new findings on basin sediments and
antiquity inscriptions" during the Axumite period.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they will also offer technical trainings to their
Ethiopian counterparts engaged in similar activities while doing
the research in Ethiopia in the coming five years, he said.
