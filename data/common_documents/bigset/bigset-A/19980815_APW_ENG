	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Chris Hoiles became the ninth major leaguer and
first catcher to hit two grand slams in a game Friday night,
leading the Baltimore Orioles to a 15-3 rout of the Cleveland
Indians.
	   Hoiles hit his seventh career grand slam in the third off
Charles Nagy (10-8), who yielded 11 of Baltimore's runs. With two
outs in the eighth against left-hander Ron Villone, Hoiles hit a
406-foot (125-meter) shot to left on a 3-2 pitch that sailed inside
the foul pole to tie the record.
	   Robin Ventura of the Chicago White Sox was the last player to
hit two grand slams, on Sept. 4, 1995 against Texas. Hoiles is the
third Orioles player to do it, joining Jim Gentile and Frank
Robinson.
	   Eric Davis led off Baltimore's five-run third with a single to
extend his hitting streak to 29 games, longest in the majors this
season.
	   The Orioles won for the ninth time in 11 games and improved to a
major league-best 26-7 since the All-Star break.
 &UR; Tigers 13, Athletics 4 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Damion Easley hit his first career grand slam to
help the Detroit Tigers snap a nine-game losing streak.
	   Justin Thompson (10-9) pitched six innings, allowing four runs
(one earned) and four hits, walking three and striking out seven.
A.J. Sager pitched three innings for his first save.
	   Blake Stein (4-7) dropped to 0-2 in his last five starts,
allowing six runs on six hits in four innings.
 &UR; Yankees 6, Rangers 4 &QC; 
	   In New York, Bernie Williams and Chuck Knoblauch hit solo homers
as New York extended its latest winning streak to nine and knocked
Texas out of first place in the AL West.
	   Andy Pettitte (14-6) won for the eighth time in his last nine
decisions, and the Yankees (89-29) improved to 60 games over .500,
one short of the team record set in 1939, when the Yankees finished
106-45.
	   New York beat the Rangers for the fifth time in six games this
season, improving its home record to 47-8. Texas lost for the fifth
time in six games and fell a half-game behind Anaheim.
 &UR; Angels 7, Blue Jays 5 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Tim Salmon drove in two runs as the Anaheim Angels
beat the Toronto Blue Jays for the first time this season.
	   The Angels ended the Blue Jays five-game winning streak and
improved to 1-5 vs. Toronto this season.
	   Craig Shipley went 3-for-4 for the Angels, who have won five of
their last six.
	   Salmon hit a sacrifice fly in the first, and his RBI double in
the fourth gave the Angels a 6-2 lead.
 &UR; White Sox 14, Mariners 2 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Frank Thomas homered to cap a nine-run sixth inning
and Mike Sirotka pitched 7 1-3 strong innings as the Chicago White
Sox routed the Seattle Mariners.
	   Albert Belle drove in four runs and Thomas had three RBIs for
the White Sox, whose nine-run outburst matched their biggest of the
season. Chicago has won seven of its last 10.
	   Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. went 3-for-4 but remained stuck on 41
homers. He hasn't homered since July 30, a stretch of 54 at-bats.
	   Sirotka (12-10) won for the fourth time in his last five starts,
retiring 12 straight before Rich Amaral hit a one-out single in the
eighth.
 &UR; Red Sox 13, Twins 12 &QC; 
	   In Boston, rookie Donnie Sadler hit a two-run single in the
seventh inning as Boston held off Minnesota in a wild game.
	   The two teams combined for 32 hits and every starter got at
least one hit.
	   Trailing by two runs, the Twins loaded the bases with one out in
the ninth off Tom Gordon, who gave up an RBI groundout to Marty
Cordova before getting Ron Coomer on a grounder to third for his
34th save.
	   Sadler drove in three runs for the Red Sox, who trailed 6-0 in
the third inning and 9-8 in the fifth. Sadler's single to left off
Travis Baptist (0-1) drove home Troy O'Leary and Jason Varitek in
the seventh to snap an 11-11 tie.
	   Mike Stanley, Mo Vaughn, John Valentin and Damon Buford also had
two RBIs for the Red Sox, who lead the AL wild-card race by 7{
games over Texas.
 &UR; Royals 11, Devil Rays 9 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Johnny Damon homered and tripled, and
Dean Palmer drove in four runs as Kansas City beat Tampa Bay.
	   Jose Offerman, who has hit safely in 32 of his last 33 games,
had three singles as the Royals beat the Devil Rays for the fifth
time in six tries and dropped the expansion team to a
franchise-worst 27 games under .500 (46-73).
	   Rolando Arrojo (11-9), who pitched a three-hit, shutout against
the Royals on May 6, lasted only 3 2-3 innings and gave up six runs
on seven hits.
	   Chris Haney (5-5) gave up five hits and three runs in six
innings and picked up his first win as a starter since April 15.
Scott Service got the last seven outs for his third save.

<TEXT>
	   ORCHARD PARK, New York (AP) _ Carolina's John Kasay connected on
all four of his field goal attempts, but quarterback Kerry Collins
may have suffered a broken nose in the victory.
	   Kasay connected on field goals of 20, 37, 46 and 49 yards and
improved to 9-for-9 overall for the Panthers (2-0).
	   Collins, Carolina's fourth-year quarterback, was 12-of-23 for
138 yards before leaving the game with an apparent broken nose just
before halftime. Collins, who suffered a broken jaw last preseason,
will have X-rays Saturday in Charlotte.
	   Rob Johnson was 6-of-11 for 122 yards and added 27 yards on four
rushes for Buffalo (0-2).
 &UR; Falcons 7, Lions 3
	   In Pontiac, Michigan, Steve DeBerg's comeback got off to a shaky
start, but a 29-yard touchdown pass by Chris Chandler turned out to
be enough for Atlanta (1-1).
	   DeBerg, 44, a 17-year NFL veteran making his first appearance
since 1993, entered the game with 9:50 left in the second quarter
and was unable to get a sustained drive going. He was sacked three
times and was 6-of-11 passing for 39 yards.
	   Terance Mathis had four catches for 74 yards for the Falcons,
including the lone touchdown in the second quarter. Chandler was
4-for-5 for 74 yards.
	   Jason Hanson, who missed two field goal attempts and had a third
attempt blocked, had a 20-yard field goal for Detroit (1-1).
	   In Philadelphia, third-string quarterback Koy Detmer threw three
second-half touchdown passes as the Eagles came back from a 17-0
deficit.
	   Detmer, who finished 18-of-27 for 217 yards, hit Karl Hankton
for two touchdown passes and Antwuan Wyatt for another for
Philadelphia (1-1).
	   Kordell Stewart played a quarter and a half for the Steelers
(1-2) and was 9-of-13 for 73 yards.
	   Pittsburgh's Chris Oldham scored on a 64-yard interception
return on Philadelphia's third play from scrimmage.

Prosecutor: ex-president's brother exempted from murder probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors investigating the 1994 murder of
a ruling-party politician quashed early mentions of the president's
brother in connection with the case, Assistant Attorney General
Jose Luis Ramos said Friday.
	   A former police director also said Friday that he had heard that
investigators in 1994 were deleting references to Raul Salinas,
brother of former president Carlos Salinas de Gotari, from the
probe into the shooting death of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
	   Raul Salinas was later charged with masterminding the murder of
Ruiz Massieu _ his political rival _ and has been in jail while
being tried on the homicide charges for the last 3 1/2 years.
	   Ramos said ``the prosecution has always maintained that the one
who gave the order (to drop witnesses' references to Raul Salinas)
was Mario Ruiz Massieu,'' the victim's brother and the prosecutor
in charge of the case at the time.
	   However, the former federal police director, Adrian Carrera
Fuentes _ himself currently imprisoned on unrelated charges _ said
he knew little about Raul Salinas' alleged motive or participation
in the killing.
	   The statements came during a court hearing on the homicide
charges against Raul Salinas at a federal prison west of Mexico
City.
	   Mario Ruiz Massieu is now under house arrest in New Jersey and
fighting extradition to Mexico, where he faces various charges.

Cardinals 10, Pirates 5
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Five Cardinals not named Mark McGwire homered
as St. Louis ended the Pittsburgh Pirates' four-game winning streak
with a 10-5 victory Friday night.
	   Ray Lankford, who leads the team with 11 home runs since the
All-Star break _ one more than McGwire _ hit his 22nd and Tom
Lampkin hit his sixth for the Cardinals. Both were three-run shots.
	   Delino DeShields, Brian Jordan and Fernando Tatis added solo
shots as the Cardinals had their second five-homer game this
season. Meanwhile, McGwire barely got to swing his bat.
	   McGwire didn't have an official at-bat, walking three times,
getting nicked by a pitch and scoring twice before getting a rest
after the sixth inning.
	   He has had nine consecutive at-bats without putting a ball in
play _ three strikeouts, five walks and one hit by pitch _ after
ending a similar 13-at-bat sequence with his major league-leading
47th home run on Tuesday.
	   Donovan Osborne (2-2) won for the first time since April 27,
allowing two runs and eight hits in six innings.
	   Jon Lieber (8-13) took the loss.
 &UR; Cubs 6, Astros 4 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Sammy Sosa hit a tiebreaking RBI double and pitcher
Mark Clark's capped Chicago's four-run sixth inning with a two-run
single, snapping the Astros' seven-game winning streak.
	   Clark (7-11) allowed four runs and seven hits in 7 2-3 innings.
He struck out eight and didn't walk a batter.
	   The Astros had runners on first and second with two outs in the
ninth, but Rod Beck got Ricky Gutierrez to hit into a forecout for
his 35th save.
	   Shane Reynolds (14-8) has lost four of his last five decisions.
	   Sosa went 3-for-5, including his go-ahead double in the sixth
after a fan ran down to the Cubs dugout with a sign that said ``Not
in our house Sosa.''
	   Sosa, second in the majors with 46 homers, singled in his first
at-bat. But he got a bigger reaction from the crowd moments earlier
when he hit a speaker in foul territory and the ball ricocheted
into the upper deck.
	   Moises Alou hit a two-run homer, his 33rd, for Houston.
 &UR; Phillies 6, Rockies 2 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Doug Glanville hit a two-run homer and Carlton Loewer
pitched 6 1-3 strong innings as Philadelphia ended Colorado's
season-high four-game winning streak.
	   Scott Rolen broke out of an 0-for-13 slump with a double for the
Phillies, who had lost 11 of 14.
	   Loewer (6-4) faced the minimum through the first 3 2-3 innings
before Larry Walker doubled in the fourth. The right-hander allowed
two runs and seven hits.
	   Bobby Jones (5-6) gave up six hits and six runs in four
innings.
 &UR; Reds 3, Expos 2 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Roberto Petagine delivered a pinch-hit RBI single
to center with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.
	   Dmitri Young walked to start the ninth against Steve Kline (2-4)
and advanced on Jeffrey Hammonds' sacrifice. Kline then walked
Eddie Taubensee, who had hit a two-run homer in the fifth, and Mike
Maddux came on and got Bret Boone to hit into a force at second.
	   Petagine, pinch-hitting for the second time since the Reds
called him up, lined the first pitch to center to end the Reds'
four-game losing streak. Gabe White (5-3) pitched two hitless
innings to complete the three-hitter and get the victory.
	   The game provided a first for the '90s _ both teams had brothers
in the starting lineup.
	   Wilton and Vladimir Guerrero started for the Expos, while Aaron
and Bret Boone started for the Reds. It was the first time this
decade that two sets of brothers had played in the same game.
	   Vladimir Guerrero hit an upper-deck homer in the second, only
the 25th to reach the red seats in the stadium's 28-year history.

Chinese president rallies nation to fight floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS graf 8 on Chinese urged to give donations, dlrs 1
million received Friday

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ All Chinese must rally to fight summer floods
that have affected one-fifth of the Chinese population, leaving
millions homeless, President Jiang Zemin said in remarks carried
Saturday by state media.
	   Jiang, who traveled to flood zones earlier in the week, warned
that the floods were reaching a crucial stage and that carelessness
could cause huge losses, the newspaper China Daily said.
	   With millions stranded on sweltering dikes along the raging
Yangtze River, with little shelter, clean water or food, Jiang
urged flood workers to guard against the spread of diseases and
prevent crime.
	   ``People must wade through waist high water to go about their
daily life,'' the Red Cross reported from one flood-hit province.
	   Already, 10,000 medical teams are handing out food, water
purification tablets and medical supplies and evacuating people in
flooded areas.
	   But shortages of funds are delaying relief efforts, the Red
Cross said. It appealed urgently for money to provide food, water
purification tablets and medical supplies to one million people.
	   It also warned that the floods threaten efforts to control snail
fever in some areas and said outbreaks of this tropical disease may
increase.
	   Chinese living in areas not affected by flooding are being
strongly urged to donate money, clothing and other needed items to
flood victims. The China Daily reported that the Ministry of Civil
Affairs had received the equivalent of about dlrs 1 million in
donations and items on Friday alone.
	   Xinhua reported Friday that this year's floods had killed 625
people in Hunan, one of the worst-hit provinces along the Yangtze.
Nationwide, the death toll from summer flooding stands at more than
2,000.
	   Meanwhile, state radio reported that Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress and former premier, had traveled to
northeastern China to view flood relief efforts there.
	   One million civilians and soldiers were mobilized for ``a
round-the-clock fight'' against the worst-ever floods on the Nen
and Songhua rivers, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   A major levee protecting China's largest oil field in
northeastern Heilongjiang, which borders Russia, gave way Friday,
forcing the closure of some wells, Xinhua reported.
	   More than 200,000 people were fighting flooding in Daqing, a
city of 2.34 million people and home of the field that produced
half of China's oil output last year, it said.
	   But a lack of manpower forced the abandonment of efforts to
repair the levee that collapsed some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from
the city center, forcing the evacuation of some 20,000 people.
Workers were building a barrier near the oil field to protect it
from the floods, the report added.
	   To the west, along the Nen River in Inner Mongolia, 113,600
people remained stranded by floods that began August 8 and left
414,000 people homeless, Xinhua reported.
	   Floods and landslides have been reported from many areas of
China, as a rain belt swells rivers across China.

Indonesian President apologizes for past human rights abuses
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Pledging to end past authoritarian
ways and to fix the crisis-ridden economy, Indonesia's president
Saturday apologized for widespread human rights abuses and called
on his countrymen to adopt a new sense of confidence and
nationalism.
	   In his first state of the nation address to Parliament to mark
independence anniversary celebrations, President B.J. Habibie
outlined an eight-point reform plan ``to build a just, open and
democratic society.''
	   As Habibie spoke, thousands of police and troops were on standby
in Jakarta following rumors that rioting could mar the anniversary,
which falls on Monday.
	   Wearing a traditional black peci hat, Habibie said confidence
building, transparency in government and an eradication of the
``disease'' of corruption would restore the once booming economy.
	   Indonesia has been hit hardest by Asia's financial meltdown.
Inflation and unemployment rates are soaring, and poverty now
affects 40 percent of the population compared with about 11 percent
a year ago.
	   Habibie pointed to Indonesia's vast natural resources and said
the economy and the ailing rupiah would recover once confidence is
restored.
	   He called for a renewed sense of nationalism and trumpeted the
need for respect for human rights.
	   Habibie expressed his ``deepest regrets for the human rights
violations in several regions committed by individuals from the
state apparatus in the past.''
	   ``I apologize to the Indonesian people, in particular to the
families of the victims,'' he said in the nationally televised
address.
	   Habibie, Indonesia's third head of state in 53 years, came to
power in May after former leader President Suharto quit following
riots and protests against his 32-year reign.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in the violence which, Habibie
said, had ``streaked the face of the nation'' with shame.
	   Following widespread international condemnation, Habibie made
particular reference to allegations that at least 168 women and
girls were raped during the riots.
	   Allegedly, most victims were members of the ethnic Chinese
minority, targeted for their relative wealth and made scapegoats
for Indonesia's economic disaster. Hundreds of Chinese homes and
business were attacked and burned by rampaging mobs.
	   Habibie called for a crackdown against continuing outbreaks of
looting and said that many business people are too traumatized to
rebuild.
	   Since the riots and political changes, the powerful military has
been hit by a wide range of allegations of human rights violations.
	   It's been accused of kidnapping pro-democracy activists across
the country as well as carrying out atrocities in outlying
territories wracked by separatist struggles, including the former
Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   In his 37-page speech, Habibie said that under Suharto tough
security measures Indonesia's 202 million people had produced
stability and economic growth.
	   However, the violence last May that ended the autocrat's rule
meant this approach must be replaced by greater democratic freedom.
	   He said Indonesia had now abandoned the concept, widely argued
in Asia, that human rights is merely a notion of Western culture.
	   ``Now, in an assertive way, we state that all of us are
committed to human rights so that we can respect the honor and
dignity of mankind, irrespective of religion, race, ethnicity, skin
color, sex or social status,'' he said.

	   In addition to the seacoast town of Noosa, here are some other
popular hideaways favored by the locals in Australia:
	   _The Great Ocean Road winding along the southern coast of
Victoria, which rivals California's Highway One for rugged coastal
scenery, including the ``Twelve Apostles'' rock formation jutting
out of the surf. There are motels and bed-and-breakfasts the whole
way.
	   _The New England Highway through New South Wales to the rural
center of Armidale, a route that brings urban dwellers back to the
land to enjoy farms and rolling sheep pastures.
	   _Byron Bay, a New South Wales answer to Noosa, another low-rise
coastal community featuring restaurants, cafes, surf shops and art
galleries, up the coast almost to the Queensland border.
	   _The fishing village of Batemans Bay, 250 kilometers (155 miles)
south of Sydney on the New South Wales coast, which attracts
weekenders and vacationers with an appetite for fish, oysters and
crayfish.
	   _Fremantle on the fringe of Western Australia's capital of
Perth, site of the Royal Perth Yacht Club's unsuccessful defense of
the America's Cup in 1987. It has largely escaped Perth's rampant
development, with the marina area featuring quaint old pubs and
shops that now offer coffee as well as drinks and meals. Perth also
has three dazzling ocean beaches.
	   _Western Australia's inland deserts and Hamersley Mountain
range, which erupt into blooms of wildflowers each spring. Many
Aboriginal sites are scattered through the region.
	   _A weekly TV show called ``Getaway'' highlights at least one
off-the-beaten-track vacation site in Australia each week. You can
find its Web site at www.getaway.com.au.

	   UYUNI SALT FLATS, Bolivia (AP) _ On the bulletin board of the
hotel rising out of a surreal moonscape high in the Andes, somebody
posted a note:
	   ``Please don't lick the walls.''
	   The walls, you see, are made of salt. In fact, much of the hotel
_ the roof, some beds, chairs, tables, and bar _ are made of salt.
Even the floor is covered with salt granules.
	   The hotel, recently renamed the Salt Palace and Spa, sits in the
middle of the Uyuni Salt Flats, Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric lake
of salt near the Chilean border, covering 40 square miles (100
square kilometers) at an altitude of 12,500 feet (3,800 meters).
	   The salt flat is bordered by a strange land of volcanoes and
geysers, flamingoes and cactus, with a rich history and spectacular
scenery that has become one of Bolivia's main tourist destinations.
	   A railroad ``graveyard'' in the village of Uyuni southeast of
the salt pan, once an important railroad junction, has vintage
locomotives and boxcars that remind of the days when Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid robbed trains and banks before being gunned
down in 1908 by Bolivian troops in the village of San Vicente not
far from here.
	   Juan Quesada, an adventurous tourism operator, built the hotel
with 14-by 14-inch (35-by-35-centimeter) hard blocks of salt cut
with axes out of the salt flat.
	   Twelve guest rooms with 24 beds and and shared bathrooms
surround a central courtyard covered with glass. The intense sun of
the high Andes heats the blocks of salt during the day and at night
the bedrooms remain cozy while outside temperatures drop below
freezing.
	   I spent two nights at the hotel and found the rooms comfortable
and dry with no salty smell. There are flush toilets, but no
showers.
	   One night we dined on barbecued llama meat. Quite tasty.
	   The hotel, built four years ago, charges 277 bolivianos (dlrs
50) for a single, 332 bolivianos (dlrs 60) for a double. There is a
separate building at cheaper rates for backpackers.
	   Quesada says a nine-hole golf course adjacent to the hotel will
be in operation by the end of August, perhaps the first-ever gold
course on a salt flat. He recently added a game room to the hotel
and is working on a sauna.
	   As interesting as the hotel itself is, the scenery around it is
breathtaking. During sunsets and sunrises, the sun casts shadows on
the white expanse and geometric forms shaped by salt crystals. As
the sun fades, a bright red sky contrasts with the white-blue salt
flats. Star-watching is dazzling.
	   From April through October _ the dry season here _ vehicles
travel across the barely marked makeshift roads that crisscross the
flats. Over the years, some people who ventured off the marked
tracks froze to death at night. During the day the climate can be
balmy.
	   During the rainy season, the flats are covered with brine and
the hotel is often isolated.
	   The nearest town to the hotel is Uyuni, once one of the
country's premier railroad centers, 220 miles (350 kilometers)
south of La Paz.
	   Dozens of passenger train cars and some locomotives sit on
sidings there, evoking the railroad's heyday when much of the tin
and silver produced in the Bolivian highlands passed through Uyuni
en route to the Chilean port of Antofagasta.
	   Minerals are still mined, but it's the tourist industry that is
fast changing the region, bringing in money and creating jobs. At
least 15,000 tourists are expected this year to visit the salt
flats and Fisherman's Island that lies in the middle of the flats.
Regular train service now brings visitors from La Paz to Uyuni.
	   Hotels, restaurants and night clubs are sprouting up to cater to
the mainly European and Israeli tourists who have made the Uyuni
salt flats and surrounding areas the country's second-most
important tourist destination.
	   On Fisherman's Island, Isla de Pescadores, there are thousands
of cactuses, some of them 30 feet (10 meters) high, and a stranded
colony of vizcachas, long-tailed rodents related to the chinchilla.
	   Special treats tourists encounter around the salt flats include
herds of graceful and shy vicunas (relatives of llamas) and dozens
of pink flamingoes flying across the flats.
	   Laguana Colorada in the highlands of this far southwest corner
of Bolivia is a fiery red lake surrounded by a treeless landscape.
Birdwatchers are interested in the rare James' flamingoes that
inhabit the lake. Thirty miles (50 kilometers) south of the lake is
the 14,400-foot (4,390-meter) Sol de Manana, where a geyser,
bubbling mud pools and hellish fumaroles belch stinky sulfurous
fumes.
	   Hundreds of Quechua Indians in surrounding villages make a
living scraping layers of salt for processing into table salt, or
by cutting blocks of salt. After a block the size of a shoe box is
cut, brine that lies just below the surface rapidly fills the hole.
After a few days, the surface becomes hard as rock.
	   In pre-Columbian periods, Aymara and Quechua Indian llama
herdsman carried blocks of salt across the Andes and down to the
tropical lowlands.
	   Today, the salt is carried on old rusty trucks to nearby
villages where residents make a living by drying, grinding, adding
iodine and packaging the salt.
	   Many quaint villages with beautiful churches that flourished
around the salt flats for centuries are being revived thanks to
tourism and aid-developed farming.
	   ``This is one of the most spectacular regions on Earth,'' said
David Atkinson, a representative of the Inter-American Development
Bank in Bolivia. ``It shouldn't be long before the area becomes a
must for tourists visiting South America.''

India ends yearlong jubilee celebrations

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
opened festivities marking the end of India's golden jubilee year,
hoping to ease tensions Pakistan and with his political allies.
	   From behind bulletproof glass, Vajpayee spoke to the nation from
the ramparts of the Red Fort of New Delhi, addressing concerns over
India's newly acquired nuclear capability and its tense relations
with Pakistan.
	   Vajpayee vowed India would never use nuclear weapons
aggressively, and it was ready for a pact with Pakistan that
neither would be the first to unleash them.
	   Vajpayee's address on India's 51st independence day brought to a
close a troubled jubilee year full of political upheaval, economic
difficulty and international opprobrium and sanctions for
conducting nuclear tests.
	   The prime minister defended his decision to go nuclear, and said
the world was gaining more appreciation for what India describes as
the security concerns that compelled it to develop a nuclear
deterrent.
	   ``The effect of economic sanctions is slackening gradually,'' he
said. ``We welcome this.''
	   Without naming Pakistan, Vajpayee said India was fighting a
proxy war against forces supported from across the border.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming Muslim militants
fighting a secessionist war in India-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan
says it is only providing moral and diplomatic support to the
militants.
	   On Friday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pledged to
continue supporting Kashmiri separatists as Pakistan celebrated its
own independence day. Violence in Kashmir would ``force India to
come to the negotiation table,'' Sharif said.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir, since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Earlier this month, the Indian and Pakistani armies engaged in
one of their heaviest peacetime artillery duels across their
disputed frontier in Kashmir, killing nearly 200 people on both
sides. The battles coincided with an abortive meeting between
Vajpayee and Sharif that ended in mutual recriminations.
	   On Saturday, Vajpayee said he wasn't disheartened by the
setback, and he was looking forward to the next meeting with Sharif
in a few weeks in South Africa.
	   ``I believe there is no dispute which cannot be resolved through
dialogue,'' he said, speaking in Hindi under a gray early morning
sky.
	   India and Pakistan raised the stakes of their 51-year-old
conflict when each conducted underground nuclear explosions last
May.
	   In office less than six months, Vajpayee's more immediate
concern was the turmoil within his 19-party coalition that made his
own political future uncertain. He spoke about the difficulties in
running a coalition government on the basis of consensus.
	   He served a warning to his detractors, saying: ``I will never
compromise on principles. I have spent 40 years on the opposition
benches.''
	   Sonia Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress Party and
torchbearer of the family that led India for most of its
post-independence years, told her party members Friday to be ready
for ``all contingencies and any sudden developments'' _ a hint she
might be getting ready to bid for power.

At least five dead as mudslides bury cars in northern Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ Mudslides barreling across the highway
near the Brennero tunnel on the Italian-Austrian border early
Saturday killed at least five travelers in their cars, Italian RAI
state radio reported.
	   At least three people were reported injured in the tragedy near
the town of Fortezza, RAI state radio said.
	   Two victims were found in a car with German license plates, the
Italian news agency ANSA said. The other victims -- a man, woman
and child -- were found in another vehicle, ANSA said.
	   At least two of victims were believed to be foreigners, but no
identities of any of the victims were immediately released.
	   Reporting from this South Tyrolean city, ANSA said rescue
workers were using metal detectors to see if any other vehicles
were buried.
	   At least three separate mudslides covered roads and railway
track, but no trains were involved, according to the news reports.
	   Torrential rains brought by thunderstorms caused walls of mud to
loosen.
	   Cars were backed up for kilometers (miles) along both sides of
the tunnel, one of the north-south routes in Europe, and it is
especially heavily traveled in mid-August, the peak of the Italian
vacation season straddling the Aug. 15 Ferragosto national holiday.
	   Rescue workers carried water and food to motorists stuck in the
backups.
	   One of the slides hit just outside Fortezza's train station.
	   Highway officials said both the rail lines and the autostrada
might be able to be cleared by late Saturday.

Raucous welcome as democracy activists freed from Myanmar

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists jailed by
the military junta in Myanmar for distributing anti-government
leaflets were expelled from that country Saturday and arrived to a
raucous welcome in Bangkok.
	   Relatives, friends and supporters mobbed and hugged the
activists as they came through the dignitaries' lounge at Bangkok's
airport. They were draped with garlands of flowers, a traditional
Thai greeting.
	   ``Of course, I'm very happy,'' said Ellene Sana, 36, a social
activist from the Philippines. ``I didn't want to stay there any
longer.''
	   The activists were convicted in a one-day trial Friday before a
judge of violating an Emergency Provisions Act dating from 1950 and
sentenced to five years' hard labor. The catchall law has been used
to sentence hundreds of political prisoners to terms as long as 20
years in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Almost immediately after sentencing, Myanmar officials announced
that the punishment was suspended and they would be deported. They
spent Friday night in a police guest house.
	   The activists included six Americans, three Indonesians, three
Malaysians, three Thais, two Filipinos and an Australian. They
ranged in age from 19 to 51 and included students, social
activists, academics, lawyers and a businessmen.
	   On arrival, the Americans were easily recognizable, wearing navy
blue T-shirts with the U.S. Embassy logo, apparently the only clean
clothes they had. They and the others were immediately whisked off
to a news conference.
	   ``As foreigners, we were treated like kings and queens,'' said
Sapna Chattpar, 21, one of four students from the University in
Washington in the United States among the activists.
	   ``We were given everything we possibly wanted. We were given
rooms with fans and air conditioning. We were given all the food we
needed,'' Chattpar said.
	   ``What's horrible about this is, we were able to leave six days
later while Burmese who were sentenced to the exact same thing have
been sentenced to life or even killed,'' Chattpar said.
	   Family members, fellow activists and U.S. Congressman Chris
Smith, chairman of the House International Operations and Human
Rights subcommittee, congratulated each other as they waited at the
Bangkok airport's VIP lounge for the Myanmar Airways flight.
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican, had a constituent, Michele
Keegan, 19, of Hamilton Township, New Jersey, New Jersey, among the
group.
	   A banner hung in the lounge read ``Welcome Home, Democracy
Heroes.''
	   The activists, who belong to overseas groups opposed to
Myanmar's government, entered the country as tourists last week
ahead of the 10th anniversary of a nationwide uprising against
military rule. The 1988 demonstrations were eventually crushed and
an estimated 3,000 people died.
	   Last Sunday, the activists passed out small leaflets in Yangon,
the Myanmar capital, urging people to remember the uprising and not
give up. No unrest was reported anywhere in the country.
	   ``When we gave out the goodwill messages, you could see the fear
in their eyes,'' said Tyler Gianini, 28, a Washington environmental
lawyer. ``But when we were able to do it subtly, you were able to
see the joy.''
	   Echoed Alison Vicary, 35, an Australian university lecturer:
``Nothing prepared me for the level of fear that permeates Burmese
society.''
	   An organization working with the activists announced the
campaign to hand out leaflets well before they were to even try to
leave the country, but claimed that their arrest was not a goal.
	   The activists were arrested and questioned for the next six
days. The government accused them of trying to incite unrest.
	   Diplomatic pressure built from their home countries for their
release. Some acknowledged that Myanmar's laws had been broken and
the activists knew the risks, while others said that there was no
crime handing out pieces of paper.
	   Diplomats were caught by surprise Friday when the activists were
suddenly put on trial in a courtroom next to Insein Prison, where
hundreds of political prisoners are kept. There was no jury, and
diplomatic observers believed the outcome was scripted in advance.
	   The activists were warned that if they return to Myanmar and
violate the laws again, they will serve the five-year suspended
term plus any new prison sentence they incur.
	   The leaflet campaign is part of an attempt by Myanmar's
pro-democracy opposition, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi,
to bring pressure on the government to meet her Aug. 21 deadline
for the military to convene a parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the elections, but the
government never recognized the result. The military has ruled
Myanmar since 1962.

Cockpit Eavesdropping: How much do you want to know?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic TRV LISTEN IN &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS KENT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Most airlines offer their passengers in-flight
music. United Airlines also lets them listen in to their pilot's
radio communications.
	   In an offering that some passengers may find reassuring, and
others less so, Channel 9 on the airline's in-seat audio system
carries the flight crew's conversations with air traffic
controllers.
	   The idea is not only to please aviation buffs who understand the
staccato, jargon-filled transmissions, but to reassure nervous
passengers that someone is hard at work up front looking after
their safety.
	   ``A lot of people have some apprehension when they fly,'' says
Mary Jo Holland, a spokeswoman for United. Channel 9, she says,
``gives them a certain comfort zone.''
	   Suppose passengers hear over their headsets that there's an
emergency aboard? Even then, says Hart Langer, United's senior vice
president for operations, Channel 9 ``more often than not gets
passengers involved in what's going on and provides a comfort
factor.''
	   He cites an incident two years ago when a United DC-10 had one
engine fail on a flight from Los Angeles to Washington. The captain
told the passengers that the plane would have to return to Los
Angeles and encouraged them to keep tuned to Channel 9 to follow
the plane's progress. Listening in, Langer said, helped keep the
passengers calm.
	   Madison Walton, a Boeing 727 captain at United, believes the
calm, professional radio procedures pilots pride themselves on in
emergencies can be especially comforting to passengers.
	   (Channel 9 doesn't carry pilots' private comments to each other
in the cockpit.)
	   United believes it is the only airline now offering an air
traffic channel. American had such an offering in the 1970s and
early 80s, but dropped it when it rewired its planes and focus
groups showed little passenger interest, spokesman John Hotard
said.
	   Even on United, Channel 9 isn't guaranteed.
	   ``There are some pilots who are a little antsy about doing this
and they turn it off,'' Langer said.
	   Sound quality sometimes is poor. But even when it's clear, it
still takes an almost-professional knowledge of aviation and a
lapful of charts to understand exactly what's going on.
	   Aside from self-evident terms like ``Clear for takeoff'' and
``Clear to land,'' most of the back-and-forth consists of pilot
jargon, strings of numbers and geographical references that
ordinary maps won't explain.
	   Passengers listening to Channel 9 aboard a plane recently
approaching O'Hare airport in Chicago heard their flight being
directed to ``Deana,'' but it would take an aeronautical chart to
know that Deana is a point planes pass just before making an
eastward landing. When pilots refer to ``flight level 24,'' they
mean an altitude of 24,000 feet (7,300 meters).
	   But even if passengers don't understand much, hearing their
captain gives them confidence that ``there's a living, breathing
human being up front'' looking after the flight, Walton said.

At least five dead as mudslides bury cars in northern Italy

 &UR; EDS: NEW details throughout on rail traffic, rescue operation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ Mudslides barreling across the highway
near the Brennero tunnel on the Italian-Austrian border early
Saturday killed at least five travelers in their cars, Italian RAI
state radio reported.
	   At least three people were reported injured in the tragedy near
the town of Fortezza, and hundreds of firefighters, civil defense
workers and other rescue crew were digging through tons of mud and
using metal detectors to see if there were any other vehicles were
buried by the slides.
	   Two victims were found in a car with German license plates, the
Italian news agency ANSA said. The other victims -- a man, woman
and child -- were found in another vehicle, ANSA said, reporting
from this South Tyrolean city.
	   At least three separate mudslides struck.
	   Two of them covered rail track, including one slide which hit
just outside the train station in Fortezza, a major transit point
for travelers going to Italy's Alpine resorts, a popular summer
destination as well as ski zone.
	   No trains were hit, but train travelers on the major
international lines were facing several hours' delay. Rail travel
was diverted to other lines, and buses were used to move travelers
between Verona and the Austrian side of the border.
	   Torrential rains brought by thunderstorms caused walls of mud to
loosen.
	   Cars were backed up for kilometers (miles) along both sides of
the tunnel, one of the north-south routes in Europe, and it is
especially heavily traveled in mid-August, the peak of the Italian
vacation season straddling the Aug. 15 Ferragosto national holiday.
	   Rescue workers carried water and food to motorists stuck in the
backups.
	   Highway officials said both the rail lines and the autostrada
might be able to be cleared by late Saturday at the earliest.

	   TREBIC, Czech Republic (AP) _ Walking through the fairy-tale
streets of Eastern Europe's largest preserved Jewish quarter, you
get the feeling time stopped a hundred years ago.
	   A charming maze of alleyways and brightly colored houses, stairs
hewn into a steep hill, a majestic hillside cemetery with 2,000
Jewish graves _ the Zamosti ghetto looks like a 19th-century
postcard.
	   Now, after surviving the Nazis who drove its inhabitants out,
and the communists who planned to raze it, Zamosti is getting a
``new'' old face that may bring it out of its obscurity.
	   Officials in the provincial town of Trebic, where Zamosti is
located, are restoring its synagogues and 123 houses with an eye
toward attracting tourists.
	   ``It's now up to us to get the ghetto into tourist guides,''
said Vera Jourova, the mayor's secretary in the town of 30,000
people 170 kilometers (about 100 miles) southeast of Prague.
	   ``Zamosti is a unique quarter which documents how rich the
Jewish life in this region once was, and we're dedicating all our
time to save it for the next generations.''
	   Founded as early as the 14th century, the ghetto was home for
hundreds of years to the country's most flourishing and cohesive
Jewish community.
	   Its prime days were in the 1850s, when its population peaked at
1,600 and some of the most prosperous companies in the
Austro-Hungarian empire moved their headquarters there.
	   By no means was it an austere religious center. As late as 1911
the main street alone featured 25 bars and two pubs.
	   Eventually, rich Jews began leaving the crammed ghetto for more
fashionable places. Other groups moved in, and the quarter
gradually turned into a refuge of the town's poor.
	   The Holocaust also took its toll. Only 10 of the 300 Jews living
there at the start of World War II survived.
	   Zamosti itself weathered the war intact, but what the Nazis
didn't manage the communists nearly accomplished later. In the
mid-1980s, the local Communist council proposed razing it and
constructing four high-rise blocks instead.
	   ``In the end, they let it stand, not because they were
open-minded but because they simply lacked money,'' said the Trebic
council architect, Lubor Herzan.
	   The ghetto nevertheless suffered from the communists' neglect
and their policy of using it to house people or ethnic groups they
wanted to segregate.
	   Zamosti became a squalid place, with streets deserted after dark
and buildings crumbling. Along with the charm, virtually all traces
of its Jewish roots were gone.
	   ``All that time, I had no idea I was living in a Jewish
ghetto,'' said Roman Dzunga, one of Zamosti's Gypsy inhabitants.
	   After the communist regime fell in 1989, the first
democratically elected council in 42 years took up the task of the
ghetto's renovation, albeit slowly. A 16th-century synagogue used
in communist times as a warehouse was restored and reopened in
1996.
	   Now, the ghetto's renaissance is clearly visible to visitors.
	   New places with distinctively Jewish names have sprung up: the
Jacob's Snack Bar, the Synagogue Guest House, the Jewish Grocery
and Rachel's Wine Cellar, a charming restaurant in a centuries-old
Jewish building.
	   ``It's becoming good form again to live `at the Jews,' as we
call it,'' Jourova said.
	   However, only a fraction of Zamosti's houses have been fully
restored. City officials are desperately soliciting private
contributions from abroad.
	   ``Everybody comes here to take a look at what we've done and
pats us on the back,'' said Jourova. ``But when it comes to
donating money, they usually shrink back.''
	   Overlooking the ghetto, the 87-year-old caretaker of the
meticulously restored Jewish cemetery is certain the tradition will
endure.
	   Bohumil Pavlik noted that Jews throughout the region now choose
to be buried here _ including Zamosti's only three remaining
Holocaust survivors, who live elsewhere but are awaiting their
turn.
	   ``They have their tombstones ready,'' he said, ``and when their
time comes, I'll take care of them.''

Cartoonist gets OK for 'Peanuts' museum in California
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTA ROSA, California (AP) _ Good grief, Charlie Brown and his
pals may soon have their very own cartoon museum.
	   The Santa Rosa City Council has approved a zoning change that
would allow Charles Schulz, the creator of the popular ``Peanuts''
comic strip, to build on a 1.5-acre (0.6-hectare) site. The
structure would house memorabilia from his career.
	   Schulz, 75, started drawing ``Peanuts'' in 1950, and the strip
now appears in more newspapers than any other cartoon feature in
history.
	   Schulz's wife, Jean, said the museum would include ``Peanuts''
artwork that has never been displayed. No opening date has been
set.

 &UR; Pilfering bears being retrained in Olympic National Park
	   PORT ANGELES, Washington (AP) _ As it turns out, ``Goldilocks''
is not just a fairy tale of bears eating children's porridge.
	   Bears here have been gobbling up campers' food, prompting park
officials to close several wilderness campsites in the Sol Duc back
country of Olympic National Park.
	   The closings aren't meant to punish people. Rather, they are to
``recondition the bear or bears to find and consume natural food,''
said David Morris, park superintendent.
	   The animals ``have already begun to associate backpacks and food
sacks with their next meal,'' said park wildlife biologist Patti
Happe.
	   ``We want to stop the cycle before an animal grows bold enough
to approach a backpack that's near a person.''

 &UR; Proposal would restore a 19th-century Georgia canal
	   SAVANNAH, Georgia (AP) _ Canoeists, bikers and hikers could
benefit if a historic 19th-century is restored.
	   The canal was built by slaves and Irish workers to transport
cotton and timber between the Savannah and Ogeechee rivers from
1831 to 1892.
	   In addition, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and his Union troops
camped on the banks of the canal during the Civil War's battle of
Savannah.
	   Now the Savannah/Ogeechee Canal Society wants to restore the 16
1-2 -mile (27-kilometer) Chatham County waterway ``so that people
could canoe from Ogeechee to Savannah,'' said Jerry Williamson,
volunteer director of a museum and nature center built near the
canal.
	   There are also plans to create hiking and biking trails on 180
acres (73 hectares) the society owns alongside the canal, he said.
	   The society presently operates the nonprofit Savannah/Ogeechee
Museum and Nature Center.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Popular museum collection gets new lease on life
	   CORVALLIS, Oregon (AP) _ A popular museum collection that ranges
from a stuffed moose to hummingbird eggs is set to reopen after
three years of budget-imposed closure.
	   Oregon State University and the Benton County Historical Society
signed an agreement on Aug. 4 transferring to the society the
management and eventual ownership of the Horner Museum collection.
	   A favorite spot for generations of school field trips, the
museum drew more than 40,000 visitors a year in its heyday. Kids
flocked to see the 60,000 artifacts that included primitive robots,
textiles, fossils, mammoth tusks and clothing from around the
world.
	   The historical society plans to manage the collection and raise
money for a new building.

Massive crowd hears call to spread the word

<TEXT>
	   LA VANG, Vietnam (AP) _ The top Roman Catholic official in
Vietnam on Saturday urged one of the largest crowds since the
country was reunited nearly a quarter-century ago to attract more
converts.
	   The call by Cardinal Phaolo-Giuse Pham Dinh Tung covered what
little common ground exists between the Church and the government:
that religion can help slow the rise in social vices now plaguing
the country.
	   ``We have to spread our beliefs to non-Catholics,'' Tung,
looking somewhat frail and supported at the elbows by a pair of
priests, told a crowd that looked only a little smaller than the
organizers' estimate of 200,000 people.
	   ``To do this, Catholics should set an example by doing only good
things so people can see that the Christian religion is good,'' he
said.
	   Buddhism is Vietnam's primary religion, but an estimated 8
million of the 78 million people are Catholics.
	   Tung was celebrating a mid-morning Mass to wrap up a three-day
Catholic festival marking the 200th anniversary of an apparition of
the Virgin Mary.
	   It was a remarkably well-disciplined event that drew pilgrims
from all over the country to give thanks and to pray for boons both
personal and humanitarian.
	   Fourteen bishops and archbishops were joined by 300 priests as
the crowd _ stretching more than 100 yards in every direction
except areas exposed to direct sun _ sweltered under a sea of
umbrellas.
	   People, many dressed in their finest clothes, began arriving
before dawn for a colorful procession of some 3,000 people that was
full of pomp and ceremony.
	   The centerpiece was an ornate shrine with a small rendition of
the Virgin Mary, but a dance group from the nearby Hue diocese
stole the show with an elaborate fan dance.
	   The communist government limited its visible presence to traffic
control outside the festival site, although several plainclothes
officers videotaped the proceedings and individuals in the crowd.
	   The government, saying it sees religion as a way to ease rises
in youth drug use and prostitution, has shown a recent desire for
an improvement in its strained relations with organized religions.
	   But it also emphasizes that patriotism comes first. Only
officially recognized religions are permitted and must operate
under government rules.
	   The government tried to discourage people from coming with
widespread reports that there wouldn't be enough food, water or
accommodation, but festival organizers praised the logistical
support that provincial officials provided.
	   Top provincial officials turned down an invitation to come,
saying they were too busy, said Father Guise Duong Duc Toai, head
of the local church and the organizing committee for the festival.

Cabinet ministers visit controversial war shrine

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Members of Japan's new Cabinet made controversial
visits to a Tokyo war shrine Saturday as part of ceremonies to
commemorate the 53rd anniversary of the end of World War II.
	   Eight Cabinet members, including Transport Minister Jiro
Kawasaki and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Seiko Noda, paid
their respects at Yasukuni Shrine, a sprawling Shinto complex in
the center of the Japanese capital dedicated to the spirits of
Japanese soldiers fallen in battle.
	   Such visits in the past have elicited angry criticisms from
other Asian countries, who see them as one more sign of the
Japanese government's reluctance to take responsibility for its
aggression in World War II.
	   The politicians, dressed in black and wearing somber
expressions, bowed deeply before the altar in Yasukuni's main
building.
	   Five more Cabinet members have already paid their respects at
the shrine, Japan's state-run NHK news said.
	   Nearby, more than 6,000 people streamed into a city martial arts
auditorium to attend a memorial service led by Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and Emperor Akihito.
	   The auditorium held a one minute moment of silence to remember
the 3.1 million Japanese soldiers and civilians who died in what in
Japanese is known as the Great Pacific War.
	   Japanese usually consider the war as starting with the invasion
of Manchuria in 1931 and ending when Japan capitulated to the
Allies on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   ``The war caused great pain and suffering, particularly to
neighboring countries in Asia. We would like to express our deep
regret and condolences to them sincerely,'' Obuchi said at the
start of the service.
	   Prime ministers only started expressing remorse at the annual
ceremony six years ago, Kyodo News said.
	   Obuchi then bowed deeply before a Shinto altar with a wooden
sign that read ``the spirits of those from the entire nation who
died in war.''
	   The emperor and his wife, Empress Michiko, also bowed before the
altar.
	   ``So many lost lives, it make us sad,'' Akihito told the
auditorium. ``We hope war will never be repeated.''

At least five dead as mudslides bury cars in northern Italy

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ Mudslides barreling across the highway
near the Brennero tunnel on the Italian-Austrian border early
Saturday killed at least five Germans in their cars, Italian RAI
state radio reported.
	   At least three people were reported injured in the tragedy on
the highway between the town of Bressanone, which is also called
Brixen, in the heart of Italy's Alpine resort country.
	   Hundreds of firefighters, civil defense workers and other rescue
crew were digging through tons of mud and using metal detectors to
see if there were any other vehicles buried by the slides.
	   Two victims were found in a car with German license plates, the
Italian news agency ANSA said, reporting from the South Tyrolean
capital of Bolzano. The other victims -- a man, woman and child --
were found in another vehicle, ANSA said.
	   All five bodies were recovered from the cars, which were buried
under a three meter (10-foot) high layer of mud and rocks, RAI
said.
	   No identities of the victims were immediately released.

	   In Jacksonville, Florida, fourth-round draft pick Tavian Banks
turned a broken play into a 59-yard touchdown run, and James
Stewart rushed for 70 yards on nine first-quarter carries in
Jacksonville's victory.
	   Midway through the third quarter, Banks saw no hole on an
off-tackle play to the right and quickly reversed field, slipping
through the line and using a block from receiver Willie Jackson to
break his touchdown run for Jacksonville (1-1).
	   Backup quarterback Kent Graham, 8-for-11 for 104 yards, hit

	   Griese, selected by Denver in the third round out of Michigan,
was 2-for-3 for 68 yards.
	   The Saints (0-2) scored their first touchdown of the exhibition

World War II photographer, 84, shows dramatic images
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos WX101, WX2-3 &QL; 
 &UR; By CARL HARTMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ On a Sunday in August 54 years ago, a crowd in
the French Riviera town of St. Tropez cheered a young photographer
as she climbed on the hood of a car to get a better angle.
	   Her subject: seven Frenchwomen who had just had their heads
shaved for ``fraternizing'' with German troops who had fled the
town that morning.
	   Constance Stuart Larrabee's image _ of a woman hiding her face,
clutching her clipped hair in her arm _ is part of a dramatic show
of her World War II photographs opening Saturday at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art. Two other exhibits of her work go on view in the
Washington area later this summer.
	   ``We were on our way to Cannes when we came on them,'' Mrs.
Larrabee told reporters Friday. ``No, they weren't tortured. That
was punishment enough.''
	   Mrs. Larrabee, her own shoulder-length hair now white, got up
from a wheelchair to show reporters around the exhibit.
	   In a memoir called ``Jeep Trek,'' she recalled that one of the
women wore dark glasses ``for moral support.''
	   ``They were paraded through the streets to the delight of all
the children,'' she wrote. ``It was my first taste of primitive
reprisals, mild compared with Gestapo methods, yet very
effective.''
	   Born in England, Mrs. Larrabee moved with her mining engineer
father a few months later to South Africa. She received her first
camera _ a Kodak box Brownie _ at 10 and had her first exhibit at
16.
	   Shows of her photos from South Africa and the Maryland shore
area where she now lives will open at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime
Museum in St. Michael's, Maryland, on Aug. 29 and at the National
Museum of African Art in Washington on Sept. 20.
	   She is 84, and busy on a book to be published with the African
show.
	   At the Corcoran, ``Life in Wartime, 1936-1945'' opens with shots
from Munich, Germany, where Mrs. Larrabee went to study
photography. There are pictures of youthful Nazis and their Fuehrer
on parade, and of a sign outside a construction site that reads:
``We are building here thanks to our leader Adolf Hitler.''
	   The Johannesburg newspaper ``Libertas'' sent the 30-year-old
Constance Stuart to cover World War II just as the Western allies,
including South African troops, were invading southern France. She
also went to Italy, where the allies were advancing slowly up the
peninsula.
	   In addition to her scenes of death and battle, Mrs. Larrabee's
taste for irony includes a photo of an allied Jeep parked in front
of a sign in German that reads ``We will fight until final
victory'' and another of a warning poster in mixed languages from
Rome: ``Vino + Venus  &QC;  V.D.''

Thompson takes national title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRESNO, California (AP) _ Jenny Thompson claimed her 20th
individual national title Friday night, winning the 100-meter
butterfly in the U.S. Swimming Championships.
	   Thompson is the 16th swimmer to win 20 national titles in a
career. She won the 100 freestyle earlier this week and will swim
the 50 freestyle on Saturday.
	   Thompson was ahead of world record pace at the 50-meter mark,
but finished well off the record of 57.93 with a time of 59.74.
	   ``The clock must be wrong, I don't think I did that bad,''
Thompson said.
	   On winning her 20th title, Thompson said, ``I feel privileged to
be in that category but I don't think I will swim long enough to
get to the top of that list.'' Tracy Caulkins won 48 titles to rank
first.
	   Lenny Krayzelburg won his second race of the championships,
capturing the men's 100 backstroke in 54.64. He won the 200
backstroke earlier in the week.
	   ``I thought I could go faster but I had focused on the 200 more
for this meet,'' Krayzelburg said. ``It's still a good time and I
am near the top in the world on consistent basis. Any time you can
do that, you have to be happy.''
	   Barbara Bedford won the women's 100 backstroke in 1:01.11,
beating 1996 Olympic gold medalist Beth Botsford and Lea Maurer,
who finished second. Botsford was fourth.
	   ``I can't believe it, it's the greatest thing and I am so
excited to have my best time,'' Bedford said. ``I haven't done a
best time since the world championships in 1994 and now to do it at
25 _ I'm an old lady.''
	   Cristina Teuscher, who was second in both the 400 individual
medley and the 200 freestyle on Thursday, won the 400 freestyle.
Teuscher won in 4:10.80, just eight-hundredths of second faster
than 15-year-old Melissa Deary.
	   Rick Vendt made up for disappointing day on Thursday by winning
the men's 400 freestyle in 3:51.23. Vendt had been the
second-fastest qualifier in the 400 IM on Thursday but then was
disqualified after a false start.

 &UR; Mets 3, Diamondbacks 2 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Phoenix, Brian McRae hit a two-run homer and Rick Reed won
his 14th game as the New York Mets beat the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Reed (14-7) scattered eight hits over seven innings to become
the NL's seventh 14-game winner. His 14 victories are a career
best, after going 13-9 for the Mets last season.
	   Turk Wendell got three outs for his first save as the Mets
remained a half-game behind the Chicago Cubs in the race for the
wild card.
 &UR; Padres 7, Brewers 0 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Sterling Hitchcock pitched a five-hitter for his
second career shutout as San Diego beat Milwaukee.
	   Hitchcock (7-4) struck out nine to match his career high and
walked one in his first shutout since May 21, 1995, while pitching
for the New York Yankees.
	   Scott Karl (9-7) gave up five runs and eight hits in four
innings.
	   The Brewers have lost five straight games for the second time
this season, and have dropped nine of 10. Chris Gomez hit a two-run
homer and a double for the Padres, who have won seven of 10.
 &UR; Giants 10, Marlins 0 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Mark Gardner pitched a six-hitter for his
second shutout of the season and his two-run single started the
Giants' seven-run second inning.
	   J.T. Snow broke an 0-for-20 skid with a two-run homer and Marvin
Benard added a solo shot for San Francisco, which remained three
games behind Chicago and 2{ behind New York in the NL wild-card
race.
	   The victory was just the third in the last 10 games for the
Giants, who played without Barry Bonds, who began serving a
three-game suspension for charging the mound after being hit by a
pitch from Ricky Bottalico at Philadelphia on Aug. 2.
	   Gardner (9-5), who came to San Francisco after being released by
Florida three years ago, struck out eight and walked two in his
eighth career shutout and 13th complete game.
 &UR; Braves 5, Dodgers 2 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Andres Galarraga hit his 37th homer, a three-run
shot, and Kevin Millwood won his third straight start.
	   Millwood (14-6) allowed a run and five hits in five innings
before leaving with a sprained right ankle. The right-hander
injured his ankle while running out a grounder in the fourth.
	   Javy Lopez and pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn added RBI singles for
the NL East-leading Braves, who swept the Dodgers in a three-game
series at Turner Field in May and have won their last seven
meetings with Los Angeles.
	   Kerry Ligtenberg pitched the ninth for his 19th save.

Cuban baseball players arrive in Nicaragua after flight from Cuba

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Seven Cubans, including five baseball
players, arrived in Managua Friday after being plucked from a boat
in the Caribbean several days ago.
	   The Cubans became the latest in a series of baseball players to
abandon Cuba, following the highly-publicized flight of pitcher
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez in January.
	   The Nicaraguan government granted the six men and one woman
temporary refugee status here. One of the Cubans, Angel Lopez
Berrido, told a local radio station he was unsure where the group
would go, or whether they would stay in Nicaragua.
	   Lopez Berrido said they had set off in a small boat from Pinar
del Rio, on the western tip of Cuba and were rescued by another
craft and taken to the Nicaraguan port of Puerto Cabezas Thursday.
	   He did not provide further information on the circumstances of
the group's flight, which reportedly began five days ago.
	   All of the Cubans were apparently in good health.
	   On Thursday, the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation
identified the five baseball players as men who had previously fled
from Cuba to the Bahamas, from where they were repatriated to Cuba
on May 18.
	   Nicaragua's government had offered at that time to accept the
Cubans as refugees in order to avoid their repatriation.
	   The foundation _ known by its initials as the CANF _ said it had
``helped arrange haven in Nicaragua'' for the Cubans, identified as
Lopez Berrido, 25; Michael Jova, 17; Jorge Diaz Orlando, 23; Osmani
Garcia Santana, 23, all baseball players.
	   The other Cubans were identified as Alain Hernandez Cardenas,
Ernesto Gonzalez Nunez and Laura Sanchez.
	   The five reported played for Cuba's Villa Clara team.
	   In January, Cuban player Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez fled to
the Bahamas, turned down an asylum offer in the United States, and
later went to Costa Rica.
	   From there, Hernandez was able to sign a dlrs 6.6 million,
four-year contract with the New York Yankees a few weeks later.

Indonesian President apologizes for past human rights abuses

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Pledging to end past authoritarian
ways and to fix a deep economic crisis, Indonesia's president
Saturday apologized for human rights abuses and called for renewed
confidence and nationalism.
	   In his first state of the nation address to Parliament to mark
independence anniversary celebrations, President B.J. Habibie
outlined an eight-point reform plan ``to build a just, open and
democratic society.''
	   In a two-hour speech, he said bloody riots that had ended the
32-year-old rule of ex-President Suharto and that had helped bring
him to power last May were ``barbaric.''
	   In particular he condemned violence against the ethnic Chinese
minority, targeted as scapegoats for Indonesia's economic disaster.
	   As Habibie spoke, thousands of police and troops were on standby
in Jakarta following rumors that more rioting could mar the
anniversary, which falls on Monday.
	   Wearing a traditional black peci hat, Habibie expressed his
``deepest regrets for the human rights violations in several
regions committed by individuals from the state apparatus in the
past.''
	   ``I apologize to the Indonesian people, in particular to the
families of the victims,'' he said in the nationally televised
address.
	   Indonesia has been hit hardest by Asia's financial meltdown.
Inflation and unemployment rates are soaring, and poverty now
affects 40 percent of the population compared with about 11 percent
a year ago.
	   Habibie, Indonesia's third head of state in 53 years, pointed to
Indonesia's vast natural resources and said the economy and the
ailing rupiah would recover once confidence is restored.
	   He said the ``disease'' of corruption must be eliminated.
Troubled banks and financial institutions must be strengthened, a
huge debt problem solved, monopolies eliminated and transparency
brought into policy-making, he said.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in May's violence which, Habibie
said, had ``streaked the face of the nation'' with shame.
	   ``As a civilized and religious nation, we curse these barbaric
acts,'' he said.
	   Following widespread international condemnation, Habibie made
particular reference to allegations that at least 168 women and
girls were raped during the riots.
	   Allegedly, most victims were Chinese, targeted for their
relative wealth and perceived domination of commerce and industry.
	   Hundreds of Chinese homes and business were attacked and burned
by rampaging mobs.
	   Habibie called for a crackdown against continuing outbreaks of
looting and said many business people are too traumatized to
rebuild.
	   Since the riots and political changes, the powerful military has
been hit by a wide range of allegations of human rights violations.
	   It's been accused of kidnapping pro-democracy activists across
the country and also carrying out atrocities in outlying
territories wracked by separatist struggles, including the former
Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   In his 37-page speech, Habibie said tough security measures
under Suharto had produced stability and economic growth for
Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   However, May's unrest showed this must be replaced by greater
democratic freedom, said Habibie.
	   He said Indonesia has abandoned the concept, widely argued in
Asia, that human rights is merely a notion of Western culture.
	   ``Now, in an assertive way, we state that all of us are
committed to human rights so that we can respect the honor and
dignity of mankind, irrespective of religion, race, ethnicity, skin
color, sex or social status,'' he said.
	   He called for reform of the armed forces, saying that it should
become more professional and that its dual constitutional role in
politics and security should be reformed.
	   He also suggested the police force, now under military command,
should be strengthened as a law enforcement agency.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Members of Japan's new Cabinet made controversial
visits to a Tokyo war shrine Saturday as part of ceremonies to
commemorate the 53rd anniversary of the end of World War II.
	   Eight Cabinet members, including Transport Minister Jiro
Kawasaki and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Seiko Noda, paid
their respects at Yasukuni Shrine, a sprawling Shinto complex in
the center of the Japanese capital dedicated to the spirits of
Japanese soldiers fallen in battle.
	   Such visits in the past have elicited angry criticisms from
other Asian countries, who see them as one more sign of the
Japanese government's reluctance to take responsibility for its
aggression in World War II.
	   The politicians, dressed in black and wearing somber
expressions, bowed deeply before the altar in Yasukuni's main
building.
	   Five more Cabinet members have already paid their respects at
the shrine, Japan's state-run NHK news said.
	   Nearby, more than 6,000 people streamed into a city martial arts
auditorium to attend a memorial service led by Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and Emperor Akihito.
	   The auditorium held a one minute moment of silence to remember
the 3.1 million Japanese soldiers and civilians who died in what in
Japanese is known as the Great Pacific War.
	   Japanese usually consider the war as starting with the invasion
of Manchuria in 1931 and ending when Japan capitulated to the
Allies on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   ``The war caused great pain and suffering, particularly to
neighboring countries in Asia. We would like to express our deep
regret and condolences to them sincerely,'' Obuchi said at the
start of the service.
	   Prime ministers only started expressing remorse at the annual
ceremony six years ago, Kyodo News said. This was Obuchi's first
ceremony since his government took power last month.
	   Obuchi bowed, 11th graf pvs

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Seven Cubans, including four baseball
players, arrived in Managua on Friday after being plucked from the
boat in which they fled Cuba several days ago.
	   The Cubans became the latest baseball players to abandon their
Caribbean island, following the highly publicized flight of pitcher
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez in January. He fled to Costa Rica
and signed a dlrs 6.6 million, four-year contract with the New York
Yankees.
	   The Nicaraguan government granted the six men and one woman
temporary refugee status. One of the Cubans, Angel Lopez Berrido,
told a local radio station he was unsure where the group would go
or whether they would stay in Nicaragua.
	   Lopez Berrido said they had set off in a small boat from Pinar
del Rio on the western tip of Cuba, were rescued by another craft
in the Caribbean and taken to the Nicaraguan port of Puerto Cabezas
on Thursday. All were apparently in good health.
	   The Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation identified
the baseball players as men who had previously fled from Cuba to
the Bahamas, from where they were repatriated to Cuba on May 18.
	   Nicaragua's government had offered at that time to accept the
Cubans as refugees in order to avoid the repatriation.
	   The foundation said it had ``helped arrange haven in Nicaragua''
for the Cubans, identified as Lopez Berrido, 25; Michael Jova, 17;
Jorge Diaz Orlando, 23; and Osmani Garcia Santana, 23, all baseball
players.
	   The other Cubans were identified as Alain Hernandez Cardenas,
Ernesto Gonzalez Nunez and Laura Sanchez.
	   The players reportedly were with Cuba's Villa Clara team.

Myanmar describes freed activists as ``sacrificial lambs''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists jailed by
the military junta in Myanmar for distributing anti-government
leaflets were expelled from that country Saturday and arrived to a
raucous welcome in Bangkok.
	   Relatives, friends and supporters mobbed and hugged the
activists as they came through the dignitaries' lounge at Bangkok's
airport. They were draped with garlands of flowers, a traditional
Thai greeting.
	   ``Of course, I'm very happy,'' said Ellene Sana, 36, a social
activist from the Philippines. ``I didn't want to stay there any
longer.''
	   The activists were convicted in a one-day trial Friday before a
judge of violating an Emergency Provisions Act dating from 1950 and
sentenced to five years' hard labor. The catchall law has been used
to sentence hundreds of political prisoners to terms as long as 20
years in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Almost immediately after sentencing, Myanmar officials announced
that the punishment was suspended and they would be deported. They
spent Friday night in a police guest house.
	   In a faxed statement to The Associated Press, a Myanmar
spokesman said the government felt that ``these misguided youths
were exploited'' by anti-government groups ``to perform subversive
activities and become sacrificial lambs for them.''
	   The activists included six Americans, three Indonesians, three
Malaysians, three Thais, two Filipinos and an Australian. They
range in age from 19 to 51 and include students, social activists,
academics, lawyers and a businessmen.
	   On arrival, the Americans were easily recognizable, wearing navy
blue T-shirts with the U.S. Embassy logo, apparently the only clean
clothes they had. The activists were immediately whisked off to a
news conference.
	   ``As foreigners, we were treated like kings and queens,'' said
Sapna Chattpar, 21, one of four students from American University
in Washington among the group.
	   ``We were given everything we possibly wanted. We were given
rooms with fans and air conditioning. We were given all the food we
needed,'' Chattpar said.
	   ``What's horrible about this is, we were able to leave six days
later while Burmese who were sentenced to the exact same thing have
been sentenced to life or even killed,'' Chattpar said.
	   Family members, fellow activists and U.S. Congressman Chris
Smith, chairman of the House International Operations and Human
Rights subcommittee, congratulated each other as they waited for
the Myanmar Airways flight.
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican, had a constituent, Michele
Keegan, 19, of Hamilton Township, New Jersey, in the group, whom he
called ``apostles on behalf of the Burmese people.''
	   A banner hung in the lounge read ``Welcome Home, Democracy
Heroes.''
	   The activists, who belong to overseas groups opposed to
Myanmar's government, entered the country as tourists last week
ahead of the 10th anniversary of a nationwide uprising against
military rule. The demonstrations were eventually crushed and an
estimated 3,000 people died.
	   Last Sunday, the activists passed out leaflets in Yangon, the
Myanmar capital, urging people to remember the uprising and not
give up. No unrest was reported anywhere in the country.
	   ``When we gave out the goodwill messages, you could see the fear
in their eyes,'' said Tyler Gianini, 28, a Washington environmental
lawyer. ``But when we were able to do it subtly, you were able to
see the joy.''
	   Chong Kok Ywei, a Malaysian activist, said: ``I personally feel
that six or seven days for what we have done, if it advances human
rights and democracy and makes people's lives better in Burma, is
worth it.''
	   An organization working with the activists announced the
campaign to pass out leaflets well before they were to even try to
leave the country but claimed that their arrest was not a goal.
	   The activists were arrested and questioned for the next six
days. The government accused them of trying to incite unrest.
	   Diplomatic pressure built from their home countries for their
release. Some acknowledged that Myanmar's laws had been broken and
the activists knew the risks, while others said that there was no
crime handing out pieces of paper.
	   Diplomats were caught by surprise Friday when the activists were
suddenly put on trial in a courtroom next to Insein Prison, where
hundreds of political prisoners are kept.
	   Chattpar said: ``It was a big performance, it looked like they
were making it up as they went along.''
	   The activists were warned that if they return to Myanmar and
violate the laws again, they will serve the five-year suspended
term plus any new prison sentence they incur.
	   The leaflet campaign is part of an attempt by Myanmar's
pro-democracy opposition, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi,
to bring pressure on the government to meet her Aug. 21 deadline
for the military to convene a parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the elections, but the
government never recognized the result. The military has ruled
Myanmar since 1962.

Singapore's Lee worries about values in 2025
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asian youths need to be shielded against
adopting Western values through the influence of the Internet,
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore was quoted as saying
Saturday.
	   By the year 2025, the information technology revolution will
likely have caused changes in long-held social norms, the
74-year-old Singaporean leader was quoted as telling the Chinese
Xinhua news agency.
	   Singapore's government television and radio said that Lee told
the agency Asian youth ``should be inculcated with tried-and-tested
core values so they won't succumb to looser Western lifestyles.''
	   The reports quoted Lee as saying that by then every home will
have a multimedia computer ``and family cohesion will weaken when
members choose to interact with their peers on line.''
	   ``The younger generation may see their leaders as irrelevant and
outdated,'' Lee warned.

Opposition parties demand new Cambodian elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's two main opposition
parties called Saturday for new parliamentary elections unless
hundreds of complaints about irregularities in last month's vote
are investigated.
	   The continued refusal of the opposition to accept strongman Hun
Sen's declared victory has stymied attempts to form a new
government and bring political stability to the long-suffering
country.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party issued a
detailed document Saturday accusing Hun Sen, who deposed the prince
as co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago, of rigging the
polls in his favor.
	   Meanwhile, the prince's opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, told a
demonstration of some 200 people in front of the U.S. Embassy that
``the people demand a new election.''
	   ``The people voted for a change,'' Sam Rainsy said, ``but the
ruling party stole our votes.''
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won 64 of 122 National
Assembly seats in the July 26 elections but lacks the two-thirds
majority needed to form a government.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party, which together won 58 seats,
have alleged rampant fraud and have threatened to boycott
parliament unless more than 800 complaints are properly
investigated.
	   The Hun Sen-controlled National Election Committee has dismissed
their concerns as ``baseless'' and efforts by FUNCINPEC and the Sam
Rainsy Party to appeal have so far been blocked.
	   Failure to address their concerns ``calls into question the
legitimacy of the entire election process,'' FUNCINPEC said in a
lengthy report, detailing alleged irregularities in the voting and
counting process.
	   If the complaints are not properly investigated, FUNCINPEC said,
it ``has no other alternative'' but to ask King Norodom Sihanouk,
the prince's father, to consider a new election.
	   Though Sihanouk is the constitutional head of state, he lacks
the true power to force an election over the wishes of Hun Sen, the
country's most powerful politician.
	   Ranariddh's party also accused the election committee and other
administrative bodies of being biased in favor of Hun Sen's party.
	   FUNCINPEC also said that a climate of intimidation, violence and
threats in the months leading up to last month's vote marred the
entire process.
	   Hun Sen has invited FUNCINPEC into a coalition, but the royalist
party is hanging back with on-again, off-again ally Sam Rainsy in
an apparent attempt to wrest concessions on key posts.
	   The new assembly does not convene until Sept. 24, and bargaining
and brinkmanship could take weeks.
	   The July 26 elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh, shattering their tense dual premiership formed after the
U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen called the elections to restore his legitimacy in the
eyes of the international community and win back foreign aid. The
vote itself was quickly endorsed as sufficiently free and fair, but
observers were not present during most of the counting process.

At least five dead as mudslides bury cars in northern Italy

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ Mudslides barreling across the main
highway south of the Italian-Austrian border early Saturday killed
five Germans heading to Italy for holiday, RAI state radio
reported.
	   At least three people were reported injured in the tragedy on
the autostrada near the town of Fortezza, about 40 kilometers south
of the border, which is crossed by the Brenner Pass, one of
Europe's major north-south crossing points.
	   Three separate mudslides, triggered shortly after midnight by a
thunderstorm, struck in a valley in the South Tyrol, or Alto Adige,
in the heart of Italy's Alpine resort country.
	   Hundreds of firefighters, civil defense workers and other rescue
crew were digging through tons of mud and using metal detectors to
see if there were any other vehicles buried by the slides, which
covered the autostrada, Italy's highest-speed road, as well as a
local highway and rail line, which are all near each other at that
point in the valley.
	   RAI state radio said the dead included two German families in
two cars heading south. Among the five victims was a 7-year-old
boy.
	   No identities were immediately released.
	   All five bodies were recovered from the cars, which were buried
under a three meter (10-foot) high layer of mud and rocks, RAI
said.
	   Cars were backed up for kilometers (miles) along both sides of
the Brenner tunnel.
	   The slides struck on the Aug. 15 Assumption Day religious feast
day which is a national holiday in Italy and elsewhere in much of
Europe and the peak of Italy's vacation season.
	   Traffic is usually heaviest on the days before and after the
holiday.
	   Highway authorities said that the roads and rail lines would not
be cleared before Saturday night at the earliest.
	   No trains were hit, but train travelers on the major
international lines were facing several hours' delay. Rail travel
was diverted to other lines, and buses were used to move travelers
between Verona and the Austrian side of the border.
	   Rescue workers carried water and food to motorists stuck in the
backups.

Taliban leader says scholars will decide on democracy, human

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar has
assured Afghans that democracy and human rights will have a place
in his Islamic state, but says Muslim scholars will have to define
the terms.
	   Omar, in a speech read by an announcer on Taliban radio late
Friday, said scholars will discuss the place of democracy and human
rights in Afghanistan ``according to the Islamic law which has been
handed down from the beginning of Islam for all Muslims.''
	   He said all of Afghanistan's ethnic groups would be treated
equally. The Taliban are, like most Afghans, predominately Pashtun,
while their opposition is a coalition of various ethnic and
religious minorities. Taliban troops have been accused of harassing
or killing minorities in the towns they have captured.
	   ``The Taliban movement is an Islamic movement and there are no
differences between Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara and other Afghan''
ethnic groups, Omar said.
	   The Taliban, after a series of military victories in recent
weeks against their northern-based opposition, are on the verge of
conquering all of Afghanistan.
	   ``Our advancement in the north broke the spinal column of the
opposition,'' Omar said.
	   In the parts of the country they already control, their
interpretation of Islamic law has angered human rights activists.
Women are confined to the home, girls are denied an education, and
television, movies and books have been banned, thieves have their
hands cut off and murderers are publicly executed.
	   Muslim scholars in other countries have said Taliban rules owe
more to tribal traditions than to the Koran, Islam's holy book.
	   Omar also assured neighboring Iran and other countries that they
need not fear a total Taliban victory.
	   ``We don't want to interfere in other countries' affairs. We
have respect for our neighbors,'' Omar said.
	   Earlier Friday, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan and
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi met to share their concerns
over Afghanistan. Iran, which is predominately Shiite Muslim, has
been suspicious of the rise of the conservative Taliban, who adhere
to the Sunni sect of Islam.
	   According to Russia's Interfax news agency, Kharazi also
reiterated Iran's concerns about the reported abduction of 11
Iranians by Taliban forces, including employees of the Iranian
consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold the anti-Taliban
coalition recently lost.
	   Kazakstan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear
that if the Taliban gain control of all of Afghanistan, there will
be an influx of refugees and weapons across their borders.

Taiwan's master of the glove puppet makes final bow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Lee Tien-lu, revered as a national
treasure for breathing new life into Taiwan's age-old puppet
theater, died on Thursday at age 87, his family reported.
	   Lee passed away of heart and lung failure at his family home in
Sanchih, on Taiwan's northern tip, reports said.
	   Born during Japanese colonial rule, Lee chafed under the
governor's demands to inject pro-militarist propaganda into his
shows and was forced to abandon performances during the war years.
	   He later attracted large audiences in the television age by
mixing modern slang into the classical Taiwanese used in folk tales
acted out by wooden-headed cloth puppets and adding special effects
and dramatic acrobatic stunts.
	   ``Lee Tien-lu's life is the modern history of puppet theater. He
led, and the theater followed, bringing Taiwanese puppetry to the
world's attention,'' the United Daily News said in an obituary.
	   Lee served as director of his I Wan Ran puppet troupe until his
death, frequently performing abroad and appearing in Taiwanese
variety shows and in TV advertisements. Lee was honored by Taiwan,
France and the United States for his art.
	   With his two sons, he later established a pair of children's
troupes, the Wei Wan Ran and Chiao Wan Ran.
	   A physically slight man whose trademark was a French-style beret
cap, Lee was was the subject of director Hou Hsiao-hsien's
award-winning 1993 film, The Puppetmaster.
	   Brought by early immigrants from China's Fujian province, glove
puppetry, called ``Bo Dai Hei'' in Taiwanese, developed a distinct
character on the island and remains among the most popular of folk
arts.
	   Some 200 troupes stage public performances and a flashier
version of the theater draws a large audience on cable television.

Floods, other catastrophes, take bite out of Chinese economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With China-Floods &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Even in an average year for China, summer floods
bring weeks of misery, wrecking crops and leaving hundreds of
thousands of people homeless.
	   This year has brought the worst floods in at least four decades
_ forcing factories to close, swamping fertile farmland, wrecking
fish farms, destroying ports, bridges, rail, electricity and phone
lines and homes at a time when China is struggling to keep its
economy growing despite a region-wide crisis.
	   The floods head a list of natural catastrophes that have long
plagued this nation, encumbering its developing economy and
bringing untold suffering to a fifth of mankind.
	   A ruinous combination of geography, climate and huge population
have left the Chinese particularly vulnerable to flood, drought,
earthquakes, typhoons, snowstorms, landslides and toxic red tides.
	   Direct economic losses from this year's floods alone are
expected to surpass 200 billion yuan (dlrs 24 billion), the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported this week.
	   It said the floods could lop another 0.5 percentage points off
economic growth, which slowed to 7 percent in the first half of the
year, well below the 8 percent target the government insists it
must reach to provide jobs for millions left unemployed by
revamping state factories.
	   Swamping of fertile farmland along the Yangtze River has
scuttled hopes for a record harvest this year. The 2.2 billion yuan
(dlrs 266 million) rescue and relief effort is a huge burden for
the 20 provinces and regions, from northeastern Heilongjiang down
to southwestern Guangxi, affected by serious flooding.
	   Even before the floods, government economists were predicting
natural calamities would cost China an average of 200 billion yuan
to 250 billion yuan (dlrs 24 billion to dlrs 30 billion) annually
over the next few years.
	   ``Natural disasters have already become a major factor hindering
economic growth in China,'' Xinhua quoted Zhou Guangzhao, chairman
of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, as telling a
conference in May.
	   In the short term, floods and other disasters can help generate
slight construction booms, as homes, roads and factories are
rebuilt. But for many of the 240 million reportedly affected by
this year's floods _ one fifth of the population _ they mean seeing
a lifetime of effort washed away, and starting over from scratch.
	   ``Apart from a few houses we managed to protect, all of the
other property has been completely destroyed, all in one go. All is
gone, the roads, the industry, the crops, ordinary people's
belongings,'' said Ho Zhengwu, chief of Anzhang town in Hunan
province, one of the areas most severely affected by the floods.
	   The torrential rains are just the latest disaster to hit the
country.
	   This year, severe snowstorms wiped out livestock herds in
eastern Tibet, major earthquakes leveled Zhangbei, an impoverished
farming area north of Beijing and drought withered crops in parts
of both north and south China.
	   China's 1.2 billion population is most heavily concentrated in
flood basins and in eastern coastal areas that often are hit by
earthquakes, floods and typhoons.
	   Since Communist China was founded in 1949, more than 500,000
people have died in natural disasters. Floods along the Yangtze in
1954, killed 30,000 people.
	   Although China's Communist Party rulers have staked their claim
to power on their ability to nurture economic growth and protect
the people from famine and other calamities, several thousand
people still die each year because of natural disasters. The
government reports more than 2,000 have died in this summer's
floods.
	   An environment grown fragile over centuries of intensive
farming, excessive logging and other ecological devastations has
accentuated the problem.
	   Hillsides denuded of trees and other natural vegetation become
prone to landslides. Instead of soaking into the soil, rainfall
carves away the land, rivers are choked with silt and streambeds
rise, increasing the likelihood and severity of floods.
	   A report by the State Environmental Protection Administration
pointed to poor land use and unwise water conservation planning as
key factors behind this summer's floods.
	   ``Human abuses of nature have invited more frequent disasters,''
the official newspaper China Daily said in a commentary Thursday,
arguing that only ecologically sound development would enable the
country to build a strong economy.
	   ``The attribution of the calamity to nature is an alibi.''

Report: Jakarta governor calls on citizens to arm themselves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ As rumors of possible riots sweep
Jakarta, its governor has reportedly called on the capital's
residents to arm themselves with clubs, spears and swords.
	   ``Don't hesitate to use weapons to protect yourselves ... that's
completely tolerable if it's for self-defense,'' the Jakarta Post
newspaper Saturday quoted Gov. Sutiyoso as saying.
	   ``Use any weapon _ clubs, spears, klewang (type of sword),
scissors, anything _ to defend yourself because those who might
come to plunder your neighborhood will certainly not come with bare
hands,'' he said.
	   The governor couldn't be reached for immediate comment.
	   About 15,000 troops and police have been put on alert in Jakarta
after rumors suggested rioting might break out over the weekend
ahead of Indonesia's national day of independence on Monday.
	   But Sutiyoso said citizens should not just rely on protection
from the police and army, the newspaper Kompas reported.
	   ``If men don't have the guts to fight against looters, they may
as well wear a skirt,'' the paper quoted him as saying.
	   He said women and children should also be taught how to fight
back.
	   Government officials have repeatedly dismissed the rumors as
baseless. Nevertheless, they taken have taken major security
precautions in the wake of massive riots that shook the city in May
and led to the resignation of longtime President Suharto.
	   About 1,200 people died in the violence and arson attacks.
Women's groups allege 168 women and girls were raped, many of them
ethnic Chinese who were targeted for their affluence. Thousands of
houses and buildings were ransacked and burned.

Strike paralyzes economic hub
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's economic hub was closed for
business Saturday, with supporters of the political party that
called the general strike erecting barricades of burning tires and
firing warning shots to make sure their ``day of mourning'' was
observed.
	   The Mohajir Quami Movement withdrew from the federal government
a day earlier to protest the violence that has engulfed Karachi for
years. Saturday, party spokeswoman Nasreen Jaleel, a federal
senator, said the party would also withdraw from the provincial
government in Sindh, where Karachi is located, in two days if the
government did not arrest those responsible for the deaths of 10
party workers.
	   ``There is no law in the city,'' Jaleel said. ``What is the
purpose of staying in a government that ... cannot arrest the
murderers?''
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif can govern without the MQM at the
federal level, but Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat Jatoi's provincial
government would topple without MQM support.
	   Three days ago, eight MQM party members were killed by gunmen
who sprayed a crowd sitting in a park. Two others injured that day
later died. The MQM blamed a breakaway faction with whom it has
been locked in a violent power struggle.
	   More than 500 people have been killed in Karachi's political,
ethnic and sectarian violence this year, compared with about 400 in
1997. Saturday, an unidentified, bullet-riddled body found in one
of the city's most volatile neighborhoods was believed to be the
latest political casualty.
	   Buses and taxis stayed off the streets and shops were closed
throughout the city Saturday. Security forces patrolled the streets
after a night disturbed by gunfire, most of it believed to be
warning shots. The tire barricades Saturday morning underlined the
message.

Military govt says activists, Suu Kyi trying to rock state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military regime accused opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi and 18 deported foreign democracy activists
Saturday of trying to destabilize the state, but vowed the army
would stay strong to crush them.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, remained at a
road block 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of Yangon as a standoff
with authorities dragged into a fifth day. Officials are blocking
her from meeting with provincial party supporters.
	   Gen. Maung Aye, the army commander and one of the top four
generals in the ruling State Peace and Development Council, said in
a speech to troops reported by official newspapers Saturday that
``traitors'' were working with foreign powers.
	   ``Because of the lack of local support, the puppets are slowly
becoming dependent on their foreign masters,'' Maung Aye was quoted
as saying in Friday's speech. ``Synchronizing with the masters'
command, they are committing various disruptive acts.''
	   No names were mentioned, but Maung Aye was clearly referring to
Suu Kyi's standoff and to the 18 activists who were held in custody
for a week for distributing leaflets urging Myanmar's people to
remember a failed nationwide uprising against military rule.
	   Borrowing a tactic from the activists, a pro-government party
passed around leaflets at shopping centers and elsewhere in Yangon
saying that ``18 foreigners and internal traitors are trying to
create unrest in the country and instigate the public.''
	   The leaflets said it was ``the national duty of citizens to
oppose these internal ax-handles.''
	   The diplomatic frenzy to free the activists overshadowed Suu
Kyi's latest attempted foray into the provinces, where she has been
allowed only once _ to visit a Buddhist monk _ since being freed
from formal house arrest in 1995.
	   She remains largely confined to her home, however, and has
recently used the government's determination to stop her traveling
to create non-violent confrontations.
	   International condemnation of the government _ one of the few
tools available to Suu Kyi _ accompanied a recent six-day standoff
at the same roadblock that ended two weeks ago when she was
forcibly driven back to Yangon. She suffered from fever and
dehydration.
	   Sources in her National League for Democracy party said Saturday
that she had taken milk, cake, biscuits and water for the standoff
this time. She is accompanied by Hla Pe, 75, a member of the
party's central executive committee, and two drivers.
	   The government has said an ambulance is on standby. The party
has expressed fears that the wooden bridge Suu Kyi's van is on may
not be able to support the vehicle's weight for long periods.
	   Security around the area is tight. A traveler passing by Friday
saw Suu Kyi standing outside the vehicle.

Bombings probe pushes ahead; Kenyans still in shock

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with evidence arriving in Washington, funerals in
Kenya, Clinton's videotaped message, more on Albright plans &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ While the investigation to unmask the
mystery bombers in East Africa entered a second week Saturday
without firm answers, Kenyans were still mourning the dead and
wondering how their capital could have become ``another Beirut.''
	   The FBI says it will take another month or more to finish
examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people and injured more than
5,500.
	   In the shadow of the bombed embassy in Nairobi, not far from a
mound of memorial bouquets that cast their work in poignant
perspective, helmeted investigators continued poking through rubble
while others pored over evidence in tents nearby.
	   A British forensic team was on the way to aid the FBI's 215
agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians, computer specialists,
photographers and translators in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the two
bomb-hit capitals.
	   Bombing evidence was expected to arrive at the FBI laboratories
in Washington this weekend for tests to confirm what explosives
were used and whether the two bombs had the same ingredients.
	   Police here are working on new leads they hope will enable them
to trace the vehicle used in the bombing _ a yellow pickup truck or
van _ which local reports say was apparently bought locally shortly
before the attack.
	   Investigators have declined to discuss specifics of the probe.
But employees at one Nairobi car dealership said Friday that police
had called in the firm's owner for questioning the previous day as
they tried to find out about the bombers. What he said was not
immediately known.
	   Nine badly charred bodies still lie in cold storage at morgues,
unclaimed more than a week after the deadliest attack on a U.S.
embassy. Funeral services for others were being held Saturday
across Kenya, where the newspapers were filled with black-bordered
death announcements.
	   In a videotaped message, U.S. President Clinton extended
condolences to the victims' families, saying ``We grieve
together.''
	   ``Violent extremists try to use bullets and bombs to derail our
united efforts to bring peace to every part of this earth,'' he
said.
	   ``But I am proud that our nations have also renewed our
commitment to stand together _ to bring the offender swiftly to
justice, to combat terrorism in all its forms and to create a more
tolerant and peaceful world for our children,'' Clinton said.
	   At a somber service Friday in Nairobi, which suffered 247
bombing deaths, families and friends remembered 13 people killed in
the collapse of a building next to the embassy. They comprised half
the staff of an insurance brokerage.
	   ``We are wondering how Nairobi could have become a Beirut, a
Belfast,'' banker Sam Kamau said in a mournful eulogy.
	   In a procession of grief, relatives and friends of the dead each
carried a bouquet of pink carnations with a single flickering
candle.
	   ``They were caught in a conflict they didn't know about,'' said
Kamau, representing friends and clients of the dead. ``We ask,
`Why?'''
	   Before the ceremony, mourners expressed anger and bewilderment
at the devastating toll on Kenya for what presumably was an act of
political terrorism against the United States.
	   ``Fight the enemy on its own territory,'' said George Kariuki,
an insurance broker.
	   There is some anger at the United States, both for allegedly not
moving swiftly enough to rescue victims _ all but 12 of them
Kenyans _ and for warning Americans against traveling to Kenya.
	   The travel advisory, which would have dealt a serious blow to
Kenya's tourism industry, was lifted late Thursday after Kenyan
protests. And on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced she will leave Sunday for the two East African capitals
to meet with investigators and console the injured.
	   Her four-day trip that amounts to a show of support, and a
declaration of U.S. resolve in the face of terrorism.

China gives medicine to cash-strapped Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ China is giving dlrs 3 million worth
of medicine and dlrs 200 million in export credits to cash-strapped
Indonesia, a news report said Saturday.
	   ``This is our contribution to help Indonesia to overcome
medicine shortages and alleviate patients' suffering,'' China's
ambassador to Indonesia, Chen Shiqiu, was quoted as saying by the
official news agency Antara.
	   China now joins a host of nations sending medical and other aid
to Indonesia, where the Asian economic collapse is causing a
worsening crisis of public health.
	   Doctors warn the economic recession in Indonesia, the worst in
30 years, could bring new outbreaks of disease with millions of
newly poor unable to afford basic medicines.
	   Experts say the economy is shrinking by around 15 percent and 80
million people are expected to fall beneath the poverty line by the
end of 1998.
	   Chen said 8,769 containers of antibiotics, anti-parasite
medicine and medical equipment had already arrived and would be
distributed to communities in most dire need.
	   China's assistance comes despite criticism by Beijing of
Indonesia over attacks against ethnic Chinese Indonesians during
rioting that rocked Jakarta and other cities in May.
	   Protesters in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States and
other countries have staged demonstrations against the alleged
rapes of ethnic Chinese women during the riots, which led to the
resignation of former President Suharto.
	   The Chinese embassy in Jakarta has offered to help ethnic
Chinese with visas and protection if there is further rioting in
Indonesia.

in and out of Indonesia ahead of Monday's anniversary.
	   Antara said Chinese had boarded planes for several Asian cities
as well as the Hindu island of Bali.
	   Ethnic Chinese, who are mainly Christian and Buddhist, make up
only a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million predominately
Muslim population.
	   However, they figure prominently in the economy and have been
made scapegoats for the financial crisis.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At 10:39:20 a.m., Friday, Aug. 7, the
University of Nairobi geology department detected a small tremor.
Eight seconds later it registered another, this one with a 3.4
magnitude. They were not earthquakes.
	   The first was the shock from a hand grenade, the second the
blast from a huge explosion. At virtually the same moment, 450
miles (725 kilometers) away, a single boom shattered the
tranquility of the port city of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.
	   It had been a gray and chilly Friday in Nairobi, 5,496 feet
(1,675 meters) above sea level and still gripped by the southern
hemisphere's winter. It was sunny and humid In Dar es Salaam. In
both cities, thousands of people were at work or in the streets,
shopping or running errands, and looking forward to the weekend.
	   Suddenly, windows shattered. Chunks of concrete and twisted
steel rained down. Nostrils burned with fire and smoke. Under the
debris, voices cried out.
	   And in the areas that took the brunt of the bombs, there was
silence. The silence of the dead.
	   In both cities, 257 people were dead; 5,500-plus were injured.
	   Moments earlier, about 10:35 a.m., Kenyan security guards at the
front of the U.S. Embassy had stopped five men in a truck at the
parking lot entrance. Go around the back, guard Joash Okindo told
them, to the rear parking lot.
	   Julius Koiyet, a preacher, was waiting to board a bus outside
the embassy when he heard a blast. A blowout, he thought. Then
people started running from the embassy.
	   He headed toward the back of the building and saw a yellow van
with four men in it driving into the parking lot. A man jumped from
the van and opened fire.
	   ``I thought it was a normal bank robbery,'' he said. ``The man
saw that I was not afraid, and he fired at me on the shoulder and I
fell down.''
	   The men in the van then threw a tin container a foot (30
centimeters) high toward the embassy. It exploded. Two more
cylinders followed, he said.
	   Okindo, the security guard, saw the attackers jump from the
truck and open fire with automatic rifles. They shot a guard and
hurled a grenade. At least one Marine returned fire.
	   At his desk on the third floor near the front of the embassy,
Kevin Richardson, 43, of Hackensack, New Jersey, heard an
explosion. He went to the window to take a look.
	   ``I just thought another demonstration was going on,'' said
Richardson, the embassy refugee officer. From the window, ``I could
see some of the Kenyan employees of the embassy who just happened
to be outside and they were running.''
	   At the four-story Ufundi Cooperative House next door, Sammy
Ng'ang'a, a 48-year-old scrap metal dealer, had dropped by to see a
friend. He heard a noise and saw people rush to windows facing the
embassy to see what was happening.
	   It was the natural thing to do, but it put a lot of people in
front of a lot of glass.
	   Then came ``a very, very loud explosion,'' Richardson said.
``The building started to shake and the lights went out and I hit
the floor.''
	   Richardson heard his assistant, Immy Rose Lassiter, shouting:
``Are you OK? Are you OK? What happened? What should we do?''
Richardson did what he learned in embassy bomb and fire drills _ he
locked his safe and left.
	   ``It was fairly dark,'' he said, ``so we had to feel our way
along the walls to get out.''
	   They made their way to the elevator. ``One elevator door was
shut,'' he said. ``The other had sprung open and you could see
lights and smoke coming out of the shaft.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell had just finished a press
conference with Kenya's Minister of Trade Joseph Kamotho and was in
his office on the 18th floor of the 22-story Cooperative Bank
building when she heard the explosion. For a moment, she thought it
must be from construction.
	   Next thing she knew, she said, ``I was sitting and had my hands
over my head, which was why I had cuts on my hand.''
	   Two floors below, a table propelled by the blast slammed into
John Mukuru. ``I saw some objects falling, falling. ... I heard
people screaming. ... Then I tried to get out of the office.''
	   All communication between the embassy and the outside world was
cut.
	   Hundreds of miles (kilometers) away in Dar es Salaam, Tanzanian
Ibrahim Pamba walked out of the U.S. Embassy and saw a blue tanker
truck maneuvering to turn on Laibon Road.
	   ``There was nothing suspicious,'' Pamba said. ``It was an
ordinary day.''
	   Minutes later, an explosion stopped embassy clocks at 10:39 a.m.
	   Acting Ambassador John Lange was in his office with eight other
people when the windows shattered, cutting several of them with
flying glass. At the guard house at the front gate, Valentine
Katunda of the Ultimate Security company was buried alive.
	   At Nairobi Hospital, the city's largest, administrator Mike
Sheldon was in his office when he heard an explosion.
	   ``We thought it was an earthquake, thought the roof in surgery
had caved in,'' he said. ``Then word got back that it was a bomb.
We went down to casualty to implement our major disaster plan.''
	   The blast interrupted a meeting 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the
embassy, in the office of Nairobi Provincial Police Chief Isaac
Muthuri. He rushed outside when he heard the blast.
	   ``I saw smoke and we realized there was something serious and we
rushed to the scene,'' he said.
	   Help was on the way, but people at the scene already were
helping one another.
	   Bernard Njoroge Mirangi, a 47-year-old railway laborer, had been
trying to cash a check on the ground floor of the Cooperative Bank
when he was hit in the head by a toppling beam. He got up, kicked
out a glass window and escaped. But he immediately went back inside
to help two women get out.
	   ``There was thick smoke outside and metal structures were
falling,'' he said. ``I carried one woman on my shoulders and held
the other by the hand.''
	   Inside the embassy, Richardson and Lassiter held hands as they
groped their way down a stairway.
	   ``There was a lot of smoke and other smells we couldn't
identify. Some of the emergency lights had come on. There was a
large amount of debris on the stairways,'' Richardson said. ``By
that time, there were people from other floors entering the
stairway, trying to get out of the building.''

NAIROBI, Kenya: the building.''

	   At the Cooperative Bank, Mukuru also was trying to get down
stairs.
	   ``People got there and were stuck, with blood all over,'' he
said. ``I had blood all over. I was feeling that my head is not
there.''
	   Richardson and Lassiter emerged from the embassy and checked
each other to be sure they were OK.
	   ``Just like everybody else, we were all covered with dust and
smoke,'' Richardson said. ``Crowds were coming toward the embassy
from all over. ... I could see fire coming from the back of the
building and people running around, some quite injured.''
	   Ambassador Bushnell, her lower lip cut badly enough to need
stitches, doesn't know whether she lost consciousness when the
blast hit.
	   ``There was debris coming all over, and the clinking and the
clanging, and then all of a sudden it was silent.'' she said. ``My
first thought was, is the building going to collapse and aye, aye,
aye, we're on the 18th floor.''
	   With a colleague who was bleeding profusely, she made it to the
stairs and started walking.
	   ``As we went down the stairs, every door from hallway into
stairwell had been blown in. So, we were walking over doors. There
was blood everywhere. Now and again you would find a shoe. ... As
we got further and further down, there was much more smoke.
	   ``By the time we got probably to the third floor, second floor,
people were very pressed together. I have to say it was not a
stampede and it was not a panic. People were taking care of one
another. Everybody was bleeding ... and the bannister was wet with
blood.''
	   About 10:45 a.m., the first wave of casualties arrived at
Nairobi Hospital. ``There must have been at least 100,'' Sheldon
says.
	   Abraham Muthogo Kamau, a 28-year-old corporate analyst at the
Cooperative Bank, was among them, driven to the hospital by a
passer-by. He had glass cuts all over his body, shards embedded on
the left side of his head and in his left knee. His shirt, tie and
trousers were shreds.
	   He said an American doctor at the hospital was treating two
injured Americans, but not the Kenyan victims.
	   ``All he cared about was the Americans,'' Kamau said. ``It's not
fair. Human life is human life _ Kenyan life or American life. ...
It's changed my attitude towards Americans.''
	   About this time in Dar es Salaam, acting ambassador Lange
reached the U.S. Marine post.
	   ``Amazingly ... the phones were still working,'' he said, ``so I
quickly called the State Department Operations Center and told them
there was a huge explosion in the embassy.''
	   Bleeding from her head, embassy employee Laurel McMullen helped
another woman down the stairs. ``I remember immediately thinking,
`We have been bombed,''' she said.
	   Jim Owens, an American visiting the embassy, saw the guard house
was burning. Elizabeth Mary Slater, an embassy employee, saw ``just
twisted, contorted metal.''
	   Owens and McMullen both described popping noises.
	   ``The marines thought it was gunfire ... and kept shouting `get
down, get down','' said Owens.
	   Later, they found out the noise was burning tires exploding. At
least 22 vehicles parked outside were destroyed.
	   Tanzanian police, embassy security, extra guards from Ultimate
Security all arrived on the scene. Dozens were there by the time
McMullen emerged from the building.
	   Employees waited for word from embassy security and then climbed
over the 6-foot (1.8-meter)-high exterior wall of the compound with
the help of a ladder.
	   The wounded and ultimately the dead also passed over the wall.
Security company cars, police, civilian cars, public minibuses
known as Dala Dalas, helped carry wounded to hospital.
	   It was 11:30 a.m. when the first casualties began arriving at
state-owned Muhimbili hospital in Dar es Salaam. Katunda was the
only one of the four guards at the front entrance to survive.
	   Embassy staff in Nairobi, meanwhile, contacted the State
Department Operations Center to tell them about the explosion and
were told that they had just heard from the embassy in Dar es
Salaam about a similar blast.
	   Within an hour after the explosion in Nairobi, the crowd around
the embassy had grown to thousands.
	   ``Many people were trying to dig through rubble with their bare
hands, trying to help people trapped inside,'' Richardson said.
``There were just a whole lot of rescue people, embassy people and
others going floor by floor to check for people who could not get
out on their own.''
	   U.S. Marines, Kenyan police, soldiers and Red Cross workers
tried to control the crowds, pushing onlookers away so ambulances
and fire trucks could move freely.
	   Richardson went to the undamaged U.S. Agency for International
Development building, where he started compiling a list of staff
and employees to check who was missing.
	   About 1:30 p.m., at the request of the American Embassy, a
British Army convoy of about 35 personnel arrived to help. They
found broken glass everywhere, tiles off roofs and about 10,000
Kenyans standing around watching. The adjacent Ufundi building was
a frenzy of people digging and pulling things out.
	   ``Total chaos really,'' Capt. Rhyl Jones, commander of the
British contingent, recalled of the scene. ``Devastation and chaos.
This was bigger than anything I've seen.''
	   A half-dozen Marines were among about 20 Americans at the
embassy. Some British and American engineers and their teams were
digging, some were searching for a missing Marine.
	   ``A lot of them, I think, had been in the building when the bomb
went off and they were pretty well shocked,'' said Staff Sgt. Eddie
Elms. ``But I think they were more concerned about a second attack
on the building, and just putting up a cordon around the building
to ensure security.''

	   After putting men at the perimeter and checking the building to
make sure it wouldn't collapse, Jones sent others inside to check
for survivors. In the hours ahead, they found two survivors and 20
to 25 bodies.
	   About 3:30 p.m., Richardson went to the Nairobi city morgue.
``After showing my embassy badge, I was escorted to the only
criminal pathologist in Kenya, who was trying to organize what was
going on. And at the same time, he told me there were already 54
dead. Of course, the number went much higher. I was able to
identify one official American.
	   ``As it turned out, there were two other people associated with
the embassy who were there, although I was not immediately able to
recognize them. They were bringing in bodies in really bad shape.
After 20 minutes there ... I realized I was not as tough as I
thought I was, and so I left.''
	   All that afternoon, rescue work also proceeded in Dar es Salaam.
By 4:40 p.m., all the dead and wounded were evacuated from the
embassy there, spokesman Dudley Simms said.
	   That night, Richardson couldn't sleep. Instead, he went from
hospital to hospital, searching for the missing.
	   ``We really didn't find anybody,'' he said, ``because it was
just too chaotic at the hospital.''
	   Shortly after daybreak Saturday, Red Cross spokeswoman Nina
Galbe saw a flurry of activity at the bomb site in Nairobi.
	   ``I remember the sound of all these axes, metal against stone,
like a hacking, the clinking _ at the same time it was pitiful,''
Galbe said. ``It was pitiful because they could do so little. And
then there was an anger as well because there was no coordination
at all.''
	   ``Everyone was just tearing and pulling and pushing at this
stone monster that would not be tamed or broken,'' Galbe said.
	   The cranes were standing by idly, she said, because nobody knew
how to use them.
	   In the early morning hours before Galbe had arrived, rescuers
had reached a man lying on a table. They cut the table from
underneath, thinking it would then fall so they could pull him out.
	   ``Instead, what happened was, of course, that the rubble on top
of him fell down as well and he was crushed,'' Galbe said.
	   As the morning wore on, rescuers found another survivor. When
they called for a stretcher, hopes rose. Shortly afterward, they
called for a stethoscope. The man was dead.
	   ``These were two people who were alive, who with more
sophisticated tools might have been clearly saved,'' Galbe said.
	   Shortly after 2 p.m., an Israeli search-and-rescue team _ 181
men and women and eight sniffer dogs _ arrived and took charge.
They saw two cranes, a bulldozer and a backhoe standing by.
Soldiers, police officers and civilians were picking over the
rubble, many with their bare hands.
	   The Israelis used a bulldozer to clear debris blocking the path
behind the Ufundi building. They looked over the ruins and put the
cranes to work, digging into the rubble, calling for survivors.
	   Ng'ang'a, the scrap metal dealer, replied. So did Rose Wanjiku
Irungu, a 36-year-old employee of the Cooperative Bank.
	   About 10:30 p.m., the Israelis reached Ng'ang'a.
	   ``They are coming for you next,'' he called to Rose. He was
rushed to Nairobi Hospital with a broken leg and deep gashes on his
head.
	   In Uhuru (Freedom) Park, people streamed to a Red Cross center
to donate blood. Several preachers swayed and sang on a makeshift
platform in the park, joined by about 4,000 men, women and
children. Their songs ranged from the exultant to the mournful in
memory of those killed in the blast. Their shabby clothes marked
them as the urban poor.
	   At 3 p.m. Sunday, rescuers heard Rose speak. Their digging took
on a new urgency.
	   It was Tuesday afternoon when Charles Kamuti, 31, went to the
city morgue, looking for his younger brother, Lawrence, an
assistant pharmacist in the Cooperative Bank building. A friend
said Lawrence, 29, had run to the street after hearing the grenade.
	   And it was Tuesday afternoon when Rose's rescue seemed near. Two
search dogs veered toward a hole in the debris of the Ufundi
building, now shrunken by more than two-thirds, and barked
excitedly.
	   Shoulder to shoulder, Kenyans and Israelis used shovels,
pickaxes and their hands. Finally, they reached a body. It wasn't
Rose.
	   It was Wednesday, about 2:30 p.m., when the Israelis called for
silence and dropped a microphone deep into the ruins in hopes of
picking up some sound from Rose.
	   It was 3 a.m. Thursday by the time rescuers wearily removed the
last layers of debris from the one victim the world hoped might be
saved.
	   They slipped her broken body into a white plastic bag and drove
it to the morgue. Rose had died less than 24 hours before they
reached her, rescuers said.
	   Sniffer dogs made one last check at 10 a.m. Nothing. The Israeli
commander declared the search for survivors over.
	   It wasn't until about 3 p.m. Friday that the body of Kamuti's
brother was identified from fingerprints. But nine undentified
bodies remained in cold storage at morgues and seven families have
filed reports with the Red Cross saying relatives are missing.
	   Today, dwarfed by the bombed U.S. Embassy and a blackened office
tower, a small, flower-covered pyramid of concrete rubble has
become a memorial to the dead and a magnet for the grief of a
nation.
	   Amid the bouquets of roses and colored ribbons, someone has
placed a hand-lettered sign, summing up the sorrow that has
enveloped this deeply religious east African country. Written in
red ink, it says:
	   ``Cry Kenya''
	   ``Pray Kenya''
	   ``God Heal Kenya''
	   There is no memorial at the now abandoned U.S. Embassy in Dar es
Salaam. Just rows of barbed wire and U.S. Marines with assault
rifles who keep curious onlookers away.

Saddam's son orders amputations to punish commandos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Odai Hussein, the son of the Iraqi leader,
ordered that six members of an elite commando unit who used their
positions to rob citizens be punished by having a hand amputated,
an Iraqi newspaper reported Saturday.
	   An army deserter also involved in the alleged banditry was
ordered punished in a similar way, said the daily Babil, an
Arabic-language newspaper published by Odai.
	   The order _ the first of its kind involving the Fedayeen Saddam,
or Saddam's Commandos _ was in a letter from Odai dated Aug. 7, the
paper said. The letter ordered that the amputations be carried out
within 48 hours.
	   The paper did not say if this had occurred.
	   The Fedayeen Saddam, named for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, is a
paramilitary force created in 1996 and commanded by Odai. Its role
is to resist any uprisings or coups against the leadership.
	   The group is believed to have a working core of about 20,000 to
25,000 men and women, but other volunteers can be called up if
needed.
	   Iraq had suspended the use of amputations as a method of
punishment, mainly applied to in the past to military deserters or
bandits. But it was reinstated in recent weeks amid reports of
rising crime in Iraq.
	   The country has been hard-hit by trade sanctions, imposed by the
U.N. Security Council after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and limit the sale
of oil, which is Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Babil said Saturday that the amputations were ordered after six
members of the group were caught setting up a check point near the
southern town of Basra and robbing people in the cars they stopped.
Basra is 550 kilometers (330 miles) south of the capital Baghdad.
	   The seventh man was identified by the paper as a
non-commissioned officer in the army who had deserted.
	   The paper said that an investigation by officers of the Fedayeen
Saddam, ordered by Odai, ``proved the seven used their profession
to rob people.''
	   It added: ``Because of the danger of such an incident by those
Fedayeen which injured the pride of the people, the country and
their faith in God ... the general supervisor of Fedayeen Saddam
has decided to punish them by cutting the hand of each one of
them.''
	   The paper said that the punishments were ordered despite pleas
from fellow members of the commando force that the men be pardoned.
	   Odai was determined to carry out the punishment to maintain
public respect for the commando force, the Babil said.
	   ``It is the duty to carry on with the punishment immediately
because how can we expect a thief to protect the country and the
women and children of Iraq,'' the paper quoted Odai as saying in
the letter.
	   The paper said the amputations were to be witnessed by 10
members of the Fedayeen, 10 members of Saddam's ruling Baath party
and 10 citizens ``in addition to all those who were robbed by the
seven.''

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's economic hub was closed for
business Saturday, with supporters of a general strike erecting
barricades of burning tires and firing shots to make sure their
``day of mourning'' was observed.
	   Police said at least five people were killed and four injured in
violence linked to the strike by the Mohajir Quami Movement, the
main political party in Karachi.
	   The MQM withdrew from the federal government a day earlier to
protest the violence that has engulfed Karachi for years. Saturday,
party spokeswoman Nasreen Jaleel, a federal senator, said the party
would also withdraw from the provincial government in Sindh, where
Karachi is located, in two days if the government did not arrest
those responsible for the deaths of 10 party workers.
	   ``There is no law in the city,'' Jaleel said.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif can govern without the MQM at the
federal level. But Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat Jatoi's provincial
government would topple without MQM support.
	   Three days ago, eight MQM party members were killed by gunmen
who sprayed gunfire into a crowd sitting in a park. Two others
injured that day later died. The MQM blamed a breakaway faction
with whom it has been locked in a violent power struggle.
	   More than 500 people have been killed in Karachi's political,
ethnic and sectarian violence this year, compared with about 400 in
1997. Saturday, an unidentified, bullet-riddled body found in one
of the city's most volatile neighborhoods was believed to be the
latest political casualty. Police linked four other shooting deaths
Friday and Saturday to the strike.
	   Tire barricades Saturday morning helped keep buses and taxis
from plying their routes, and shops were closed throughout the
city. Security forces patrolled after a night disturbed by gunfire,
most of it believed to be warning shots. Unidentified gunmen fired
on a patrol, injuring four paramilitary soldiers.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Members of Japan's new Cabinet made controversial
visits to a Tokyo war shrine Saturday as part of ceremonies to
commemorate the 53rd anniversary of the end of World War II.
	   Eight Cabinet members, including Transport Minister Jiro
Kawasaki and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Seiko Noda, paid
their respects at Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japanese soldiers
fallen in battle _ including several convicted war criminals.
	   Such visits in the past have elicited angry criticisms from
other Asian countries, who see them as one more sign of the
Japanese government's reluctance to take responsibility for its
aggression in World War II.
	   The politicians, dressed in black and wearing somber
expressions, bowed deeply before the altar in Yasukuni's main
building.
	   Five more Cabinet members had already paid their respects
recently at the shrine, Japan's state-run NHK news said.
	   Nearby, more than 6,000 people streamed into a city martial arts
auditorium to attend a memorial service led by Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and Emperor Akihito.
	   The auditorium held a one minute moment of silence to remember
the 3.1 million Japanese soldiers and civilians who died in what in
Japanese is known as the Great Pacific War.
	   Japanese usually consider the war as starting with Tokyo's
invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and ending when Japan capitulated to
the Allies on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   ``The war caused great pain and suffering, particularly to
neighboring countries in Asia. We would like to express our deep
regret and condolences to them sincerely,'' Obuchi said at the
start of the service.
	   Prime ministers only started expressing remorse at the annual
ceremony six years ago, Kyodo News said. This was Obuchi's first
ceremony since his government took power last month.
	   Obuchi, who has been an outspoken defender of visits to
Yasukuni, then bowed deeply before a Shinto altar with a wooden
sign that read ``the spirits of those from the entire nation who
died in war.''
	   The emperor and his wife, Empress Michiko, also bowed before the
altar.
	   ``So many lost lives, it make us sad,'' Akihito told the
auditorium. ``We hope war will never be repeated.''

Police intensify manhunt for killer of 10 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ILOILO, Philippines (AP) _ Police on Saturday intensified the
manhunt for the three remaining killers of 10 people, including a
U.S. Peace Corps volunteer, during an unprovoked shooting rampage
in the central Philippines.
	   About 100 policemen, including a crack team from a presidential
anti-crime task force, have assigned to track down the suspects,
including the alleged mastermind, said police Maj. Camilo Cascolan.
	   Cascolan said that aside from additional manpower, policemen
also were using motorlaunches to prevent the suspects from escaping
to nearby islands. Photos of the suspects also have been
distributed to buses, jeeps and motorized pedicabs, he said.
	   The victims were murdered Wednesday night in Sara town when the
five men, apparently drunk or high on drugs, fired assault rifles
and pistols at the occupants of four passing vehicles. After the
killing, the men stole the victims' belongings.
	   Among those dead was Robert Bock, 33, of New York, a U.S. Peace
Corps volunteer who was working as a fishery consultant in
Concepcion, near Sara.
	   Bock, whose parents are from Virginia, was assigned to Iloilo
last year and was one of four American Peace Corps volunteers
working there, the U.S. Peace Corps office in Manila said.
	   Police said a suspect who was picked up for questioning Thursday
was arrested after tests showed traces of nitrates on his hands,
indicating he had recently fired a gun. Another suspect was
arrested Friday.
	   The Peace Corps returned to the Philippines in 1992 after an
18-month absence following the kidnapping of a volunteer. Bock was
one of 108 volunteers in the country, many working in development
and environmental projects.
	   Iloilo is about 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.

	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Paraguay's president-elect Raul Cubas
Grau has vowed to wage war against corruption as the first elected
civilian to succeed another in this young democracy.
	   Cubas was to be inaugurated today to succeed President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy, Paraguay's first elected president after a 34-year
military dictatorship ended in 1989.
	   The transfer of power comes amid an economic and political
crisis in this South American nation of 5.6 million, where
unemployment hovers around 15 percent and industries are
threatened.
	   The country is grappling with bitter political feuding and
corruption that Cubas says has siphoned off dlrs 2 billion since
1996.
	   ``The priority of my government will be a frontal assault
against corruption,'' Cubas told The Associated Press hours ahead
of his inauguration.
	   Cubas easily won a May 10 election to extend the long-ruling
Colorado Party's dominance of politics in this landlocked nation
that borders Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia.
	   The Colorados have ruled Paraguay since 1947, through both
dictatorship and democracy.
	   An engineer by training, Cubas, 54, served briefly as economics
minister under Wasmosy.
	   For many voters, a leading question has been what Cubas will do
with former presidential candidate Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, who is
jailed at an infantry base on the outskirts of the capital,
Asuncion.
	   Originally the vice presidential nominee, Cubas became the
presidential candidate after Oviedo, the winner of a September 1997
primary, was imprisoned in the middle of the campaign.
	   Cubas went on to handily defeat one of Paraguay's top opposition
figures, Domingo Laino of the Democratic Alliance.
	   Aides say Cubas will try to combat Paraguay's deep economic
problems by, among other things, cost-cutting in government and
helping impoverished rural peasants.
	   About 300,000 peasants lack land for cultivation in a country
where farming and cattle dominate. The weather phenomenon El Nino,
separately, has been blamed for flooding and heavy damage to
cotton.
	   Additionally, some 40,000 jobs have been lost since 1996 in key
areas of manufacturing, textiles, and woodworking.
	   Cubas also must address infighting within his own party.
Acrimony is so strong that the inaugural ceremony was scripted so
that Wasmosy _ a rival _ would not place the presidential sash
directly on Cubas' shoulders.
	   After the oath, Cubas was to attend a special Mass and receive
visiting dignitaries. Those expected include Carlos Menem of
Argentina, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia, Eduardo Frei of Chile, Peru's
Alberto Fujimori, Uruguay's Julio Maria Sanguinetti, and Brazil's
Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   Ecuador President Jamil Mahuad, sworn in days ago, also was
expected, amid speculation he would use the occasion to meet with
Fujimori about an ongoing border conflict between Ecuador and Peru.

A Look at Paraguay's New President: Raul Cubas Grau
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Paraguay-New President &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Raul Cubas Grau, of Paraguay's
long-ruling Colorado Party, was elected May 10 as the successor to
Juan Carlos Wasmosy for a five-year presidential term.
	   Originally the vice presidential nominee, Cubas assumed the
candidacy of former army Gen. Lino Oviedo in mid-campaign, after
Oveido was imprisoned on a conviction of rebelling against Wasmosy
in 1996.
	   Oviedo denies he resisted a presidential order that month to
resign as army chief-of-staff, after ultimately complying after a
27-hour standoff that generated a brief political crisis.
	   An engineer by training, Cubas turns 55 on Aug. 23.
	   In 1994, Cubas served briefly as economics minister under
Wasmosy.
	   During the election campaign, Cubas promised to attract foreign
investment to Paraguay, reform the prisons, decentralize education
and attack deeply entrenched poverty.
	   Cubas studied electrical engineering in Brazil before returning
to Paraguay in the late 1960s to work at the state elecrical
monopoly. He later entered private business and worked on dam- and
road-building projects in the Paraguayan jungle.
	   He is married and has two daughters, 19 and 25. His hobbies
include off-road car racing.

	   Just a week ago, thousands of people in the East African cities
of Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were at work, shopping, or running
errands. It was a grey and chilly Friday in the Kenyan capital of
Nairobi, still gripped by the southern hemisphere's winter. In Dar
es Salaam, the quiet capital of Tanzania, it was sunny and humid.
Everyone was looking forward to the weekend. Then terrorists struck
at virtually the same moment 450 miles (725 kilometers) apart.
	   Suddenly, there was chaos, smoke and fire. Windows shattered,
and chunks of concrete and twisted steel rained down. In the areas
that took the brunt of the bombs, there was silence _ the silence
of the dead.
	   The Associated Press offers a story recounting the blast and the
awful aftermath as described by witnesses and seismologists, who
say the blast was so powerful that it registered as a small
earthquake.
	   The story has moved in three takes.

Kenyans bury dead as bombings probe pushes ahead

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ While the investigation to unmask the
mystery bombers in East Africa entered a second week without firm
answers, Kenyans were burying their dead Saturday and wondering how
their capital could have become ``another Beirut.''
	   The FBI says it will take another month or more to finish
examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people and injured more than
5,500.
	   In the shadow of the bombed embassy in Nairobi, not far from a
mound of memorial bouquets that cast their work in poignant
perspective, helmeted investigators continued poking through rubble
while others pored over evidence in tents nearby.
	   A British forensic team was on the way to aid the FBI's 215
agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians, computer specialists,
photographers and translators in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the two
bomb-hit capitals.
	   Bombing evidence was expected to arrive at the FBI laboratories
in Washington this weekend for tests to confirm what explosives
were used and whether the two bombs had the same ingredients.
	   Police here are working on new leads they hope will enable them
to trace the vehicle used in the bombing _ a yellow pickup truck or
van _ which local reports say was apparently bought locally shortly
before the attack.
	   Investigators have declined to discuss specifics of the probe.
But employees at one Nairobi car dealership said Friday that police
had called in the firm's owner for questioning the previous day as
they tried to find out about the bombers. What he said was not
immediately known.
	   Nine badly charred bodies still lie in cold storage at morgues,
unclaimed more than a week after the deadliest attack on a U.S.
embassy. Funeral services for others were being held Saturday
across Kenya, where newspapers carried dozens of black-bordered
death announcements.
	   In a videotaped message, U.S. President Clinton extended
condolences to the victims' families, saying ``We grieve
together.''
	   ``Violent extremists try to use bullets and bombs to derail our
united efforts to bring peace to every part of this earth,'' he
said.
	   ``But I am proud that our nations have also renewed our
commitment to stand together _ to bring the offender swiftly to
justice, to combat terrorism in all its forms and to create a more
tolerant and peaceful world for our children,'' Clinton said.
	   At a somber service Friday in Nairobi, which suffered 247
bombing deaths, families and friends remembered 13 people killed in
the collapse of a building next to the embassy. They comprised half
the staff of an insurance brokerage.
	   ``We are wondering how Nairobi could have become a Beirut, a
Belfast,'' banker Sam Kamau said in a mournful eulogy.
	   Eight days after the bombings, newspapers also reflected a
mixture of grief, bewilderment and anger. Several letters to the
editor accused the Americans of giving priority to U.S. victims and
protecting evidence at the bombed embassy site, at the expense of
rescue efforts. All but 12 of the dead were Kenyans.
	   ``Few Kenyans will ever forget the hideous images of charred
bodies trapped in buses, mutilated corpses piled up in pick-ups and
dazed wounded groping in the streets, their faces washed in
blood,'' said an editorial in The Kenya Times. ``No arrest, trial
or conviction will ever compensate for the losses.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced she will
leave Sunday for the two East African capitals to meet with
investigators and console the injured.
	   Her four-day trip amounts to a show of support, and a
declaration of U.S. resolve in the face of terrorism.

Iranian pilgrims make their first visit to Iraq in 18 years
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHOSRAVI, Iran (AP) _ About 750 elderly Iranian pilgrims crossed
the Iran-Iraq border Saturday in an emotional journey to visit holy
shrines in southern Iraq.
	   They were the first to make the trip since the two states
declared war on each other 18 years ago.
	   The pilgrims _ most of them parents of men killed during the
1980-88 war _ were seen off at a special ceremony attended by some
100 Iranian officials, including governors, members of Parliament
and the minister for culture and Islamic guidance.
	   Before boarding the buses, the frail and elderly men and women,
many of them in wheel-chairs, started beating their chests in a
sign of mourning.
	   ``We deeply miss our sons,'' and ``Karbala we are coming,'' they
chanted. Many in the crowd wept.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians used to visit Iraq every year
until 1980, when the two countries went to war and Iraq stopped
giving visas. The war ended in 1988 but not the visa restrictions.
	   As part of warming relations, the two countries agreed in July
to allow 12,000 Iranians a month to visit the holy cities of
Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq.
	   Mosques in the cities are the most sacred sites to Iran's
majority Shiite Muslims after those in Saudi Arabia.
	   The pilgrims must travel by road because U.N. sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban air travel to and from
the country. From the border, it will take more than three hours
for their buses to get to Karbala.
	   To receive the pilgrims, Iraq has rebuilt Al-Muntheriya border
post, opposite this Iranian town. The post had been destroyed
during the war.
	   Ataollah Mohajerani, Iran's minister of culture and Islamic
guidance, told reporters here that the visit was the ``best way to
boost relations between the people of the two countries.'' He
expressed satisfaction with the cooperation that ``made this
opportunity possible.''
	   For its inaugural group of pilgrims, Iran pointedly gave
preference to parents whose sons were killed during the Iran-Iraq
war.
	   The pilgrims, some barefooted in a sign of respect for the
journey ahead, expressed mixed emotions about their desire to visit
the shrines in a land where their sons had died.
	   Mehrangiz Tehrani, a 55-year-old housewife who lost a son and
brother during the war, was weeping so hard she had trouble
speaking.
	   ``We have to forget the past,'' she said. ``I am happy and
honored to go to a place that I've been waiting to visit for a long
time.''
	   Najaf, which is 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Baghdad, is
the site of the tomb of Imam Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of
Islam's Prophet Mohammed. Shiites around the world aspire to bury
their dead in its cemetery, which stretches for kilometers (miles)
and is the largest in the Muslim world.
	   The Imam Hussein Shrine, commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein,
Prophet Mohammed's grandson and Shiite Islam's most revered saint,
is located in Karbala, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
the Iraqi capital.
	   Hussein's death along with 70 family members and followers in a
battle on the plain of Karbala in the year 680, was a key event in
Islam's split into the orthodox Sunni and minority Shiite sects.
	   Signs giving the distance to Karbala dotted the Iranian freeway
leading to the Iraqi border, and Iranian cities were festooned with
banners for the pilgrims.
	   ``Welcome to the pilgrims of Imam Hussein'' and ``Please pray
for us when you visit Imam Hussein,'' the banners read.
	   Iraq hopes that the pilgrims, who by tradition deliver gifts to
the shrines, will help reverse its desperate shortage of foreign
currency. Pilgrimage tourism is one of the few forms of
international trade that Iraq is allowed to engage in under the
sweeping U.N. sanctions.
	   Iran, for its part, wants its people to have access to the
Shiite shrines not only in Najaf and Karbala but also in Samara in
the north and in Baghdad.
	   Despite their common interest in pilgrimages, Iran and Iraq
spent nine months hammering out the deal. It is a sign of the
mistrust that still lingers from the war, in which more than a
million people were killed or wounded.
	   Once in Iraq, the pilgrims will travel in the buses of a
government-appointed tour company according to a fixed program. The
Iranians will not be allowed to leave the group and are not
expected to have opportunities to communicate with Iraqi citizens.

Report: Former Prime Minister Hashimoto given foreign policy post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime (izZster Keizo Obuchi appointed predecessor
Ryutaro Hashimoto as foreign policy advisor on Saturday and said
the former prime minister will visit Russia next month, a news
report said.
	   The appointment was made as Obuchi and Hashimoto met to discuss
foreign policy, including a proposed peace treaty between Japan and
Russia, Kyodo News agency reported, citing government officials.
	   Hashimoto's visit to Russia will be followed by one by Obuchi in
the fall, the first official trip to Moscow by a Japanese prime
minister since 1973.
	   Obuchi, who served as foreign minister under Hashimoto, said in
his first policy speech as prime minister last week that he wanted
to sign a peace treaty and normalize relations with Russia by 2000.
	   While prime minister, Hashimoto developed close ties to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin through two summit meetings held over the
last year, including one in Siberia. The meetings were seen as
contributing greatly to a recent improvement in relations between
the countries.
	   Japan and Russia have never signed a formal peace treaty
following World War II because of a disagreement over the Kuril
Islands. Japan claims the islands which have been held by Russia
since the end of the war.
	   Obuchi last month replaced Hashimoto, who resigned after the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating defeat in
elections for the upper house of Parliament.

Saddam's son orders amputations to punish commandos

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's son, Odai Hussein, has
ordered that six members of an elite commando unit each have a hand
amputated as punishment for using their positions to rob citizens,
an Iraqi newspaper reported Saturday.
	   An army deserter also involved in the alleged banditry was
ordered punished in a similar way, said the daily Babil, an
Arabic-language newspaper published by Odai.
	   The order _ the first of its kind involving the Fedayeen Saddam,
or Saddam's Commandos _ was in a letter from Odai dated Aug. 7, the
paper said. The letter ordered that the amputations be carried out
within 48 hours.
	   The paper did not say if the amputations had taken place.
	   The Fedayeen Saddam, named for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, is a
paramilitary force created in 1996 and commanded by Odai. Its role
is to resist any uprisings or coups against the leadership.
	   The group is believed to have a working core of about 20,000 to
25,000 men and women, but other volunteers can be called up if
needed.
	   Iraq had suspended the use of amputations as a method of
punishment, mainly applied in the past to military deserters or
bandits. But it was reinstated in recent weeks amid reports of
rising crime in Iraq.

Suu Kyi provided Madonna tapes in standoff with govt

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with govt saying Suu Kyi provided Michael
Jackson, Madonna tapes. Edits

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has
been provided with a cassette player and tapes of Michael Jackson
and Madonna to pass the time in her latest roadside standoff
against the military regime, the government said Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, one of Myanmar's top four ruling generals accused Suu
Kyi and 18 foreign democracy activists deported to Thailand on
Saturday of trying to destabilize the state, but vowed the army
would stay strong to crush them.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, remained at a
road block 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of Yangon as a standoff
with authorities who would not let her proceed to meet provincial
party supporters dragged into a fifth day.
	   ``Yesterday evening, Ms. Suu Kyi and her companions were
provided with a cassette tape recorder and some religious sermon
tapes and a selection of tapes including Madonna and Michael
Jackson ... to help pass the time,'' the government said.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok,
Thailand, the government also said mineral water and soft drinks
were provided ``to make every effort to ensure their comfort and
safety.''
	   There was no indication that Suu Kyi, 53, had accepted any of
the gifts. In previous roadside confrontations, she has refused to
take anything from _ or even speak to _ security forces blocking
her way.
	   Gen. Maung Aye, the army commander and a member of the ruling
State Peace and Development Council, said in a speech to troops
reported by official newspapers Saturday that ``traitors'' were
working with foreign powers.
	   ``Because of the lack of local support, the puppets are slowly
becoming dependent on their foreign masters,'' Maung Aye was quoted
as saying in Friday's speech. ``Synchronizing with the masters'
command, they are committing various disruptive acts.''
	   No names were mentioned, but Maung Aye was clearly referring to
Suu Kyi's standoff and the 18 activists who were held in custody
for a week for distributing leaflets urging Myanmar's people to
remember a failed nationwide uprising against military rule.
	   Borrowing a tactic from the activists, a pro-government party
passed around leaflets in Yangon saying that ``18 foreigners and
internal traitors are trying to create unrest in the country and
instigate the public.''
	   The diplomatic frenzy to free the activists overshadowed Suu
Kyi's latest attempted foray into the provinces, where she has been
allowed only once _ to visit a Buddhist monk _ since being freed
from formal house arrest in 1995.
	   She remains largely confined to her home, however, and has
recently used the government's determination to stop her traveling
to create nonviolent confrontations.
	   International condemnation of the government accompanied a
recent six-day standoff at the same roadblock that ended when she
was forcibly driven back to Yangon. She suffered from fever and
dehydration.
	   Party sources said Saturday that she had taken milk, cake,
biscuits and water for the standoff this time. The government
claims an ambulance is on standby.

U.S. Embassy relocated in Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Uganda has been
relocated from the center of the capital to a hilly suburb as a
result of the embassy bombings in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania,
newspapers said Saturday.
	   The new location is three kilometers (two miles) away in Kololo,
where most other foreign missions are located. The British High
Commission still occupies the facility it has been sharing with the
embassy in downtown Kampala, the reports said.
	   ``We have relocated some functions of our embassy elsewhere,''
Sara Stryker, the U.S. Information Services acting director, was
quoted as saying. ``We have relocated mainly administration.''
	   The Parliamentary Road site where the U.S. mission was located
had been closed since early in the week, and traffic rerouted, for
security reasons. Dozens of armed police and military personnel
have been guarding the area.

Taiwan's navy launches new patrol craft to protect shipping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's navy has launched a homemade
coastal patrol vessel designed to protect the island's sea lanes
and territorial claims in the South China Sea, the navy reported
Saturday.
	   The Hsinchiang, a 500 ton Chinchiang class vessel, was launched
Thursday at the shipyard of builders China Shipbuilding Corp. in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung, a navy statement said.
	   The navy did not reveal the ship's armaments or other details,
but said its role would be to protect shipping to and from Taiwan,
as well as the disputed Spratly and Pratas islands in the South
China Sea.
	   ``Safeguarding transportation on the seas can be equated with
safeguarding national survival and development. This is the navy's
imperative,'' the navy quoted Vice Commander in Chief Yeh Shih-wen
saying at the christening ceremony.
	   Foreign trade accounts for about 70 percent of Taiwan's gross
national product, and a sea blockade is considered among the top
threats to the island. China, which claims Taiwan as a renegade
province, accentuated Taiwan's vulnerability in 1996, when it
disrupted shipping by lobbing missiles just outside the island's
main ports.
	   According to the statement, the Chinchiang class combines high
performance with low maintenance, and can operate with a much
smaller crew than similar ships _ an important feature for Taiwan's
manpower-strapped armed forces.
	   Along with the rest of the armed forces, Taiwan's navy is
undergoing a massive upgrade, allowing it to retire World War II
era Gearing class destroyers and other antiquated vessels.

Opposition parties demand new Cambodian elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES in grafs 1-7 with opposition calls to
replace Hun Sen as candidate for prime minister candidate

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian opposition refused on
Saturday to endorse strongman Hun Sen to become prime minister in a
new government and demanded parliamentary elections won by his
ruling party be held again.
	   The refusal of the opposition to accept Hun Sen's declared
victory has stymied attempts to form a new government and bring
political stability to the long-suffering country.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party issued a
detailed document Saturday accusing Hun Sen, who deposed the prince
as co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago, of rigging the
polls in his favor.
	   Meanwhile, the prince's opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, told a
demonstration of some 200 people in front of the U.S. Embassy that
``the people voted for a change but the ruling party stole our
votes.''
	   Sam Rainsy added that as long as the ruling Cambodian People's
Party tries to name Hun Sen the next prime minister, the opposition
will block efforts to form a new government. The CPP should pick a
more moderate candidate, Sam Rainsy said.
	   The CCP called the suggestion ``a waste of energy'' in a
statement broadcast on government-controlled radio.
	   Hun Sen's ruling CPP won 64 of 122 National Assembly seats in
the July 26 elections but lacks the two-thirds majority needed to
form a government.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party, which together won 58 seats,
have alleged rampant fraud and have threatened to boycott
parliament unless more than 800 complaints are properly
investigated.
	   The Hun Sen-controlled National Election Committee has dismissed
their concerns as ``baseless'' and efforts by FUNCINPEC and the Sam
Rainsy Party to appeal have so far been blocked.
	   Failure to address their concerns ``calls into question the
legitimacy of the entire election process,'' FUNCINPEC said in a
lengthy report, detailing alleged irregularities in the voting and
counting process.
	   If the complaints are not properly investigated, FUNCINPEC said,
it ``has no other alternative'' but to ask King Norodom Sihanouk,
the prince's father, to consider a new election.
	   Though Sihanouk is the constitutional head of state, he lacks
the true power to force an election over the wishes of Hun Sen, the
country's most powerful politician.
	   Ranariddh's party also accused the election committee and other
administrative bodies of being biased in favor of Hun Sen's party.
	   FUNCINPEC also said that a climate of intimidation, violence and
threats in the months leading up to last month's vote marred the
entire process.
	   Hun Sen has invited FUNCINPEC into a coalition, but the royalist
party is hanging back with on-again, off-again ally Sam Rainsy in
an apparent attempt to wrest concessions on key posts.
	   The new assembly does not convene until Sept. 24, and bargaining
and brinkmanship could take weeks.

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Fairouz, one of the Arab world's most
popular singers, captivated fans with her first performance at the
Roman ruins of Baalbek in nearly a quarter of a century.
	   The Lebanese singer, who rose to fame in the days before
Lebanon's brutal 15-year civil war, sang here Friday for the first
time since 1974, the year before the war began.
	   She was to perform for six more nights.
	   Fairouz is participating in the Baalbek International Festival,
which continues until Aug. 29.
	   The Roman ruins at Baalbek, 85 kilometers (53 miles) northeast
of Beirut, are a popular tourist site. But during the war, they
were shunned by foreigners and locals alike because the nearby town
was a stronghold of Muslim extremists. Groups based there were
blamed for the kidnappings of Westerners during the war.
	   The festival resumed last year after the government restored its
authority over most of the country. Fairouz didn't perform then
because of a dispute over salaries.
	   Fairouz's return to the Baalbek festival was viewed as a further
sign of Lebanon's post-war recovery.
	   She opened Friday to a sell-out crowd of 4,000 people under the
towering floodlit columns of the Temple of Jupiter.
	   ``Baalbek of the past has returned,'' said Mazen Haidar, a
60-year-old businessman who held back tears when Fairouz appears on
stage, dressed in white and illuminated by a single spot light.
	   Some in the audience wept when she sang ``Baalbek, I'm a candle
in your steps,'' a nostalgic song about prewar days in Lebanon.
	   Mansour and Ziyad Rahbani, brothers of Fairouz's late husband
Assi, who had directed her work, also were there.
	   ``I am happy with Fairouz's return to Baalbek,'' said Ziyad
Rahbani, who also is a musician. ``The people's turnout and their
rush to attend her concert is natural.''
	   President Elias Hrawi attended the show, along with Cabinet
ministers and members of Parliament.
	   After the three-hour concert, Hrawi hugged Fairouz and said:
``You are the opera of Baalbek. Festivals should start with you
because you have become a part of Lebanon's history.''
	   This year's festival _ the biggest since the civil war _
includes American jazz performers and a German orchestra.
	   Tickets for each performance range in price from 30,000 Lebanese
pounds (dlrs 20) to 200,000 pounds (dlrs 133).

Russian region allowing free land sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One of Russia's freest land codes took effect
Saturday in the central republic of Tatarstan, one of the only
places in the country where foreigners can now buy agricultural
land.
	   ``There is no other law like that in Russia,'' boasted regional
President Mintimer Shaimiyev in an interview with the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Most rural land in Russia remains in state hands, and can
generally not be bought or sold. In fact, a land bill passed by
parliament earlier this year _ and vetoed by President Boris
Yeltsin _ would have banned most real estate deals.
	   However, despite Shaimiyev's boasts, Tatarstan is not the first
region in Russia to allow the free sale of rural land. The region
of Saratov passed similar legislation last fall and held its first
land sale in March.
	   The Tatarstan land code allows foreigners to buy land only from
a state reserve that encompasses about 1 million hectares (2.5
million acres) throughout the republic, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Communists and other opponents of land sales have specifically
based their arguments on the fear that foreigners will buy up
Russian land.
	   ``We should not be afraid of the right to sell and purchase
land,'' Shaimiyev said. He said the potential benefits included
jobs and revenue that could come from foreign investors buying into
the region's economy.

Freed prisoners demand release of more political prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Emerging from seven years in prison, a
dissident on Saturday deplored anti-communist restrictions that
forced hundreds of political prisoners to choose to remain in
prison rather than walk free.
	   ``I feel sorry for those remaining inside,'' poet Park No-hae,
41, said, speaking outside a prison in central South Korea.
	   Park, jailed in 1991 for organizing an underground leftist
workers' group, was one of 103 political prisoners who were freed
Saturday to mark the 53rd anniversary of Korea's independence from
Japanese colonial rule in 1945. South Korea has marked past
anniversaries with similar pardons.
	   As a prerequisite for their freedom, they signed a controversial
oath to obey South Korea's laws, including one that makes it a
crime to espouse communism.
	   But an estimated 400 other political prisoners refused to sign
the oath and remained in prison, despite government promises to
free them all once they sign the pledge. They included 17 who have
served 30 years or more behind bars, often in solitary confinement.
	   International human rights groups condemned the requirement as a
human rights violation.
	   In front of jails across the country, hundreds of dissidents
unfurled large banners demanding the release of the others.
	   ``Abolish the law-abiding oath!'' they chanted. No violence was
reported.
	   ``I submitted my oath because I thought I could honor the laws.
But I think the system violates the freedom of conscience and needs
to be improved,'' said Hwang In-wook, who also was freed Saturday.
A former student activist, Hwang was jailed in 1992 for trying to
form a communist political party.
	   All political prisoners were jailed for violating South Korea's
national security law that bans any activity that may benefit its
enemy, communist North Korea.
	   And many of them refused to sign an oath to honor the law they
want abolished. The national security law is so broadly interpreted
that even possession of Marxist literature is a crime.
	   Saturday's amnesty also freed 2,071 ordinary prisoners. It also
reduced the prison terms of 13 prisoners and restored civil rights
for 4,820 people.

Swiss president: `full understanding' for banks' Holocaust
</HEADLINE>
settlement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's president expressed
relief in an interview published Saturday over the settlement of
Holocaust survivors' claims by the country's two biggest commercial
banks.
	   ``It looks as though a lengthy and extremely difficult dispute
has come to an end,'' Flavio Cotti was quoted as saying in the
Zurich daily Blick.
	   The banks ``were in a very difficult situation,'' Cotti added.
``So I have full understanding for the fact they chose this way to
solve the problem of the private action against them and their
position in the important U.S. market.''
	   On Wednesday, the banks agreed to pay dlrs 1.25 billion in an
out-of-court settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims against
them.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   The government on Thursday issued a statement restating its
position that the settlement is a matter for those involved. It did
not take part in negotiations and is committed to nothing by the
agreement, the statement added.
	   ``We still say that negotiations between civil parties cannot be
a matter for the state,'' Cotti said.
	   He stressed that Switzerland will continue with its existing
policies to address its wartime past, notably a panel of
independent historians investigating the period.
	   ``We need clarity about our history,'' Cotti said. ``And if the
pressure from the United States decreases, as I hope, that will be
beneficial to a climate for an objective discussion.''

Iranian pilgrims make their first visit to Iraq in 18 years

<TEXT>
	   KHOSRAVI, Iran (AP) _ About 750 elderly Iranian pilgrims crossed
the Iran-Iraq border Saturday in an emotional journey to visit holy
shrines in southern Iraq.
	   They were the first to make the trip since the two states
declared war on each other 18 years ago.
	   The pilgrims _ most of them parents of men killed during the
1980-88 war _ were seen off at a special ceremony attended by some
100 Iranian officials, including governors, members of Parliament
and the minister for culture and Islamic guidance.
	   Before boarding the buses, the frail and elderly men and women,
many of them in wheel-chairs, started beating their chests in a
sign of mourning.
	   ``We deeply miss our sons,'' and ``Karbala we are coming,'' they
chanted. Many in the crowd wept.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians visited Iraq every year until
1980, when the two countries went to war and Iraq stopped giving
visas. The war ended in 1988 but not the visa restrictions.
	   As part of warming relations, the two countries agreed in July
to allow 12,000 Iranians a month to visit the holy cities of
Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq.
	   Mosques in the cities are the most sacred sites to Iran's
majority Shiite Muslims after those in Saudi Arabia.
	   The pilgrims must travel by road because U.N. sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban air travel to and from
the country. From the border, it will take more than three hours
for their buses to get to Karbala.
	   To receive the pilgrims, Iraq has rebuilt Al-Muntheriya border
post, opposite this Iranian town. The post had been destroyed
during the war.
	   Ayatollah Mohajerani, Iran's minister of culture and Islamic
guidance, told reporters here that the visit was the ``best way to
boost relations between the people of the two countries.'' He
expressed satisfaction with the cooperation that ``made this
opportunity possible.''
	   For its inaugural group of pilgrims, Iran pointedly gave
preference to parents whose sons were killed during the Iran-Iraq
war.
	   The pilgrims, some barefooted in a sign of respect for the
journey ahead, expressed mixed emotions about their desire to visit
the shrines in a land where their sons had died.
	   Mehrangiz Tehrani, a 55-year-old housewife who lost a son and
brother during the war, was weeping so hard she had trouble
speaking.
	   ``We have to forget the past,'' she said. ``I am happy and
honored to go to a place that I've been waiting to visit for a long
time.''
	   Najaf, which is 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Baghdad, is
the site of the tomb of Imam Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of
Islam's Prophet Mohammed. Shiites around the world aspire to bury
their dead in its cemetery, which stretches for kilometers (miles)
and is the largest in the Muslim world.
	   The Imam Hussein Shrine, commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein,
Prophet Mohammed's grandson and Shiite Islam's most revered saint,
is located in Karbala, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
the Iraqi capital.
	   Hussein's death along with 70 family members and followers in a
battle on the plain of Karbala in the year 680, was a key event in
Islam's split into the orthodox Sunni and minority Shiite sects.
	   Signs giving the distance to Karbala dotted the Iranian freeway
leading to the Iraqi border, and Iranian cities were festooned with
banners for the pilgrims.
	   ``Welcome to the pilgrims of Imam Hussein'' and ``Please pray
for us when you visit Imam Hussein,'' the banners read.
	   Iraq hopes that the pilgrims, who by tradition deliver gifts to
the shrines, will help reverse its desperate shortage of foreign
currency. Pilgrimage tourism is one of the few forms of
international trade that Iraq is allowed to engage in under the
sweeping U.N. sanctions.
	   Iran, for its part, wants its people to have access to the
Shiite shrines not only in Najaf and Karbala but also in Samara in
the north and in Baghdad.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Jiang Zemin urged the nation to rally
behind the battle against summer floods that have affected
one-fifth of the Chinese population, leaving millions homeless,
state-run media said Saturday.
	   Flood damage mounted in northeastern Heilongjiang province,
which borders Russia, as a second dike near Daqing, China's largest
oilfield, collapsed early Saturday, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   No casualties were reported, although the breach forced the
evacuation of ``most'' local residents in the city of 2.34 million,
and the relief situation remained unclear, Xinhua said.
	   Rains brought by a seasonal front that stretches across China
have caused floods and landslides in many areas, killing more than
2,000 people.
	   Xinhua reported that flooding had begun along the lower reaches
of the Yellow River, and that a flood crest would sweep through the
eastern coastal province of Shandong.
	   The Yellow River, which runs across north-central China, has
been the source of particularly disastrous floods that have killed
hundreds of thousands of people over the centuries.
	   Jiang, who traveled earlier this week to flooded areas along the
Yangtze River, further to the south, warned that after more than
six weeks of flooding, the disaster was reaching a ``crucial
stage.''
	   With millions stranded on sweltering dikes along the raging
Yangtze River, with minimal shelter, clean water or food, relief
workers had to ensure social order and guard against the spread of
diseases, Xinhua quoted Jiang as saying.
	   The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued an urgent order
Saturday warning that with the health of millions at risk, more had
to be done to prevent epidemics.
	   ``Historical experience tells us that major disasters often lead
to epidemics,'' said the order carried by Xinhua. It urged health
workers to raise awareness about disease prevention and to improve
sanitation, purify more drinking water and exterminate
disease-carrying pests.
	   Government officials insist that so far, apart from a few
outbreaks of infectious diseases, no epidemics have occurred in
flooded areas.
	   Already, 10,000 medical teams are handing out food, water
purification tablets and medical supplies. But shortages of funds
are delaying relief efforts, the Red Cross said in a report from
one flood-stricken province. It appealed urgently for money to
provide food and medical supplies to one million people.
	   The Red Cross also warned that the floods threaten efforts to
control snail fever in some areas and said outbreaks of this
tropical disease may increase.
	   Meanwhile, state radio reported that Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress and former premier, had traveled to
northeastern China to view flood relief efforts there.
	   There, 1 million civilians and soldiers were mobilized for ``a
round-the-clock fight'' against the worst-ever floods on the Nen
and Songhua rivers, Xinhua said.
	   At Daqing, which produced about half of China's oil last year,
355 of the oil field's 20,000 wells were waterlogged due to
flooding, it reported. It said a lack of manpower forced the
abandonment of efforts to repair a levee that collapsed Friday some
100 kilometers (60 miles) from the city center, forcing the
evacuation of some 20,000 people.

Malaysian leader says drastic economic measures may be drafted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia may soon introduce
drastic measures to shore up its flagging economy, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday, warning that some of the population
may be unnerved by the new strategy.
	   However, the tough-talking premier told doubters they should
trust their leaders.
	   ``Have faith in the government,'' Mahathir told a cheering crowd
of 10,000 people at a political rally in Sabah state on Borneo
island. ``Each time we want to adopt an approach we'll study it in
depth first.''
	   The 72-year old prime minister has toured the country widely in
recent weeks, stoking speculation that he may call an early general
election before the Southeast Asian nation's economy deteriorates
further.
	   However, Mahathir, who is now Asia's longest serving leader with
17 years in office, has dismissed suggestions that he may take his
government to the people before Parliament expires in April 2000.
	   Malaysia has dished out a range of measures to rejuvenate its
shrinking economy, racked by the continuing Asian crisis.
	   Agencies have been set up to handle a growing bad debt problem
and recapitalize the country's banks, and a central policy planning
team, called the National Economic Action Council, is overseeing
recovery efforts.
	   ``But we'll not just end here. Much more has to be done,''
Mahathir was quoted as saying by the national news agency Bernama.
	   Although the government says the economy may contract by up to 2
percent this year, private economists suggest a 5 percent shrinkage
is more likely.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia's economy showed signs that its sharp
decline is slowing, when the Bernama news agency reported Saturday
that inflation slowed to 5.8 percent in July this year, compared
with 6.2 percent in June.
	   The slight improvement came soon after the government introduced
two stimulus packages that jacked up federal spending by a hefty 20
percent _ a move which could further destabilize Malaysia's
battered economy, analysts say.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
opened festivities marking the end of India's golden jubilee year,
hoping to ease tensions Pakistan and with his political allies.
	   From behind bulletproof glass, Vajpayee spoke to the nation from
the ramparts of the Red Fort of New Delhi, addressing concerns over
India's newly acquired nuclear capability and its tense relations
with Pakistan.
	   Vajpayee vowed India would never use nuclear weapons
aggressively, and it was ready for a pact with Pakistan that
neither would be the first to unleash them.
	   Vajpayee's address on India's 51st independence day brought to a
close a troubled jubilee year full of political upheaval, economic
difficulty and international opprobrium and sanctions for
conducting nuclear tests.
	   The prime minister defended his decision to go nuclear, and said
the world was gaining more appreciation for what India describes as
the security concerns that compelled it to develop a nuclear
deterrent.
	   ``The effect of economic sanctions is slackening gradually,'' he
said. ``We welcome this.''
	   Without naming Pakistan, Vajpayee said India was fighting a
proxy war against forces supported from across the border.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming Muslim militants
fighting a secessionist war in India-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan
says it is only providing moral and diplomatic support to the
militants.
	   On Friday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pledged to
continue supporting Kashmiri separatists as Pakistan celebrated its
own independence day. Violence in Kashmir would ``force India to
come to the negotiation table,'' Sharif said.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir, since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Earlier this month, the Indian and Pakistani armies engaged in
one of their heaviest peacetime artillery duels across their
disputed frontier in Kashmir, killing nearly 200 people on both
sides. The battles coincided with an abortive meeting between
Vajpayee and Sharif that ended in mutual recriminations.
	   On Saturday, Vajpayee said he wasn't disheartened by the
setback, and he was looking forward to the next meeting with Sharif
in a few weeks in South Africa.
	   ``I believe there is no dispute which cannot be resolved through
dialogue,'' he said, speaking in Hindi under a gray early morning
sky.
	   India and Pakistan raised the stakes of their 51-year-old
conflict when each conducted underground nuclear explosions last
May.
	   In office less than six months, Vajpayee's more immediate
concern was the turmoil within his 19-party coalition that made his
own political future uncertain. He spoke about the difficulties in
running a coalition government on the basis of consensus.
	   He served a warning to his detractors, saying: ``I will never
compromise on principles. I have spent 40 years on the opposition
benches.''
	   Sonia Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress Party and
torchbearer of the family that led India for most of its
post-independence years, told her party members Friday to be ready
for ``all contingencies and any sudden developments'' _ a hint she
might be getting ready to bid for power.
	   As the prime minister made his speech in New Delhi, a separatist
group attacked a bus in the remote northeastern state of Tripura,
gunning down five passengers and wounding 11 others, said Brijpal
Singh, the state director-general of police. Suspicion for the
attack fell on the National Liberation Front of Tripura, one of
several rebel groups which vowed to disrupt India's independence
day celebrations.

Swiss president welcomes Holocaust settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's president expressed
relief in an interview published Saturday over the settlement of
Holocaust survivors' claims by the country's two biggest commercial
banks.
	   ``It looks as though a lengthy and extremely difficult dispute
has come to an end,'' Flavio Cotti was quoted as saying in the
Zurich daily Blick.
	   The banks ``were in a very difficult situation,'' Cotti added.
``So I have full understanding for the fact they chose this way to
solve the problem of the private action against them and their
position in the important U.S. market.''
	   On Wednesday, the banks agreed to pay dlrs 1.25 billion in an
out-of-court settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims against
them.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   The government on Thursday issued a statement restating its
position that the settlement is a matter for those involved. It did
not take part in negotiations and is committed to nothing by the
agreement, the statement added.
	   ``We still say that negotiations between civil parties cannot be
a matter for the state,'' Cotti said.
	   He stressed that Switzerland will continue with its existing
policies to address its wartime past, notably a panel of
independent historians investigating the period.
	   ``We need clarity about our history,'' Cotti said. ``And if the
pressure from the United States decreases, as I hope, that will be
beneficial to a climate for an objective discussion.''

Switzerland's main political parties oppose any contribution by the
central bank.

With exodus from cities, Japan marks Festival of the Dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMARU, Japan (AP) _ With paper lanterns and sticks of pungent
incense, millions of Japanese gathered at family gravesites
Saturday for the eerie culmination of one of this country's oldest
and most important holidays _ the Festival of the Dead.
	   According to Japanese Buddhist belief, the spirits of the dead
briefly return to the realm of the living each summer. During that
time, they are welcomed with rice wine, fresh vegetables and fruits
at altars erected in the homes of their descendants.
	   After a week or so of wining and dining the spirits, the holiday
is capped off with midnight visits to ancestral graves, where
incense and paper lanterns are burned.
	   ``Walking around graveyards at night isn't something I would
normally do,'' Yoshio Shimomura said before heading out to his
family plot in this village on the central Japan coast. ``But this
is special.''
	   Most Japanese observe the holiday, called ``O-bon,'' more as a
social tradition than a religious event _ a much-needed respite
from the heat of the summer and the demands of Japan's relentless
work ethic.
	   ``Everybody comes home for O-bon. It's tradition,'' said Nobuo
Iwasa, a Buddhist priest. ``People use O-bon as a chance to relax
and enjoy themselves, but they also pay the proper respects to the
dead.''
	   O-bon is not an official holiday, but workers tend to plan their
summer vacations around it and most private businesses close down
for several days.
	   Stages are set up in town squares or vacant lots, where small,
neighborhood-sponsored festivals are held. There, dancers twist and
sway in colorful summer kimono to the loud pounding of drums.
	   O-bon is also time for the national high school baseball
championships, which has long been one of Japan's most popular
sporting events because it provides fans at home for the holidays a
chance to root for their home town teams.
	   In years past, paper lanterns representing the departing spirits
were set afloat on rivers or streams on the final night of O-bon.
That practice has been stopped in many places, however, out of
deference to environmental concerns.
	   Because of the increasing tendency since World War II for people
to move out of the small towns of their roots and into the bigger
cities, millions must simultaneously hit the highways, airports and
train stations to get home for O-bon.
	   This year, officials say, the crowding hasn't been so bad.
	   Even so, traffic jams stretched as long as 45 kilometers (30
miles) along highways heading out of Tokyo earlier this week.
	   Flights out of the city have been almost fully booked, and
long-distance trains packed to as much as 150-percent their seating
capacity _ meaning vacationers have to stand in the aisles or squat
in the decks between cars, often for several hours at a time.
	   ``Bon Voyage,'' quipped a headline on the front page of one
Tokyo newspaper. The headline was accompanied by a photo of a huge
traffic snarl outside of the capital.
	   For those city dwellers who have no countryside hometowns to
return to, the O-bon exodus provides a special bonus.
	   ``My train is usually so crowded I can't move,'' said Tokyo
office worker Yuji Yamashita. ``But during O-bon, the ride is
comfortable. I can get a seat if I want, and read the paper.''
	   The rush back to the cities is expected to peak on Monday.

Yeltsin refuses to let economic crisis interrupt vacation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While the Russian economy has teetered on the
brink of calamity, President Boris Yeltsin has resolutely refused
to interrupt his annual summer vacation, which is nearing the
one-month mark.
	   On Saturday, Yeltsin returned closer to home, flying to a
presidential retreat about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of
Moscow, but still insisting that he was officially on vacation.
	   Throughout the past month, Yeltsin has surfaced periodically
from resorts in the Russian north to insist that the economy is in
fine shape or to complain about the cool, rainy weather and lousy
fishing. He has brushed aside suggestions that he come back to
work.
	   ``There is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told reporters Friday in
Novgorod, a medieval Russian city north of Moscow. ``Moreover, when
the president rushes to the Kremlin, everybody thinks that
something is wrong.''
	   By now, though, there are signs that nearly everybody does think
something is wrong _ and that perhaps Yeltsin is part of the
problem.
	   Russian newspapers were unsparing Saturday in their criticism of
the president, with most national papers leaping on the words,
``everybody thinks that something is wrong.''
	   ``President at rest _ everything is fine,'' the respected
business daily Kommersant wrote in a sarcastic Page 1 headline, on
a day when the news was dominated by grave economic worries.
	   The Russian stock market, which has been battered in recent
months, fell sharply Thursday in response to international market
declines and fears that the Russian ruble would be devalued.
	   Yeltsin brushed aside any fears of a devaluation, insisting that
his administration had matters well in hand. But his words and
actions suggested confusion at the top.
	   Yeltsin at one point Friday insisted that he would not call
parliament into emergency session to confront the economic crisis.
An hour later, he did just that. And while he praised his
government's response, he also sharply criticized his ministers of
economy, finance and customs _ three major players in the crisis.
	   Yeltsin also appeared somewhat haggard, raising fresh concerns
about his health.
	   ``The president's health leaves much to be desired,'' the
newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta noted, adding that Yeltsin seemed
confused and unaware of ``the crisis in the country and of what
happened on Thursday in the stock market.''
	   Yeltsin began his vacation on July 18. He has not said when he
would return to the Kremlin; last year, his vacation lasted almost
exactly one month. One of his top economic aides, Anatoly Chubais,
interrupted his vacation Saturday to return to Moscow, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   At the presidential retreat ``Rus,'' where he arrived Saturday,
Yeltsin is in striking distance of the Kremlin and within easy
driving distance of his top advisors. And he has clearly remained
in touch throughout his vacation. On Friday, he spoke by telephone
with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is said to have urged Yeltsin
to take charge of the economic crisis.
	   For now, the perception lingers that he is not in charge.
	   The newspaper Segodnya carried a picture of Yeltsin kissing a
young woman in a traditional costume in Novgorod. The caption read:
``Yesterday, Boris Yeltsin was busy with other things. The fall of
the ruble was not his problem.''

State radio warns of Nile flooding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ State-run radio on Saturday warned
citizens to take precautions against seasonal floods in northern
Sudan, saying they could be as damaging as floods a decade ago.
	   The level of the Nile River has been rising for several days by
15 centimeters (6 inches) a day as it did before the 1988 floods,
Omdurman Radio said.
	   Those floods were Sudan's worst this century. They killed more
than 90 people and left some two million Sudanese homeless. Damage
was estimated at dlrs 364 million.
	   The flood warning came as Sudan also is struggling to contain
widespread famine in southern states caused by drought and a
long-running civil war.
	   The broadcast urged citizens along the Nile from the capital
Khartoum to Wadi Halfa, 750 kilometers (465 miles) north, to take
care.
	   The radio did not outline safety measures, but Sudanese
understand this to include moving their families and cattle to
higher ground and working on sand-bagging riverbanks.
	   The Nile waters already have overflowed levees and damaged
houses in Kalakla, a southern suburb of Khartoum, and on an island
in the city. There was no immediate estimate available of the
damage.

Peace envoys in Kinshasa, government vows counter-attack

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese officials vowed Saturday to hit
back at rebels advancing on the capital _ but still prepared to
meet a delegation of visiting African envoys searching for a
peaceful end to the country's war.
	   Foreign ministers from Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Namibia
were scheduled to meet with Information Minister Didier Mumengi and
other senior government officials during weekend talks.
	   Mumengi, however, said the meetings shouldn't be taken as a sign
the government was pulling back from its war effort against a rebel
army of Congolese Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted members
of President Laurent Kabila's military.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by the new government.
	   ``We're getting ready to launch a counter-strike at the rebels
who are in Lower Congo,'' Mumengi said in a telephone interview.
	   The government says neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are fighting
with and supplying the rebellion _ a charge both countries deny.
	   Asked if a political settlement to the fighting could be found,
Mumengi responded: ``As long as there are foreign troops on our
soil the only solution will be a military solution.''
	   A rebellion against Kabila launched earlier this month quickly
escalated into an insurgent war with the rebels capturing key towns
in the east, including Goma and Bukavu, and securing positions in
the west after a troop airlift.
	   In eastern Congo, Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign
minister-turned-rebel, said Congolese opposition leaders had formed
the Congolese Democratic Movement to replace Kabila's government.
	   ``We have a name, we have program, we have leaders,'' Karaha
said from the eastern town of Bukavu. ``We're trying to be as
intrusive as possible.''
	   He said the movement included political opponents of both Mobutu
and Kabila as well as ordinary Congolese.
	   Responding to the mounting concern of a rebel takeover over in
Kinshasa and ensuing violence, Britain and the United States are
preparing contingency evacuation plans for their citizens.
	   Kinshasa residents have been stocking up on provisions and
bottled water.
	   Soldiers continued to patrol streets and markets, searching cars
for weapons and frequently detaining suspected rebel collaborators.
	   Government radio on Saturday told the public to remain calm and
blamed the growing tensions in Kinshasa on what it called biased
news reports of rebel advances.
	   State-controlled radio earlier accused several foreign
broadcasters of airing false reports about rebel gains. Foreign
journalists in Kinshasa have been harassed and repeatedly detained
for brief periods over the past week.
	   Rebels in the region of Lower Congo in the country's west have
captured several key towns, including the oil port of Muanda.
	   More recently, a rebel spokesman and western diplomats said the
town of Inga, where the main power dam for Kinshasa is located, was
in rebel hands.
	   Power had been cut off in Kinshasa for more than a day, but has
been largely restored to the capital using a second power facility
in the town of Nzongo, Mumengi said.
	   Kabila's chief of communications, Dominic Sakombe, however,
denied Inga had been taken and said Kinshasa's power was still
flowing from that western town about 215 kilometers (135 miles)
southwest of the capital.
	   After a day of confusion over Kabila's whereabouts, it was still
unclear whether the president was in the capital or had left for
his former rebel stronghold of Lubumbashi.
	   Requests for an interview with Kabila were turned away.
	   ``We're in the middle of war, the president can't speak now,''
Sakombe said. ``Our actions are what count.''
	   The rebellion began earlier this month when Tutsi-led rebels
closely tied to Rwanda fought government troops in the capital and
opened up fronts in both the east and west of Congo, formerly known
as Zaire.
	   The rebels said some of their troops had advanced as far as
Kasangalu, 20 miles (30 kilometers) southwest of the capital.
	   Congo's relations with its former Rwandan and Ugandan allies
have been deteriorating throughout Kabila's rule, and last month he
expelled Rwandan soldiers. Uganda and Rwanda have been angered by
the Congolese president's failure to contain attacks on their
territory by renegade groups based in eastern Congo.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's economic hub was closed for
business Saturday, with supporters of a general strike erecting
barricades of burning tires and firing shots to make sure their
``day of mourning'' was observed.
	   Police said at least five people were killed and four injured in
violence linked to the strike by the Mohajir Quami Movement, the
main political party in Karachi.
	   The MQM withdrew from the federal government a day earlier to
protest the violence that has engulfed Karachi for years. Saturday,
party spokeswoman Nasreen Jaleel, a federal senator, said the party
would also withdraw from the provincial government in Sindh, where
Karachi is located, in two days if the government did not arrest
those responsible for the deaths of 10 party workers.
	   ``There is no law in the city,'' Jaleel said.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif can govern without the MQM at the
federal level. But Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat Jatoi's provincial
government would topple without MQM support.
	   Three days ago, eight MQM party members were killed by gunmen
who sprayed gunfire into a crowd sitting in a park. Two others
injured that day later died. The MQM blamed a breakaway faction
with whom it has been locked in a violent power struggle.
	   More than 500 people have been killed in Karachi's political,
ethnic and sectarian violence this year, compared with about 400 in
1997. Saturday, an unidentified, bullet-riddled body found in one
of the city's most volatile neighborhoods was believed to be the
latest political casualty. Police linked four other shooting deaths
Friday and Saturday to the strike.
	   Tire barricades Saturday, a working day in Pakistan, helped keep
buses and taxis from plying their routes, and shops were closed
throughout the city. Security forces patrolled after a night
disturbed by gunfire, most of it believed to be warning shots.
Unidentified gunmen fired on a patrol, injuring four paramilitary
soldiers.

President blames rebel leader for prolonging civil war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ As Sudanese opposition leaders met in
Egypt on Saturday, President Omar el-Bashir lashed out at southern
rebel leader John Garang and said he was responsible for prolonging
the country's 15-year civil war.
	   In a speech to the army, el-Bashir accused the Sudan People's
Liberation Army led by Garang of resisting government efforts ``to
stop the shadow of war and bloodshed,'' the state-run Sudan News
Agency said.
	   He added: ``Our experience has proved that the rebel movement is
not serious about taking a single step toward this noble and
cherished goal, and that the rebel Garang has become a
war-monger.''
	   His speech marked the 44th anniversary of the establishment of
Sudan's army.
	   Garang's SPLA has led the fight since 1983 for more autonomy for
the south's Christian and animist people from the Islamic north.
More than 1.5 million people have died in the war and related
famines.
	   Both sides have declared a temporary cease-fire to allow
international aid agencies to deliver food to an estimated 1.5
million people threatened by starvation in the south.
	   Bashir made his comments as Garang met in Cairo, Egypt, with
other members of the National Democratic Alliance.
	   The Eritrea-headquartered alliance is an umbrella group for
northern politicians and southern rebels intent on overthrowing
el-Bashir.
	   El-Bashir, a lieutenant general in the army, took power in a
military coup in 1989 and installed an Islamic regime. He has since
won an election _ boycotted by the opposition _ for the presidency.
	   El-Bashir also has put forward a new constitution that is based
on Islamic sharia law but promises to safeguard the rights of
religious minorities.
	   Among the Sudanese attending the Cairo meeting are Mohammed
Osman al-Mirgani, who heads the alliance, and former Prime Minister
Sadiq el-Mahdi, who was ousted by el-Bashir.
	   Egypt is hosting the meeting because it fears the civil war
could result in partition of Sudan and threaten the flow of the
Nile River, which is Egypt's main source of water.
	   In advance of Saturday's opening session, the visiting Sudanese
met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa.
	   Little was revealed of those meetings, and the Saturday talks
were closed to the media.
	   Sudan's ruling party on Thursday protested Egypt's decision to
host the meeting, saying that it amounted to ``instigating the
opposition against the Sudanese people and their legitimate,
constitutional institutions.''

Rescuers end search for survivors

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Rescuers, working around the clock for
four weeks, have ended their search for ten men trapped by
mudslides and water in a mine on July 17.
	   Economics Minister Hannes Farnleitner, whose ministry is
responsible for the mining sector, was quoted as saying the last
attempt to retrieve any body on Friday ended in failure and the
rescue operation was over.
	   Chancellor Viktor Klima and Farnleitner expressed their
condolences to the victims' families and promised that everything
would be done to retrieve all the dead men.
	   Alfred Zechling, spokesman for the rescue team, told the Austria
Press Agency, that a a camera, lowered 164 meters (yards) through
the last newly drilled shaft into a cavern where some of the
trapped men were presumed, hit against mud and water.
	   Rescuers left the scene of the accident late Friday, but
officials assured the families affected that work would not
concentrate on retrieving the ten dead men.
	   ``Retrieval certainly will not be fast. It can take months,
maybe up to a year,'' Zechling said.
	   The 10 men were themselves part of a rescue team which was sent
into the mine in Lassing, 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of
Vienna, on July 17, when a landslide buried their colleague, Georg
Hainzl.
	   But a second, stronger mudslide trapped them in the collapsed
mine, too, and officials declared there was no chance anyone
survived.
	   On July 26, however, Hainzl was found alive and in relatively
good condition despite his ordeal. Rescue efforts intensified, but
were plagued by a series of breakdowns and equipment failures.
	   Late Friday, Zechling and his team telephoned each of the
victims' families to tell them it was no longer possible anyone
could have survived.

	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Fairouz, one of the Arab world's most
popular singers, captivated fans with her first performance at the
Roman ruins of Baalbek in nearly a quarter of a century.
	   The Lebanese singer, who rose to fame in the days before
Lebanon's brutal 15-year civil war, sang here Friday for the first
time since 1974, the year before the war began.
	   She was to perform for six more nights.
	   Fairouz is participating in the Baalbek International Festival,
which continues until Aug. 29.
	   The Roman ruins at Baalbek, 85 kilometers (53 miles) northeast
of Beirut, are a popular tourist site. But during the war, they
were shunned by foreigners and locals alike because the nearby town
was a stronghold of Muslim extremists. Groups based there were
blamed for the kidnappings of Westerners during the war.
	   The festival resumed last year after the government restored its
authority over most of the country. Fairouz didn't perform then
because of a dispute over salaries.
	   Fairouz's return to the Baalbek festival was viewed as a further
sign of Lebanon's post-war recovery.
	   She opened Friday to a sell-out crowd of 4,000 people under the
towering floodlit columns of the Temple of Jupiter.
	   ``Baalbek of the past has returned,'' said Mazen Haidar, a
60-year-old businessman who held back tears when Fairouz appears on
stage, dressed in white and illuminated by a single spot light.
	   Some in the audience wept when she sang ``Baalbek, I'm a candle
in your steps,'' a nostalgic song about prewar days in Lebanon.
	   Mansour and Elias Rahbani, brothers of Fairouz's late husband
Assi, who had directed her work, also were there.
	   ``I am happy with Fairouz's return to Baalbek,'' said Elias
Rahbani, who also is a musician. ``The people's turnout and their
rush to attend her concert is natural.''
	   President Elias Hrawi attended the show, along with Cabinet
ministers and members of Parliament.
	   After the three-hour concert, Hrawi hugged Fairouz and said:
``You are the opera of Baalbek. Festivals should start with you
because you have become a part of Lebanon's history.''
	   This year's festival _ the biggest since the civil war _
includes American jazz performers and a German orchestra.
	   Tickets for each performance range in price from 30,000 Lebanese
pounds (dlrs 20) to 200,000 pounds (dlrs 133).

Kenyans bury dead as bombings probe pushes ahead

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ While the investigation to unmask the
mystery bombers in East Africa entered a second week without firm
answers, Kenyans buried their dead Saturday and sought to endure
their ``undeserved grief.''
	   The FBI says it will take another month or more to finish
examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people and injured more than
5,500.
	   While graves were dug in the red earth in a Nairobi cemetery,
casting their work in poignant perspective, helmeted investigators
continued poking through rubble. Others pored over evidence in
tents nearby.
	   A British forensic team was on the way to aid the FBI's 215
agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians, computer specialists,
photographers and translators in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the two
bomb-hit capitals.
	   Bombing evidence was expected to arrive at the FBI laboratories
in Washington this weekend for tests to confirm what explosives
were used and whether the two bombs had the same ingredients.
	   Police here are working on new leads they hope will enable them
to trace the vehicle used in the bombing _ a yellow pickup truck or
van _ which local reports say was apparently bought locally shortly
before the attack.
	   Investigators have declined to discuss specifics of the probe.
But employees at one Nairobi car dealership said Friday that police
had called in the firm's owner for questioning the previous day as
they tried to find out about the bombers. What he said was not
immediately known.
	   Funeral services were being held Saturday across Kenya, which
suffered 247 bombing deaths, and newspapers carried dozens of
black-bordered death announcements.
	   At Langata Cemetery, hundreds of mourners remembered Alice Ndutu
Gachiri, a government secretary who was killed while at work in on
the third floor of Cooperative Bank House, which towers above a
parking lot where the car bomb exploded.
	   Watching shovels of dirt fall onto his 36-year-old sister's
coffin, Peter Njao remembered her as ``our guiding light. She was
someone who would keep somebody's secret, and she would really try
to help.''
	   The family expressed anger at her unknown killers. Brother
Edward Chege prayed, ``Most of all, let us thank our God, Jehovah,
for giving us the strength to endure this undeserved grief.''
	   Gachiri was survived by her husband, Mwangi Gachiri and
daughters Grace Christine, 12, and Maryanne Wambui, 10.
	   In a videotaped message, U.S. President Bill Clinton extended
condolences to the victims' families, saying ``We grieve
together.''
	   ``Violent extremists try to use bullets and bombs to derail our
united efforts to bring peace to every part of this earth,'' he
said.
	   ``But I am proud that our nations have also renewed our
commitment to stand together _ to bring the offender swiftly to
justice, to combat terrorism in all its forms and to create a more
tolerant and peaceful world for our children,'' Clinton said.
	   Eight days after the bombings, newspapers also reflected a
mixture of grief, bewilderment and anger. Several letters to the
editor accused the Americans of giving priority to U.S. victims and
protecting evidence at the bombed embassy site, at the expense of
rescue efforts. All but 12 of the dead were Kenyans.
	   ``Few Kenyans will ever forget the hideous images of charred
bodies trapped in buses, mutilated corpses piled up in pickups and
dazed wounded groping in the streets, their faces washed in
blood,'' said an editorial in The Kenya Times. ``No arrest, trial
or conviction will ever compensate for the losses.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced she will
leave Sunday for the two East African capitals to meet with
investigators and console the injured.
	   Her four-day trip amounts to a show of support, and a
declaration of U.S. resolve in the face of terrorism.

At least five dead as mudslides bury cars in northern Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW details throughout, including hometowns of victims, 30 km
backup in Austria, how survivors found &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ Mudslides barreling across the main
highway south of the Italian-Austrian border early Saturday buried
two cars, killing five German vacationers, authorities said.
	   Three people were slightly injured by the slides, which covered
the high-speed autostrada highway, a local highway and rail tracks
in a narrow point of a valley river gorge where all three routes
pass.
	   Traffic was backed up as far as 30 kilometers (20 miles) into
Austria from the Brenner Pass, and for kilometers (miles) on the
Italian side. Rescue workers gave out water and food to stuck
motorists.
	   All five bodies were recovered from the cars, which were buried
under a three-meter (10-foot) high layer of mud and rocks, RAI
said.
	   Austria Press Agency reported that the dead were a married
couple from Mainz in one car and a family with a young boy from
Pinneberg, Schleswig-Holstein, in northern Germany.
	   One of the cars was flattened in the middle and most of its
front end was missing.
	   Some of the rocks that tumbled down the sheer valley walls were
almost as big as cars. Fallen tree trunks were so thick workers had
to saw them into smaller chunks before removing them.
	   Injured slightly were three German tourists who sought refuge on
the roof of their camper, which had been parked near the road when
the slides struck, ANSA reported.
	   Scene of the tragedy was just outside the town of Fortezza,
about 40 kilometers south of the border, which is crossed by the
Brenner Pass, one of Europe's major north-south crossing points.
	   Three separate mudslides were triggered shortly after midnight
by a thunderstorm in the South Tyrol, or Alto Adige, in the heart
of Italy's Alpine resort country.
	   Hundreds of firefighters and other rescuers used bulldozers and
shovels to dig through tons of mud and using metal detectors to see
if there were any other vehicles buried by the slides.
	   But several hours later Bolzano police said there didn't appear
to be any other bodies in the mud.
	   Highway authorities said that the autostrada and rail lines
would not be cleared before Saturday night at the earliest. The
local highway was reopened by mid-morning.
	   Saturday was the Aug. 15 Assumption Day religious feast day
which shuts down Italy and much of the rest of Europe. Traffic is
usually heaviest on the days before and after the holiday.
	   No trains were hit, but rerouting cost travelers several hours
of delays. Buses moved travelers between Verona and the Austrian
side of the border.
	   Italy's transport minister, who was in the area for vacation,
inspected the area by helicopter.

Malaysian leader says drastic economic measures may be drafted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds:UPDATES with deputy prime minister's remarks in grafs 12-13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia may soon introduce
drastic measures to shore up its flagging economy, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday, warning that some of the population
may be unnerved by the new strategy.
	   However, Mahathir told doubters they should trust their leaders.
	   ``Have faith in the government,'' Mahathir told a cheering crowd
of 10,000 people at a political rally in Sabah state on Borneo
island. ``Each time we want to adopt an approach we'll study it in
depth first.''
	   The 72-year old prime minister has toured the country widely in
recent weeks, stoking speculation that he may call an early general
election before the Southeast Asian nation's economy deteriorates
further.
	   However, Mahathir, who is now Asia's longest serving leader with
17 years in office, has dismissed suggestions that he may take his
government to the people before Parliament expires in April 2000.
	   Malaysia has dished out a range of measures to rejuvenate its
shrinking economy, racked by the continuing Asian crisis.
	   Agencies have been set up to handle a growing bad debt problem
and recapitalize the country's banks, and a central policy planning
team, called the National Economic Action Council, is overseeing
recovery efforts.
	   ``But we'll not just end here. Much more has to be done,''
Mahathir was quoted as saying by the national news agency Bernama.
	   Although the government says the economy may contract by up to 2
percent this year, private economists suggest a 5 percent shrinkage
is more likely.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia's economy showed signs that its sharp
decline is slowing, when the Bernama news agency reported Saturday
that inflation slowed to 5.8 percent in July this year, compared
with 6.2 percent in June.
	   The slight improvement came soon after the government introduced
two stimulus packages that jacked up federal spending by a hefty 20
percent _ a move which could further destabilize Malaysia's
battered economy, analysts say.
	   Also Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Malaysia
has to take full charge in steering its economy out of the present
crisis, without depending on foreign assistance.
	   He said that with bigger Asian economies like Japan, South Korea
and China grappling with their own economic problems, Malaysia had
no countries to turn to for assistance.

Taiwan central bank to secure currency, punish speculators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan
announced new measures Saturday to rein in currency speculation,
and promised a stable exchange rate for the remainder of 1998.
	   The bank will crack down on ``irregular'' activities in the
currency market, including stepping up regulation of international
currency speculators' proxy accounts in Taiwan, Perng told a news
conference.
	   Institutions suspected of speculating in the Taiwan dollar will
be starved of local currency and information about individual
speculators will be turned over to tax authorities for conducting
audits, he said.
	   Perng said the bank will intervene if necessary to shore up the
Taiwan dollar as it did in June, when the dollar was brushing
11-year lows. However, the bank did not sell ``a single U.S.
dollar,'' during July, allowing the market to set the rate of
exchange, he said.
	   Perng gained a reputation as the speculator's most dedicated
opponent while head of the central bank's foreign exchange
department from 1994 to 1995.
	   Dragged down by the sagging yen and weakened exports, the Taiwan
dollar has fallen to almost 35 against the U.S. dollar in recent
weeks, down from about 28 a year ago.
	   But government purchases overseas and private buying of U.S.
dollars has recently fallen off, and in coming months the Taiwan
dollar may regain ground lost to the American currency, Perng said.

New crew docks with Mir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fresh crew reached the Mir space station
Saturday and docked successfully after a minor hitch, space
officials said.
	   A Soyuz TM-28 ship, launched Thursday from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakstan, carried what is expected to be the aging
station's next-to-last crew.
	   At the last minute, the docking was switched from automatic to
manual pilot, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. It said mission
controllers spotted a minor problem in the automatic docking
system.
	   The docking was carried out 2 minutes ahead of schedule, at 2:56
p.m. Moscow time, the news agency said.
	   Earlier in the week, space officials had reported trouble with
Mir's automatic docking system but later said the crew fixed it.
The docking system has failed during previous dockings, but the
crew has been able to use manual controls.
	   Among the arriving cosmonauts was a rookie _ former national
security advisor Yuri Baturin, on a mission that was widely
ridiculed as a hoax when it was first announced.
	   Baturin and two other cosmonauts, flight commander Sergei
Avdeyev and engineer Gennady Padalka, will relieve a crew that has
been on Mir since January.
	   The new crew is expected to remain until February. However,
Avdeyev, the flight commander, might remain on the orbiter until
June, when the Mir is to be discarded and lowered to Earth.
	   Yeltsin fired Baturin as national security advisor earlier this
year without explanation. Since then, the 49-year-old official, a
space physicist by training, has focused on training for the trip.
	   It has not been clear why Baturin was chosen. Some people have
speculated that he is expected to attract attention to the
struggling space program. Baturin told reporters at Baikonur that
he would like to work aboard the international space station, which
is to receive its first crew next July.

Group deeply concerned over proposed restrictions on foreign
</HEADLINE>
journalists

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists said it is deeply concerned by an announcement
from the Malaysian Information Minister that he plans to impose new
restrictions on foreign journalists.
	   The minister, Mohamed Rahmat, has not revealed the details of
his proposal but the group said he made his intentions to more
closely monitor reporters clear when he said, ``if there is
negative and bad news, we will then know who is responsible...We
are not preventing them, but we want to know who they are, so that
we can resolve any problems that arise.''
	   In a letter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad the group said
foreign journalists working in Malaysia are already watched closely
by the government through a requirement that they register with the
Home Affair Ministry in order to get a work permit.
	   A copy of the letter which was faxed to the Associated Press on
Saturday said journalists also must provide the Information
Ministry with details about their personal and professional
background and also information about their employer before
obtaining a press pass.
	   The committee, which is dedicated to the protection of press
freedom worldwide, said it was dismayed by the recent trend in
Malaysia toward censorship and reminded the information minister
that economic advancement and democratic reform are possible only
with an uninhibited press.
	   Journalists in Malaysia have often tolerated subtle forms of
government intimidation.
	   Last month the Deputy Information Minister Suleiman Mohamad told
local reporters that ``if the media indulges in activities that
threaten political stability or national unity, we will come down
hard regardless of whether they are local or foreign.''
	   He went on to say that the local media was kept in check with
the internal Security Act, which allows suspected offenders to be
detained without a trial.
	   The committee said that no new rules were needed to ensure fair
reporting.
	   ``We believe that in cases where journalists knowingly distort
the truth there are sufficient remedies available for redress in
civil law,'' it said.
	   According to the journalists group, Mohamad Rahmat has also
criticized Malaysians who work for the foreign press, accusing them
of disloyalty and warning them ``not to resort to slanting reports
or write highly speculative reports just to please their
employer.''

Police block students from marching to border

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police used water cannons Saturday to
repel students trying to march to the border for a pro-unification
rally with their North Korean counterparts.
	   On Saturday, both Koreas held ceremonies to celebrate the 53rd
anniversary of the peninsula's liberation from 36 years of Japanese
colonial rule in 1945.
	   But the mood of celebration went unnoticed at Seoul National
University, where police water cannon buffeted 2,500 students who
had gathered for an illegal Liberation Day festival supported by
North Korea.
	   The students's three-day festival culminated Saturday with an
attempt to march to the border, where they were invited to a rally
hosted by North Korea. South Korea considered the border rally an
anti-Seoul propaganda stage and outlawed any attempts by students
to attend.
	   ``Let's advance the reunification of the fatherland!'' the
students chanted as they marched out of the campus.
	   At least two students were briefly knocked unconscious by water
cannon, witnesses said. Dozens more were hauled off by police for
questioning.
	   Police helicopters rained down yellow dye solution on the
students to mark demonstrators for arrests. The students held
umbrellas and wrapped their bodies with plastic bags to avoid the
raining solution.
	   The students demanded the abolishment of Seoul's anti-communist
national security law and the removal of 37,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea, which they say hinder reconciliation
between the two Koreas.
	   South Korea views such demands as pro-communist and seditious.
	   In Panmunjom, a truce village inside the Demilitarized Zone
separating the two Koreas, North Korea held its Liberation Day
ceremony with representatives from overseas Koreans and
Hanchongryon, South Korea's largest student activist group.
	   The rally ended with a resolution renewing North Korea's
traditional demands, including the end to U.S. military presence in
South Korea.
	   As they have done in the past, South Korean student activists
sent their two representatives to North Korea this year to join the
border rally. They arrived there last week via China.
	   Soon after liberation, the peninsula was divided into communist
North Korea and capitalist South Korea.
	   The two Koreas fought a devastating, three-year war that ended
without a peace treaty in 1953 and mutual distrust remains deep.
Their border is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
men on both sides.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Joining NATO next April means security for
Poland's independence and sovereignty, the nation's top army
chaplain said Saturday at a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary
of the Polish Army.
	   Bishop Slawoj Leszek Glodz also said that the most important
task of today's world is to secure peace, even by force, if
necessary.
	   Glodz celebrated a Mass as part of observations that also
included a ceremonial change of guard at the downtown Tomb of The
Unknown Soldier, with President Aleksander Kwasniewski looking on.
	   On Friday, a monument was unveiled in Warsaw to commemorate the
participation of American Poles in battles to restore and defend
Poland's independence between 1918 and 1920. The work of Andrzej
Pitynski, a Polish sculptor living in the United States, it was
financed by the Polish-American Congress.
	   In a another gesture to mark the army's anniversary and Poland's
future membership in NATO, Ensign Wojciech Pismenko voluntarily set
off on a 1,400 kilometer (868 mile) run from Warsaw to NATO
headquarters in Mons near Brussels, Belgium where he hopes to
arrive Sept. 6.

More than 300 people demand speedy probe into Indonesian violence

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ More than 300 people marched to the Indonesian
consulate in Hong Kong Saturday to demand a speedy and full
investigation into the violence against ethnic Chinese during riots
in May.
	   The protesters fanned themselves in the sweltering heat with
plastic fans emblazoned with the Chinese character ``shame'' to
depict their feelings about alleged sexual assaults against the
ethnic Chinese in Indonesia.
	   The protest was organized by Hong Kong's Democratic Party _ the
country's major opposition party.
	   In Jakarta, President B. J. Habibie said Saturday about 1,200
people were killed in May's violence which, he said, had ``streaked
the face of the nation'' with shame.
	   Most victims were members of the ethnic Chinese minority,
targeted for their relative wealth and made scapegoats for
Indonesia's economic disaster. Hundreds of Chinese homes and
business were attacked and burned by rampaging mobs.
	   ``This has been going on for a long time,'' said 57-year old
housewife Tai Yi-mei from Taiwan, whose husband has a business in
Hong Kong.
	   Despite repeated announcements from the Indonesian government of
heightened security on Aug. 17 _ Indonesia's Independence Day _
rumors have spread of possible renewed attacks against the ethnic
Chinese in Indonesia.
	   ``Whether the talk of planned attacks is genuine or rumor, the
terror instilled in the Chinese community is real enough,'' said an
editorial in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post.
	   Lee Kuen, an Indonesian expatriate living in Hong Kong, said she
told all her relatives in Indonesia to keep out of the streets on
Monday.
	   ``I told them to lock the doors,'' said Lee.
	   Democratic Party spokesman Albert Ho said he hoped the
Indonesian government could ``stop the aggression against the
Indonesian Chinese and restore social order.''
	   Chong Yi-min, a 50-year-old businessmen said he felt ``pain in
his heart'' whenever he saw pictures of the May riots.
	   Chang Shih-chun, an Indonesian-born doctor who spoke before the
protesters, accused Jakarta of tolerating the anti-Chinese
sentiment, saying the violence would never have happened if the
government had been ``more concerned.''
	   ``It's been going on for years,'' Chang said. ``And it isn't
going to stop under Habibie.''
	   Outrage over the May attacks has galvanized ethnic Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests outside Indonesia's representative
offices abroad.
	   Students at the prestigious Beijing University have reportedly
put up posters all over the campus accusing China's government of
reacting apathetically to the rapes.
	   Habibie has reportedly ordered Indonesian officials to ask
intelligence officers from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United
States to take part in an official investigation into the rapes.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces, using tanks and
aircraft, launched a strong, coordinated attack early Saturday
against a string of Kosovo villages apparently controlled by
separatist guerrillas, an ethnic Albanian source said.
	   The attack in western Kosovo came two days after ethnic Albanian
pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a negotiating team for
talks with the government on the future of the embattled southern
Serbian province.
	   Rugova said Friday all military operations carried out by the
government must stop before negotiations can begin. The new
offensive appeared to rule out talks for a settlement of the
conflict any time soon.
	   Nevertheless, the government in Belgrade invited Rugova's party
to start negotiations as early as next week.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported that government forces
deployed at strategic positions and at 6 a.m. opened fire on
villages Loka, Rausic, Krusevac, Istinic, Streoc, Papracane and
some others, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina near
the Albanian border.
	   All were believed to be under the control of the underground
Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence of Kosovo.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attack, the ethnic Albanian
source said.
	   It also alleged that the assault began with jets dropping one
bomb on each village. The report could not be verified
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center also said that
grenade fire from two nearby military facilities followed, and in
two hours a total of 200 hundred grenades hit the village of Loka.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Some fighting was also reported early Saturday further to the
south, where a total of five civilians died.
	   Apparently ignoring the new government offensive, Ratko
Markovic, the head of the government's negotiating team, sent a
message to Fehmi Agani, a top Rugova aide, proposing that talks
between the two delegations should begin ``as soon as next week.''
	   Meanwhile, the decision by Adem Demaci, a prominent Albanian
opposition politician, to lead the political wing of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, has widened the split between the rebel
organization and Rugova, the longtime ethnic Albanian leader.
	   Demaci, Rugova's chief rival, announced his acceptance Friday
after Rugova failed to persuade the KLA to join his team. By doing
so, Demaci in effect established himself as an alternative leader
of the province's majority Albanian community.
	   Rugova is supported by the U.S. and other international leaders,
who view him as the best choice to bring the bloody conflict
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   On Thursday, Rugova raised hopes that a political solution was
in sight, when he announced a delegation to begin talks with the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But the KLA, who demand independence, accused Rugova Friday of
``forgetting ... those who are ... spilling blood,'' meaning
themselves. They said Rugova's ``illegal'' team could not reach any
binding agreement ``without the presence of KLA representatives.''
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia whose population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.

Irie surges ahead in NEC Karuizawa 72
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARUIZAWA, Japan (AP) _ Defending champion Yuka Irie shot her
second straight 5-under-par 67 Saturday and surged ahead for a
five-stroke lead going into the final round of the NEC Karuizawa
72.
	   Irie, one shot off the lead overnight, overcame the foggy and
drizzly weather and sank seven birdies against two bogeys en route
to a 10-under 134 total.
	   The 29-year-old Irie wasted two early birdies with two straight
bogeys on No. 6 and No. 7. But she quickly regained the touch, and
not only played bogey-free the rest of the round but also scored
five more birdies.
	   ``I was putting well, so I just tried to hit the ball close,''
said Irie, in contention for her first title of the season and
fourth overall. She one-putted 11 holes.
	   The day's play started three hours behind the schedule due to
heavy fog in the morning.
	   Akiko Fukushima, the Japan tour's best player in the last two
years, fired a 69 for 139. She is seeking her second victory of the
season.
	   Kaori Harada, an overnight co-leader, struggled to 74 and shared
third at 140 with Michiko Hattori, who shot a 71. Harada, currently
leading the tour's money list, is in contention for her third title
of the season and eighth overall.
	   Another stroke back at 141 were Lee Young-me, her South Korean
compatriot Ku Ok-hee, Aki Nakano, Kotomi Akiyama and Mikino Kubo.
	   The 60 million yen (dlrs 414,000) event offers a top prize of
10.8 million yen (dlrs 74,500).

Italian reports: actress in New York hospital for a few days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Actress Sophia Loren is being treated for a few days
at a New York hospital after falling ill on a flight from Los
Angeles and will have to skip a trip to Venice next month to
receive a major award, Italian news media Saturday quoted her
family as saying.
	   RAI state TV and radio and well as private Italian network
Canale 5 said her family in Los Angeles on Friday issued a
statement blaming stress for a ``light cardiovascular'' problem.
	   It said hot weather and a long delay before the flight took off
for New York were also factors in Loren's falling ill.
	   The statement, issued by the family of film producer Carlo
Ponti, her husband, said Loren, who is 63, had been transferred
from intensive care to a regular room and would be hospitalized for
a few days.
	   Loren won't be able to keep her appointment Sept. 3 to receive
the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion career award, the family
statement was quoted as saying.
	   It was not clear which flight Loren had taken or the exact
nature of the heart problem.
	   ``She just needs rests -- no more airplanes for a month,'' RAI
TV quoted Ponti as saying in Los Angeles.
	   Loren apparently had recently made several long trips, including
one from her other home, in Geneva, Switzerland, to California.
	   The family made the statement after a day of swirling rumors in
the United States, including one that she had suffered a heart
attack after some plastic surgery.
	   On Friday, a spokesman at the hospital where she was reportedly
taken denied a report by the New York Daily News that the
Italian-born Loren had suffered a heart attack and was resting
comfortably at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ While the investigation to unmask the
mystery bombers in East Africa entered a second week without firm
answers, Kenyans buried their dead Saturday and sought to endure
their grief. The FBI says it will take another month or more to
finish examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people and injured
more than 5,500. A British forensic team was on the way to aid the
FBI's 215 agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians, computer
specialists, photographers and translators in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, sites of the bombings. Bombing evidence was expected to
arrive at the FBI laboratories in Washington this weekend for tests
to confirm what explosives were used and whether the two bombs had
the same ingredients. (EMBASSY-BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese officials vowed Saturday to hit
back at rebels advancing on the capital _ but still prepared to
meet a delegation of visiting African envoys searching for a
peaceful end to the country's war. Foreign ministers from Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Namibia were scheduled to meet with
Information Minister Didier Mumengi and other senior government
officials during weekend talks. Mumengi, however, said the meetings
shouldn't be taken as a sign the government was pulling back from
its war effort against a rebel army of Congolese Tutsis, Rwandan
soldiers and disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's
military. (CONGO)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia may soon introduce
drastic measures to shore up its flagging economy, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday, warning that some of the population
may be unnerved by the new strategy. The tough-talking premier told
doubters they should trust their leaders. The 72-year old prime
minister has toured the country widely in recent weeks, stoking
speculation that he may call an early general election before the
Southeast Asian nation's economy deteriorates further. Mahathir,
who is now Asia's longest serving leader with 17 years in office,
has dismissed suggestions that he may take his government to the
people before Parliament expires in April 2000. (MALAYSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Jiang Zemin urged the nation to rally
behind the battle against summer floods that have affected
one-fifth of the Chinese population, leaving millions homeless,
state-run media said Saturday. Flood damage mounted in northeastern
Heilongjiang province, which borders Russia, as a second dike near
Daqing, China's largest oilfield, collapsed early Saturday, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. No casualties were reported,
although the breach forced the evacuation of ``most'' local
residents in the city of 2.34 million, and the relief situation
remained unclear, Xinhua said. Rains brought by a seasonal front
that stretches across China have caused floods and landslides in
many areas, killing more than 2,000 people. (CHINA FLOODS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian opposition refused on
Saturday to endorse strongman Hun Sen to become prime minister in a
new government and demanded parliamentary elections won by his
ruling party be held again. The refusal of the opposition to accept
Hun Sen's declared victory has stymied attempts to form a new
government and bring political stability to the long-suffering
country. Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party issued
a detailed document Saturday accusing Hun Sen, who deposed the
prince as co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago, of rigging
the polls in his favor. (CAMBODIA-ELECTION)

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Two of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top
cabinet ministers remain at odds over what action to take in the
embattled Serb province of Kosovo, with the split in opinions
widening, German news media said Saturday.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel was quoted by the Magdeburger
Volksstimme newspaper as saying he hoped Russia and China would go
along with a United Nations Security Council mandate sanctioning
military action against the Serbs.
	   ``I haven't given up the hope that Russia and China line up and
in the end do not veto a U.N. mandate for a deployment in Kosovo,''
the newspaper quote Kinkel as saying. ``We have to convince all
there is a joint responsibility.''
	   But Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in an interview with Der
Spiegel weekly of Hamburg, that it was an ``unrealistic and
unattainable,'' goal to try to convince Russia to approve a U.N.
mandate against the Serbs.
	   Spiegel also quoted Ruehe as saying NATO military action against
the Serbs with German forces taking an active part should in an
emergency take place even without Russia's agreement.
	   ``In view of the escalation of violence, brutal murder and
inhuman expulsion in the middle of Europe, we cannot allow that
Russia blocks everything in the Security Council,'' Spiegel quoted
Ruehe as saying.
	   Ruehe distanced himself from Kinkel's hopes of a U.N. mandate.
``Naturally it would be good when that came through the U.N. But
it's not working,'' Spiegel quoted him as saying.
	   Ruehe charged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with ``lying
in the faces of 370 million Europeans'' about the situation in
Kosovo, while his military action against ethnic Albanians
continues unhindered by anyone, Spiegel said.
	   Ruehe also repeated past remarks that any NATO action to stop
the fighting in Kosovo would be primarily air forces using limited
military strikes to force the opposing sides to negotiate a
settlement.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the dominant republic
in what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians want independence from the Serbs, whom they
outnumber 9-to-1 in Kosovo. Milosevic ordered a crackdown on the
ethnic Albanians in February, and fighting in the province has
spiraled since then, with thousands of people seeking to flee the
violence.

settlement &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in final grafs with central bank calling special board
meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's president expressed
relief in an interview published Saturday over the settlement of
Holocaust survivors' claims by the country's two biggest commercial
banks.
	   ``It looks as though a lengthy and extremely difficult dispute
has come to an end,'' Flavio Cotti was quoted as saying in the
Zurich daily Blick.
	   The banks ``were in a very difficult situation,'' Cotti added.
``So I have full understanding for the fact they chose this way to
solve the problem of the private action against them and their
position in the important U.S. market.''
	   On Wednesday, the banks agreed to pay dlrs 1.25 billion in an
out-of-court settlement of Holocaust survivors' claims against
them.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   The government on Thursday issued a statement restating its
position that the settlement is a matter for those involved. It did
not take part in negotiations and is committed to nothing by the
agreement, the statement added.
	   ``We still say that negotiations between civil parties cannot be
a matter for the state,'' Cotti said.
	   He stressed that Switzerland will continue with its existing
policies to address its wartime past, notably a panel of
independent historians investigating the period.
	   ``We need clarity about our history,'' Cotti said. ``And if the
pressure from the United States decreases, as I hope, that will be
beneficial to a climate for an objective discussion.''
	   Also Saturday, a spokesman for the Swiss National Bank, the
country's central bank, said it has called an extraordinary board
meeting for Friday to discuss the settlement.
	   The commercial banks have said they expect ``other Swiss
companies and institutions'' to help finance the settlement.
Switzerland's main political parties oppose any contribution by the
central bank.

inhuman expulsion in the middle of Europe, we cannot allow that
Russia blocks everything in the Security Council,'' Spiegel quoted
Ruehe as saying.
	   Ruehe distanced himself from Kinkel's hopes of a U.N. mandate.
``Naturally it would be good when that came through the U.N. But
it's not working,'' Spiegel quoted him as saying.
	   Ruehe charged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with ``lying
in the faces of 370 million Europeans'' about the situation in
Kosovo, while his military action against ethnic Albanians
continues unhindered by anyone, Spiegel said.
	   Ruehe also repeated past remarks that any NATO action to stop
the fighting in Kosovo would be primarily air forces using limited
military strikes to force the opposing sides to negotiate a
settlement.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the dominant republic
in what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians want independence from the Serbs, whom they
outnumber 9-to-1 in Kosovo. Milosevic ordered a crackdown on the
ethnic Albanians in February, and fighting in the province has
spiraled since then, with thousands of people seeking to flee the
violence.

	   After putting men at the perimeter and checking the building to
make sure it wouldn't collapse, Jones sent others inside to check
for survivors. In the hours ahead, they found two survivors and 20
to 25 bodies.
	   About 3:30 p.m., Richardson went to the Nairobi city morgue.
``After showing my embassy badge, I was escorted to the only
criminal pathologist in Kenya, who was trying to organize what was
going on. And at the same time, he told me there were already 54
dead. Of course, the number went much higher. I was able to
identify one official American.
	   ``As it turned out, there were two other people associated with
the embassy who were there, although I was not immediately able to
recognize them. They were bringing in bodies in really bad shape.
After 20 minutes there ... I realized I was not as tough as I
thought I was, and so I left.''
	   All that afternoon, rescue work also proceeded in Dar es Salaam.
By 4:40 p.m., all the dead and wounded were evacuated from the
embassy there, spokesman Dudley Simms said.
	   That night, Richardson couldn't sleep. Instead, he went from
hospital to hospital, searching for the missing.
	   ``We really didn't find anybody,'' he said, ``because it was
just too chaotic at the hospital.''
	   Shortly after daybreak Saturday, Red Cross spokeswoman Nina
Galbe saw a flurry of activity at the bomb site in Nairobi.
	   ``I remember the sound of all these axes, metal against stone,
like a hacking, the clinking _ at the same time it was pitiful,''
Galbe said. ``It was pitiful because they could do so little. And
then there was an anger as well because there was no coordination
at all.''
	   ``Everyone was just tearing and pulling and pushing at this
stone monster that would not be tamed or broken,'' Galbe said.
	   The cranes were standing by idly, she said, because nobody knew
how to use them.
	   In the early morning hours before Galbe had arrived, rescuers
had reached a man lying on a table. They cut the table from
underneath, thinking it would then fall so they could pull him out.
	   ``Instead, what happened was, of course, that the rubble on top
of him fell down as well and he was crushed,'' Galbe said.
	   As the morning wore on, rescuers found another survivor. When
they called for a stretcher, hopes rose. Shortly afterward, they
called for a stethoscope. The man was dead.
	   ``These were two people who were alive, who with more
sophisticated tools might have been clearly saved,'' Galbe said.
	   Shortly after 2 p.m., an Israeli search-and-rescue team _ 181
men and women and eight sniffer dogs _ arrived and took charge.
They saw two cranes, a bulldozer and a backhoe standing by.
Soldiers, police officers and civilians were picking over the
rubble, many with their bare hands.
	   The Israelis used a bulldozer to clear debris blocking the path
behind the Ufundi building. They looked over the ruins and put the
cranes to work, digging into the rubble, calling for survivors.
	   Ng'ang'a, the scrap metal dealer, replied. So did Rose Wanjiku
Irungu, a 36-year-old employee of the Cooperative Bank.
	   About 10:30 p.m., the Israelis reached Ng'ang'a.
	   ``They are coming for you next,'' he called to Rose. He was
rushed to Nairobi Hospital with a broken leg and deep gashes on his
head.
	   In Uhuru (Freedom) Park, people streamed to a Red Cross center
to donate blood. Several preachers swayed and sang on a makeshift
platform in the park, joined by about 4,000 men, women and
children. Their songs ranged from the exultant to the mournful in
memory of those killed in the blast. Their shabby clothes marked
them as the urban poor.
	   At 3 p.m. Sunday, rescuers heard Rose speak. Their digging took
on a new urgency.
	   During the afternoon, a 62-member rescue squad from the United
States arrived with four search dogs. So did a 10-man French team
with two dogs. FBI and other U.S. investigators also began to
trickle in.
	   It was Tuesday afternoon when Charles Kamuti, 31, went to the
city morgue, looking for his younger brother, Lawrence, an
assistant pharmacist in the Cooperative Bank building. A friend
said Lawrence, 29, had run to the street after hearing the grenade.
	   And it was Tuesday afternoon when Rose's rescue seemed near. Two
search dogs veered toward a hole in the debris of the Ufundi
building, now shrunken by more than two-thirds, and barked
excitedly.
	   Shoulder to shoulder, Kenyans and Israelis used shovels,
pickaxes and their hands. Finally, they reached a body. It wasn't
Rose.
	   Shortly after noon on Wednesday, a bulldozer pried the
blackened, shredded wreckage of a vehicle off the Nairobi embassy
wall, where it had been plastered by the force of the blast. There
was speculation that it might have carried the explosives.
	   At about 2:30 p.m., the Israelis called for silence and dropped
a microphone deep into the ruins in hopes of picking up some sound
from Rose.
	   It was 3 a.m. Thursday by the time rescuers wearily removed the
last layers of debris from the one victim the world hoped might be
saved.
	   They slipped her broken body into a white plastic bag and drove
it to the morgue. Rose had died less than 24 hours before they
reached her, rescuers said.
	   Sniffer dogs made one last check at 10 a.m. Nothing. The Israeli
commander declared the search for survivors over.
	   It wasn't until about 3 p.m. Friday that the body of Kamuti's
brother was identified from fingerprints. But nine unidentified
bodies remained in cold storage at morgues and seven families have
filed reports with the Red Cross saying relatives are missing.
	   Today, dwarfed by the bombed U.S. Embassy and a blackened office
tower, a small, flower-covered pyramid of concrete rubble has
become a memorial to the dead and a magnet for the grief of a
nation.
	   Amid the bouquets of roses and colored ribbons, someone has
placed a hand-lettered sign summing up the sorrow that has
enveloped this deeply religious east African country. Written in
red ink, it says:
	   ``Cry Kenya''
	   ``Pray Kenya''
	   ``God Heal Kenya''
	   There is no memorial at the abandoned U.S. Embassy in Dar es
Salaam. Just rows of barbed wire and U.S. Marines with assault
rifles who keep curious onlookers away.

Politician criticises Hong Kong's market intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A leading Hong Kong politician criticised the
government's unprecedented intervention in the stock and futures
markets, saying it could harm the territory's reputation as a major
financial center.
	   On Friday, Hong Kong shares surged 8.5 percent after the
government stepped into the market in an attempt to crush
speculators.
	   Martin Lee, a lawmaker and head of the Democratic Party, said
Hong Kong is regarded as having the freest economy in the world and
that the intervention could damage that reputation.
	   Speaking on government-owned Radio Hong Kong, Lee said the
government has now become a ``player in the market'' instead of
being just a regulator.
	   He said this has led to uncertainty because people ``don't known
when the government'' will intervene again.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang bitterly criticized speculators
Friday for what he said was an effort to manipulate Hong Kong's
markets, and said the government acted in response to ``very
exceptional circumstances.''
	   He refused to reveal the size of the government's effort.
	   Tsang also accused speculators of spreading rumors about the
delinking of the Hong Kong currency's fixed peg to the U.S. dollar,
devaluation of the Chinese currency, and the instability of Hong
Kong banks.
	   Speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar have caused local
interest rates to rise and shares to plummet.
	   After shedding 16 percent of its value and falling to a
five-year low in the first two weeks of August, the Hang Seng Index
rose 564.27 points to close at 7,224.69 on Friday.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Formula One leader Mika Hakkinen
clinched the pole position for the Hungarian Grand Prix in
Saturday's qualifying, while his closest rival in the battle for
the championship, Michael Schumacher, had to settle for the second
row.
	   A good grid position is vital on the narrow, twisting
Hungaroring where overtaking is difficult and Hakkinen will have a
distinct advantage by starting from the pole.
	   Schumacher posted the third fastest time in his Ferrari.
	   ``Being in the pole is extremely important here,'' Hakkinen
said. ``This track is difficult, there i a lot of dust on the
inside and you can lose the grip of your tires.''
	   Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate David Coulthard was second.
	   Hakkinen, seeking his third straight victory, charged to his
eighth pole of the season and now has a good chance of increasing
his 16-point lead over Schumacher in the drivers' standings.
	   The Finn sped around the 3.9-kilometer (2.4-mile) circuit in his
silver McLaren to clock the fastest lap in one minute 16.973
seconds.
	   Coulthard, a Briton who finished second to Hakkinen in the last
two races, was .158 seconds behind, while Schumacher was .393
seconds off the pace.
	   Schumacher, a German with two Formula One titles, is trying to
become the first Ferrari driver to win the championship since Jody
Scheckter in 1979.
	   ``In principle, I am quite happy with third place,'' Schumacher
said. ``I think I still have a realistic chance tomorrow.''
	   Joining Schumacher in the second row was Damon Hill, the former
champion from Britain, 1.241 seconds behind in a Jordan.
	   Eddie Irvine of Ireland in the second Ferrari was fifth, while
reigning champion Jacques Villeneuve was sixth in a Williams.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An EgyptAir flight with 163 passengers bound
for Vienna, Austria, was held up for three hours at Cairo airport
after a woman passenger went missing, airport police said Saturday.
	   The incident occurred Friday night when the woman passenger,
identified by police as a German national who lives in Cairo,
disappeared after checking in at the gate.
	   When the number of passengers on the plane didn't match the
number of boarding cards that had been collected, all the
passengers were ordered off the plane.
	   It left three hours later without the German woman or her
luggage, airport officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The woman surfaced on Saturday at an EgyptAir office, where she
reserved another flight, the officials said.
	   She told airline officials that she had left the gate area
Friday to try to upgrade her seat to first class. Then, thinking
that she had missed the flight, she returned to her home in Cairo.
	   Airport officials said the woman, in her 50s, is the widow of an
Egyptian man.
	   The German Embassy was closed Saturday, and diplomats could not
immediately be reached for comment.

U.S. scales down manpower in next week's NATO exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The United States has withdrawn two
warships, thus sharply reducing the number of Marine forces
participating in NATO maneuvers starting next week in Albania, U.S.
and Albanian officials said.
	   Originally, about 1,000 Marines were to take part in the
weeklong Albanian military exercise, including the amphibious
warfare ships USS Saipan, USS Austin and USS Tortuga.
	   The USS Saipan and USS Tortuga have been diverted toward Congo
because of the unrest there. That leaves USS Austin for the
Albanian exercise, with about 275 Marines, according to Lt. Col.
Stephen Cambell, a spokesman for the Pentagon.
	   The number of U.S. forces participating in the NATO maneuvers
has been reduced ``because of operational requirements, not because
of the situation on the ground in Albania,'' Campbell said Friday.
	   The war games are in part designed to show neighboring
Yugoslavia that the Western military alliance can respond
forcefully to the crisis in neighboring Kosovo.
	   In Tirana, the Albanian capital, Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga
admitted on Saturday that the United States had reduced the number
of its participants in the ``Cooperative Assembly'' exercise.
	   He explained that the U.S. troops were needed in the evacuation
of American citizens from Kinshasa, the Congo capital.
	   Hajdaraga also took pains to pledge that all the necessary
measures had been taken to ensure the safety of those participating
in the exercise.
	   ``We have taken high-security measures for all the foreigners
that are staying in Albania and for those who will arrive. We are
sure that these maneuvers will be very successful,'' the minister
declared.
	   Contrary to a series of reports from the area, Hajdraraga also
claimed the situation along the border with Yugoslavia was under
control of his government.
	   ``Albania is able to face any provocation or incident caused by
the Serbians,'' he asserted.

Campaign aims to wipe out polio in Somalia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Youths with megaphones took to the
streets urging Somalis to get their children immunized as part of a
nationwide campaign to wipe out polio launched Saturday by health
authorities.
	   The campaign, sponsored by UNICEF and the World Health
Organization in collaboration with local health authorities, is
aimed at immunizing more than 900,000 children under the age of 5.
	   Faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed formally began the campaign at
a ceremony in north Mogadishu attended by political and religious
leaders, giving a 2-year-old girl the first vaccine drops.
	   More than 100 teams are carrying out the campaign in all 16
districts of the capital, while the central town of Dhusamareb and
the southern port town of Kismaio also are involved in the first
phase.
	   Somalis are being urged not to be the last victims of polio, as
was the case with smallpox when the world's final victim was Ali
Ma'ow in the coastal town of Merca in 1977. He has been enlisted to
help in the polio eradication campaign.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait will introduce unleaded gasoline this fall,
Al-Watan daily reported Saturday.
	   The newspaper quoted a statement by the National Petroleum Corp.
as saying the more environment-friendly fuel will be available in
two octanes (91 and 95) at gasoline stations starting Oct. 1.
	   The statement did not announce the price of unleaded gasoline,
but Al-Watan said it would be set soon by the Supreme Petroleum
Council, Kuwait's oil policy-making body.
	   Kuwait is a major oil country, producing about 2 million barrels
of crude a day.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Arab Potash Co., a hard currency
earner, reported Saturday that its profits fell 21 percent in the
first six months of this year because of reduced sales and
increased operational expenses.
	   The company said it earned 6.3 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs
8.8 million) in half of 1998, compared with 7.9 million dinars
(dlrs 11 million) in the first six months of 1997.
	   ``The decreased profit is due to reduced sales because of
shrinking demand on the product internationally as well as stiff
competition with other potash firms,'' said board chairman Saleh
Irsheidat.
	   He said expenditures had increased because of projects to
increase production to 2 million tons annually in the year 2000
from the current 1.5 million tons.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Nearly 450,000 Gulf Arabs have visited
Jordan since the beginning of the year, an increase of 22.2 percent
over 1997.
	   State-run Jordan Radio said Saturday that most came from Saudi
Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
	   Tourism is a vital industry for Jordan, which boasts biblical,
Nabatean and Roman sites. But the country lacks the hotels and
other facilities available in neighboring countries.
	   Jordan earned about dlrs 1.1 million from nearly a million
tourists last year. Most of the visitors are Arabs or Israelis.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's budget deficit widened in July
from June, Lebanese newspapers reported Saturday.
	   An-Nahar quoted the Finance Ministry as saying that spending
rose to dlrs 492 million from dlrs 427 million, while revenues
dropped to dlrs 243 million from dlrs 288 million.
	   The deficit in July was dlrs 249 million, compared with dlrs 139
million the month before.
	   July expenditures included dlrs 219 million for servicing
foreign debts.
	   Fuad Saniora, state minister for finance, said the widening
deficit did not mean the government wouldn't achieve its goal of
reducing the deficit this year.
	   ``We're warning everybody that revenues and expenditures
fluctuate from month to month,'' the English-language Daily Star
quoted Saniora as saying.

At least five dead as mudslides bury cars in northern Italy

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with autostrada partially reopened, EDITS to conform,

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ Mudslides barreling across the main
highway south of the Italian-Austrian border early Saturday buried
two cars, killing five German vacationers, authorities said.
	   Three people were slightly injured by the slides, which covered
the high-speed autostrada highway, a local highway and rail tracks
in a narrow point of a valley river gorge where all three routes
pass.
	   Traffic was backed up as far as 30 kilometers (20 miles) into
Austria from the Brenner Pass, and for kilometers (miles) on the
Italian side. Rescue workers gave out water and food to stuck
motorists.
	   All five bodies were recovered from the cars, which were buried
under a three-meter (10-foot) high layer of mud and rocks, RAI
said.
	   Austria Press Agency reported that the dead were a married
couple from Mainz in one car and a family with a young boy from
Pinneberg, Schleswig-Holstein, in northern Germany.
	   One of the cars was flattened in the middle and most of its
front end was missing.
	   Some of the rocks that tumbled down the sheer valley walls were
almost as big as cars. Fallen tree trunks were so thick workers had
to saw them into smaller chunks before removing them.
	   Injured slightly were three German tourists who sought refuge on
the roof of their camper, which had been parked near the road when
the slides struck, ANSA reported.
	   Scene of the tragedy was just outside the town of Fortezza,
about 40 kilometers south of the border.
	   Three separate mudslides were triggered shortly after midnight
by a thunderstorm in the South Tyrol, or Alto Adige, in the heart
of Italy's Alpine resort country.
	   Hundreds of firefighters and other rescuers used bulldozers and
shovels to dig through tons of mud and using metal detectors to see
if there were any other vehicles buried by the slides.
	   But several hours later Bolzano police said there didn't appear
to be any other bodies in the mud.
	   By early afternoon, one lane of the autostrada was reopened in
each direction.
	   Authorities said rail lines would not be cleared before Saturday
night at the earliest. No trains were hit, but rerouting cost
travelers several hours of delays.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese officials vowed Saturday to hit
back at rebels advancing on the capital _ but still prepared to
meet a delegation of visiting African envoys searching for a
peaceful end to the country's war.
	   Foreign ministers from Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Namibia
were scheduled to meet with Information Minister Didier Mumengi and
other senior government officials during weekend talks.
	   Mumengi, however, said the meetings shouldn't be taken as a sign
the government was pulling back from its war effort against a rebel
army of Congolese Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted members
of President Laurent Kabila's military.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by the new government.
	   ``We're getting ready to launch a counter-strike at the rebels
who are in Lower Congo,'' Mumengi said in a telephone interview.
	   The government says neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are fighting
with and supplying the rebellion _ a charge both countries deny.
	   Asked if a political settlement to the fighting could be found,
Mumengi responded: ``As long as there are foreign troops on our
soil the only solution will be a military solution.''
	   A rebellion against Kabila launched earlier this month quickly
escalated into an insurgent war with the rebels capturing key towns
in the east, including Goma and Bukavu, and securing positions in
the west after a troop airlift.
	   In eastern Congo, Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign
minister-turned-rebel, said Congolese opposition leaders had formed
the Congolese Democratic Movement to replace Kabila's government.
	   ``We have a name, we have program, we have leaders,'' Karaha
said from the eastern town of Bukavu. ``We're trying to be as
intrusive as possible.''
	   He said the movement included political opponents of both Mobutu
and Kabila as well as ordinary Congolese.
	   Responding to the mounting concern of a rebel takeover over in
Kinshasa and ensuing violence, France, Britain and the United
States are preparing contingency evacuation plans for their
citizens.
	   Across the Congo River, in the Republic of Congo capital of
Brazzaville, three planeloads of French soldiers were preparing to
get their countrymen out of Kinshasa as anti-foreigner sentiment
there grew. Official radio in Brazzaville said a French evacuation
plane had been refused authorization to land Friday at Kinshasa's
airport and the soldiers were trying to get the French citizens out
by ferrying them across the river. However, Congo has already
declared the river closed and by early Saturday afternoon no boats
had yet been allowed to cross.
	   Kinshasa residents, meanwhile, have been stocking up on
provisions and bottled water.

New crew docks with Mir

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fresh crew reached the Mir space station
Saturday and docked successfully after a minor hitch, space
officials said.
	   A Soyuz TM-28 ship, launched Thursday from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakstan, carried what is expected to be the aging
station's next-to-last crew.
	   At the last minute, the docking was switched from automatic to
manual pilot, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. It said mission
controllers spotted a minor problem in the automatic docking
system.
	   The docking was carried out 2 minutes ahead of schedule, at 2:56
p.m. Moscow time, the news agency said.
	   Earlier in the week, space officials had reported trouble with
Mir's automatic docking system but later said the crew fixed it.
The docking system has failed during previous dockings, but the
crew has been able to use manual controls.
	   Among the arriving cosmonauts was a rookie _ former national
security advisor Yuri Baturin, on a mission that was widely
ridiculed as a hoax when it was first announced.
	   Baturin and two other cosmonauts, flight commander Gennady
Padalka and engineer Sergei Avdeyev, will relieve a crew that has
been on Mir since January.
	   The new crew is expected to remain until February. However,
Avdeyev might remain on the orbiter until June, when the Mir is to
be discarded and lowered to Earth.
	   Yeltsin fired Baturin as national security advisor earlier this
year without explanation. Since then, the 49-year-old official, a
space physicist by training, has focused on training for the trip.
	   It has not been clear why Baturin was chosen. Some people have
speculated that he is expected to attract attention to the
struggling space program. Baturin told reporters at Baikonur that
he would like to work aboard the international space station, which
is to receive its first crew next July.

Four people killed in subway accident in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An elevator carrying workers down a deep
ventilation shaft at a Kiev subway station broke loose and fell 90
meters (yards), killing four people, a news agency said Saturday.
	   Six people were in the elevator when one of its ropes broke
Friday at the Pecherska subway station, Interfax said.
	   Three workers died soon after the accident and the fourth died
in a Kiev hospital Saturday, Interfax said. Another worker remains
hospitalized in serious condition.
	   The sixth worker saved his life by grabbing at the ropes an
instant before the elevator started to fall.

Police in Azerbaijan arrest 300 people: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested 300 opposition protesters in Baku,
the capital of the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, the
Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
	   No other details were immediately available and officials could
not be reached for comment.
	   Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in Azerbaijan on
Oct. 11. The opposition has said it will boycott the vote because
the country was undemocratic and the election would likely be
unfair.
	   President Geidar Aliev, who is seeking re-election, has been
trying to improve his democratic credentials and recently issued a
decree abolishing most forms of censorship in the oil-rich country
of 7 million people on the Caspian Sea.
	   Aliev was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss. He came
to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Police and paramilitary soldiers shot
and killed four protesters setting fire to cars to enforce a
one-day strike in Karachi, witnesses said, among seven deaths
linked to the unrest in the southern port city Saturday.
	   The ``day of mourning'' called by the Mohajir Quami Movement,
the main political party in Karachi, transformed parts of
Pakistan's economic hub into war zones.
	   Young men armed with automatic rifles wandered the streets,
challenging patrolling police and paramilitary forces. Barricades
of burning tires hampered buses and taxis plying their routes, and
shops were closed throughout the city. At least 100 vehicles were
burned by protesters.
	   The MQM withdrew from the federal government a day earlier to
protest the violence that has engulfed Karachi for years. Saturday,
party spokeswoman Nasreen Jaleel said the MQM would also withdraw
from the provincial government in Sindh, where Karachi is located,
in two days if the government did not arrest those responsible for
the deaths of 10 party workers who were shot by unknown gunmen
earlier in the week.
	   Witnesses and the MQM said three of their supporters were shot
dead by police as they set fire to vehicles Saturday. Police denied
they fired on those three, but confirmed paramilitary forces killed
a fourth in a similar confrontation.
	   Elsewhere in Karachi, a dead police officer, his hands bound and
his body bearing marks of a brutal beating, was found with a
bullet-wound in the head. Attacks on security forces are often
staged by both the MQM and the breakaway faction with whom it has
been battling for years.
	   Another body, this one unidentified, was found riddled with
bullets in one of the city's most volatile neighborhoods. No
details were available on the seven killing reported by police.
	   In nearby Hyderabad, another city dominated by the MQM, a police
officer was killed in a drive-by shooting. Hyderabad, like Karachi,
was closed down by the strike on what is normally a working day in
Pakistan.
	   More than 500 people have been killed in Karachi's political,
ethnic and sectarian violence this year, compared with about 400 in
1997.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif can govern without the MQM at the
federal level. But Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat Jatoi's provincial
government would topple without the support of the MQM, which
represents Muslims who emigrated to Pakistan from neighboring
India.
	   The escalating violence in Karachi is just one of the challenges
facing Sharif:
	   _Pakistan's relations with its giant neighbor India are at one
of the lowest points in their 51-year histories following a series
of tit-for-tat nuclear weapons tests by both nations in May.
	   _International anti-nuclear economic sanctions have pushed the
already weak Pakistani economy to the brink of bankruptcy.
	   _Sharif's opponents are harnessing popular resentment over his
proposal to build a huge power-generating dam on the Indus River
that could flood hundreds of acres (hectares) of farm land in the
north and dry up irrigation water in the south.

Neo-Nazis march to commemorate 11th anniversary of Rudolf Hess
</HEADLINE>
death &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GREVE, Denmark (AP) _ Several dozen neo-Nazis marched peacefully
and gave outdoor speeches Saturday morning in this small Copenhagen
suburb.
	   Public disturbances occurred nonetheless as larger groups of
anti-Nazi protestors jostled with police at crowd-control barriers.
Police fired tear gas to break up some of those demonstrations. One
person was reported detained, and another slightly injured by tear
gas.
	   The neo-Nazis were commemorating the 11th anniversary of the
death of Rudolf Hess, the former deputy to Adolf Hitler, Germany's
leader in World War ll.
	   Hess died in Aug. 1987 at Berlin's Spandau prison, subsequently
demolished. Authorities said he committed suicide. Some family
members and supporters claim he was murdered.
	   Anniversary marches in Denmark, which was occupied by German
troops from 1940-45, usually arouse public emotions and provoke
social unrest. This year, petitions by neo-Nazis to hold a
commemorative march were rejected in Copenhagen and two other
municipalities.
	   A number of German neo-Nazis were detained at the border and
prevented from entering Denmark.
	   The march in Greve, located about 25 kilometers (16 miles)
southwest of Copenhagen, took place at 7 a.m. _ earlier than
protesters had anticipated.
	   About 150 neo-Nazis walked along empty streets the short
distance from the headquarters of the Denmark National Socialist
Movement to city hall, gave a few speeches, and walked back;
returning about 9 a.m.
	   A short while later, anti-Nazi demonstrators numbering about
1,000 gathered at several points near the political headquarters,
which was cordoned off by police. A few half-hearted attempts to
break through were dispersed by tear gas.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At 10:39:20 a.m., Friday, Aug. 7, the
University of Nairobi geology department detected a small tremor.
Eight seconds later it registered another, this one with a 3.4
magnitude. They were not earthquakes.
	   The first was the shock from a hand grenade, the second the
blast from a huge explosion. At virtually the same moment, 450
miles (725 kilometers) away, a single boom shattered the
tranquility of the port city of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.
	   It had been a gray and chilly Friday in Nairobi, 5,496 feet
(1,675 meters) above sea level and still gripped by the southern
hemisphere's winter. It was sunny and humid in Dar es Salaam. In
both cities, thousands of people were at work or in the streets,
shopping or running errands, and looking forward to the weekend.
	   Suddenly, windows shattered. Chunks of concrete and twisted
steel rained down. Nostrils burned with fire and smoke. Under the
debris, voices cried out.
	   And in the areas that took the brunt of the bombs, there was
silence. The silence of the dead.
	   In both cities, 257 people were dead; 5,500-plus were injured.
	   Moments earlier, about 10:35 a.m., Kenyan security guards at the
front of the U.S. Embassy had stopped five men in a truck at the
parking lot entrance. Go around the back, guard Joash Okindo told
them, to the rear parking lot.
	   Julius Koiyet, a preacher, was waiting to board a bus outside
the embassy when he heard a blast. A blowout, he thought. Then
people started running from the embassy.
	   He headed toward the back of the building and saw a yellow van
with four men in it driving into the parking lot. A man jumped from
the van and opened fire.
	   ``I thought it was a normal bank robbery,'' he said. ``The man
saw that I was not afraid, and he fired at me on the shoulder and I
fell down.''
	   The men in the van then threw a tin container a foot (30
centimeters) high toward the embassy. It exploded. Two more
cylinders followed, he said.
	   Okindo, the security guard, saw the attackers jump from the
truck and open fire with automatic rifles. They shot a guard and
hurled a grenade. At least one Marine returned fire.
	   At his desk on the third floor near the front of the embassy,
Kevin Richardson, 43, of Hackensack, New Jersey, heard an
explosion. He went to the window to take a look.
	   ``I just thought another demonstration was going on,'' said
Richardson, the embassy refugee officer. From the window, ``I could
see some of the Kenyan employees of the embassy who just happened
to be outside and they were running.''
	   At the six-story Ufundi Cooperative House next door, Sammy
Ng'ang'a, a 48-year-old scrap metal dealer, had dropped by to see a
friend. He heard a noise and saw people rush to windows facing the
embassy to see what was happening.
	   It was the natural thing to do, but it put a lot of people in
front of a lot of glass.
	   Then came ``a very, very loud explosion,'' Richardson said.
``The building started to shake and the lights went out and I hit
the floor.''
	   Richardson heard his assistant, Immy Rose Lassiter, shouting:
``Are you OK? Are you OK? What happened? What should we do?''
Richardson did what he learned in embassy bomb and fire drills _ he
locked his safe and left.
	   ``It was fairly dark,'' he said, ``so we had to feel our way
along the walls to get out.''
	   They made their way to the elevator. ``One elevator door was
shut,'' he said. ``The other had sprung open and you could see
lights and smoke coming out of the shaft.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell had just finished a press
conference with Kenyan Minister of Trade Joseph Kamotho and was in
his office on the 18th floor of the 22-story Cooperative Bank
building when she heard the explosion. For a moment, she thought it
must be from construction.
	   Next thing she knew, she said, ``I was sitting and had my hands
over my head, which was why I had cuts on my hand.''
	   Two floors below, a table propelled by the blast slammed into
John Mukuru. ``I saw some objects falling, falling. ... I heard
people screaming. ... Then I tried to get out of the office.''
	   All communication between the embassy and the outside world was
cut.
	   Hundreds of miles (kilometers) away in Dar es Salaam, Tanzanian
Ibrahim Pamba walked out of the U.S. Embassy and saw a blue tanker
truck maneuvering to turn on Laibon Road.
	   ``There was nothing suspicious,'' Pamba said. ``It was an
ordinary day.''
	   Minutes later, an explosion stopped embassy clocks at 10:39 a.m.
	   Acting Ambassador John Lange was in his office with eight other
people when the windows shattered, cutting several of them with
flying glass. At the guard house at the front gate, Valentine
Katunda of the Ultimate Security company was buried alive.
	   At Nairobi Hospital, the city's largest, administrator Mike
Sheldon was in his office when he heard an explosion.
	   ``We thought it was an earthquake, thought the roof in surgery
had caved in,'' he said. ``Then word got back that it was a bomb.
We went down to casualty to implement our major disaster plan.''
	   The blast interrupted a meeting 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the
embassy, in the office of Nairobi Provincial Police Chief Isaac
Muthuri. He rushed outside when he heard the blast.
	   ``I saw smoke and we realized there was something serious and we
rushed to the scene,'' he said.
	   Help was on the way, but people at the scene already were
helping one another.
	   Bernard Njoroge Mirangi, a 47-year-old railway laborer, had been
trying to cash a check on the ground floor of the Cooperative Bank
when he was hit in the head by a toppling beam. He got up, kicked
out a glass window and escaped. But he immediately went back inside
to help two women get out.
	   ``There was thick smoke outside and metal structures were
falling,'' he said. ``I carried one woman on my shoulders and held
the other by the hand.''
	   Inside the embassy, Richardson and Lassiter held hands as they
groped their way down a stairway.
	   ``There was a lot of smoke and other smells we couldn't
identify. Some of the emergency lights had come on. There was a
large amount of debris on the stairways,'' Richardson said. ``By
that time, there were people from other floors entering the
stairway, trying to get out of the building.''

	   At the Cooperative Bank, Mukuru also was trying to get down
stairs.
	   ``People got there and were stuck, with blood all over,'' he
said. ``I had blood all over. I was feeling that my head is not
there.''
	   Richardson and Lassiter emerged from the embassy and checked
each other to be sure they were OK.
	   ``Just like everybody else, we were all covered with dust and
smoke,'' Richardson said. ``Crowds were coming toward the embassy
from all over. ... I could see fire coming from the back of the
building and people running around, some quite injured.''
	   Ambassador Bushnell, her lower lip cut badly enough to need
stitches, doesn't know whether she lost consciousness when the
blast hit.
	   ``There was debris coming all over, and the clinking and the
clanging, and then all of a sudden it was silent.'' she said. ``My
first thought was, is the building going to collapse and aye, aye,
aye, we're on the 18th floor.''
	   With a colleague who was bleeding profusely, she made it to the
stairs and started walking.
	   ``As we went down the stairs, every door from hallway into
stairwell had been blown in. So, we were walking over doors. There
was blood everywhere. Now and again you would find a shoe. ... As
we got further and further down, there was much more smoke.
	   ``By the time we got probably to the third floor, second floor,
people were very pressed together. I have to say it was not a
stampede and it was not a panic. People were taking care of one
another. Everybody was bleeding ... and the bannister was wet with
blood.''
	   About 10:45 a.m., the first wave of casualties arrived at
Nairobi Hospital. ``There must have been at least 100,'' Sheldon
says.
	   Abraham Muthogo Kamau, a 28-year-old corporate analyst at the
Cooperative Bank, was among them, driven to the hospital by a
passer-by. He had glass cuts all over his body, shards embedded on
the left side of his head and in his left knee. His shirt, tie and
trousers were shreds.
	   He said an American doctor at the hospital was treating two
injured Americans, but not the Kenyan victims.
	   ``All he cared about was the Americans,'' Kamau said. ``It's not
fair. Human life is human life _ Kenyan life or American life. ...
It's changed my attitude towards Americans.''
	   Sheldon disputed the claim that Americans were favored by
doctors, explaining that medical personnel concentrated first on
the most seriously injured, among whom were two Americans.
	   About this time in Dar es Salaam, acting ambassador Lange
reached the U.S. Marine post.
	   ``Amazingly ... the phones were still working,'' he said, ``so I
quickly called the State Department Operations Center and told them
there was a huge explosion in the embassy.''
	   Bleeding from her head, embassy employee Laurel McMullen helped
another woman down the stairs. ``I remember immediately thinking,
`We have been bombed,''' she said.
	   Jim Owens, an American visiting the embassy, saw the guard house
was burning. Elizabeth Mary Slater, an embassy employee, saw ``just
twisted, contorted metal.''
	   Owens and McMullen both described popping noises.
	   ``The marines thought it was gunfire ... and kept shouting `Get
down, get down','' said Owens.
	   Later, they found out the noise was burning tires exploding. At
least 22 vehicles parked outside were destroyed.
	   Tanzanian police, embassy security, extra guards from Ultimate
Security all arrived on the scene. Dozens were there by the time
McMullen emerged from the building.
	   Employees waited for word from embassy security and then climbed
over the 6-foot- (1.8-meter-) high exterior wall of the compound
with the help of a ladder.
	   The wounded and ultimately the dead also passed over the wall.
Security company cars, police, civilian cars, public minibuses
known as Dala Dalas, helped carry wounded to hospital.
	   It was 11:30 a.m. when the first casualties began arriving at
state-owned Muhimbili hospital in Dar es Salaam. Katunda was the
only one of the four guards at the front entrance to survive.
	   Embassy staff in Nairobi, meanwhile, contacted the U.S. State
Department Operations Center to tell them about the explosion and
were told that they had just heard from the embassy in Dar es
Salaam about a similar blast.
	   Within an hour after the explosion in Nairobi, the crowd around
the embassy had grown to thousands.
	   ``Many people were trying to dig through rubble with their bare
hands, trying to help people trapped inside,'' Richardson said.
``There were just a whole lot of rescue people, embassy people and
others going floor by floor to check for people who could not get
out on their own.''
	   U.S. Marines, Kenyan police, soldiers and Red Cross workers
tried to control the crowds, pushing onlookers away so ambulances
and fire trucks could move freely.
	   Richardson went to the undamaged U.S. Agency for International
Development building, where he started compiling a list of staff
and employees to check who was missing.
	   About 1:30 p.m., at the request of the American Embassy, a
British army convoy of about 35 personnel arrived to help. They
found broken glass everywhere, tiles off roofs and about 10,000
Kenyans standing around watching. The adjacent Ufundi building was
a frenzy of people digging and pulling things out.
	   ``Total chaos really,'' recalled Capt. Rhyl Jones, commander of
the British contingent. ``Devastation and chaos. This was bigger
than anything I've seen.''
	   A half-dozen Marines were among about 20 Americans at the
embassy. Some British and American engineers and their teams were
digging, some were searching for a missing Marine.
	   ``A lot of them, I think, had been in the building when the bomb
went off and they were pretty well shocked,'' said Staff Sgt. Eddie
Elms. ``But I think they were more concerned about a second attack
on the building, and just putting up a cordon around the building
to ensure security.''

	   After putting men at the perimeter and checking the building to
make sure it wouldn't collapse, Jones sent others inside to check
for survivors. In the hours ahead, they found two survivors and 20
to 25 bodies.
	   About 3:30 p.m., Richardson went to the Nairobi city morgue.
``After showing my embassy badge, I was escorted to the only
criminal pathologist in Kenya, who was trying to organize what was
going on. And at the same time, he told me there were already 54
dead. Of course, the number went much higher. I was able to
identify one official American.
	   ``As it turned out, there were two other people associated with
the embassy who were there, although I was not immediately able to
recognize them. They were bringing in bodies in really bad shape.
After 20 minutes there ... I realized I was not as tough as I
thought I was, and so I left.''
	   All that afternoon, rescue work also proceeded in Dar es Salaam.
By 4:40 p.m., all the dead and wounded were evacuated from the
embassy there, spokesman Dudley Simms said.
	   That night, Richardson couldn't sleep. Instead, he went from
hospital to hospital, searching for the missing.
	   ``We really didn't find anybody,'' he said, ``because it was
just too chaotic at the hospital.''
	   Shortly after daybreak Saturday, Red Cross spokeswoman Nina
Galbe saw a flurry of activity at the bomb site in Nairobi.
	   ``I remember the sound of all these axes, metal against stone,
like a hacking, the clinking _ at the same time it was pitiful,''
Galbe said. ``It was pitiful because they could do so little. And
then there was an anger as well because there was no coordination
at all.''
	   ``Everyone was just tearing and pulling and pushing at this
stone monster that would not be tamed or broken,'' Galbe said.
	   The cranes were standing by idly, she said, because nobody knew
how to use them.
	   In the early morning hours before Galbe had arrived, rescuers
had reached a man lying on a table. They cut the table from
underneath, thinking it would then fall so they could pull him out.
	   ``Instead, what happened was, of course, that the rubble on top
of him fell down as well and he was crushed,'' Galbe said.
	   As the morning wore on, rescuers found another survivor. When
they called for a stretcher, hopes rose. Shortly afterward, they
called for a stethoscope. The man was dead.
	   ``These were two people who were alive, who with more
sophisticated tools might have been clearly saved,'' Galbe said.
	   Shortly after 2 p.m., an Israeli search-and-rescue team _ 181
men and women and eight sniffer dogs _ arrived and took charge.
They saw two cranes, a bulldozer and a backhoe standing by.
Soldiers, police officers and civilians were picking over the
rubble, many with their bare hands.
	   The Israelis used a bulldozer to clear debris blocking the path
behind the Ufundi building. They looked over the ruins and put the
cranes to work, digging into the rubble, calling for survivors.
	   Ng'ang'a, the scrap metal dealer, replied. So did Rose Wanjiku
Irungu, a 36-year-old employee of the Cooperative Bank.
	   About 10:30 p.m., the Israelis reached Ng'ang'a.
	   ``They are coming for you next,'' he called to Rose. He was
rushed to Nairobi Hospital with a broken leg and deep gashes on his
head.
	   In Uhuru (Freedom) Park, people streamed to a Red Cross center
to donate blood. Several preachers swayed and sang on a makeshift
platform in the park, joined by about 4,000 men, women and
children. Their songs ranged from the exultant to the mournful in
memory of those killed in the blast. Their shabby clothes marked
them as the urban poor.
	   At 3 p.m. Sunday, rescuers heard Rose speak. Their digging took
on a new urgency.
	   During the afternoon, a 62-member rescue squad from the United
States arrived with four search dogs. So did a 10-man French team
with two dogs. FBI and other U.S. investigators also began to
trickle in.
	   It was Tuesday afternoon when Charles Kamuti, 31, went to the
city morgue, looking for his younger brother, Lawrence, an
assistant pharmacist in the Cooperative Bank building. A friend
said Lawrence, 29, had run to the street after hearing the grenade.
	   And it was Tuesday afternoon when Rose's rescue seemed near. Two
search dogs veered toward a hole in the debris of the Ufundi
building, now shrunken by more than two-thirds, and barked
excitedly.
	   Shoulder to shoulder, Kenyans and Israelis used shovels,
pickaxes and their hands. Finally, they reached a body. It wasn't
Rose.
	   Shortly after noon on Wednesday, a bulldozer pried the
blackened, shredded wreckage of a vehicle off the Nairobi embassy
wall, where it had been plastered by the force of the blast. There
was speculation that it might have carried the explosives.
	   At about 2:30 p.m., the Israelis called for silence and dropped
a microphone deep into the ruins in hopes of picking up some sound
from Rose.
	   It was 3 a.m. Thursday by the time rescuers wearily removed the
last layers of debris from the one victim the world hoped might be
saved.
	   They slipped her broken body into a white plastic bag and drove
it to the morgue. Rose had died less than 24 hours before they
reached her, rescuers said.
	   Sniffer dogs made one last check at 10 a.m. Nothing. The Israeli
commander declared the search for survivors over.
	   It wasn't until about 3 p.m. Friday that the body of Kamuti's
brother was identified from fingerprints. But nine unidentified
bodies remained in cold storage at morgues and seven families have
filed reports with the Red Cross saying relatives are missing.
	   Today, dwarfed by the bombed U.S. Embassy and a blackened office
tower, a small, flower-covered pyramid of concrete rubble has
become a memorial to the dead and a magnet for the grief of a
nation.
	   Amid the bouquets of roses and colored ribbons, someone has
placed a hand-lettered sign summing up the sorrow that has
enveloped this deeply religious east African country. Written in
red ink, it says:
	   ``Cry Kenya''
	   ``Pray Kenya''
	   ``God Heal Kenya''
	   There is no memorial at the abandoned U.S. Embassy in Dar es
Salaam. Just rows of barbed wire and U.S. Marines with assault
rifles who keep curious onlookers away.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Scheduled to join NATO in April, Poland
wants to be the ``exporter of stability'' in central Europe,
President Aleksander Kwasniewski said Saturday at a Polish Army
80th anniversary ceremony.
	   Kwasniewski also said that joining NATO meant security for
Poland and presented no threat to its neighbors, in an obvious
attempt to dispel Russian concerns about NATO's expansion.
	   ``We extend a friendly hand to everyone, especially to our
eastern neighbors,'' Kwasniewski said during a ceremonial changing
of the guard at the downtown Tomb of The Unknown Soldier.
	   Poland wants to be the ``exporter of stability in our part of
Europe,'' Kwasniewski said to the crowd that included Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek.
	   Adjusting the former Warsaw Pact army to NATO standards is a
costly process, but seeking security alone would have been much
more expensive and ``full of risks,'' Kwasniewski said.
	   The ceremony and an earlier Mass celebrated by army chaplain
Slawoj Leszek Glodz were a part of observances remembering the
creation of Poland's army in 1918, following World War I.
	   Glodz said that NATO membership meant security for the nation's
independence and sovereignty at a time when the most important task
for the world is to secure peace, even by force, if necessary.
	   On Friday, a monument was unveiled in Warsaw to commemorate the
participation of American Poles in battles to restore and defend
Poland's independence between 1918 and 1920. The work of Andrzej
Pitynski, a Polish sculptor living in the United States, it was
financed by the Polish-American Congress.
	   In a another gesture to mark the army's anniversary and Poland's
future membership in NATO, Ensign Wojciech Pismenko voluntarily set
off on a 1,400 kilometer (868 mile) run from Warsaw to NATO
headquarters in Mons near Brussels, Belgium where he hopes to
arrive Sept. 6.
	   Hungary and the Czech Republic are also to join NATO next April.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested 300 opposition protesters during a
rally in Baku, the capital of the former Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan, Russian news agencies reported.
	   They also arrested 10 independent journalists, said National
Front leader Abulfaz Elcibey, a former president of Azerbaijan,
according to ITAR-Tass. A Radio Liberty reporter was arrested in
the city of Gadzha, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Interfax said Azerbaijani police blocked Elcibey's home for more
than an hour, trying to prevent him and other opposition activists
from attending the protests.
	   The National Front and Musavat opposition parties organized the
rallies to protest preparations for presidential elections
scheduled for Oct. 11. The opposition has said it will boycott the
vote because the country was undemocratic and the election would
likely be unfair.
	   ITAR-Tass said more than 20,000 people were attending a rally at
the Baku race track.
	   President Geidar Aliev, who is seeking re-election, has been
trying to improve his democratic credentials and recently issued a
decree abolishing most forms of censorship in the oil-rich country
of 7 million people on the Caspian Sea.
	   Aliev was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss. He came
to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993.

Tanned, sweating pope marks summer feast day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Looking tanned but tired during
his vacation break away from the Vatican, Pope John Paul II on
Saturday marked Italy's main summer holiday by remembering those
who are alone or must work while others have fun.
	   Taking advantage of the cooler early morning hours, the pontiff
led an 8 a.m. Mass in the courtyard of the palace in the lakeside
hills southeast of Rome where he has his vacation retreat.
	   Four hours later, he returned to the public eye to give the noon
Angelus prayer and blessing to pilgrims marking the Aug. 15 holy
day which Catholics believe marks the assumption of the Virgin Mary
into heaven. It is a national holiday in Italy and much of the rest
of Europe.
	   The 78-year-old pontiff appeared tired and uncomfortable in the
heat in the high 20s (80s F). His voice was weak and he wiped his
brow several times with a handkerchief as he said Mass under a
canvas awning.
	   After two weeks in the Alps in July, the pope was staying in
Castel Gandolfo through mid-September.
	   After wishing those on holiday a happy feast day, the pope
recalled those who cannot get away, especially the elderly, those
who live alone and ``those who in these days of vacation assure
essential services for the community.''
	   John Paul made no mention of the day being also the startup of
live video, via the Internet, of papal appearances, such as on
Sundays and holy days.
	   The debut was announced earlier in the week.
	   A link on the Vatican's Web site, www.vatican.va, was launching
the software.
	   Working out of the Internet Office behind the Vatican's walls,
church experts are also building a network that will let bishops
enter a password and download instructions and documents direct
from Rome and will give Vatican embassies around the world direct
access to the Vatican's computers.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
opened festivities marking the end of India's golden jubilee year,
hoping to ease tensions with Pakistan and with his political
allies.
	   From behind bulletproof glass, Vajpayee spoke to the nation from
the ramparts of the Red Fort of New Delhi, addressing concerns over
India's newly acquired nuclear capability and its tense relations
with Pakistan.
	   Vajpayee vowed India would never use nuclear weapons
aggressively, and it was ready for a pact with Pakistan that
neither would be the first to unleash them.
	   Vajpayee's address on India's 51st independence day brought to a
close a troubled jubilee year full of political upheaval, economic
difficulty and international opprobrium and sanctions for
conducting nuclear tests.
	   The prime minister defended his decision to go nuclear, and said
the world was gaining more appreciation for what India describes as
the security concerns that compelled it to develop a nuclear
deterrent.
	   ``The effect of economic sanctions is slackening gradually,'' he
said. ``We welcome this.''
	   Without naming Pakistan, Vajpayee said India was fighting a
proxy war against forces supported from across the border.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming Muslim militants
fighting a secessionist war in India-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan
says it is only providing moral and diplomatic support to the
militants.
	   On Friday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pledged to
continue supporting Kashmiri separatists as Pakistan celebrated its
own independence day. Violence in Kashmir would ``force India to
come to the negotiation table,'' Sharif said.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir, since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Earlier this month, the Indian and Pakistani armies engaged in
one of their heaviest peacetime artillery duels across their
disputed frontier in Kashmir, killing nearly 200 people on both
sides. The battles coincided with an abortive meeting between
Vajpayee and Sharif that ended in mutual recriminations.
	   On Saturday, Vajpayee said he wasn't disheartened by the
setback, and he was looking forward to the next meeting with Sharif
in a few weeks in South Africa.
	   ``I believe there is no dispute which cannot be resolved through
dialogue,'' he said, speaking in Hindi under a gray early morning
sky.
	   India and Pakistan raised the stakes of their 51-year-old
conflict when each conducted underground nuclear explosions last
May.
	   In Islamabad, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman on Saturday
denied an Indian diplomat and his three-year-old son had been
kidnapped in Islamabad by Pakistani intelligence agents.
	   A day earlier, India accused Pakistani officials of kidnapping
Ajay Gupta, an embassy official in Islamabad, and his son and
detaining them for an hour on Monday. Gupta was asked to become an
informer.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Lee Tien-lu, revered as a national
treasure for breathing new life into Taiwan's age-old puppet
theater, died on Friday at age 87, his family reported.
	   Lee passed away of heart and lung failure at his family home in
Sanchih, on Taiwan's northern tip, reports said.
	   Born during Japanese colonial rule, Lee chafed under the
governor's demands to inject pro-militarist propaganda into his
shows and was forced to abandon performances during the war years.
	   He later attracted large audiences in the television age by
mixing modern slang into the classical Taiwanese used in folk tales
acted out by wooden-headed cloth puppets and adding special effects
and dramatic acrobatic stunts.
	   ``Lee Tien-lu's life is the modern history of puppet theater. He
led, and the theater followed, bringing Taiwanese puppetry to the
world's attention,'' the United Daily News said in an obituary.
	   Lee served as director of his I Wan Ran puppet troupe until his
death, frequently performing abroad and appearing in Taiwanese
variety shows and in TV advertisements. Lee was honored by Taiwan,
France and the United States for his art.
	   With his two sons, he later established a pair of children's
troupes, the Wei Wan Ran and Chiao Wan Ran.
	   A physically slight man whose trademark was a French-style beret
cap, Lee was was the subject of director Hou Hsiao-hsien's
award-winning 1993 film, The Puppetmaster.
	   Brought by early immigrants from China's Fujian province, glove
puppetry, called ``Bo Dai Hei'' in Taiwanese, developed a distinct
character on the island and remains among the most popular of folk
arts.
	   Some 200 troupes stage public performances and a flashier
version of the theater draws a large audience on cable television.

	   LYTHAM, St. ANNES, England (AP) _ Brandie Burton made a
triple-bogey eight to lose her lead in the Women's British Open
Saturday while Se Ri Pak's bid to get into contention crumbled when
she bogeyed the first five holes.
	   Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago and
starting the third round ahead by one stroke, maintained her lead
until she ran into a storm of trouble at the par 5,535-yard
seventh.
	   She drove into the deep rough, chipped out onto the fairway and
her third landed in a bunker short of the green. Burton needed two
to get out of the bunker back onto the fairway, chipped onto the
green and finally two-putted.
	   Thatodie and American playing partner Leslie Spalding.
	   King collected four birdies in the first 11 holes to move up to
2-over and Moodie, two behind at the start, birdied the sixth.
Spalding, one off the lead at the start of the round, stumbled with
bogeys at the first and third but birdied five and seven.
	   Pak, a 20-year-old South Korean who has won four tournaments
including two majors in her rookie season on the U.S. Tour, began
the third round seven shots behind the leader and tied for 19th.
	   After rounds of 78 and 74 she had been showing signs of
improvement in her first tournament on a tricky British links
course. But, despite sunny and less windy conditions compared with
the first two days, she began to run up another huge score at the
par-72 Royal Lytham links.
	   After missing the green at the 197-yard par 3 first, her
six-foot putt for par lipped out and she collected a double bogey 6
at the second after twice hitting left into the long rough.
	   Pak drove too far left again at the third and wound up
three-putting and she needed three more on the green to get down at
the fourth.
	   Pak's drive at the 176-yard fifth was too short and she failed
to get down in two from off the green.

Portuguese ask for French and American help in Congo evacuation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Portuguese government has asked for
French and U.S. help to evacuate its citizens from Congo, as rebels
advance towards the capital Kinshasa, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The Portuguese evacuation plan relies on French military
transport planes already in the region and two U.S. warships
expected over the weekend, the daily Publico reported.
	   Military attaches from Portugal, Belgium, France and the United
States were to meet Sunday in Stuttgart, Germany, to coordinate the
plans, Publico said.
	   Some 180 Portuguese citizens and a further 250 dual nationals
remained in Kinshasa. About 400 other Portuguese nationals, mostly
women and children, have left the Congo since the war situation
sharpened at the beginning of the month, the paper said.
	   Portuguese Foreign Minister decided to activate the emergency
evacuation plan on Friday, after a TAP Air Portugal airliner was
unable to land in Kinshasa airport for security reasons.
	   Radio reports said the plane had been refused permission to
land.

Ukraine's central bank reports sharp fall in reserves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's foreign currency reserves fell
sharply this month after the government dipped into them to repay a
large foreign loan, the central bank chief said Saturday.
	   The central bank's reserves stand at dlrs 1.15 billion, down
from dlrs 1.49 billion on Aug. 1, National Bank chief Viktor
Yushchenko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The government had to use some of the reserves to pay off a dlrs
450 million loan to Japan's Nomura International bank on Wednesday,
Yushchenko said.
	   The central bank reserves were the only source of money for
Ukraine's financially struggling government.
	   The government initially planned to repay the loan with foreign
aid, but was unable to secure it because of foreign investors' lack
of confidence in Ukraine and other emerging markets.
	   Ukraine's reserves, which stood at dlrs 2.34 billion at the
beginning of 1998, have been steadily shrinking as the National
Bank tries to defend the national hryvna currency, which is under
constant pressure from foreign investors withdrawing their money
from the country.
	   The U.S. bond rating agency Moody's said last month it would
consider lowering its credit rating for Ukraine, because of growing
depletion of the national bank's reserves and the shaky situation
in the country's financial markets.
	   The agency expressed fear that Ukraine's reserves could run out
before the end of September if no foreign aid were received.
	   However, Yushchenko said the present level of reserves was ``a
few hundred million dollars'' above forecasts, and the government's
major task was to replenish them by negotiating new loans with the
International Monetary Fund and other foreign financial
institutions.
	   ``(Ukraine's) major debt payments for 1998 are now behind (us),
and we have to do everything possible to make foreign creditors
think positively of Ukraine's markets,'' Yushchenko said.
	   Ukraine is currently awaiting approval of a dlrs 2.5 billion
loan from the International Monetary Fund, which is scheduled to
consider it at the end of August.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ On a track where a good grid position
is vital, Mika Hakkinen gained the pole for the Hungarian Grand
Prix in Saturday's qualifying, leaving Michael Schumacher, his
closest rival in the battle for the Formula One championship, in
the second row.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate David Coulthard will also
start from the front row after clocking the second fastest time
Saturday. Schumacher was third in his Ferrari.
	   ``I am delighted,'' Hakkinen said after clinching his eighth
pole of the year.
	   ``Being in the pole is extremely important here,'' the Finn
said. ``This track is difficult, there is a lot of dust on the
inside and you can lose the grip of your tires.''
	   Overtaking is difficult on the tight, twisting Hungaroring and
Hakkinen will have a distinct advantage by starting from the pole
in Sunday's 77-lap race.
	   Hakkinen is seeking his third straight Grand Prix victory that
would pad his 16-point lead over Schumacher in the drivers'
standings. Each win is worth 10 points and there are five races
left in the season.
	   Schumacher, a German with two Formula One titles, is trying to
become the first Ferrari driver to win the championship since Jody
Scheckter in 1979.
	   ``In principle, I am quite happy with third place,'' Schumacher
said. ``I think I still have a realistic chance tomorrow.''
	   Hakkinen sped around the 3.9-kilometer (2.4-mile) circuit in his
silver McLaren to clock the fastest lap in one minute 16.973
seconds.
	   ``We did quite a few modifications on the car before the
qualification,'' Hakkinen said. ``We improved in one area, but not
in some others and I couldn't make a bigger margin.''
	   ``The wind changed in the last 10 minutes, it was very strong
and you could feel it in the car,'' he said.
	   Coulthard, a Briton who finished second to Hakkinen in the last
two races in Austria and Germany, was .158 seconds behind, while
Schumacher was .393 seconds off the pace.
	   ``I know it's difficult, but we are pretty close though,''
Schumacher said. ``I think we are well prepared for tomorrow.''
	   Schumacher was only fifth in the German Grand Prix two weeks ago
and spent the week after the race testing on Ferrari's home track
in Italy.
	   ``We did not expect to challenge for pole position today. I can
have a good race starting from third position. With the right
strategy we have a chance tomorrow and I believe we will make the
most of it,'' said Schumacher, who won this race in 1994 in a
Benetton.
	   Schumacher aborted his first run after being slowed down by the
Williams of Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was heading for the pit.
	   Coulthard said he lost some time by hitting the curb in his
third run.
	   ``I am a little bit disappointed and frustrated because the gap
with Mika is so small,'' Coulthard said.
	   Joining Schumacher in the second row was Damon Hill, the former
champion from Britain, 1.241 seconds behind in a Jordan. Hill won
here in 1993 and 1995.
	   Eddie Irvine of Ireland in the second Ferrari was fifth, while
reigning champion Jacques Villeneuve was sixth in a Williams.
	   ``Once qualifying got underway, we knew we couldn't beat McLaren
and somehow we couldn't beat Michael,'' said Villeneuve, who is
coming off his best season finish, third in Germany.
	   ``They (Ferrari) weren't very quick at the start of the weekend
and have since picked up speed,'' the Canadian said.
	   ``Tomorrow will be a race of attack and fighting, trying to get
on the podium,'' said Villeneuve, who won the Hungarian Grand Prix
last year.
	   Ricardo Rosset of Brazil failed to qualify in his Tyrrell after
being outside the 107-percent limit off the pole time. He was 6.167
seconds slower than Hakkinen.
	   Rosset missed the German race when he couldn't run in the
qualifying following a crash in practice. This is the third time
he's failed to qualify this season.

Taiwan's navy launches new patrol craft to protect shipping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS date of launch to Friday sted Thursday in 2nd graf

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's navy has launched a homemade
coastal patrol vessel designed to protect the island's sea lanes
and territorial claims in the South China Sea, the navy reported
Saturday.
	   The Hsinchiang, a 500 ton Chinchiang class vessel, was launched
Friday at the shipyard of builders China Shipbuilding Corp. in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung, a navy statement said.
	   The navy did not reveal the ship's armaments or other details,
but said its role would be to protect shipping to and from Taiwan,
as well as the disputed Spratly and Pratas islands in the South
China Sea.
	   ``Safeguarding transportation on the seas can be equated with
safeguarding national survival and development. This is the navy's
imperative,'' the navy quoted Vice Commander in Chief Yeh Shih-wen
saying at the christening ceremony.
	   Foreign trade accounts for about 70 percent of Taiwan's gross
national product, and a sea blockade is considered among the top
threats to the island. China, which claims Taiwan as a renegade
province, accentuated Taiwan's vulnerability in 1996, when it
disrupted shipping by lobbing missiles just outside the island's
main ports.
	   According to the statement, the Chinchiang class combines high
performance with low maintenance, and can operate with a much
smaller crew than similar ships _ an important feature for Taiwan's
manpower-strapped armed forces.
	   Along with the rest of the armed forces, Taiwan's navy is
undergoing a massive upgrade, allowing it to retire World War II
era Gearing class destroyers and other antiquated vessels.

Hundreds of thousands worship Virgin Mary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Over 400,000 pilgrims congregated
Saturday, Assumption Day, on Nicula monastery in Transylvania to
worship Virgin Mary _ a statue some faithful believe can work
miracles.
	   The Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic pilgrims arrived in cars
and by public transport in a nearby village, then walked three
kilometers (2 miles) to the hillside monastery. They attended the
church service, kneeling for hours in the open, private radio
station ProFM reported.
	   President Emil Constantinescu and Senate President Petre Roman
also were in attendance, saying they prayed for their country.
	   Every year, some 200,000 people worship Virgin Mary at Nicula,
368 kilometers (230 miles) northwest of Bucharest, the capital.
	   The annual pilgrimage started 300 years ago when, according to
legend, soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire saw for the first
time the statue crying.
	   Thousands of other Romanians celebrated Virgin Mary as the
patron saint of the sailors on what is also Navy Day.
	   Priests were throwing crosses adorned with flowers into rivers
and the sea in a gesture meant to ask for protection for ships,
their crew and passengers.

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Vowing to wage war on corruption,
Paraguay's president-elect Raul Cubas Grau was sworn in Saturday as
the first elected civilian to succeed another since the days of
dictatorship.
	   Cubas succeeded President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Paraguay's first
elected civilian president since the 1989 end of Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner 34-year military government.
	   Cubas declared he would wage a ``frontal assault against
poverty,'' and ``attack crime in all its forms,'' including trade
piracy and drug trafficking. He also vowed to integrate Paraguay
further into the global economy.
	   ``My commitment is with God and with the people of Paraguay,''
said Cubas, 54, taking the red, white and blue sash of Paraguay
upon his shoulders.
	   Amid loud applause in the National Congress, Cubas was ushered
into power in a ceremony witnessed by hundreds of invited guests,
including seven fellow Latin American presidents.
	   In his outgoing address, Wasmosy said he was proud of his place
in history as the first civilian elected in ``free and transparent
elections'' that helped consolidate Paraguayan democracy.
	   He said he regretted he was unable to fulfill promises to attack
a serious economic crisis and make this landlocked nation more
prosperous _ tasks he said he would leave ``to the next
government.''
	   The transfer of power came amid an economic and political crisis
in this South American nation of 5.6 million, where unemployment
hovers around 15 percent and industries are threatened.
	   The country is grappling with bitter political feuding and
corruption that Cubas says has siphoned off dlrs 2 billion since
1996.
	   ``The priority of my government will be a frontal assault
against corruption,'' Cubas has said.
	   Cubas easily won a May 10 election to extend the long-ruling
Colorado Party's dominance in this nation bordering Brazil,
Argentina and Bolivia.
	   The Colorados have ruled Paraguay since 1947, through both
dictatorship and democracy.
	   An engineer by training, Cubas, 54, served briefly as economics
minister under Wasmosy.
	   Originally the vice presidential nominee, Cubas became the
presidential candidate after Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, the winner of
a September 1997 primary, was imprisoned in the middle of the
campaign.
	   Cubas went on to handily defeat one of Paraguay's top opposition
figures, Domingo Laino of the Democratic Alliance.
	   Aides say Cubas will try to combat Paraguay's deep economic
problems by cost-cutting in government and helping impoverished
rural peasants.
	   About 300,000 peasants lack land for cultivation in a country
where farming and livestock dominate. The weather phenomenon El
Nino has also been blamed for flooding and heavy damage to cotton.
	   Additionally, some 40,000 jobs have been lost since 1996 in key
areas of manufacturing, textiles, and woodworking.
	   Cubas also must address infighting within his own party.
Acrimony is so strong that the inaugural ceremony was scripted so
that Wasmosy _ a rival _ would not place the presidential sash
directly on Cubas' shoulders.

Saturday started celebrations marking the 750th anniversary of the
laying of the foundation stone of its famed Gothic cathedral with a
Pontifical Mass attended by 10,000 people.
	   Among the dignitaries attending the mass were Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, North-Rhine Westphalia state Governor Wolfgang Clement, and
former Soviet state and party chief Michael Gorbachev.
	   Papal legate Angelo Soda was joined by Cologne Archbishop,
Cardinal Joachim Meisner, to celebrate the mass.
	   Sodan greeted the guests and 30 cardinals and bishops from
around the world in the name of Pope John Paul II in the beautiful,
domed cathedral, which has a 157 meters (515 foot) high main
steeple making it Cologne's most famous landmark.
	   About 4,000 people crowded into the cathedral for the mass, with
another 6,000 standing in the large square in front of the building
watching the ceremony projected by video on a huge screen.
	   With its installation completed at the end of June, music for
the mass was played on the cathedral's new 3,956-pipe organ, that
according to cathedral officials cost 2.7 million marks (dlrs 1.5
million).
	   It replaced the cathedral's original organ that was destroyed on
the night of June 29, 1943 during an allied bombing attack in World
War II and a provisional organ installed in 1948.
	   The first foundation stone for the cathedral was laid in a
ceremony led by Archbishop Konrad von Hochstaden on Aug. 15, 1248.
	   The Cologne arch-diocese has also organized a pilgrimage for
Roman Catholics to the cathedral that started on Aug. 8 and ends on
Aug. 23.
	   About 5,000 pilgrims a day have been visiting the cathedral and
about 6.5 million tourists visit it annually, according to a
cathedral spokesman Rolf Breitenbruch.
	   While the first foundation stone for the cathedral was laid 750
years ago, work on Cologne's so-called ``perpetual construction
site,'' stopped on the unfinished building in 1560, and was not
resumed until 1842. Construction was declared completed in 1880.
	   Damage from the World War II also took its toll, and repair work
lasted through 1956. Constant improvements and upkeep continues at
a cost of up to 14 million marks (dlrs 7.8 million) annually,
Breitenbruch said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Julio Franco drove in the tying run on Saturday to
help lift the Pacific League's last place Chiba Lotte Marines past
the Kintetsu Buffaloes 2-1 at the Osaka Dome.
	   Makoto Kosaka drove in the winning run in the fifth inning with
a single to hand Kintetsu its fourth straight loss.
	   Franco, a designated hitter, formerly played for the Milwaukee
Brewers.
	   Rob Mattson, a former Mexican League player, went the distance
but took the loss for Kintetsu to drop to a record of 5-3.
	   Fukuoka Daiei Hawks hitter Koichiro Yoshinaga belted a three-run
homer and drove in another run to power the Hawks past the
league-leading Nippon Ham Fighters 8-2.
	   Hawks hurler Kazuhiro Takeda picked up the win.
	   Both of Nippon Ham's runs came from Nigel Wilson homers. Wilson,
who formerly played for the Cleveland Indians, leads the league in
home runs with 26.
	   In the Central League, Kazuhiro Kiyohara drove out a solo homer
in the bottom of the ninth inning to lift the Yomiuri Giants to a
5-4 victory over the last-place Hanshin Tigers in the Tokyo Dome.
	   It was the 11th straight loss for the hapless Tigers.
	   At Jingu stadium in Tokyo, Atsuya Furuta and Kota Soejima each
drove in a run in the bottom of the first inning to give the Yakult
Swallow a 3-2 lead that they never lost over the Central
League-leading Yokohama BayStars.
	   Yakult hurler Kazuhisa Ishii struggled with his control, giving
up three walks and two runs, before settling down to claim his
ninth win of the year.
	   In the Nagoya Dome, Hiroshima Carp hitters drove in four runs in
a six-hit second inning on their way to a 4-2 victory over the
Chunichi Dragons.
	   Hiroshima starter Yasuyuki Yamauchi gave up five hits in seven
innings on the mound for the win. Shigeo Tamaki struck out three in
two innings of relief for his second save of the year.
	   A game between the Seibu Lions Orix BlueWave in Saitama
Prefecture was called off due to rain.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Using tanks and aircraft, government
forces launched a strong, coordinated attack early Saturday against
a string of Kosovo villages apparently controlled by separatist
guerrillas, an ethnic Albanian source said.
	   The attack in western Kosovo came two days after ethnic Albanian
pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a negotiating team for
talks with the government on the future of the embattled southern
Serbian province.
	   Rugova said Friday all military operations carried out by the
government must stop before negotiations can begin. The new
offensive appeared to rule out talks for a settlement of the
conflict any time soon.
	   Nevertheless, the government in Belgrade invited Rugova's party
to start negotiations as early as next week.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported that government forces
deployed at strategic positions and at 6 a.m. opened fire on the
villages of Loka, Rausic, Krusevac, Istinic, Streoc, Papracane and
others, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina near the
Albanian border.
	   All were believed to be under the control of the underground
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attack, the ethnic Albanian
source said.
	   It also alleged that the assault began with jets dropping one
bomb on each village. The report could not be verified
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center also said that
grenade fire from two nearby military facilities followed, and in
two hours a total of 200 hundred grenades hit the village of Loka.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Some fighting was also reported early Saturday further to the
south, where a total of five civilians died.
	   Ratko Markovic, the head of the government's negotiating team,
sent a message to Fehmi Agani, a top Rugova aide, proposing that
talks between the two delegations should begin ``as soon as next
week.''
	   On Thursday, Rugova raised hopes that a political solution was
in sight, when he announced a delegation to begin talks with the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But the KLA, who demand independence, accused Rugova Friday of
``forgetting ... those who are ... spilling blood,'' meaning
themselves. They said Rugova's ``illegal'' team could not reach any
binding agreement ``without the presence of KLA representatives.''
	   A decision by a prominent Albanian opposition politician to lead
the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army has widened the
split between the rebel organization and Rugova, the longtime
ethnic Albanian leader.
	   Adem Demaci, Rugova's chief rival, announced his acceptance
Friday after Rugova failed to persuade the KLA to join his team. By
doing so, Demaci in effect established himself as an alternative
leader of the province's majority Albanian community.
	   Rugova is supported by the U.S. and other international leaders,
who view him as the best choice to bring the bloody conflict
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to an end.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia whose population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett broke his
second personal record _ distance traveled in a balloon _ as his
round-the-world quest continued Saturday without sign of slowing
down.
	   Shortly before 1200 GMT, the Chicago financier was traveling
southeast over the Indian Ocean, about 365 miles (590 kilometers)
west of Australia, in his bid to become the first person to fly
nonstop around the globe in a balloon. Solo Spirit lifted off Aug.
7 from Mendoza, Argentina.
	   His ground crew at Washington University in St. Louis burst into
applause two hours earlier upon learning that he had traveled
10,480 miles (16,865 kilometers), breaking his own world distance
ballooning record of 10,360 miles (16,672 kilometers), set in
January 1997.
	   Fossett on Friday had been aloft seven days, surpassing his
personal duration record of six days, two hours, 44 minutes, also
set in 1997. That trip ended when Fossett landed in India after
running short of fuel while waiting for clearance to fly over
Libya.
	   Fossett still has more to go before breaking the longest-lasting
flight ever. That record, of nine days, 17 hours and 55 minutes,
was set in January by Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard and his crew.
Piccard's round-the-world bid was abandoned when China balked at
allowing him into its airspace.
	   Fossett was flying southeast at 28,000 feet (8,534 meters) and
expected to reach the Australian coast at Geraldton, a few hundred
miles (kilometers) north of Perth, on Saturday or Sunday.
	   Alan Blount, director of mission control, said once Solo Spirit
is over Australia, the balloon will decrease altitude to try to
preserve Fossett's supply of oxygen. Fossett has to wear to an
oxygen mask at high altitudes because the cabin is unpressurized.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Chris Webber of the Sacramento
Kings was fined dlrs 500 for carrying a small amount of marijuana
that was detected by dogs at the airport, customs officials said
Sunday.
	   Webber had 11 grams of marijuana in his luggage when he was
detained Saturday during a layover in San Juan. He then resumed his
trip from the Dominican Republic to Barbados.
	   Webber was traveling with Jerry Stackhouse of the Detroit
Pistons and other athletes on a trip sponsored by the sporting
goods company Fila.
	   The customs department said that because of the small amount of
marijuana involved Webber was not cited for smuggling and would not
be prosecuted for possession.
	   A customs dog on a routine inspection in the transit lounge at
Luis Munoz Martin International Airport sniffed a carry-on bag that
was tagged as belonging to Stackhouse, customs said. Stackhouse
denied the bag was his, and Webber admitted it belonged to him.
	   This is the latest in a series of legal problems for Webber, who
was unwillingly traded in May from the Washington Wizards to
Sacramento and reportedly was looking for another switch. The trade
was prompted in part by his off-court turmoil.
	   Webber is awaiting trial for a January arrest that stemmed from
a traffic stop on his way to practice with the Wizards in Maryland.
He faces charges of marijuana possession, second-degree assault and
resisting arrest.
	   In May, a grand jury declined to prosecute Webber on a complaint
filed by a woman who said she was sexually assaulted at a party in
Maryland in April. Webber's lawyer said he left the party before
the alleged attack.
	   The NBA and its players are in the midst of a lockout, and
contact between players and teams is prohibited.
	   Only heroin and cocaine are covered in the drug agreement
between the NBA and the union. The league would like to add
provisions dealing with marijuana and alcohol abuse.
	   Union director Billy Hunter said last week the sides were near
an accord that would add marijuana to the list of banned
substances.

U.S. scales down manpower in next week's NATO exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The United States has withdrawn two
warships, sharply reducing the number of Marine forces
participating in NATO maneuvers starting next week in Albania, U.S.
and Albanian officials said.
	   Originally, about 1,000 Marines were to take part in the
weeklong Albanian military exercise, including the amphibious
warfare ships USS Saipan, USS Austin and USS Tortuga.
	   The USS Saipan and USS Tortuga have been diverted toward Congo
because of the unrest there. That leaves USS Austin for the
Albanian exercise, with about 275 Marines, according to Lt. Col.
Stephen Cambell, a spokesman for the Pentagon.
	   The number of U.S. forces participating in the NATO maneuvers
has been reduced ``because of operational requirements, not because
of the situation on the ground in Albania,'' Campbell said Friday.
	   The war games are in part designed to show neighboring
Yugoslavia that the Western military alliance can respond
forcefully to the crisis in Kosovo province.

Outlawed leftist group claims credit for Istanbul bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A leftist urban guerrilla group has
claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on a police bus which
injured four people.
	   The blast Friday ripped through the bus, which was parked near a
university.
	   A statement faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Istanbul
Saturday from the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front
said the attack was launched in retaliation for the disappearance
of four of its members apparently while in police custody.
	   The Turkish daily Yeni Yuzyil Saturday said shortly after the
attack the group called the paper and made them listen to a tape
recording claiming credit.
	   Turkey's Independent Human Rights Association claims more than
800 people disappeared, most of them after detention by security
forces.
	   The Marxist group is considered the successor to Dev
Sol-Revolutionary Left, a rebel group which claimed responsibility
for the killings of active and retired generals, police, secret
service agents, government officials and foreigners, including
several Americans, over the last few years
	   Dev Sol was splintered by internal fight and apparently
devastated by arrests. Its leadership was believed to have fled
abroad and formed the new group.

aircraft, launched a strong, coordinated attack early Saturday
against a string of Kosovo villages apparently controlled by
separatist guerrillas, an ethnic Albanian source said.
	   The attack in western Kosovo came two days after ethnic Albanian
pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a negotiating team for
talks with the government on the future of the embattled southern
Serbian province.
	   Rugova said Friday all military operations carried out by the
government must stop before negotiations can begin. The new
offensive appeared to rule out talks for a settlement of the
conflict any time soon.
	   Nevertheless, the government in Belgrade invited Rugova's party
to start negotiations as early as next week.
	   A statement released by the Democratic League of Kosovo,
Rugova's party, said hopes by foreign powers that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, after formation of a negotiating
team, would ``start to act seriously, once again turned out to be
futile.'' formation of negotiating team by Ibrahim Rugova, would
start to act seriously, once again turned out futile,'' the
statement said.
	   ``Milosevic continued with attacks even stronger than before,''
said the statement, reiterating calls on the United Nations, NATO,
the European Union and the United States to intervene to stop the
government attacks.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported that government forces
deployed at strategic positions and at 6 a.m. opened fire on
villages Logja, Rausic, Krusevac, Istinic, Streoc, Papracane and
some others, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina near
the Albanian border.
	   All were believed to be under the control of the underground
Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence of Kosovo.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attack, the ethnic Albanian
source said. It also alleged that the assault began with jets
dropping one bomb on each village.
	   Later, the Kosovo Information Center said that Serb shelling
stoppedsome time after noon in the Decani area.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center also said that
grenade fire from two nearby military facilities followed, and in
two hours a total of 200 hundred grenades hit the village of Loka.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Also in Pristina, the Serbian Media Center reported that early
Saturday a group of ``extremists'' attacked Serbian police forces
securing the Decani-Pec road. The road runs close to the area of
fighting. In a counterattack, police forces reportedly pushed the
rebels into nearby forests.
	   Serbian Interior Ministry officials in Pristina meanwhile showed
reporters and photographers what they said were weapons and
documents seized from rebels after recent battles, including
Chinese anti-tank mines, German uniforms and American helmets.
	   Some fighting was also reported early Saturday further to the
south, where a total of five civilians died.

Russia says it would retaliate if Taliban crosses border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia would retaliate if the Taliban Islamic army
crossed the border from Afghanistan into former Soviet republics in
Central Asia, a presidential representative said Saturday.
	   ``Russia will retaliate with all the might it has,'' said Ivan
Rybkin, who is President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to the Commonwealth
of Independent States, a loose grouping of former Soviet republics.
	   Rybkin said on Ekho Moskvy radio that the Russian Foreign
Ministry is in touch with both the Taliban and the opposition
Northern Alliance who are fighting for control of northern
Afghanistan.
	   Russia fears that if the Taliban gains control of the final 15
percent of Afghanistan and entrenches its fundamentalist Islamic
government throughout the country, there will be an influx of
refugees and weapons into the former Soviet Union.
	   Russia has troops stationed in Tajikistan to guard its border
with Afghanistan.

Despite disaster, Kenya copes with need for untainted blood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In the awful aftermath of the U.S. embassy
bombing, Kenyans learned some things about themselves that perhaps
only a disaster of such magnitude could have revealed.
	   Rushing fellow citizens to hospital and desperately tearing into
the rubble to free those trapped beneath, they transcended the
tribal and ethnic differences that politicians claim divide Kenya.
	   And despite a high rate of AIDS and hepatitis, they ran an
efficient blood collection and screening operation to provide
untainted blood for the hundreds of injured.
	   Blood is routinely screened in Nairobi's 12 hospitals, and
despite the pressure of the emergency, safeguards were respected.
	   The initial calls for blood came on the day of the Aug. 7 blast
and the next day.
	   ``Most hospitals seemed to have enough blood to begin with,''
said Duncan Ochieng, a lab technician at the African Medical and
Research Foundation, which coordinated the emergency blood donation
program.
	   He said the problem wasn't finding blood, it was finding type
O-negative, which can be given to anyone, no matter what their
blood type. O-negative is very rare in Kenya, Ochieng said.
	   When the call went out for donations, hundreds answered, among
them young people who streamed into Uhuru Park, lay down mats,
stretched out their arms and clenched their fists.
	   ``This is a very large blood problem. We haven't been through
something before of this magnitude,'' said Susan Deverell of the
Kenyan Red Cross.
	   An official at the blood bank of the National Public Health
Laboratories said he was impressed by how little of the blood was
rejected for infection.
	   He said less than 10 percent of the emergency donations were
discarded, compared with 50 percent of ordinary, day-to-day
donations.
	   Ochieng of the AMREF lab said most hospital blood banks called
on regular donors, healthy people whose blood had been previously
typed and tested.
	   But no matter what the source, all donations were tested for the
viruses that cause AIDS, hepatitis and syphilis.
	   A 1997 U.N. report says 7.4 percent of people from 15 to 49 in
sub-Saharan Africa are thought to be infected with the AIDS virus.
Some researchers put the figure as high as 20 percent among Kenyan
males in that age range.
	   Deverell said the response to the blood appeal was
``fantastic.'' It was so good, in fact, that the Health Ministry
finally asked people to stop giving blood.
	   Blood has a shelf life of only 35 days and Deverell said some
hospital blood banks were short of money for testing materials and
storage refrigerators. Local and international donors pitched in to
help, she said.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Flood raged in northeastern China on Saturday, as
swollen rivers in Heilongjiang province crushed levees and
threatened a major industrial city with its worst disaster in
almost 50 years.
	   No casualties were reported from the collapse of a second dike
near the Heilongjiang city of Daqing, China's largest oilfield,
which forced the evacuation of some 3,850 people, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Heavy rains were expected to bring the worst floods since 1949
to the provincial capital, Harbin, Xinhua said, with a flood crest
expected next Friday that might exceed danger levels by 2.2 meters
(7 feet).
	   President Jiang Zemin urged the nation to rally behind the
battle against summer floods that have affected one-fifth of the
Chinese population, killing more than 2,000 people and leaving
millions homeless.
	   Rains brought by a seasonal front that stretches across China
have caused floods and landslides in many areas. Xinhua reported
that flooding had begun along the lower reaches of the Yellow
River, and that a flood crest would sweep through the eastern
coastal province of Shandong.
	   The Yellow River, which runs across north-central China, has
been the source of particularly disastrous floods that have killed
hundreds of thousands of people over the centuries.
	   Jiang, who traveled earlier this week to flooded areas along the
Yangtze River, further to the south, warned that after more than
six weeks of flooding there, the disaster was reaching a ``crucial
stage.''
	   With millions stranded on sweltering dikes along the raging
Yangtze River, with minimal shelter, clean water or food, relief
workers had to ensure social order and guard against the spread of
diseases, Xinhua quoted Jiang as saying.
	   The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued an urgent order
Saturday warning that with the health of millions at risk, more had
to be done to prevent epidemics.
	   ``Historical experience tells us that major disasters often lead
to epidemics,'' said the order carried by Xinhua. It urged health
workers to raise awareness about disease prevention and to improve
sanitation, purify more drinking water and exterminate
disease-carrying pests.
	   Government officials insist that so far, apart from a few
outbreaks of infectious diseases, no epidemics have occurred in
flooded areas.
	   Thousands of medical teams are handing out food, water
purification tablets and medical supplies, but shortages of funds
are delaying relief efforts, according to the Red Cross.
	   The Red Cross also warned that the floods threaten efforts to
control snail fever in some areas and said outbreaks of this
tropical disease may increase.
	   Meanwhile, state radio reported that Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress and former premier, had traveled to
Heilongjiang, which borders Russia, to observe the flood fight
along the Nen and Songhua rivers.
	   At Daqing, which produced about half of China's oil last year,
355 of the oil field's 20,000 wells were waterlogged due to
flooding, it reported. Soldiers and residents had abandoned efforts
to repair dikes that burst on Friday and Saturday and were
concentrating on shoring up other levees protecting the oilfield.

Report: South Africa farm attacks motivated by robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Attacks on white farmers are
increasing, but robbery _ not racism _ was the motive for 99
percent of the attacks investigated, top government security
officials said Saturday.
	   ``No evidence is available to suggest that any sinister forces
are responsible for the attacks,'' said a police and intelligence
report released by Safety and Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi.
	   Some attacks have been particularly brutal. One white farmer
choked to death this year after the black assailants stuffed his
mouth with grain and gagged him.
	   The report expressed doubt the brutality is aimed at
intimidating farmers to leave their land.
	   ``Some killers may be psychopaths or schizophrenics. Killing a
person is a brutal act in itself. The team does not think anything
can be read into the brutality of the murders,'' the report said.
	   The report investigated 305 attacks reported between January and
May in which 53 people were killed and 192 were injured.
	   The report comes about six months after a similar one released
by the government in January which also singled out crime as the
most likely motive for farm attacks.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian soccer legend Pele has become
a grandfather for the first time.
	   The ex-soccer player's daughter, Sandra Regina Machado do
Nascimento Felinto, 33, on Friday gave birth to a son called
Octavio in a hospital in this city.
	   She was accompanied by her husband of one and a half years, a
record label director.
	   Pele discovered his first grandson was born when informed by
reporters in Brasilia, 540 miles (870 kms) northwest of Sao Paulo.
	   ``It's been born?'' he asked. ``That's great, I did not know.
I'm going to pray the child has a healthy and happy life.''
	   Pele refused to recognize Sandra as his daughter until she won a
court victory to establish her birthright in 1996.
	   But the ruling has not brought them closer, she said in a
Brazilian magazine article published this month.

Bosnian Serb refugees return to devastated Mostar suburb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Some 100 Bosnian Serbs
returned Saturday to their devastated village of Bacevici, a few
kilometers (miles) south of Mostar.
	   The Serbs fled from Bacevici when the war started in 1992. The
village was subsequently destroyed in heavy fighting that raged
across southern Bosnia.
	   Saturday's return was part of a program under which several
hundred Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim refugees have returned to
their pre-war homes in the Mostar region. More returns wer planned
in coming weeks.
	   ``The first impressions are encouraging,'' said Vujadin
Berberovic, one of the Serb returnees.``People are willing to
remain here, to clean up this place, to reconstruct it and live a
normal life again.''
	   Until basic infrastructure in Bacevici is rebuilt, local
authorities and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees will be
providing the returnees with immediate help, including sheltering
materials and drinking water.
	   International agencies are trying to speed up the return of
refugees to Bosnia, considering it a crucial part of the
implementation of the Dayton peace accord.
	   According to the latest UNHCR figures, some 500,000 people _
refugees from across the Europe and from within Bosnia _ have
returned to their pre-war homes.
	   But more than one million remain displaced, and officials hope
the return will be speeded up further this year.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In the awful aftermath of the U.S. embassy
bombing, Kenyans learned some things about themselves that perhaps
only a disaster of such magnitude could have revealed.
	   Rushing fellow citizens to hospital and desperately tearing into

 &UR; Neo-Nazis march to commemorate 11th anniversary of Rudolf Hess
death &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GREVE, Denmark (AP) _ Neo-Nazis rescheduled a demonstration to
early morning Saturday to avoid controversy, but the activity
provoked public outrage all the same and police ended up quelling
disturbances with tear gas and detentions in this small suburb of
Copenhagen.
	   ``It is a disgrace. We were in a legally notified (approved)
demonstration, and then the police throw tear gas at us,'' said
Leon Petersen, a former inmate of Dachau concentration camp during
World War ll.
	   Police said 31 anti-Nazi protesters were detained, most for
possession of homemade weapons like sling shots and clubs. About 20
neo-Nazis also were detained briefly, some for possession of
ille3gal weapons, but then released.
	   One person was reported slightly injured by tear gas.
	   The neo-Nazis were commemorating the 11th anniversary of the
death of Rudolf Hess, the former deputy to Adolf Hitler.
	   Hess died in Aug. 1987 at Berlin's Spandau prison, subsequently
demolished. Authorities said he committed suicide. Some family
members and supporters claim he was murdered.
	   Anniversary marches in Denmark, which was occupied by German
troops from 1940-45, usually arouse public emotions and provoke
social unrest. This week, petitions by neo-Nazis to hold a
commemorative march were rejected in Copenhagen and two other
municipalities.
	   A number of German neo-Nazis were detained at the border and
prevented from entering Denmark.
	   The march in Greve, located about 25 kilometers (16 miles)
southwest of Copenhagen, took place at 7 a.m. ``We hadn't
anticipated the Nazis to march so early,'' police inspector
Flemming Steen Munch said.
	   About 150 neo-Nazis walked along empty streets the short
distance from the headquarters of the Denmark National Socialist
Movement to city hall, gave a few speeches, and walked back;
returning about 9 a.m.
	   A short while later, anti-Nazi demonstrators numbering about
1,000 gathered at several points near the political headquarters,
which was cordoned off by police. When some 150 demonstrators
attempted to pass police barriers throwing rocks and bottles, they
were repelled by tear gas.
	   Jonni Hansen, leader of the neo-Nazis, called Hess ``the great
victim of democracy,'' and added, ``by marching so early we have
now played games with Danish bourgeois.''
	   As the tear gas dissipitated in the late morning summer breeze,
bystander Axel Nielsen said, wiping tears from his eyes, ``You
would think it was us who were the Nazis the way police treat us.''

Suspected killer of media tycoon arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Police arrested Saturday a Kosovo
Albanian suspected of killing Hungary's biggest media tycoon, the
state news agency MTI reported.
	   Njazi Aqifi, 28, gave turned himself in voluntarily, crossing
the Yugoslav-Hungarian border at Roeszke, 200 kilometers (120
miles) southeast of Budapest, where he was immediately detained by
border guards.
	   ``I'm not guilty, and I trust I will be able to clear myself,
that's why I go to Hungary,'' he told journalists still on the
Yugoslav side of the border.
	   Aqifi, using a Yugoslav-made rifle, is suspected to have shot in
the head 20 times media czar Janos Fenyoe, 43, an
American-Hungarian citizen, at a busy crossing in Budapest on
February 11.
	   An arrest warrant was issued against Aqifi on March 31.
According to Hungarian police, he was a hired killer.
	   ``My client claims to be innocent and hopes he can prove it and
will soon be released,'' Aqifi's lawyer, Gabor Kamaras, told MTI.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Using tanks and aircraft, government
forces launched a strong, coordinated attack early Saturday against
a string of Kosovo villages apparently controlled by separatist
guerrillas, an ethnic Albanian source said.
	   The attack in western Kosovo came two days after ethnic Albanian
pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a negotiating team for
talks with the government on the future of the embattled southern
Serbian province.
	   Rugova said Friday all military operations carried out by the
government must stop before negotiations can begin. The new
offensive appeared to rule out talks for a settlement of the
conflict any time soon.
	   A statement released by Rugova's party, the Democratic League of
Kosovo, said hopes by foreign powers that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic would ``start to act seriously, once again
turned out to be futile.''
	   It reiterated calls on the United Nations, NATO, the European
Union and the United States to intervene to stop the government
attacks.
	   The government in Belgrade invited Rugova's party to start
negotiations as early as next week.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported that government forces
deployed at strategic positions and at 6 a.m. opened fire on the
villages of Logja, Rausic, Krusevac, Istinic, Streoc, Papracane and
others, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina near the
Albanian border.
	   All were believed to be under the control of the underground
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attack, the ethnic Albanian
source said.
	   It also alleged that the assault began with jets dropping one
bomb on each village. The report could not be verified
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center also said that
grenade fire from two nearby military facilities followed, and in
two hours a total of 200 hundred grenades hit the village of Logja.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Some fighting was also reported early Saturday further to the
south, where a total of five civilians died.
	   Also in Pristina, the Serbian Media Center reported that early
Saturday a group of ``extremists'' attacked Serbian police forces
securing the Decani-Pec road. The road runs close to the area of
fighting. They said police forces pushed the rebels into nearby
forests in a counterattack.
	   Serbian Interior Ministry officials in Pristina meanwhile showed
reporters and photographers what they said were weapons and
documents seized from rebels after recent battles, including
Chinese anti-tank mines, German uniforms and American helmets.
	   Some fighting was also reported early Saturday further to the
south, where a total of five civilians died.

	   AL-MUNTHERIYA, Iraq (AP) _ Carrying red plastic roses, about 750
Iranian pilgrims entered Iraq here Saturday, crossing the border
for the first time since the two states declared war on each other
18 years ago.
	   Some 300 Iraqi men, women and children waved flags and clapped
rhythmically in an officially-orchestrated welcome.
	   One of the Iraqis could not clap. Former soldier Al-Sayed Taha
had lost his left arm in a battle with the Iranians near the end of
the 1980-88 war.
	   But he stood smiling as the Iranians walked across the border
and exchanged the traditional greeting of ``Peace be upon you.''
	   ``The war is behind our backs now,'' Taha said, his Arab cloak
covering his missing arm.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians used to visit Iraq each year
until the war began. In July, the two countries agreed to allow
12,000 Iranians a month to visit Iraq's shrines.
	   The pilgrims must travel by road because U.N. sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban air travel to and from
the country.
	   To receive the pilgrims, Iraq has rebuilt Al-Muntheriya border
post which had been destroyed in the war. By Saturday's ceremony
workers had barely finished a towering portrait of President Saddam
Hussein kneeling in Islamic prayer.
	   Iraq hopes the visitors, who by tradition deliver gifts to the
shrines, will bring in much needed foreign currency. Pilgrimage
tourism is one of few forms of international trade that Iraq is
allowed under the sanctions.
	   Iran, for its part, wants its people to have access to the
Shiite Muslim shrines in Karbala, Najaf, Samara and Baghdad.
Shiites regard these mosques as second only to those in Saudi
Arabia in terms of holiness.
	   But mistrust lingers after a war in which more than a million
people were killed and wounded, and where the return of prisoners
has still not been settled.
	   It took Iran and Iraq nine months to negotiate the opening of
the border. For its inaugural group of pilgrims, Iran pointedly
gave preference to parents whose sons were killed during the war.
	   However, both sides spoke Saturday of their having taken a new
step in relations.
	   Ataollah Mohajerani, Iran's minister of culture and Islamic
guidance, told reporters on the Iranian side of the border that the
visit was the ``best way to boost relations between the people of
the two countries.''
	   Iraq's Charge d'Affaires in Tehran, Salah al-Samarmad, who came
here for the event, said that although the border had been opened
only for pilgrims, ``maybe in the future all Iranian citizens would
be allowed in.''
	   As the pilgrims drove down from Tehran, they passed banners in
Iranian towns wishing them well.
	   ``Welcome to the pilgrims of Imam Hussein'' and ``Please pray
for us when you visit Imam Hussein,'' the banners said, referring
to the grandson of Islam's Prophet Mohammed, who is buried in
Karbala, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Baghdad.
	   The pilgrims, some barefooted in a sign of respect for the
journey, expressed mixed emotions about their desire to visit
shrines in a land where their sons had died.
	   Mehrangiz Tehrani, a 55-year-old housewife who lost a son and
brother during the war, was weeping so hard she had trouble
speaking.
	   ``We have to forget the past,'' she said. ``I am happy and
honored to go to a place that I've been waiting to visit for a long
time.''
	   The pilgrims are traveling in the buses of a government-run
tourist company according to a fixed program. They are not expected
to have opportunities to communicate with Iraqi citizens.
	   Their first stop on their week-long tour is scheduled to be
Najaf, 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Baghdad, where Imam Ali,
the son-in-law of the Prophet, is buried.

<TEXT>
	   LILLESTROM, Norway (AP) _ Reigning world titlist Norway
qualified for next year's Womens World Cup soccer tournament with a
2-0 win over England at Lillestrom on Saturday.
	   The Norwegians finished top of Group 3 after dominating the
English women in torrential rain Saturday, reaffirming its strength
from set-pieces by scoring both goals from corner kicks.
	   Norway joins Italy, Ukraine, China, North Korea, Japan and
Brazil and hosts, the U.S., as qualifiers for the World Cup
starting June 19 next year.
	   Norway edged Germany, which now goes into another qualifying
round to decide the remaining places in the 16-nation tournament.
	   Norway and Germany each scored four wins in the qualification
rounds, but Norway's superior goal record earned it automatic
qualification.
	   England finished bottom of Group 3, winning just one of its six
matches.

Klinsmann on verge of retiring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann, one of soccer's top
forwards this decade, told a German newspaper Saturday he may
retire without playing another match.
	   Klinsmann was a former player of the year in England, Germany
national team captain and claimed most of the game's top trophies
during his long career including the 1990 World Cup title.
	   ``I don't know if I'm going to play anymore. My 15-month son
needs me and I need him,'' Klinsmann, 34, told Bild, Germany's
largest-circulation daily.
	   ``In the last two or three years my values have completely
changed,'' he added. ``It doesn't excite me to push for lofty goals
anymore. I have a family.''
	   Klinsmann, who hasn't signed with a club after leading Tottenham
Hotspur out of relegation last season, has reportedly been asked to
play for Major League Soccer by the U.S. league officials.
	   But Klinsmann, who has an American wife and has often stated he
may want to ring out his career in the United States, said he now
plans to study languages and economic management instead.
	   Klinsmann was captain of Germany's 1996 European championship
team and won a UEFA Cup title with Inter Milan, but may have been
at his peak when he single-handedly led Bayern Munich to the 1996
UEFA Cup title, while breaking the scoring record for the
competition.
	   Klinsmann's scoring prowress has diminished since then, with his
last match ending bitterly. Germany, a perennial favorite, was
ousted in the quarterfinals of the recent World Cup by Croatia.

Fun set to begin in season's final major
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cooler weather as play begins Saturday. &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The club pros are gone, along with
the U.S. Open champion. The fun can finally begin under the
monstrous trees of Sahalee Country Club.
	   Two days of play weeded out the pretenders at the U.S. PGA
Championship and made Vijay Singh the midway leader Friday. But it
did little else other than to turn the year's last major into a
wide-open event going into the final 36 holes.
	   On a golf course growing more difficult by the hour, a cluster
of big names lurked within a few shots of Singh, while a handful of
players seeking their first major championship were close behind.
	   The story lines abounded, from Davis Love III's attempt to
repeat as champion to Mark O'Meara's bid to become the first to win
three majors in one season since Ben Hogan 45 years ago.
	   Colin Montgomerie was a stroke back and trying not to finish
second in a major once again. Tiger Woods, meanwhile, was two back
and trying to win his second major. U.S. Open champ Lee Janzen was
not so lucky. He was gone after a 148.
	   ``I've played a lot of weekends going into the lead or close to
the lead,'' Singh said. ``But this is something different, I think.
The pressure of a major tournament is always different than a
normal tournament.''
	   That pressure figures only to get worse if Singh takes a good
look at the leaderboard just behind him.
	   Singh's 66 tied the course record set by Woods a day earlier,
but did little more than give him a one-shot lead over a trio of
golfers led by Montgomerie and two over the likes of Woods, Love
and 1995 PGA champion Steve Elkington.
	   ``I haven't come over here to finish second,'' said Montgomerie,
who has done just that in three previous majors. ``The hardest
thing to do is get into contention. We'll go from there.''
	   Singh had the advantage of a morning tee time at Sahalee, where
the fairways and greens grew increasingly firm as the day went on
and players had trouble getting the ball close to pins tucked
behind traps and on ledges.
	   But the sunshine that was making the course more difficult
changed Saturday, with typical Seattle weather _ cool, damp and
overcast conditions _ greeting morning golfers.
	   Woods played in the afternoon Friday and struggled early. After
making seven birdies a day earlier, he made only one on the 16th
hole and had to make some putts just to salvage a 2 over 72.
	   Still, Woods liked his position going into the weekend.
	   ``Right now I'm in ideal shape,'' Woods said.
	   Love was right with Woods despite a blunder with his driver that
cost him a double bogey on No. 15 as he tried to add a second PGA
to the emotional win he had a year ago at Winged Foot. And he was
just as comfortable with his position two shots back after a
2-under 68.
	   ``It's a good spot to be in,'' Love said. ``I feel very
fortunate to be in the tournament.''
	   Love played late in the day with O'Meara, who was lurking in
contention for a third major title in 1998.
	   Just as he was at the Masters and British Open, O'Meara was not
in the lead, but wasn't too far out of it after two rounds.
	   ``At least I've given myself a chance going into the weekend,''
O'Meara said after an even-par round that included a pitch-in
birdie at No. 6 and an eagle on No. 11.
	   For the third straight major, par was beginning to be a score to
shoot at as the fairways and greens firmed up in unseasonable heat
and the pin positions got trickier.
	   ``It was like Sunday afternoon at a major,'' said Brad Faxon,
who was two back.
	   Woods led by two shots going into the round, but Singh passed
him with five front-nine birdies by the time Woods stepped to the
first tee.
	   Singh shot 30 on the front side, then added a 1-over 36 on the
back to give the rest of the field a score to shoot at.
	   ``End of the day, this is a major and I need to focus on what I
was doing,'' Singh said. ``I think that's what I did and I did
really good.''
	   Focus may be the key on a weekend where the slightest mistake
can be the difference between winning and losing.
	   Of the leaders, only Woods, Love and O'Meara have won majors.
Montgomerie has come in second three times, while players like
Scott Gump have never contended.
	   ``I think your nerves are a little bit edgy anytime you are
close to the lead whether you have won a major or not,'' O'Meara
said. ``The guys who have won, though, have a better understanding
of that pressure and how to deal with it.''

Bosnian Serb refugees return to devastated Mostar suburb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ About 100 Bosnian Serbs
returned Saturday to their devastated village near Mostar.
	   The Serbs fled from Bacevici, south of Mostar, when the war
started in 1992. The village was subsequently destroyed in the
heavy fighting that raged across southern Bosnia.
	   Saturday's return was part of a program returning several
hundred Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim refugees to their pre-war
homes in the Mostar region. More returns wer planned in coming
weeks.
	   ``The first impressions are encouraging,'' said Vujadin
Berberovic, one of the Serb returnees.''People are willing to
remain here, to clean up this place, to reconstruct it and live a
normal life again.''
	   Until a basic infrastructure in Bacevici is rebuilt, local
authorities and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees will be
providing the returnees with immediate help, including sheltering
materials and drinking water.
	   International agencies are trying to speed up the return of
refugees to Bosnia, considering it a crucial part of the
implementation of the Dayton peace accord.
	   According to the latest UNHCR figures, some 500,000 people _
refugees from across the Europe and from within Bosnia _ have
returned to their pre-war homes.
	   More than one million remain displaced, and officials hope the
return will be accelerated this year.

surface trough will be in the Virgin Islands this evening and will
pass through Puerto Rico tonight and early on Sunday. High pressure
will follow in behind this trough Sunday night and Monday.

Lee Kuan Yew: Malaysia, Indonesia expect too much from Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Frictions between Singapore and its nearest
neighbors have increased during the economic crisis because
Malaysia and Indonesia expect more than the republic of 3.1 million
people can deliver, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said Saturday.
	   ``Most Indonesians and Malaysians expect Singapore to offer
help,'' Lee said in a speech celebrating the island nation's
national day, which was Monday. ``Frictions have increased because
they expect more from us than we can deliver.
	   ``We will help within our capabilities and where it can make a
difference, but let us not forget that Singapore has only 3 million
people and we know our limitations,'' said Lee, who stepped down as
prime minister after 31 years in 1990 and assumed the post of
senior minister.
	   Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie said in a recent interview
with the Asian Wall Street Journal that he did not feel Singapore
was a friend. His supporters have said he resented comments Lee
made last February about market reaction when Habibie was about to
be named vice president.
	   Singapore's often testy relations with neighboring Malaysia have
deteriorated in the last few weeks in disputes over where to locate
a railroad border check, competing port facilities and accusations
that each country is bad-mouthing the other.
	   Singapore has weathered the economic storm better than its
neighbors but is beginning to feel the effects of the regional
crisis, including rising unemployment, bankruptcies, falling
property prices, plunging stock exchange levels and declining
currency value.
	   Government television quoted Lee as saying that Singapore will
have a budget deficit again next year and maybe the year after, but
he was not shown saying that on the air.
	   ``Singaporeans have seen from this crisis how other countries
have suffered because of collusion, corruption, nepotism,'' Lee
said in the speech, featured as the top story on the late night
government television news program.
	   Lee is regarded as Singapore's chief figure of authority and
consults on major issues with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.
	   One of Lee's sons is deputy prime minister and head of the
Monetary Authority, the equivalent of a central bank. The other son
heads Singapore Telecom, a government-linked company that has a
monopoly on fixed phone line service.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Two young girls wept at their mother's
grave Saturday, while investigators labored to identify the bombers
who killed her and 256 others in attacks on U.S. embassies in East
Africa.
	   ``We shall miss our dear mother greatly,'' Grace Christine
Wakanyi, 12, and Maryanne Wambui, 10, said in unison during the
funeral beneath a fragrant eucalyptus tree. Many sobbed in the
crowd of hundreds, some of whom wore bandages on their bombing
wounds.
	   The FBI says it will take at least another month to finish
examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S. embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   ``The investigation is like a jigsaw puzzle of 10,000 pieces,''
said Kenneth Piernick, head of the FBI investigation in Tanzania.
``We have some pieces, but still 9,990 pieces remain.''
	   Just two of 14 foreigners arrested in connection with Tanzania
bombing were still being interrogated, police said. Neither was
among ``the perpetrators of the offense,'' but may be able to
assist in the investigation, said Rajabi Adabi, director of
criminal investigations.
	   In Nairobi, Kenyan soldiers and U.S. Marines stood guard
Saturday around the bomb site, ringed by barbed wire. FBI
specialists studied evidence in striped tents out front and a
parking lot across the street. A bulldozer piled a mound of
picked-over wreckage ever higher.
	   A TV cameraman allowed into the devastated embassy recorded
scenes of bleak destruction and hints of the terror those inside
experienced immediately after the blast.
	   Bloody handprints were smeared on the wall of a second-floor
hallway, presumably those of a survivor trying to stagger to
safety. An investigator had written ``BLOOD'' on the wall and drawn
arrows pointing to the crimson stains.
	   A jumble of beams, plaster, glass and other debris filled
hallways and offices. While rooms on the embassy's western side _
facing the bomb site _ were caved in, others elsewhere were more
intact. A photograph of U.S. President Bill Clinton hung squarely
on one wall.
	   Dozens of funeral services were held Saturday across Kenya,
which suffered 247 bombing deaths. In keeping with tradition, most
of the dead were buried in their villages. Coffins were loaded in
pickups or tied atop buses for the final journeys home.
	   At Nairobi's Langata Cemetery, friends and family mourned Alice
Ndutu Gachiri, a government secretary who was killed hours after
her husband, Mwangi Gachiri, 46, dropped her off at work at the
Cooperative Bank House, which towers above a parking lot where the
car bomb exploded.
	   Mrs. Gachiri was admired ``as a jolly, generous, sympathetic and
welcoming person,'' her daughters said, reading a speech that
brought tears to mourners' eyes.
	   Watching shovels of dirt fall onto his 36-year-old sister's dark
wooden coffin, Peter Njao, 34, remembered her as ``our guiding
light. She was someone who would keep somebody's secret, and she
would really try to help.''
	   Near her grave were two others, freshly dug.
	   In a videotaped message, Clinton extended condolences to the
victims' families, saying ``We grieve together.''
	   ``Violent extremists try to use bullets and bombs to derail our
united efforts to bring peace to every part of this earth,'' he
said.
	   ``But I am proud that our nations have also renewed our
commitment to stand together _ to bring the offender swiftly to
justice, to combat terrorism in all its forms and to create a more
tolerant and peaceful world for our children,'' Clinton said.
	   Eight days after the bombings, newspapers reflected a mixture of
grief, bewilderment and anger. Several letters to the editor
accused the Americans of giving priority to U.S. victims and
protecting evidence at the bombed embassy site, at the expense of
rescue efforts. The overwhelming majority of the dead were Kenyans.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, shelving her
vacation plans, is to leave Sunday for the two East African
capitals to meet with investigators and console the injured. Her
four-day trip amounts to a show of support, and a declaration of
U.S. resolve in the face of terrorism.

 &UR; Deaths reported as car bomb explodes in Northern Ireland town &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb exploded aturday in
the religiously mixed town of Omagh, and a spokesman for the
Ambulance Service said that some people had been killed.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the attack nearby the
crowded shopping district of the town 70 miles (110 kms) west of
Belfast. But the placing of the bomb _ nearby Omagh's courthouse, a
symbol of British rule in Northern Ireland _ suggested that one of
the province's anti-British paramilitary groups was responsible.
	   The Ambulance Service said only that there had been ``several''
deaths. Police could not confirm either the number or severity of
those wounded. But the local Tyrone hospital ordered all off-duty
doctors and nurses to work.
	   ``I could see five or six bodies (on the ground) and a lot of
injured people, and people running about crying,'' said eyewitness
Sean Conway, a Catholic resident.
	   ``There's police and ambulances, and people running about
everywhere looking for their friends, relatives ... just
pandemonium.''
	   Police said they received a telephoned warning of a bomb in
Omagh about 40 minutes before the blast, but the caller said it was
directly outside the courthouse. The blast occurred nearer the
downtown's shops, pubs and supermarkets.
	   Several outlawed groups, including an Irish Republican Army
dissident gang, have continued to mount car-bomb and mortar attacks
in Northern Ireland in defiance of the IRA's July 1997 truce and
the April 1998 peace agreement.
	   Last month a car bomb wounded 35 people in the predominantly
Protestant market town of Banbridge, 22 miles (37 kms) southwest of
Belfast. In June a car bomb wrecked the mainly Protestant section
of Newtownhamilton, 40 miles (65 kms) southwest. Other bombing
attempts have been intercepted by police in the neighboring Irish
Republic.

	   AL-MUNTHERIYA, Iraq (AP) _ Carrying red plastic roses, about 750
Iranian pilgrims entered Iraq here Saturday, crossing the border
for the first time since the two states declared war on each other
18 years ago.
	   Some 300 Iraqi men, women and children waved flags and clapped
rhythmically in an officially-orchestrated welcome.
	   One of the Iraqis could not clap. Former soldier Al-Sayed Taha
had lost his left arm in a battle with the Iranians near the end of
the 1980-88 war.
	   But he stood smiling as the Iranians walked across the border
and exchanged the traditional greeting of ``Peace be upon you.''
	   ``The war is behind our backs now,'' Taha said, his Arab cloak
covering his missing arm.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians used to visit Iraq each year
until the war began. In July, the two countries agreed to allow
12,000 Iranians a month to visit Iraq's shrines.
	   The pilgrims must travel by road because U.N. sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban air travel to and from
the country.
	   To receive the pilgrims, Iraq has rebuilt Al-Muntheriya border
post which had been destroyed in the war. By Saturday's ceremony
workers had barely finished a towering portrait of President Saddam
Hussein kneeling in Islamic prayer.
	   Iraq hopes the visitors, who by tradition deliver gifts to the
shrines, will bring in much needed foreign currency. Pilgrimage
tourism is one of few forms of international trade that Iraq is
allowed under the sanctions.
	   Iran, for its part, wants its people to have access to the
Shiite Muslim shrines in Karbala, Najaf, Samara and Baghdad.
Shiites regard these mosques as second only to those in Saudi
Arabia in terms of holiness.
	   But mistrust lingers after a war in which more than a million
people were killed and wounded, and where the return of prisoners
has still not been settled.
	   It took Iran and Iraq nine months to negotiate the opening of
the border. For its inaugural group of pilgrims, Iran pointedly
gave preference to parents whose sons were killed during the war.
	   However, both sides spoke Saturday of their having taken a new
step in relations.
	   Ataollah Mohajerani, Iran's minister of culture and Islamic
guidance, told reporters on the Iranian side of the border that the
visit was the ``best way to boost relations between the people of
the two countries.''
	   Iraq's Charge d'Affaires in Tehran, Salah al-Samarmad, who came
here for the event, said that although the border had been opened
only for pilgrims, ``maybe in the future all Iranian citizens would
be allowed in.''
	   As the pilgrims drove down from Tehran, they passed banners in
Iranian towns wishing them well.
	   ``Welcome to the pilgrims of Imam Hussein'' and ``Please pray
for us when you visit Imam Hussein,'' the banners said, referring
to the grandson of Islam's Prophet Mohammed, who is buried in
Karbala, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Baghdad.
	   The pilgrims, some barefooted in a sign of respect for the
journey, expressed mixed emotions about their desire to visit
shrines in a land where their sons had died.
	   Mehrangiz Tehrani, a 55-year-old housewife who lost a son and
brother during the war, was weeping so hard she had trouble
speaking.
	   ``We have to forget the past,'' she said. ``I am happy and
honored to go to a place that I've been waiting to visit for a long
time.''
	   The pilgrims are traveling in the buses of a government-run
tourist company according to a fixed program. They are not expected
to have opportunities to communicate with Iraqi citizens.
	   Their first stop on their week-long tour is scheduled to be
Najaf, 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Baghdad, where Imam Ali,
the son-in-law of the Prophet, is buried.

Flash floods in Yemen kill 18 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Flash floods have killed 18 people in
western and southern Yemen, a government official said Saturday.
	   Fifteen farmers were killed Thursday in a valley in the Red Sea
province of al-Hodeida, 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of San`a,
and three others in the southern province of Ibb, 120 miles (192
kilometers) south of the capital, said the official.
	   The floods, caused by heavy rains, devastated fields and houses
in al-Hodeida, Ibb and the southern province of Abyan, the official
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Abyan, people reported waters as high as 5.8 meters (6.3
yards), he added.
	   Earlier this month, at least 14 people were killed in similar
flash floods in Yemen.
	   In 1996, about 200 people died in floods that swept through
several Yemeni provinces, causing damage estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.

Afghan Taliban scores another victory against northern alliance

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban militia captured several
more districts northeast of Kabul Saturday, scoring another victory
against its battered northern-based opposition in a bid to unite
Afghanistan under its strict version of Islam.
	   ``Our fighters captured the remaining areas of Nuristan without
any fighting,'' Taliban Ambassador in Islamabad, Maulvi
Saeed-ur-Rehman, told The Associated Press.
	   Nuristan, around 150 kilometers (90 miles) northeast of Kabul,
is the capital of Laghman, a province near neighboring Pakistan.
Saeed-ur-Rehman said his fighters already held most of the area,
and on Saturday moved into nearby mountains.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, hammered badly by the Taliban in
recent weeks, now only controls central Bamiyan province and the
Panjshir Valley north of Kabul.
	   These last strongholds are surrounded by Taliban fighters, who
snapped the alliance's only supply route from Central Asia by
capturing northern Hayratan.
	   The Taliban militia has vowed to transform Afghanistan into a
purist Islamic state.
	   In a radio address Friday, supreme Taliban leader Mullah Omar
assured Afghans that democracy and human rights will have a place
in this state, but added Muslim scholars will have to define these
terms.
	   In the parts of the country already under its control, the
Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law has angered human rights
activists. Women are confined to the home, girls are denied
education, and television, movies and books have been banned.
	   Muslim scholars in other countries have said Taliban rules owe
more to tribal traditions than to the Koran, Islam's holy book.
	   Omar, in a speech read by an announcer on Taliban radio, said
all of Afghanistan's ethnic groups would be treated equally. The
Taliban are, like the plurality Afghans, predominately Pashtun,
while their opposition is a coalition of various ethnic and
religious minorities. Taliban troops have been accused of harassing
or killing minorities in the towns they have captured.
	   Omar also assured its neighbors they need not fear a total
Taliban victory.
	   President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan and Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharazi met Friday to share their concerns over
Afghanistan. Predominately Shiite Muslim Iran has been suspicious
of the rise of the Sunni Taliban.
	   Kazakstan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear
that if the Taliban gain control of all of Afghanistan, there will
be an influx of refugees and weapons across their borders.
	   On Saturday, Russia's envoy to the Commonwealth of Independent
States, which loosely groups former Soviet republics, said his
country would strike back if Taliban fighters crossed into Central
Asia.

	   AL-MUNTHERIYA, Iraq (AP) _ Carrying red plastic roses, about 750
Iranian pilgrims entered Iraq here Saturday, crossing the border
for the first time since the two states declared war on each other
18 years ago.
	   Some 300 Iraqi men, women and children waved flags and clapped
rhythmically in an officially-orchestrated welcome.
	   Former soldier Al-Sayed Taha, who lost his left arm in a battle
with the Iranians near the end of the 1980-88 war, stood smiling as
the Iranians walked across the border and exchanged the traditional
greeting of ``Peace be upon you.''
	   ``The war is behind our backs now,'' Taha said, his Arab cloak
covering his missing arm.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians used to visit Iraq each year
until the war began. In July, the two countries agreed to allow
12,000 Iranians a month to visit Iraq's shrines.
	   The pilgrims must travel by road because U.N. sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban air travel to and from
the country.
	   Iraq rebuilt Al-Muntheriya border post, destroyed during the
war, adding a towering portrait of President Saddam Hussein
kneeling in Islamic prayer.
	   Iraq hopes the visitors, who by tradition deliver gifts to the
shrines, will bring in much needed foreign currency. Pilgrimage
tourism is one of few forms of international trade that Iraq is
allowed under the sanctions.
	   Iran wants its people to have access to the Shiite Muslim
shrines in Karbala, Najaf, Samara and Baghdad _ for Shiites, second
only to those in Saudi Arabia in terms of holiness.
	   Mistrust lingers after a war in which more than a million people
were killed and wounded, and where the return of prisoners has
still not been settled.
	   It took Iran and Iraq nine months to negotiate the opening of
the border. For its inaugural group of pilgrims, Iran pointedly
gave preference to parents whose sons were killed during the war.
	   However, both sides spoke Saturday of their having taken a new
step in relations.
	   Ataollah Mohajerani, Iran's minister of culture and Islamic
guidance, told reporters on the Iranian side of the border that the
visit was the ``best way to boost relations between the people of
the two countries.''
	   Iraq's Charge d'Affaires in Tehran, Salah al-Samarmad, who came
here for the event, said that although the border had been opened
only for pilgrims, ``maybe in the future all Iranian citizens would
be allowed in.''
	   Mehrangiz Tehrani, a 55-year-old housewife who lost a son and
brother during the war, was weeping so hard she had trouble
speaking.
	   ``We have to forget the past,'' she said. ``I am happy and
honored to go to a place that I've been waiting to visit for a long
time.''
	   The pilgrims are traveling in the buses of a government-run
tourist company according to a fixed program. They are not expected
to have opportunities to communicate with Iraqi citizens.
	   Their first stop on their week-long tour is scheduled to be
Najaf, 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Baghdad, where Imam Ali,
the son-in-law of the Prophet, is buried.

Flash floods in Yemen kill 18 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Flash floods have killed 18 people in
western and southern Yemen, a government official said Saturday.
	   Fifteen farmers were killed Thursday in a valley in the Red Sea
province of al-Hodeida, 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of San`a,
and three others in the southern province of Ibb, 120 miles (192
kilometers) south of the capital, said the official.
	   The floods, caused by heavy rains, devastated fields and houses
in al-Hodeida, Ibb and the southern province of Abyan, the official
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Abyan, people reported waters as high as 5.8 meters (6.3
yards), he added.
	   Earlier this month, at least 14 people were killed in similar
flash floods in Yemen.
	   In 1996, about 200 people died in floods that swept through
several Yemeni provinces, causing damage estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.

Moodie leads King by one
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Moodie taking lead &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM, St. ANNES, England (AP) _ Janice Moodie, a Scotswoman in
her debut season on the U.S. Tour, got out of a bunker and rolled
in a 15-foot par putt at the last to card level par 72 Saturday and
take a 1-stroke lead into the final round of the Women's British
Open.
	   Betsy King, a veteran of 22 years on the Tour, also scored a 72
after a bunker shot at the last gave her a one-foot par putt. She
is 4-over with a three-round total of 220, one behind Moodie.
	   ``I'm looking forward to going out with Betsy King tomorrow
because we also played the first two round together,'' said Moodie.
``It's kind of exciting and the nerves are going in my stomach,''
	   The 25-year-old from Glasgow, birdied two holes and bogeyed two
as the sun finally shone on the Royal Lytham course to make
conditions less wintry to allow a few more players to shoot scores
level or under par.
	   Moodie, whose best finishes this season were a shared fourth at
the Myrtle Beach Classic and fifth in the Big Apple Classic, also
is two shots clear of two more American challengers, Wendy Ward and
Leslie Spalding, and Smitri Mehra of India, also a U.S. Tour
player, who are at 5-over.
	   Ward carded a 74, Spalding a 75 and Mehra a 71, which included
three birdies on the front nine.
	   Brandie Burton made a triple-bogey eight to lose the lead while
Se Ri Pak's bid to get into contention crumbled when she bogeyed
the first five holes.
	   Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago and
starting the third round ahead by one stroke, maintained her lead
until she ran into a storm of trouble at the par 5,535-yard
seventh.
	   She drove into the deep rough, chipped out onto the fairway and
her third landed in a bunker short of the green. Burton needed two
to get out of the bunker back onto the fairway, chipped onto the
green and finally two-putted.
	   That dropped her from 1-over to 4-over and she wound up with a
77 for a six over total of 222.
	   Pak, a 20-year-old South Korean who has won four tournaments
including two majors in her rookie season on the U.S. Tour, began
the third round seven shots behind the leader. She ended up with a
79 and a 15-over score of 231.

Chris Webber fined for marijuana possession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with five grafs with Webber's whereabouts unknown;
Minor editing thereafter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Chris Webber of the Sacramento
Kings was fined dlrs 500 for carrying a small amount of marijuana
that was detected by dogs at the airport on Saturday, customs
officials said.
	   Webber had 11 grams of marijuana in his luggage when he was
detained during a layover in San Juan.
	   The whereabouts of the 25-year-old player were not known
Saturday.
	   Customs officials at San Juan's Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport said Webber was briefly detained and then allowed to
continue his journey, from the Dominican Republic to Barbados on a
trip sponsored by the sporting goods company Fila.
	   But an official of the Barbados Amateur Basketball Association,
which expected Webber to play in a fundraiser on Monday, said the
player had not arrived by Saturday morning.
	   Webber was traveling with Jerry Stackhouse of the Detroit
Pistons and other athletes on a trip sponsored by the sporting
goods company Fila.
	   The customs department said that because of the small amount of
marijuana involved Webber was not cited for smuggling and would not
be prosecuted for possession.
	   A customs dog on a routine inspection in the transit lounge at
the airport sniffed a carryon bag that was tagged as belonging to
Stackhouse, customs said. Stackhouse denied the bag was his, and
Webber admitted it belonged to him.
	   It was the latest in a series of legal problems for Webber, who
was unwillingly traded in May from the Washington Wizards to
Sacramento and reportedly was looking for another switch. The trade
was prompted in part by his off-court turmoil.
	   Webber is awaiting trial for a January arrest that stemmed from
a traffic stop on his way to practice with the Wizards in Maryland.
He faces charges of marijuana possession, second-degree assault and
resisting arrest.
	   In May, a grand jury declined to prosecute Webber on a complaint
filed by a woman who said she was sexually assaulted at a party in
Maryland in April. Webber's lawyer said he left the party before
the alleged attack.
	   The NBA and its players are in the midst of a lockout, and
contact between players and teams is prohibited.
	   Only heroin and cocaine are covered in the drug agreement
between the NBA and the union. The league would like to add
provisions dealing with marijuana and alcohol abuse.
	   Union director Billy Hunter said last week the sides were near
an accord that would add marijuana to the list of banned
substances.

Security Minister says hangings to resume in two weeks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CAROLL ORR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, Jamaica (AP) _ The gallows have been unused for 10
years, but the executioner's holiday will end August 27 when
Neville Lewis is put to death for killing a motorist who asked him
for directions, a top official said Friday.
	   National Security Minister K.D. Knight said that not to resume
hangings would make a mockery of the law in a country plagued with
a high murder rate.
	   ``If hanging is the penalty, as it is in Jamaica, then those who
ought to hang, ought to be hanged,'' he said. ``Otherwise the law
will become a laughing stock.''
	   Along with other Caribbean countries, Jamaica has taken steps to
make it easier to hang convicted killers. Last year, it withdrew
the right of convicts to appeal to a United Nations committee.
	   London's Privy Council, which serves as the highest appeals
court for this former British colony, ruled in 1993 that it was
illegal to hang a criminal more than five years after sentencing.
The Jamaica government said convicts were abusing the appeals
process to the United Nations in order to delay _ and thereby avoid
_ execution.
	   Opinion polls show public support for hangings in Jamaica. In
1997, a record 1,038 homicides were reported in the nation of 2.6
million people. By comparison, New York City recorded fewer than
800 homicides last year among a population nearly three times as
large.
	   Lewis, the man scheduled to die Aug. 27, was convicted of
killing Vic Higgs, a 59-year-old consultant to the Jamaica Tourist
Board in October, 1994. Because a road was blocked, Higgs asked
Lewis and another man for directions and gave them a ride in his
car.
	   The two men were convicted of robbing Higgs, strangling him and
dumping his body in a lake.
	   Lewis' accomplice is also on death row.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb killed several
people and wounded scores Saturday in a crowded market town in the
deadliest terrorist attack Northern Ireland has suffered in years,
authorities and witnesses said.
	   The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said several people had
been slain in the blast in downtown Omagh, a religiously mixed town
70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, after a phoned warning
encouraged police to evacuate people in the wrong direction.
	   No precise figures for those killed or injured were yet
available, as witnesses described a scene of rubble, bodies in the
street and blood-streaked survivors frantically searching for
friends and family.

	   Ken Maginnis, a Protestant lawmaker a security spokesman for the
Ulster Unionist Party, said he wasn't sure how many deaths there
were but had been informed that the number of wounded exceeded 100.
	   ``This is a dreadful crime against humanity,'' Maginnis said.
	   An anonymous phoned warning conveyed to police indicated that
the car bomb was placed outside Omagh's courthouse. But the blast
about 40 minutes later _ and some 20 minutes after police began
evacuating civilians _ caught the gathering crowd several hundred
yards (meters) away nearby pubs, shops and a supermarket.
	   ``Police moved everybody away from this area to where the bomb
really was,'' said Nigel O'Kane, owner of a pub nearby the
courthouse. ``They cleared everybody away towards Market Street,
then about 20 minutes later the bomb blew up behind them.''
	   ``It was awful _ people running around crying. Nobody could
believe it. People (were) panicking for their loved ones. You just
hope there's as few people injured as possible. There was a couple
buildings flattened by the bomb.''
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A series of
similar car-bomb attacks have been claimed by or blamed on Irish
Republican Army dissidents opposed to the outlawed group's July
1997 cease-fire.
	   The Omagh attack happened on the 29th anniversary of the British
government's decision to deploy troops in Belfast as peacekeepers
between Protestants and Catholics. That decision triggered the rise
of the modern-day IRA.
	   The previous most deadly bombing in Northern Ireland was in
October 1993, when an IRA bomb in Belfast killed nine Protestant
civilians and one of the bombers. The worst single toll from a bomb
attack in the British-ruled province occurred in August 1979, when
two IRA bombs killed 18 soldiers.

Reports: At least one bombing suspect arrested in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani newspapers say at least one
suspect in the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa was detained in
Pakistan as he tried to slip into neighboring Afghanistan.
	   The national newspaper The News, in a report appearing in its
Sunday editions quoting unnamed government sources, said a suspect
identified as 32-year-old Mohammed Sadique confessed to planning
the bombings at the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. The nearly simultaneous Aug. 7 attacks killed a total of
257 people.
	   The U.S. embassy in Islamabad and the State Department and FBI
in Washington refused comment. Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman
Tariq Altaf said he had no knowledge of the case, as did Pakistani
intelligence sources contacted by The Associated Press.
	   Suspicion had earlier focused on Afghanistan, home of Saudi
multimillionaire Osama bin Laden. U.S. officials say bin Laden,
among the world's most militant sponsors of terrorism, was a
possible suspect in the African bombings.
	   The News did not report whether Sadique was linked to bin Laden,
his nationality, or whether he had offered a motive. But it said he
had received help in Kenya from sympathizers with connections to
the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
Before the bombings, a group known as the Islamic Jihad considered
the successor to the groups that assassinated Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat in 1981, reportedly vowed to strike U.S. interests
because some of its members had been arrested in Albania.
	   The News said Sadique was detained at the Karachi airport after
his flight from Nairobi landed Aug. 7, the day of the bombings,
because immigration officials noticed he did not match the
photograph in the passport he was carrying. When he tried to bribe
the officials, he was arrested, the newspaper said.
	   He reportedly confessed to the bombings under interrogation, and
said two other conspirators who left Nairobi a few days earlier had
already passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan, as he had planned
to do.
	   Umat, a small Karachi newspaper that had reported Sadique's
arrest earlier in the week, said in a report Saturday that the two
other men to whom Sadique referred, identified only as Mohammed
Saleh and Abdullah, were arrested later.
	   All three were brought to the capital for further questioning,
according to the Urdu-language newspaper. Umat, also unnamed
sources, had few other details.

Streel wins the Tour of Denmark, Koerts wins last stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _Belgian Marc Streel won the Tour of
Denmark on Saturday after holding the leader's yellow jersey from
day one.
	   Dutchman Jans Koerts won the 150-kilometer (93-mile) last stage
of the race on Saturday in a time of 3 hours, 17 minutes, 15
seconds. But Streel's overall time of 21 hours, 21 seconds for the
six stages of the race was enough to give him the victory.
	   Rolf Sorensen of Denmark finished second in the overall
standings, 54 seconds behind Streel. Peter Meinert of Denmark
finished third.
	   In the last stage, the pack arrived together at the finish in
central Copenhagen, with Koerts winning a mass sprint ahead of
Italians Alberto Ongarato and Frederico Colonna.
	   After the victory Streel was tired but pleased. ``I'm incredibly
proud and happy with the victory,'' he said to Danish newspaper
Ekstra Bladet.

Chelsea falls 2-1 in opener; Manchester United salvages draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea, one of the favorites to win the Premier
League and a club that spent 12 million pounds (dlrs 19.7 million)
in off-season transfers, was beaten Saturday by Coventry 2-1 as
England's Premier League got underway with about 160 foreigners
filling the 20 clubs.
	   Coventry, a low-budget team, got goals in the first 15 minutes
from Darren Huckerby and Dion Dublin and then held on as Gustavo
Poyet scored in the 37th for the League Cup and European Cup
Winners Cup champions.
	   Another powerhouse Manchester United barely escaped with a draw
as David Beckham _ much maligned when he was sent off in a critical
World Cup loss to Argentina _ scored in the final minutes on a free
kick to salvage a 2-2 draw at home against Leicester.
	   At the other end of the standings, low-spending Wimbledon _
picked as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated _ defeated
Tottenham 3-1 to get off to a good start.
	   Newly promoted Charlton also had a good beginning and managed a
0-0 draw at Newcastle despite playing with only 10 men for 70
minutes.
	   On an opening day that saw only 12 goals in eight Premier League
matches, Ian Wright _ a transfer from Arsenal _ got a crucial one
as West Ham won 1-0 at Sheffield Wednesday.
	   In other Premier League matches Saturday: Blackburn 0, Derby 0;
Everton 0, Aston Villa 0; Middlesbrough 0, Leeds 0.
	   Arsenal, the defending league and F.A. Cup champion, opens
Monday at home against Nottingham Forest. In Sunday's lone Premier
League game, Liverpool was at Southampton.
	   In Scotland's Premier League, Rangers defeated Motherwell 2-1 as
Jorg Albertz got the winner on a penalty in second half injury
time. Rod Wallace gave Rangers a 1-0 lead in the 16th and Owen
Coyle equalized in the 52nd. In two other games, Dunfermline
defeated Dundee 2-0 and St. Johnstone and Kilmarnock drew 0-0.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Amid a growing exodus of American, French
and other foreign nationals from Congo's capital, rebel gunmen
trying to oust President Laurent Kabila were battling government
troops in the country's west.
	   A military commander and a western diplomat, both speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the government was putting up
resistance to rebel advances from the western edge of the country,
near the Atlantic coastline.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi earlier said the government
was preparing a counter-offensive.
	   ``We're getting ready to launch a counter strike at the rebels
who are in Lower Congo,'' Mumengi said in a telephone interview.
``As long as there are foreign troops on our soil, the only
solution will be a military solution.''
	   Precise locations of the western fighting were not available,
although the rebels had said earlier they were within 250
kilometers (150 miles) of Kinshasa.
	   A rebel army of Congolese Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and
disenchanted members of Kabila's military has been pushing toward
Kinshasa with the aim of toppling the president's 15-month-old
regime.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by his government.
	   In Kinshasa, thousands of students and government employees
marched along the city's main street, June 30th Boulevard, pledging
support for Kabila and accusing Rwanda of waging war on Congo.
	   Many protesters also accused France and the United States of
trying to destabilize Congo.
	   With tensions boiling over in the capital, foreigners have been
fleeing on chartered evacuation flights.
	   The United States Embassy was shut down Saturday and the 20
remaining American were flown to Yaounde, Cameroon because of the
increasing tension, U.S. officials said in Washington.
	   More than 300 Americans _ U.S. Embassy staff, family and other
American citizens and their dependents _ left on two chartered
Delta Air Lines flights on Friday, an embassy official said.
	   Those jets were headed to Washington.
	   Across the Congo River in the Republic of Congo capital,
Brazzaville, three planeloads of French soldiers were preparing to
get French citizens who wanted to leave out of Kinshasa.
	   Official radio in Brazzaville said a French evacuation plane had
been refused authorization to land at Kinshasa's airport Friday and
soldiers were trying to ferry people across the river. However,
Congo has declared the river closed and by Saturday afternoon no
boats had been allowed to cross.
	   The French Foreign Ministry said Saturday that the departures
were on a voluntary basis for non-essential personnel and that it
did not intend to close its embassy. About 250 French have asked to
be evacuated, officials said.
	   Hoping to stem the fighting, foreign ministers from Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Namibia were in Kinshasa on Saturday to meet
with Congolese government officials.
	   Despite the peace efforts by the foreign ministers, there was no
sign, however, the government was pulling back from its fight
against the rebels.
	   The government says neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are fighting
with and supplying the rebellion _ a charge both countries deny.
	   A rebellion against Kabila launched earlier this month quickly
escalated into an insurgent war, with the rebels capturing key
towns in the east, including Goma and Bukavu, and securing
positions in the west after a troop airlift.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister, said today that
Congolese opposition leaders had already formed the Congolese
Democratic Movement to replace Kabila's government.
	   ``We have a name, we have program, we have leaders,'' said
Karaha, who joined the rebels and was in the eastern town of
Bukavu.
	   He said the movement included political opponents of both Mobutu
and Kabila as well as ordinary Congolese.
	   Kinshasa residents have been stocking up on provisions and
bottled water.
	   Soldiers continued to patrol streets and markets, searching cars
for weapons and frequently detaining suspected rebel collaborators.
	   Government radio today told the public to remain calm and blamed
the growing tensions in Kinshasa on what it called biased news
reports of rebel advances.
	   State-controlled radio earlier accused several foreign
broadcasters of airing false reports about rebel gains. Foreign
journalists in Kinshasa have been harassed and repeatedly detained
for brief periods over the past week.
	   After a day of confusion over Kabila's whereabouts, it was still
unclear whether the president was in the capital or had left for
his former rebel stronghold of Lubumbashi.
	   Requests for an interview with Kabila were turned away.
	   ``We're in the middle of war, the president can't speak now,''
Sakombe said. ``Our actions are what count.''

Berlin mayor Diepgen against Holocaust memorial at Brandenburg
</HEADLINE>
Gate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin's Mayor Eberhard Diepgen is against
constructing a Holocaust memorial at Brandenburg Gate in Germany's
capital and says he will recommend to the city senate it reject the
idea, Der Tagesspiegel newspaper said Saturday.
	   Diepgen, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
Christian Democrats, called the design of the planned memorial by
American architect Peter Eisenman ``overdone,'' and not suitable,
the newspaper said.
	   Berlin's leftist Social Democrats in the senate who largely
support the memorial, have charged that Diepgen, who runs the city
in a coalition with them, is using the memorial theme for political
purposes.
	   Tagesspiegel, in an early release of a report to appear in its
Sunday editions, quoted Diepgen as saying ``We surely won't let the
smaller coalition partner force their will in this question.''
	   Diepgen said his party will offer alternative suggestions for a
Holocaust memorial when the city senate takes up the subject at a
session set for Aug. 25.
	   Eisenman's proposal for a labyrinthian field of stone pillars
resembling a cemetery was scaled down at the request of Kohl, who
has been the strongest supporter of a Holocaust memorial in Berlin.
	   But after years of debate, a final decision on the memorial
still hasn't been made, although Kohl has said that step would be
taken before Sept. 27, national elections.
	   Diepgen isn't the only one fighting the memorial proposal, with
the debate for and against crossing party lines.
	   Kohl's top challenger, Gerhard Schroeder of the Social Democrats
said in an interview on RTL television on Aug. 7, that he would
call for a new national debate on the theme if he's elected.
	   ``I think that an open discussion about this lies before us,''
Schroeder said.
	   This summer, Schroeder's pick to be his culture czar, Michael
Naumann, caused a stir by saying he thought a monument was too
grandiose and antiseptic. He suggested the money might be better
spent maintaining former concentration camps, which carry more
direct emotional impact.

Fresh government attack on villages dims hopes for peace talks

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A new all-out Serbian attack against
Kosovo villages controlled by secessionist rebels Saturday dampened
hopes for early talks on the future of the embattled Serbian
province.
	   The government offensive in western Kosovo came two days after
ethnic Albanian pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a
negotiating team for talks with the government.
	   Government forces, using tanks, jets and helicopters, launched a
coordinated attack on at least nine villages in western Kosovo near
the Albanian border. Fighting also raged elsewhere in the province.
	   As the Serbian forces shelled the villages in an attempt to
force ethnic Albanian rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade
invited Rugova's team to start negotiations as early as next week.
	   However, a statement released by the Democratic League of
Kosovo, Rugova's party, said hopes for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to ``start to act seriously, once again turned out to be
futile.''
	   Rugova said already on Friday that the government offensive must
stop before peace talks can begin. The offensive appeared to rule
out an early start of such negotiations.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported that at 6 a.m. Saturday,
government forces opened fire on the village Logja and at least
eight other area villages, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Pristina near the Albanian border.
	   The center said in two hours a total of 200 hundred grenades hit
Logja. Later it reported that after they ebbed for a while, the
attacks on Logja resumed. There was no immediate word on
casualties.
	   The area remained inaccessible, but smoke could be seen from a
distance, and detonations could be heard ten kilometers (6 miles)
away.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attack on the villages, the
ethnic Albanian source said.
	   According to the Serbian version of events, the Media Center in
Pristina reported that early Saturday a group of ``extremists''
attacked Serbian police forces securing the Decani-Pec road. The
road runs close to the area of fighting. In a counterattack, police
forces reportedly pushed the rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army
into nearby forests.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav state-run Tanjug news agency reported
Saturday evening that Serbian police had ``neutralized terrorist
groups'' in two villages southwest of Decani, saying they were now
fully under police control.
	   It said KLA fighters were believed on the run in the direction
of Junik, a major KLA stronghold that has been under recurrent
heavy attack by government forces.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia whose population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.
	   Serbian Interior Ministry officials in Pristina Saturday showed
reporters and photographers what they said were weapons and
documents seized from rebels after recent battles, including
Chinese anti-tank mines, German uniforms and American helmets.
	   The Albanian source also said fighting resumed at another
location, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina, where
government forces reportedly burned two villages and kept firing
grenades on a number of others to flush out the guerrillas. In an
earlier report, it spoke of five people killed. There were no other
details.
	   Meanwhile, the decision by Adem Demaci, a prominent Albanian
opposition politician, to lead the political wing of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, has widened the split between the rebel
organization and Rugova, the longtime ethnic Albanian leader.
	   Demaci, Rugova's chief rival, announced his acceptance Friday
after Rugova failed to persuade the KLA to join his team. By doing
so, Demaci in effect established himself as an alternative leader
of the province's majority Albanian community.

Car bomb kills several, wounds scores in Northern Ireland town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with witness reports, Blair statement &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb killed several
people and wounded scores Saturday in a crowded market town in the
deadliest terrorist attack Northern Ireland has suffered in years,
authorities and witnesses said.
	   The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said several people had
been slain in the blast in downtown Omagh, a religiously mixed town
70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, after a phoned warning
encouraged police to evacuate people in the wrong direction.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, who lives in the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' Mrs. Boyle said.
	   No precise figures for those killed or injured were yet
available, as witnesses described a scene of rubble, bodies in the
street and blood-streaked survivors frantically searching for
friends and family.
	   ``It was a scene of absolute devastation,'' Paddy McGowan, a
member of the local council, told Sky News. ``You could hardly
imagine all that was left of some of the shops I had visited
earlier this afternoon. It was a scene of carnage.''
	   Ken Maginnis, a Protestant lawmaker a security spokesman for the
Ulster Unionist Party, said he wasn't sure how many deaths there
were but had been informed that the number of wounded exceeded 100.
	   ``This is an appalling act of savagery and evil by people who
are determined, whatever the cost to innocent people, to wreck the
prospects for peace in Northern Ireland,'' said Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who was vacationing in France.
	   ``We will pursue them to the utmost in order to bring them to
justice for this terrible deed. These people will never be allowed
to win,'' Blair said.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern pledged to ``ruthlessly
suppress'' terrorist organizations that opposed the wish for peace.
	   An anonymous phoned warning conveyed to police indicated that
the car bomb was placed outside Omagh's courthouse. But the blast
about 40 minutes later _ and some 20 minutes after police began
evacuating civilians _ caught the gathering crowd several hundred
yards (meters) away nearby pubs, shops and a supermarket.
	   ``Police moved everybody away from this area to where the bomb
really was,'' said Nigel O'Kane, owner of a pub nearby the
courthouse. ``They cleared everybody away towards Market Street,
then about 20 minutes later the bomb blew up behind them.''
	   ``It was awful _ people running around crying. Nobody could
believe it. People (were) panicking for their loved ones. You just
hope there's as few people injured as possible. There was a couple
buildings flattened by the bomb.''
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A series of
similar car-bomb attacks have been claimed by or blamed on Irish
Republican Army dissidents opposed to the outlawed group's July
1997 cease-fire.
	   The Omagh attack happened on the 29th anniversary of the British
government's decision to deploy troops in Belfast as peacekeepers
between Protestants and Catholics. That decision triggered the rise
of the modern-day IRA.
	   The previous most deadly bombing in Northern Ireland was in
October 1993, when an IRA bomb in Belfast killed nine Protestant
civilians and one of the bombers. The worst single toll from a bomb
attack in the British-ruled province occurred in August 1979, when
two IRA bombs killed 18 soldiers.

U.S. Tour rookie Moodie one ahead of veteran King

	   LYTHAM, St. ANNES, England (AP) _ Janice Moodie splashed out of
a bunker to 15 feet at the last and holed the putt for par to go
into Sunday's final round of the Women's British Open one stroke
ahead of Betsy King.
	   Both players carded level par 72s in Saturday's third round and
Moodie, chasing her first pro title compared with King's 31, has a
3-over total of 219.
	   A first-year player on the U.S. Tour, the 25-year-old Scot will
partner a 22-year Tour veteran in the final round at Royal Lytham
St. Annes. Although they haven't met in any of Moodie's 18
tournaments this season, this will be their third confrontation at
this championship.
	   ``I'm looking forward to going out with Betsy King tomorrow
because we also played the first two round together,'' said Moodie.
``It's kind of exciting and the nerves are going in my stomach.''
	   Yet she said there were no nerves when she landed in the
greenside bunker at the last.
	   ``There was a time when I would have thought `this is an
automatic bogey.' Now I try not to think about that. I know that,
even if a miss a green, there's still a good chance I'll get up and
down,'' said Moodie, who studied at San Jose University and won 12
collegiate NCAA tournaments.
	   Moodie, who birdied the sixth and 14th holes but bogeyed 10 and
17, said this was the first time she had gone out last in the final
round of a pro tournament.
	   King, the highest money earner in LPGA history at dlrs 6.18
million, has lost count of the number of times she's gone out last.
Yet she's looking for her first win this season.
	   ``I'm playing well in spots,'' said the American star, who
birdied the first, sixth, 10th and 11th holes but also collected
four bogeys.
	   It would have been five but she also managed a stunning bunker
shot at the last to one foot from the flag for a par.
	   ``I'm pleased,'' she said. ``You can't get to go round this
course without a mistake here, a mistake there.''
	   Having seen Moodie in action for the first two rounds, she
believed the Scot had plenty of potential.
	   ``I don't think she really has any weaknesses,'' King said.
``She has good touch, a good temperament and she's competitive.
She'll also have a few people rooting for her tomorrow. I think
it's been a few years since a British player won this tournament.''
	   Behind Moodie and King come three more U.S. Tour players on 5
over.
	   Wendy Ward carded a 74, fellow American Leslie Spalding, a 75
and Smitri Mehra of India a 1-under 71.
	   Brandie Burton made a triple-bogey eight to lose the lead while
Se Ri Pak's bid to get into contention crumbled when she bogeyed
the first five holes.
	   Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago and
starting the third round ahead by one stroke, maintained her lead
until she ran into a storm of trouble at the par 5,535-yard
seventh.
	   She drove into the deep rough, chipped out onto the fairway and
her third landed in a bunker short of the green. Burton needed two
to get out of the bunker back onto the fairway, chipped onto the
green and finally two-putted.
	   That dropped her from 1-over to 4-over and she wound up with a
77 for a six over total of 222 and a share of sixth place.
	   Pak, a 20-year-old South Korean who has won four tournaments
including two majors in her rookie season on the U.S. Tour, began
the third round seven shots behind the leader. She ended up with a
79, tied for 38th with a 15-over score of 231.

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Looking tanned but tired during
his vacation break away from the Vatican, Pope John Paul II on
Saturday marked Italy's main summer holiday by remembering those
who are alone or must work while others have fun.
	   Taking advantage of the cooler early morning hours, the pontiff
led an 8 a.m. Mass in the courtyard of the palace in the lakeside
hills southeast of Rome where he has his vacation retreat.
	   Four hours later, he returned to the public eye to give the noon
Angelus prayer and blessing to pilgrims marking the Aug. 15 holy
day which Catholics believe marks the assumption of the Virgin Mary
into heaven. It is a national holiday in Italy and much of the rest
of Europe.
	   The 78-year-old pontiff appeared tired and uncomfortable in the
heat in the high 20s (80s F). His voice was weak and he wiped his
brow several times with a handkerchief as he said Mass under a
canvas awning.
	   After two weeks in the Alps in July, the pope was staying in
Castel Gandolfo through mid-September.
	   After wishing those on holiday a happy feast day, the pope
recalled those who cannot get away, especially the elderly, those
who live alone and ``those who in these days of vacation assure
essential services for the community.''
	   Some 500 parishioners from the local church turned out for the
Mass, whose homily John Paul dedicated to the struggle between evil
and good.
	   ``As long as this world lasts, history will always be a theater
for the collision between God and the devil, between good and evil,
between grace and sin, between life and death,'' the pope said.

Family denies Karadzic son's temporary detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The wife of war crimes suspect
Radovan Karadzic, Ljiljana, said Saturday their son Sasa was not
temporarily detained earlier this week in connection with the
recent killing of a local police chief.
	   Mrs Karadzic reacted strongly to reports that linked her son
with more than 30 people detained and questioned by the Bosnian
Serb police investigating the violent death of Srdjan Knezevic, a
prominent police officer and former military leader in the Bosnian
war.
	   ``I deny most energetically that horrible lie and I condemn all
who took part in fabricating and spreading the allegation,'' said
Mrs Karadzic's statement faxed to media in Yugoslavia and the
Serb-run part of Bosnia. She said her son Sasa has been on vacation
abroad since July 10.
	   Her husband, who has been indicted twice by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, is believed to be hiding
somewhere in Bosnia, avoiding arrest by NATO-led peace troops.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Amid a growing exodus of American, French
and other foreign nationals from Congo's capital, rebel gunmen
trying to oust President Laurent Kabila were battling government
troops in the country's west.
	   A military commander and a western diplomat, both speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the government was putting up
resistance to rebel advances from the western edge of the country,
near the Atlantic coastline.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi earlier said the government
was preparing a counter-offensive.
	   ``We're getting ready to launch a counter strike at the rebels
who are in Lower Congo,'' Mumengi said in a telephone interview.
``As long as there are foreign troops on our soil, the only
solution will be a military solution.''
	   Precise locations of the western fighting were not available,
although the rebels had said earlier they were within 250
kilometers (150 miles) of Kinshasa.
	   A rebel army of Congolese Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and
disenchanted members of Kabila's military has been pushing toward
Kinshasa with the aim of toppling the president's 15-month-old
regime.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by his government.
	   In Kinshasa, thousands of students and government employees
marched along the city's main street, June 30th Boulevard, pledging
support for Kabila and accusing Rwanda of waging war on Congo.
	   Many protesters also accused France and the United States of
trying to destabilize Congo.
	   With tensions boiling over in the capital, foreigners have been
fleeing on chartered evacuation flights.
	   The United States Embassy was shut down Saturday and the 20
remaining American were flown to Yaounde, Cameroon because of the
increasing tension, U.S. officials said in Washington.
	   More than 300 Americans _ U.S. Embassy staff, family and other
American citizens and their dependents _ left on two chartered
Delta Air Lines flights for Washington on Friday, an embassy
official said.
	   Hundreds of foreigners converged at a Congo River port to board
an evacuation boat arranged by the French embassy to carry people
to Brazzaville, the capital of neighboring Republic of Congo.
	   French, Belgian, Italian and other nationalities were taken out.
	   ``I didn't want to leave, but now I've got to go,'' said Annette
LeFevre, who said she feared for her two young daughters.
	   ``We don't know what is going to happen tomorrow, so we must
leave today,'' said LeFevre, who left behind a Congolese husband.
	   Standing behind military barricades set back from the water,
Teixera De Souza, a Brazilian, watched as his wife and children
left for the boat.
	   He stayed behind to finish some business in Kinshasa.
	   ``I'll join them as soon as I can,'' he said.
	   The French Embassy was given authorization from Kinshasa to
charter the evacuation boat across the river, which is otherwise
closed to all traffic.
	   The French Foreign Ministry said Saturday that the departures
were on a voluntary basis for non-essential personnel and that it
did not intend to close its embassy. About 250 French have asked to
be evacuated, officials said.

Munich starts season with 1-0 victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ VfL Wolfsburg held Bayern Munich in check for more
than an hour Saturday, then ran out of gas against the title
favorites in a 1-0 loss on the Bundesliga's opening weekend.
	   Wolfsburg, fighting for every ball, dominated the first half
against Munich as the league's 35th season kicked off.
	   But the deep Munich team, which manager Uli Hoeness has dubbed
the club's most talented in 20 years, brought several players off
the bench and proved fresher late in the match.
	   Giovane Elber struck for the 69th-minute gamewinner, with the
Brazilian striker spinning free from his defender and sending a
well-placed shot into the net from 10 meters (10 yards).
	   ``We went to our limits. I ran like a rabbit for 60 or 70
minutes, then I was bushed,'' said Wolfsburg striker Roy Praeger.
	   Both Praeger and U.S. national team mifielder Claudio Reyna, who
tried to loft a ball over the Munich keeper's head, failed to
convert clear scoring chances.
	   The defending champion, FC Kaiserslautern, beat 1860 Munich 2-1
in an away match, Bayer Leverkusen rolled past Rostock 3-1, while
Moenchengladbach stunned Schalke 3-0.
	   SC Freiburg also made its return to the Bundesliga successful,
winning 2-1 against Bochum, while FC Nuremberg drew 1-1 with
Hamburg. On Friday, Stuttgart edged Borussia Dortmund 2-1 and MSV
Duisburg slipped past Frankfurt 2-1.
	   Kaiserslautern, after a sluggish start, won on a 42nd-minute
header from striker Olaf Marschall and a long-distance shot in the
62nd from Egypt's Ibrahim Samir's.
	   Their goals overcame a 12th minute penalty converted by 1860's
Bernhard Winkler.
	   Schalke, which boasted the league's best defense last season,
was shocked just 77 into its match by Austrian international Toni
Polster's header.
	   Eight minutes later, Sweden's Jorgen Pettersson added a second
score and Moenchengladbach completed the rout with the 3-0 from
Matthias Hagner.
	   Stefan Beinlich shot two goals against his old club, Hansa
Rostock, as Leverkusen lived up to its pre-season billing as one of
the league's top clubs.
	   Joerg Reeb scored an insurance goal, while Rostock's score came
from Igor Pamic.
	   Freiburg's successful return to the Bundesliga was led by goals
from Marco Weisshaupt Georgian international Alexander Iaschwili.
Stefan Kuntz scored for Bochum.
	   Anthony Yeboah's 88th-minute equalizer saved a draw for Hamburg
against newly-promoted Nuremberg, whose score came from Ukrainian
Andrej Polunin.

Portuguese ask for French and American help in Congo evacuation

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with officials' denial of Sunday meeting in Stuttgart

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Portuguese government has asked for
French and U.S. help to evacuate its citizens from the Congo with
rebels advancing towards the capital Kinshasa, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The Portuguese evacuation plan relies on French military
transport planes, due to arrive in the area later Saturday, and two
U.S. warships expected over the weekend, the daily Publico
reported.
	   Publico reported that military attaches from Portugal, Belgium,
France and the United States would meet Sunday in Stuttgart,
Germany, to coordinate the plans. Later, a spokesman for the U.S.
European Command said he had no knowledge of such a meeting taking
place.
	   Some 180 Portuguese citizens and a further 250 dual nationals
remain in Kinshasa. About 400 other Portuguese nationals, mostly
women and children, have left the Congo since the war situation
sharpened at the beginning of the month, the paper said.
	   Portuguese Foreign Minister decided to activate the emergency
evacuation plan on Friday, after a TAP Air Portugal airliner was
unable to land in Kinshasa airport for security reasons.
	   Radio reports said the plane had been refused permission to
land.

	   Details of English Premier League games played Saturday:
 &UR; Blackburn 0, Derby 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Blackburn strikers Kevin Davies and Chris Sutton dominated the
match but were unable to score for stylish Rovers. Norwegian Lars
Bohinen almost got the winning goal in the final minutes on a
30-yard (meter) drive that was stopped on a diving save by Rovers
goalkeeper John Filan.
 &UR; Coventry 2, Chelsea 1 (2-1) &QC; 
	   Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli started nine foreign players _
among them new signees Pierluigi Casiraghi, Marcel Desailly and
Albert Ferrer _ but it was two Englishmen who beat Chelsea as
Darren Huckerby scored in the 10th and Dion Dublin in the 15th. The
loss repeated a Chelsea pattern from last season, with key wins
over big clubs but disappointing losses away to lesser teams.
Gustavo Poyet of Uruguay scored for Chelsea in the 37th.
 &UR; Everton 0, Aston Villa 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   It wasn't a good start Everton's new Scottish manager Walter
Smith or Scotland's World Cup star John Collins. Collins, a
transfer from Monaco, missed a penalty kick after just eight
minutes as Aston Villa's Mark Bosnich dived to his right to palm
away. Villa played a largely lackadaisical game with little spark
from star striker Dwight Yorke.
 &UR; Manchester United 2, Leicester 2 (0-1) &QC; 
	   David Beckham scored on a free-kick three minutes into injury
time to rescue Manchester United at Old Trafford. The former
champions were heading for defeat against Leicester and trailed 2-0
with only 12 minutes remaining after a goal in the 7th by Emile
Heskey and another from Tony Cottee in the 76th. But substitute
Teddy Sheringham pulled one back on a header before Beckham scored
on a 25-yard free kick that beat French goalkeeper Pegguy Arphexad.
 &UR; Middlesbrough 0, Leeds 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Former England international Paul Gascoigne, back in the Premier
League after playing in Italy and Scotland for six seasons, did
little in the 0-0 draw. He wore a black armband in memory of friend
David Cheek who died Friday _ and had to pass a fitness test on an
injured calf prior to the match. Leeds dominated much of the game
but never could break through.
 &UR; Newcastle 0, Charlton 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Newcastle, perhaps the most disappointing team in the league
last season, played that way again against the newly promoted
first-division side. At one point Newcastle fans were chanting
``What a load of rubbish.'' Charlton played a man short for almost
70 minutes after Richard Rufus was sent off for violent conduct.
 &UR; Sheffield Wednesday 0, West Ham 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Ian Wright scored from West Ham on a breakaway in the final five
minutes as Trevor Sinclair fed the former Arsenal and England
striker with a perfect pass. Wright got the through-ball and beat
goalkeeper Kevin Pressman with his left foot from 12 yards
(meters).
 &UR; Wimbledon 3, Tottenham 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Wimbledon is seen by some as the most likely team to be
relegated. Don't bet on it. Jamaica international Robbie Earle
scored in the 48th and Nigerian Efan Ekoku made it 2-0 in the 59th
before Ruel Fox scored from Tottenham in the 74th. Ekoku got the
insurance goal in the 90th to put Wimbledon on top of the league
standings after the first of 38 games.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb killed 21 people
Saturday in a crowded market town, the BBC reported. Scores of
people were injured in what loomed as one of the worst atrocities
in three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.
	   The blast shattered a busy shopping street in Omagh, a
religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, after a
phoned warning encouraged police to evacuate people in the wrong
direction.

	   Police confirmed at least 20 deaths, and said the victims
included children.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, who lives in the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' Mrs. Boyle said.
	   The attack came on the 29th anniversary of the deployment of
British troops in Northern Ireland _ and 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the province's peace
agreement.
	   Witnesses described a scene of rubble, bodies in the street and
blood-streaked survivors frantically searching for friends and
family. Roofs had been blown off several buildings, and wreckage
was strewn across the street.
	   ``It was a scene of absolute devastation,'' Paddy McGowan, a
member of the local council, told Sky News. ``You could hardly
imagine all that was left of some of the shops I had visited
earlier this afternoon. It was a scene of carnage.''
	   Erne Hospital in Enniskillen reported receiving 47 injured
people, while Tyrone County Hospital in Omagh reported ``dozens and
dozens'' of casualties.
	   Queen Elizabeth II, in a statement released by Buckingham
Palace, said she was ``shocked to hear of the appalling crime in
Omagh,'' and she conveyed her condolences to which resulted in so
many deaths and injuries. Please pass my heartfelt sympathy to the
bereaved, injured and those others who have suffered in their
distress.''

	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern pledged to ``ruthlessly
suppress'' terrorist organizations that opposed the wish for peace.
	   ``This is an appalling act of savagery and evil by people who
are determined, whatever the cost to innocent people, to wreck the
prospects for peace in Northern Ireland,'' said Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who was vacationing in France.
	   ``We will pursue them to the utmost in order to bring them to
justice for this terrible deed. These people will never be allowed
to win,'' Blair said.
	   An anonymous phoned warning conveyed to police indicated that
the car bomb was placed outside Omagh's courthouse. But the blast
about 40 minutes later _ and some 20 minutes after police began
evacuating civilians _ caught the gathering crowd several hundred
yards (meters) away nearby pubs, shops and a supermarket.
	   ``Police moved everybody away from this area to where the bomb
really was,'' said Nigel O'Kane, owner of a pub nearby the
courthouse. ``They cleared everybody away towards Market Street,
then about 20 minutes later the bomb blew up behind them.''
	   ``It was awful _ people running around crying. Nobody could
believe it. People (were) panicking for their loved ones. You just
hope there's as few people injured as possible. There was a couple
buildings flattened by the bomb.''
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A series of
similar car-bomb attacks have been claimed by or blamed on Irish
Republican Army dissidents opposed to the outlawed group's July
1997 cease-fire.
	   The Omagh attack happened on the 29th anniversary of the British
government's decision to deploy troops in Belfast as peacekeepers
between Protestants and Catholics. That decision triggered the rise
of the modern-day IRA.
	   The previous most deadly bombing in Northern Ireland was in
October 1993, when an IRA bomb in Belfast killed nine Protestant
civilians and one of the bombers. The worst single toll from a bomb
attack in the British-ruled province occurred in August 1979, when
two IRA bombs killed 18 soldiers.

U.N. chief calls for review of sanctions against Cuba, Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Punishing leaders such as Fidel Castro
or Saddam Hussein with international sanctions causes unnecessary
suffering for ordinary people, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said in an interview published here Saturday.
	   Calling for a review of the sanctions against such countries as
Cuba and Iraq, Annan told the weekly Expresso that such policies
also caused unnecessary political tension and worked against good
trading relations.
	   ``Sanctions don't necessarily affect the leaders _ look at
Iraq,'' Annan said. The U.N. chief said he believed that future
U.N. sanctions would probably begin targeting leaders with such
measures as freezing personal assets and restricting international
travel.
	   ``There should not be sanctions that make ordinary people
suffer,'' he said.
	   Annan also referred to the ``Cuban case,'' where bilateral U.S.
sanctions against the government of Fidel Castro pressured other
nations to sever their economic relations with the island.
	   ``As well as causing political problems among neighbors, these
kinds of sanctions also distort trading relations,'' he said.

Chris Webber fined for marijuana possession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new 13th graf with Sacramento Kings declining
comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Chris Webber of the Sacramento
Kings was fined dlrs 500 for carrying a small amount of marijuana
that was detected by dogs at the airport on Saturday, customs
officials said.
	   Webber had 11 grams of marijuana in his luggage when he was
detained during a layover in San Juan.
	   The whereabouts of the 25-year-old player were not known
Saturday.
	   Customs officials at San Juan's Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport said Webber was briefly detained and then allowed to
continue his journey, from the Dominican Republic to Barbados on a
trip sponsored by the sporting goods company Fila.
	   But an official of the Barbados Amateur Basketball Association,
which expected Webber to play in a fundraiser on Monday, said the
player had not arrived by Saturday morning.
	   Webber was traveling with Jerry Stackhouse of the Detroit
Pistons and other athletes on a trip sponsored by the sporting
goods company Fila.
	   The customs department said that because of the small amount of
marijuana involved Webber was not cited for smuggling and would not
be prosecuted for possession.
	   A customs dog on a routine inspection in the transit lounge at
the airport sniffed a carryon bag that was tagged as belonging to
Stackhouse, customs said. Stackhouse denied the bag was his, and
Webber admitted it belonged to him.
	   It was the latest in a series of legal problems for Webber, who
was unwillingly traded in May from the Washington Wizards to
Sacramento and reportedly was looking for another switch. The trade
was prompted in part by his off-court turmoil.
	   Webber is awaiting trial for a January arrest that stemmed from
a traffic stop on his way to practice with the Wizards in Maryland.
He faces charges of marijuana possession, second-degree assault and
resisting arrest.
	   In May, a grand jury declined to prosecute Webber on a complaint
filed by a woman who said she was sexually assaulted at a party in
Maryland in April. Webber's lawyer said he left the party before
the alleged attack.
	   The NBA and its players are in the midst of a lockout, and
contact between players and teams is prohibited.
	   ``Due to the lockout, the team has to decline all comments,''
Kings spokesman Troy Hanson said.
	   Only heroin and cocaine are covered in the drug agreement
between the NBA and the union. The league would like to add
provisions dealing with marijuana and alcohol abuse.
	   Union director Billy Hunter said last week the sides were near
an accord that would add marijuana to the list of banned
substances.

 &UR; U.N. chief calls for review of sanctions against Cuba, Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Punishing leaders such as Fidel Castro
or Saddam Hussein with international sanctions causes unnecessary
suffering for ordinary people, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said in an interview published here Saturday.
	   Calling for a review of the sanctions against such countries as
Cuba and Iraq, Annan told the weekly Expresso that such policies
also caused unnecessary political tension and worked against good
trading relations.
	   ``Sanctions don't necessarily affect the leaders _ look at
Iraq,'' Annan said. The U.N. chief said he believed that future
U.N. sanctions would probably begin targeting leaders with such
measures as freezing personal assets and restricting international
travel.
	   ``There should not be sanctions that make ordinary people
suffer,'' he said.
	   Annan also referred to the ``Cuban case,'' where bilateral U.S.
sanctions against the government of Fidel Castro pressured other
nations to sever their economic relations with the island.
	   ``As well as causing political problems among neighbors, these
kinds of sanctions also distort trading relations,'' he said.

Reports: Main challenger Social Democrats outline post-election
</HEADLINE>
program &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Counting on success in national elections
on Sept. 27, the main challenger Social Democratic party has
outlined what it will do in its first 100 days running the German
government, news media reports said Saturday.
	   In the case of an election victory, the party plans to repeal
cuts in social security payments passed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
conservative-centrist coalition in the last legislative period, Der
Spiegel of Hamburg and Focus weekly magazine of Munich both said.
	   Soon after the new government is formed by the Social Democrats,
they plan to repeal reforms that would reduce step-by-step
effective in 1999, retirement payments from 70 to 64 percent of
salaries, the reports said.
	   Other moves, according to Spiegel and Bild am Sonntag newspaper,
include rescinding a law passed in September 1996 that allows
employers to reduce sick pay for the first six weeks to 80 percent
of salaries. The previous law required them to pay full salaries,
which the Social Democrats want restored.
	   Another central theme according to the Berliner Morgenpost
newspaper, is reducing joblessness in Germany, which in July was
10.7 percent or 4.13 million people, up from 10.5 percent in June.
	   The newspaper quoted Franz Muentefering, the Social Democratic
administrative manager, as saying that jobs creation was the
central theme of what he called the party's ``Start Program,''
after the election.
	   Muentefering was also quoted as saying that the party plans
quick moves to reduce taxes especially for average families by
2,500 marks (dlrs 1,400) per year.
	   An overall tax reform plan by the Social Democrats will seek to
reduce taxes for the lower paid to 15 percent from a current 25.9
percent of pay, with the highest level reduced from a current 54
percent to 49 percent. Further reductions are possible if
sufficient funds for public financing are available, Spiegel and
Bild am Sonntag said.
	   According to the reports, Kohl's Christian Democratic General
Secretary Peter Hintze charged the Social Democrats plans would
cause more unemployment by raising the cost of labor.
	   Whoever rescinds the reforms the government implemented ``takes
the chance of the loss of millions of jobs,'' Hintze was quoted as
saying.

Afghan Taliban grabs more opposition areas after heavy fighting

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban militia claimed it had
captured a strategic town northwest of the capital Saturday after
heavy fighting, inching closer to uniting Afghanistan under its
strict version of Islam.
	   Taliban fighters claimed to have captured Doshi, 160 kilometers
(100 miles) northwest of Kabul _ a crucial link between opposition
forces holed up in northern Panjshir valley and their allies in
central Bamiyan province.
	   The Hezb-e-Wahadat militia, a member of the anti-Taliban
alliance, denied that Doshi had fallen. The Salang Pass, which
links northern and southern Afghanistan, is controlled through
Doshi.
	   The Taliban also claimed victories in northern Badakshan
province and said the opposition was booted from six districts
after heavy fighting. Some local commanders and people revolted
against the opposition, according to a Taliban spokesman in Kabul
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Taliban Ambassador in neighboring Pakistan, Maulvi
Saeed-ur-Rehman, told The Associated Press the opposition was also
rooted from Nuristan, around 150 kilometers (90 miles) northeast of
Kabul and the capital of Laghman province. Rehman said his fighters
already held most of the area, and on Saturday moved into nearby
mountains.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, hammered badly by the Taliban in
recent weeks, controls only about 10 percent of Afghanistan,
including central Bamiyan province and the Panjshir Valley north of
Kabul.
	   The opposition's last strongholds are surrounded by Taliban
fighters, who snapped their enemy's only supply route from Central
Asia by capturing northern Hayratan Aug. 12.
	   The Taliban are on the verge of conquering all of Afghanistan.
They have vowed to restore peace in the war ravaged country and
transform it into a purist Islamic state.
	   In a radio address Friday, supreme Taliban leader Mullah Omar
assured Afghans that democracy and human rights will have a place
in this state, but added Muslim scholars will have to define these
terms.
	   In the parts of the country the Taliban already control, their
interpretation of Islam has angered human rights activists. Women
are confined to the home, girls are denied education, and
television, movies and books have been banned, thieves have their
hands cut off and murderers are publicly executed.
	   Muslim scholars in other countries say Taliban rules owe more to
tribal traditions than to the Koran _ Islam's holy book.
	   Omar also assured his neighbors they need not fear a total
Taliban victory.
	   Former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear that if the Taliban
gain control of all of Afghanistan, there will be an influx of
refugees and weapons across their borders.
	   On Saturday, Russia's envoy to the Commonwealth of Independent
States, which loosely groups former Soviet republics, said his
country would strike back if Taliban fighters crossed in Central
Asia.
	   Another neighbor, predominately Shiite Muslim Iran, has been
suspicious of the rise of the conservative Taliban, who adhere to
the Sunni sect of Islam. Iran accuses the Taliban of abducting 11
Iranians, including diplomats, in Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold
the anti-Taliban coalition recently lost.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ For the third time in a year, Iraq has called
a halt to U.N. inspections of its weapons programs. This time,
President Bill Clinton's response is more muted, less aggressive.
	   There's no threat of a quick military strike, no talk of crisis.
	   ``The United States is hardly saying a peep,'' said Peter
Rodman, a former Reagan administration national security aide who
is critical of the Clinton policy on Iraq.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday the United
States reserves the right to use force against Iraq at a time of
its choosing ``in response to threats.'' But her main point was
Clinton will not be drawn prematurely into a fight.
	   ``We are not going to play Saddam's game on his terms,'' she
said. ``He wants to create a U.S.-Iraq confrontation. This is an
issue between Iraq and the United Nations.''
	   The new Clinton approach is to encourage the notion that the
problem is Iraq's, not America's, and to resist escalation of
rhetoric that could foment a military crisis.
	   The president personally has made almost no recent public
remarks on Iraq. In February, as the possibility of a military
clash seemed to be growing, Clinton visited the National War
College to deliver a lengthy pep talk to Pentagon officials.
	   He may want to keep the Iraqi trouble from heating up while his
hands are full of other foreign policy problems, from FBI
investigations of the East African embassy bombings to Russia's
financial meltdown. At home, the president is at a crucial point in
the Monica Lewinsky investigation: He testifies to the grand jury
on Monday.
	   When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein refused last fall to permit
more U.N. inspections of suspect weapons sites, Washington
responded by building up military force in the Gulf. It happened
again in February. Each time the crisis was defused, and Saddam
backed down, but not before the Clinton administration threatened
to bomb Iraq into submission.
	   Saddam's capitulation included a promise of full cooperation
with the inspectors, enshrined in a Feb. 23 ``memorandum of
understanding'' between Saddam and Kofi Annan, secretary-general of
the United Nations.
	   Despite that, many people _ even some inside Clinton's
government _ concluded that Saddam had gained strength from the
encounters.
	   Then on Aug. 5 Saddam announced a ban on new inspections, and
the U.S. reaction was different. The United States deplored the
news and deferred to the U.N. Security Council, which did little
but call Iraq's defiance ``totally unacceptable.''
	   Iraq has cut off discussions with the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of Iraq's disarmament. Saddam's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz, said Iraq will answer no more questions about its forbidden
weapons, asserting that all the answers have been given.
	   Result: The United Nations is doing no unannounced inspections
in Iraq, although cameras and other monitoring equipment are still
functioning at known weapons sites. U.N. officials have said this
means they can no longer give assurances that Iraq is not
attempting to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program.
	   Zalmay Khalilzad, a former Bush administration national security
aide, said Friday the Clinton administration appears to have lost
confidence that it can count on Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies
to provide political cover for threats to use military force.
	   ``We can't build more support for a harder line, so we better go
softer to avoid a confrontation'' is the administration's apparent
thinking, Khalilzad said. ``But as we ease, Saddam is going to
become more aggressive.''
	   David Kay, the first leader of the U.N. weapons inspection team
after the 1991 Gulf War, said the Clinton administration seriously
miscalculated by failing to respond immediately to the Aug. 5
announcement with a quick military strike.
	   By giving the impression that they will tolerate violations of
the Feb. 23 agreement, Kay said, ``Inadvertently they have played
Saddam's hand.'' He said Saddam will be encouraged to think he will
outlast the United States.

 &UR; Car bomb kills at least 20, wounds scores in Northern Ireland town &QL;

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb killed at least 20
people and wounded scores Saturday in a crowded market town. A
telephone warning encouraged police to evacuate people closer to
the blast, which loomed as one of the worst atrocities in three
decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.
	   The blast shattered a busy shopping street in Omagh, a
religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast.
	   Police confirmed at least 20 deaths, and said the victims
included children. The British Broadcasting Corp. said it had
confirmed 21 dead.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A series of
similar car-bomb attacks have been claimed by or blamed on Irish
Republican Army dissidents opposed to the outlawed group's July
1997 cease-fire.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, who lives in the town.
	   ``There was one boy had half his leg blown off and it was lying
there with the wee shoe still on it. He didn't cry or anything. He
was just in shock,'' Mrs. Boyle said.
	   The attack came on the 29th anniversary of the deployment of
British troops in Northern Ireland _ and 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the province's peace
agreement.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern pledged to ``ruthlessly
suppress'' terrorist organizations that opposed Northern Ireland's
new peace agreement, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair promised
to pursue the bombers ``to the utmost.''
	   Witnesses described a scene of rubble, bodies in the street and
blood-streaked survivors frantically searching for friends and
family. Roofs had been blown off several buildings, and wreckage
was strewn across the street.
	   ``I've just met a man who has lost his wife and he's worried
about his two children as well, who were with her. It's terrible
that human beings could do this to each other,'' said Joe Byrne of
the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, who recently won a
seat in Northern Ireland's Assembly.
	   ``It was a scene of absolute devastation,'' Paddy McGowan, a
member of the local council, told Sky News. ``You could hardly
imagine all that was left of some of the shops I had visited
earlier this afternoon. It was a scene of carnage.''
	   Erne Hospital in Enniskillen reported receiving 47 injured
people, while Tyrone County Hospital in Omagh reported ``dozens and
dozens'' of casualties.
	   Queen Elizabeth II, in a statement released by Buckingham
Palace, said she was ``shocked to hear of the appalling crime in
Omagh,'' and she conveyed her condolences to townspeople.
	   ``This is an appalling act of savagery and evil by people who
are determined, whatever the cost to innocent people, to wreck the
prospects for peace in Northern Ireland,'' said Blair, who was
vacationing in France.
	   ``We will pursue them to the utmost in order to bring them to
justice for this terrible deed. These people will never be allowed
to win,'' Blair said.
	   An anonymous phoned warning conveyed to police indicated that
the car bomb was placed outside Omagh's courthouse. But the blast
about 40 minutes later _ and some 20 minutes after police began
evacuating civilians _ caught the gathering crowd several hundred
yards (meters) away nearby pubs, shops and a supermarket.
	   ``Police moved everybody away from this area to where the bomb
really was,'' said Nigel O'Kane, owner of a pub nearby the
courthouse. ``They cleared everybody away towards Market Street,
then about 20 minutes later the bomb blew up behind them.''
	   ``It was awful _ people running around crying. Nobody could
believe it.''
	   The Omagh attack happened on the 29th anniversary of the British
government's decision to deploy troops in Belfast as peacekeepers
between Protestants and Catholics. That decision triggered the rise
of the modern-day IRA.
	   The worst previous toll from a bomb attack in the British-ruled
province occurred in Aug. 27,1979, when the IRA killled 18 soldiers
at Warrenpoint. The IRA killed 21 people in Birmingham, England
when it bombed two pubs on Nov. 21, 1974.
	   The worst one-day toll in the the conflict was the 22 people
killed immediately by pro-British loyalists who set off three car
bombs in Dublin on May 17, 1974. The death toll later climbed to
33.

For lasting guilt, lay on the kindness quickly, studies suggest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Want to make someone feel really, really
guilty?
	   Bring up their dastardly deed by offering forgiveness. Say it's
not their fault. Assure them there's no need to make up for it.
Make your point before they get a chance to reply. And it'll
probably help if they don't quite believe you.
	   That's a good bet for producing long-lasting guilt, at least in
people who think they deserve to feel guilty, new studies suggest.
	   But there's a risk to this approach: It can damage your
relationship with the transgressor more than if you'd essentially
said, ``Hey! You goofed,'' according to researcher Tamara Ferguson
of Utah State University.
	   She spoke Friday in a seminar on guilt and shame at the American
Psychological Association's annual meeting.
	   Guilt is ``a major factor that regulates people's behavior,''
said Roy Baumeister of Case Western Reserve University. He and
others at the seminar said guilt can be a good thing when it
equalizes an imbalance of power in a relationship and helps people
follow rules and expectations of society and loved ones.
	   In fact, guilt and shame probably evolved in human history to
help maintain social bonds that kept ancestors from becoming some
predator's meal on the savannah, suggested Mark Leary, a psychology
professor at Wake Forest University.
	   But guilt that's chronic, frequent or inappropriate can be
harmful by making people ashamed of themselves rather than keeping
them in line, Ferguson said.
	   She presented results from studies of 384 college students who
were asked to recall instances when somebody made them feel guilty.
She wanted to know whether the method of creating guilt affected
how long the guilt lasted.
	   She checked on three categories of technique. One involved
direct assertions, like saying ``That's not fair!'' or ``Do you
know what you've done?'' A second included indirect ploys, like
giving hints through tone of voice. The third was introducing the
topic with apparent kindness: ``It's all right, I forgive you ...
It's not your fault ... You don't need to make it up to me.''
	   When the students reported an incident that produced lingering
guilt, the guilt was usually delivered through the kindness
category. When they reported incidents of briefer guilt, it usually
followed a direct technique.
	   The students' relationships with the guilt imposer deteriorated
more often when the guilt was lingering _ lasting more than a week
_ rather than briefer.
	   So when is the right time to offer forgiveness?
	   It depends on what you want to do, Ferguson said in an
interview.
	   If you want to prolong the guilt, do it before they get a chance
to say anything. If you want to help the relationship instead, give
them a chance to own up to their transgression first, because that
lets them save face by doing a morally right thing.
	   Leary, who studies emotions provoked by social situations, said
in an interview he was surprised at first by Ferguson's results.
Then he realized that the kindness strategy may come in two
versions.
	   If the guilty party believes the person is sincere, it should
``cut guilt pretty dead,'' he reasoned. But if they think the
person still feels aggrieved despite the words, he said, ``I think

South Africa's overcomes huge deficit to beat All Blacks in
</HEADLINE>
Tri-Nations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Joost van der Westhuizen, Bobby
Skinstad and James Dalton all scored in the final 12 minutes to
raise South Africa's Springboks from an 18-point deficit and beat
New Zealand 24-23 on Sunday.
	   The win, dubbed by local media as the greatest comeback in
Springbok history, gave South Africa 5 Tri-Nations log points and
put the team firmly on top. However, the competition still hinges
on next Saturday's showdown against Australia.
	   South African right wing Stefan Terblanche scored the first try
in the third minute, on a pass from fullback Percy Montgomery. A
split-second earlier, All Black center Eroni Clarke had tried to
tackle Montgomery. He might as well have tried to tackle a
refrigerator. Montgomery was immobile and flipped the ball to
Terblanche.
	   From then until the 66th minute, New Zealand dominated.
	   A raid down the left flank from giant wing Jonah Lomu resulted
in a try for scrumhalf Justin Marshall. Flyhalf Andrew Mehrtens
converted to make it 7-5.
	   Captain Taine Randell scored under the posts after number eight
Isitolo Maka had burst through the South African defence.
	   From under the posts the conversion was a mere formality for
Mehrtens, who made it 14-5, then added three more points minutes
later.
	   The Springboks conceded a penalty in a ruck on the Kiwi
goalline.
	   Mehrtens, in the first minute of the second half, struck a
long-range penalty then made it 23-5 in the 66th minute with
another penalty.
	   Then South Africa showed why they are the world champion rugby
team.
	   Springbok scrumhalf Van der Westhuizen scored from a scrum in
the opposition 22-meter (yard) area in the 69th minute.
	   Replacement flank Skinstad scored in the 73rd minute when he
finished off after a Bok surge down the right.
	   Montgomery converted both tries which made it 19-23.
	   The Springboks snatched the victory after taking play deep into
All Black territory. Lock Krynauw Otto took a line-out ball well
and South Africa mauled their way over, with the try credited to
hooker Dalton.

Fresh government attack on villages dims hopes for peace talks

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A new all-out Serbian attack against
Kosovo villages controlled by secessionist rebels Saturday dampened
hopes for early talks on the future of the embattled Serbian
province.
	   The government offensive in western Kosovo came two days after
ethnic Albanian pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a
negotiating team for talks with the government.
	   Government forces, using tanks, jets and helicopters, launched a
coordinated attack on at least nine villages in western Kosovo near
the Albanian border. Fighting also raged elsewhere in the province.
	   As the Serbian forces shelled the villages in an attempt to
force ethnic Albanian rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade
invited Rugova's team to start negotiations as early as next week.
	   A statement released by the Democratic League of Kosovo,
Rugova's party, said hopes for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to ``start to act seriously, once again turned out to be
futile.''
	   Rugova had said Friday that the government offensive must stop
before peace talks can begin.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported that at 6 a.m. Saturday,
government forces opened fire on the village of Logja and at least
eight others in the area, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Pristina near the Albanian border.
	   The center said in two hours a total of 200 hundred grenades hit
Logja. There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   The area remained inaccessible, but smoke could be seen from a
distance, and detonations could be heard ten kilometers (6 miles)
away.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attack on the villages, the
ethnic Albanian source said.
	   A Serbian version of events reported by the Media Center in
Pristina said that early Saturday a group of ``extremists''
attacked Serbian police forces securing the Decani-Pec road. The
road runs close to the area of fighting. The report said police
forces pushed the rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army into nearby
forests.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav state-run Tanjug news agency reported
Saturday evening that Serbian police had ``neutralized terrorist
groups'' in two villages southwest of Decani, saying they were now
fully under police control.
	   It said KLA fighters were believed on the run in the direction
of Junik, a major KLA stronghold that has been under recurrent
heavy attack by government forces.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia whose population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.
	   Serbian Interior Ministry officials in Pristina Saturday showed
reporters and photographers what they said were weapons and
documents seized from rebels after recent battles, including
Chinese anti-tank mines, German uniforms and American helmets.
	   The Albanian source also said fighting resumed at another
location, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina, where
government forces reportedly burned two villages and kept firing
grenades on a number of others to flush out the guerrillas. In an
earlier report, it spoke of five people killed. There were no other
details.
	   A decision by a prominent Albanian opposition politician to lead
the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army has widened the
split between the rebel organization and Rugova, the longtime
ethnic Albanian leader.
	   Adem Demaci, Rugova's chief rival, announced his decision Friday
after Rugova failed to persuade the KLA to join his team. By doing
so, Demaci in effect established himself as an alternative leader
of the province's majority Albanian community.

Japanese official says satisfied with probe in U.N. killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's deputy foreign minister said Saturday he
was satisfied with the investigation into the killings of four
United Nations workers in the Central Asian country of Tajikistan.
	   Three U.N. military observers and their Tajik translator were
shot at point-blank range while on patrol in eastern Tajikistan in
July.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the killings, but Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmonov has called the killers ``traitors'' of
the Tajik people and suggested opposition fighters were involved.
	   Japan's deputy foreign minister, Kuezo Takemi, and two others
Japanese officials were in the former Soviet republic seeking
information about the investigation. On Saturday they met with
Rakhmonov in his capital, Dushanbe.
	   Takemi said Rakhmonov assured him the killers will be found and
punished, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

Albanian source confirms arrest of a fifth alleged suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian authorities have arrested
another Egyptian national wanted in his country for an alleged
assassination attempt, a police source in the Albanian capital said
Sunday.
	   The source, who spoke on condition of strict anonymity, said on
Thursday Ahmed Ismail Osman, an Egyptian national, was arrested in
Tirana. He gave no other details and refused to say if Osman had
been extradited.
	   Albanian Interior Ministry officials so far have denied Osman's
arrest.
	   But the police source confirmed word from Yasser Tawfiq el-Siri,
an Egyptian exile in London, that Osman had been arrested on
Thursday. El-Siri heads the Islamic Observation Center in London.
	   The Albanian authorities reportedly arrested four alleged
Egyptian suspects in June and deported them to Egypt.
	   El-Siri told the AP that his organization fears that Osman, 32,
who is married to an Albanian woman and has a son, has already been
handed over to the Egyptian authorities.
	   El-Siri also said Osman was sentenced to death in absentia by an
Egyptian military court for taking part in 1993 attempted
assassination of then Prime Minister Atef Sedki.
	   Earlier this month, the London-based Arabic-language newspaper
Al-Hayat published a letter from a group calling itself the
International Islamic Front for Jihad. The letter vowed to avenge
the deportation of the four Egyptian nationals allegedly involved
in an assassination and a bomb attack. It accused the United States
of assisting their return to Cairo.
	   Although the Cairo government declines to comment on reports of
extraditions from Albania, the government-owned Egyptian Mail
published a story Saturday saying Albania had deported four
``terrorists'' to Cairo.
	   It said the four men had been arrested by the Albanian
authorities on June 28 ``on the basis of information provided by
the CIA that they have close connections with terrorist
organizations.''
	   The arrest of Osman, a fifth suspect, was the front-page lead
story in Saturday's edition of Al-Hayat, one of the two most
authoritative newspapers in the Arab world.
	   Albanian sources earlier told The AP that the four other
suspects had been spirited out of the country by U.S. agents.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the sources said the four
men were wanted for the 1993 assassination of Rifaat el-Mahgoub,
the speaker of the Egyptian parliament, and an abortive attempt to
blow up the Khan el-Khalili market in Cairo several years later.

Security Minister says hangings to resume in two weeks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CAROLL ORR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, Jamaica (AP) _ A gallows unused for 10 years will
return to active duty August 27 when Neville Lewis is put to death
for killing a motorist who asked him for directions, a top Jamaican
official said Friday.
	   National Security Minister K.D. Knight said that not to resume
hangings would make a mockery of the law in a country plagued with
a high murder rate.
	   ``If hanging is the penalty, as it is in Jamaica, then those who
ought to hang, ought to be hanged,'' he said. ``Otherwise the law
will become a laughing stock.''
	   Along with other Caribbean countries, Jamaica has taken steps to
make it easier to hang convicted killers. Last year, it withdrew
the right of convicts to appeal to a United Nations committee.
	   London's Privy Council, which serves as the highest appeals
court for this former British colony, ruled in 1993 that it was
illegal to hang a criminal more than five years after sentencing.
	   The Jamaica government said convicts were abusing the appeals
process to the United Nations in order to delay _ and thereby avoid
_ execution.
	   Opinion polls show public support for hangings in Jamaica. In
1997, a record 1,038 homicides were reported in the nation of 2.6
million people. By comparison, New York City recorded fewer than
800 homicides last year among a population nearly three times as
large.
	   Lewis, the man scheduled to die Aug. 27, was convicted of
killing Vic Higgs, a 59-year-old consultant to the Jamaica Tourist
Board in October, 1994. Because a road was blocked, Higgs asked
Lewis and another man for directions and gave them a ride in his
car.
	   The two men were convicted of robbing Higgs, strangling him and
dumping his body in a lake.
	   Lewis' accomplice is also on death row.

Police in Azerbaijan arrest 300 people: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rally over. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested 300 opposition protesters during a
rally in Baku, the capital of the former Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan, Russian news agencies reported.
	   They also arrested 10 independent journalists, said National
Front leader Abulfaz Elcibey, a former president of Azerbaijan,
according to ITAR-Tass. A Radio Liberty reporter was arrested in
the city of Gadzha, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Interfax said Azerbaijani police blocked Elcibey's home for more
than an hour, trying to prevent him and other opposition activists
from attending the protests.
	   The National Front and Musavat opposition parties organized the
rallies to protest preparations for presidential elections
scheduled for Oct. 11. The opposition has said it will boycott the
vote because the country was undemocratic and the election would
likely be unfair.
	   ITAR-Tass said more than 20,000 people attended a rally at the
Baku car racing track. Other media said the figure was
significantly lower, closer to 5,000.
	   The protesters called for democratic elections and urged the
country's current leaders to resign over their handling of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed region located inside Azerbaijan but
populated by ethnic Armenians.
	   President Geidar Aliev, who is seeking re-election, has been
trying to improve his democratic credentials and recently issued a
decree abolishing most forms of censorship in the oil-rich country
of 7 million people on the Caspian Sea.
	   Aliev was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss. He came
to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993.

South Africa overcomes huge deficit to beat All Blacks in

Tri-Nations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's Springbok overcame a
huge deficit to beat New Zealand's All Black 24-23 on Saturday,
perhaps the best comeback in team history.
	   They had trailed at one point 23-5. But Joost van der
Westhuizen, Bobby Skinstad and James Dalton all scored in the final
12 minutes.
	   The win, which local media called the greatest comeback in
Springbok history, gave South Africa five Tri-Nations points and
put the team firmly on top. However, the competition still hinges
on next Saturday's showdown against Australia.
	   South African right wing Stefan Terblanche scored the first try
in the third minute, on a pass from fullback Percy Montgomery. A
split-second earlier, All Black center Eroni Clarke had tried to
tackle Montgomery. He might as well have tried to tackle a
refrigerator. Montgomery flipped the ball to Terblanche.
	   From then until the 66th minute, New Zealand dominated.
	   A raid down the left flank by Jonah Lomu resulted in a try for
Justin Marshall. Andrew Mehrtens converted to make it 7-5.
	   Captain Taine Randell scored under the posts after Isitolo Maka
had burst through the South African defense.
	   From under the posts the conversion was a mere formality for
Mehrtens, who made it 14-5, then added three more points minutes
later.
	   The Springboks conceded a penalty in a ruck on the Kiwi
goalline.
	   Mehrtens, in the first minute of the second half, struck a
long-range penalty then made it 23-5 in the 66th minute with
another penalty.
	   That's when South Africa showed why they are the world champion
rugby team.
	   Van der Westhuizen scored from a scrum in the opposition
22-meter (24-yard) area in the 69th minute.
	   Replacement flank Skinstad scored in the 73rd minute when he
finished off after a surge down the right.
	   Montgomery converted both tries, cutting the deficit to 23-19.
	   The Springboks snatched the victory after taking play deep into
All Black territory. Lock Krynauw Otto took a line-out ball well
and South Africa mauled their way over, with the try credited to
hooker Dalton.

irregular heartbeat while visiting a friend in New York and was
expected to remain there for tests and observation for a few days,
her publicist said Saturday.
	   ``She is in the hospital. She will stay for a few days for
observation because of defibrillation, but she didn't have a heart
attack,'' Beebee Kline, Loren's longtime publicist, said in
debunking rumors about the 63-year-old actress's health. ``She'll
have some tests on Monday. I'm encouraging her to take a little
rest.''
	   Loren was being examined for arrhythmia, Kline said. Arrhythmia
is a variation in the normal rhythm of the heartbeat and can be
fatal.
	   Loren had returned from a trip to Geneva, Switzerland only days
before flying into New York on Monday and was fatigued, Kline said
from her Los Angeles-area home.
	   ``This is the first time this has happened. She's always been a
pretty healthy person,'' said Kline, who has known the actress for
about 25 years. ``It's so unusual for her not to feel well.''
	   Kline denied reports that Loren was undergoing plastic surgery
when she fell ill.
	   She learned of the actress' hospitalization on Friday but was
unsure of when or where she was admitted, Kline said.
	   On Friday, a spokesman at the hospital where she was reportedly
taken, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, denied a report by
the New York Daily News that the Italian-born actress was being
treated there.
	   In Italy, the Milan daily Corriere della Sera quoted Loren's
producer-husband Carlo Ponti as saying from his LA-area home that
he informed Venice film festival officials that his wife won't be
able to attend their Sept. 3 ceremony to receive an award honoring
her career.
	   ``She must take a month to rest and look after herself,'' Ponti
said. He blamed a ``particularly tiring trip because of (flight)
delays and the excessive heat of New York'' for a minor
``cardiovascular collapse from which she has already recovered.''

13 foreigners escape from juvenile prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police Saturday were searching for 13
foreign teenagers who escaped from a juvenile prison just north of
the capital, local media reported.
	   A total of 15 had fled the prison, located in the town of
Avlona, by jumping over a four-meter high outer wall, Athens'
private Mega channel reported. Two were arrested by guards just
outside the prison.
	   According to media reports, a large group of foreign teenagers
was exercising in the prison courtyard when the 15 fled. Mega
reported that security was apparently low at the prison because
many of the guards had taken the day off to celebrate the
Assumption of the Virgin, one of Greece's most important religious
holidays.

Man wakes up to find strange Python in his room
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A man woke up Saturday to discover a three
and-a-half meter (11.5-foot) long snake sleeping in the bedroom of
his ground floor central Athens apartment, but had no idea how it
got there, media reports said.
	   Antonis Antoniou, 38, reportedly startled the python, which then
slithered into the kitchen and hid in a cupboard.
	   After recovering from the initial shock, Antoniou notified
police, who contacted the manager of a local reptile show for
assistance.
	   The snake, which is not poisonous, was eventually captured and
is being temporarily housed in a snake exhibition, local media
reported.
	   Although authorities are uncertain as to where the python came
from, local media speculated that one of Antoniou's neighbors may
have been keeping it as a pet, and it had gone in search of food
after its owners left on vacation.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people left Athens for celebrations
Saturday of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, one of Greece's most
important religious holidays.

Caribbean leader considers ended anti-drug cooperation with U.S.

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Caribbean countries should not renew
their anti-drug trafficking agreements with the United States
because the Clinton administration has not kept its promises, Prime
Minister Owen Arthur said.
	   Wrapping up a two-day debate on foreign policy, Arthur said
Friday night that the United States has not kept the promises made
by U.S. President Bill Clinton at the U.S.-Caribbean Summit held
here in May, 1997.
	   Arthur said he would not renew the so-called Shiprider
agreement, which allows U.S. authorities to enter other countries'
territorial waters in anti-drug trafficking efforts, if Washington
does not act on the trade issues so important to the small
Caribbean countries.
	   Arthur's comments were the latest sign of frustration among
Caribbean leaders with U.S. policies. Regional leaders say
relations are two much of a one-way street: the United States gets
the cooperation it wants in fighting drugs, but the Caribbean
countries get no help on the trade issues so crucial to their small
economies.
	   The interests of both sides ``must flow in tandem,'' said
Arthur.
	   ``You cannot expect to have progress in the fight against drugs
while that part of the Bridgetown Accord that deals with the banana
regime is not being honored,'' Arthur said, referring to U.S.
complaints to the World Trade Organization that have hurt Caribbean
banana producers.
	   While Arthur focused on the banana issue, Caribbean countries
have also complained that the North American Free Trade Agreement
has hurt their exports to the United States and the U.S. trade
embargo of Cuba also limits their economic activity.

Czech tourist shot while walking in Albanian mountains

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A Czech tourist hiking in the
Albanian mountains near the Yugoslav border has been shot and
wounded, Czech television reported Saturday.
	   The incident happened on Wednesday. The man, identified in the
report only as Ivan D., was shot in the chest with a bullet coming
from the other side of the border and underwent surgery in Tirana,
the Albanian capital, but was reported out of danger, TV reported.
	   The Czech tourist arrived in Albania five days ago from Greece
to enjoy the spectacular mountain scenery in Albania, the report
said. It provided no other details.
	   Late Friday, Ilir Cano, the Albanian deputy interior minister,
claimed that the man, first identified as Ivan Dikar, 24, was a
German reporter who was hit by a Yugoslav sniper while in the
rebellious Serbian Kosovo province.
	   The man was later reported to be a Czech by the name of Ivan
Diken. He had allegedly been taken across the Yugoslav-border by
ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for the independence of Kosovo
and then helicoptered to Tirana.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb killed 21 people and
wounded scores Saturday in a crowded market town. A telephone
warning encouraged police to evacuate people closer to the blast,
one of the worst atrocities in three decades of conflict in
Northern Ireland.
	   The blast shattered a busy shopping street in Omagh, a
religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast.
	   The 21 dead included an 18-month-old child, said Ronnie Martin,
clinical services manager of Tyrone County Hospital.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder, by
murderers who have nothing else to offer _ murderers who gave us a

police chief, told reporters in Omagh.

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Police arrested 300 opposition
protesters during a rally Saturday in Baku, the capital of the
former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, but released most of them by
the end of the day.
	   The arrested included 10 independent journalists, said National
Front leader Abulfaz Elcibey, a former president of Azerbaijan,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. A Radio Liberty reporter
was arrested in the city of Gadzha, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Interfax news agency said Azerbaijani police blocked
Elcibey's home for more than an hour, trying to prevent him and
other opposition activists from attending the protests.
	   The National Front and Musavat opposition parties organized the
rally to protest preparations for presidential elections scheduled
for Oct. 11. The opposition has said it will boycott the vote
because the country was undemocratic and the election would likely
be unfair.
	   Witnesses said as many as 50,000 people attended a rally at the
Baku car racing track, but Russian media said the figure was
significantly lower, closer to 5,000.
	   The protesters called for democratic elections and urged the
country's current leaders to resign over their handling of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed region located inside Azerbaijan but
populated by ethnic Armenians.
	   President Geidar Aliev, who is seeking re-election, has been
trying to improve his democratic credentials and recently issued a
decree abolishing most forms of censorship in the oil-rich country
of 7 million people on the Caspian Sea.
	   Aliev was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss. He came
to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993.

Death threat, rumors alarm U.S. students on Caribbean island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMES ANDERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ It stunned the 280
American students cramming for finals at the Caribbean veterinary
school surrounded by shimmering fields of breeze-blown sugar cane.
	   An accused drug trafficker was threatening to randomly kill
American students at the Ross University campus on St. Kitts if
Washington succeeds in extraditing him, the U.S. State Department
says.
	   ``We will not tell you to leave and we will not tell you to
stay,'' a frustrated student, who declined to be identified,
recalled one U.S. official sent to the island as saying.
	   ``Everyone was shocked for a day or two. A couple of days
studying was ruined,'' said Duncan Medlock, 28, a second-year
student from El Paso, Texas. Many did leave, opting to take finals
in September.
	   The U.S. State Department said two weeks ago that the threat had
been made by Charles ``Little Nut'' Miller, a St. Kitts businessman
wanted in Florida on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine. But
it provided few clear-cut details.
	   Miller's house, sporting lion statuettes and security cameras,
is up the road from the Ross campus. Miller denies he made the
threat, and he denies the drug charges.
	   Nevertheless, it frightened students who live all over this
mountainous island of 32,000. And it created a no-win situation for
St. Kitts' government, which is investigating while assuring
visitors they are safe.
	   ``We continue to view that threat very, very seriously,'' said
Prime Minister Denzil L. Douglas, whose government bolstered
security for the students. He said he understood the United States
probably had reason to withhold details on its source but lamented
the fact that ``it was so non-specific.''
	   Washington didn't issue a travel advisory warning Americans
against visiting St. Kitts. But it did send diplomatic security
officials to the island and urged its government to call in the
Regional Security System, a Caribbean police and defense force.
	   That rankled Douglas' government, which noted officials from the
force came to St. Kitts and concluded there was no need to summon
troops. Police did put Miller under surveillance.
	   At Washington's behest, Douglas' government began the
extradition case against Miller in 1996 and obtained attorneys to
argue it for the United States.
	   A magistrate denied extradition last year, but a higher court
ruled this should be reconsidered. The next hearing is set for Oct.
12 but, with appeals possible, the case could take months.
	   Police Commissioner Calvin Fahie said he had little information
on the alleged threat. He said on Aug. 5 Miller told him: ``I did
not threaten any Ross University student or tell anybody I am going
to kill anyone at Ross University. ... I live among them. They are
my friends.''
	   Fahie said some things don't add up. Why, for example, would
Miller make life difficult for himself in the one place where he is
safe for the moment?

peace process. It is designed to wreck the process and everyone
should work to ensure the peace process continues,'' McGuinness
said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Two young girls wept at their mother's
grave Saturday, while investigators labored to identify the bombers
who killed her and 256 others in attacks on U.S. embassies in East
Africa.
	   ``We shall miss our dear mother greatly,'' Grace Christine
Wakanyi, 12, and Maryanne Wambui, 10, said in unison during the
funeral beneath a fragrant eucalyptus tree. Many sobbed in the
crowd of hundreds, some of whom wore bandages on their bombing
wounds.
	   The FBI says it will take at least another month to finish
examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S. embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   ``The investigation is like a jigsaw puzzle of 10,000 pieces,''
said Kenneth Piernick, head of the FBI investigation in Tanzania.
``We have some pieces, but still 9,990 pieces remain.''
	   In Washington on Saturday, officials said U.S. investigators
were heading to Pakistan to join the investigation of a man who is
reported to have confessed to planning the bombings.
	   Pakistani newspapers, citing unidentified government sources,
said 32-year-old Mohammed Sadique was detained at the Karachi
airport after flying back from Nairobi the day of the bombings.
Detained because he did not match the photograph in his passport,
he reportedly confessed to a role in the bombings under
interrogation.
	   Just two of 14 foreigners arrested in connection with Tanzania
bombing were still being interrogated, police said. Neither was
among ``the perpetrators of the offense,'' but may be able to
assist in the investigation, said Rajabi Adabi, director of
criminal investigations.
	   Five people remained in custody in connection with the Kenya
bombing, according to police.

Canada defeats Uruguay 38-15 in world cup qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Bob Ross led Canada's national
rugby union team to a 38-15 victory over Uruguay in a World Cup
qualifying game Saturday, scoring three penalties, three
conversions and a try.
	   The winner of the four-team tournament, which also includes the
United States and Argentina, qualifies for the 1999 world cup in
Wales.
	   Federico Sciarra opened the scoring for Uruguay with a penalty
in the 2nd minute.
	   But as soon as the Canadians started to move the ball around,
they equalized the score with a penalty by Ross in the 10th.
	   From that point on, Canada took command of the game, increasing
their lead with tries by Winston Stanley in the 12th minute and
John Graf in the 16th, both converted by Ross, and an unconverted
try by Ross in the 24th.
	   Ross converted another penalty in the 40th minute for a
half-time score of 28-3 for Canada.
	   In the second half, Canada continued to wreak havoc in the
Uruguayan defense, with a try by Colin Robertson converted by Ross
in the 46th minute and a Ross penalty in the 65th.
	   Uruguay tried to come back in the last half hour and managed two
consolation tries, by Diego Ormaechea in the 67th minute and by
Guillermo Storace, converted by Diego Aguirre, in the 78th.
	   Games are played at the Buenos Aires Cricket and Rugby Club in
the capital.

Seven suspects are accused of killing Bosnian Serb police chief

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In a continuing showdown
between two Bosnian Serb factions, police on Saturday accused seven
people of complicity in the murder of a police chief and handed the
case to the prosecutor's office.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, the Bosnian Serb
Interior Ministry indicated the seven were part of a larger group
loyal to former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the no. 1 war
crimes suspect, and to his chief hard-line aide, Momcilo Krajisnik,
currently the Serb member of Bosnia's three-man presidency.
	   The group of seven, all former police officers who had left or
were purged from the force when the moderates took power in the
Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, are accused of having organized and
carried out the killing of Srdjan Knezevic, a former military
commander and prominent peace-time police officer.
	   Knezevic was shot dead in front of his apartment last week amid
a feud between the hard-liners and the moderates, led by Biljana
Plavsic, president of the Serb entity in Bosnia.
	   Knezevic himself was once loyal to Karadzic but shifted his
loyalty to Plavsic.
	   The court case against the seven was certain to increase
tensions in the power struggle between the two camps ahead of
elections scheduled for September.
	   Earlier reports said that Karadzic's son, Sasa, was among about
30 arrested in the investigation of Knezevic's death. Karadzic's
wife, Ljiljana, on Saturday was reported to have denied that her
son was arrested or questioned. She said Sasa was abroad at the
time.
	   Saturday's police statement directly implicated a prominent
member of the hard-line faction, former police minister Dragan
Kijac, saying he allegedly took part in financing the group that
killed Knezevic.

Iraq criticizes the United States for its threats to use force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq rebuked the United States on Saturday
for threatening to use force over the issue of weapons inspectors,
saying America was not the world's policeman.
	   ``If the crisis is between Iraq and the United Nations, who
authorized the U.S. government to threaten to attack the Iraqi
people? Who appointed the American government as an international
police force?'' asked a spokesman for the Information and Culture
Ministry said.
	   The spokesman accused the United States of using ``the law of
the jungle in dealing with one of the founder members of the United
Nations,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Iraq's government to resume full cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors because ``there will be no sanctions relief if we can't
have inspections going on.''
	   Iraq suspended cooperation on Aug. 5 after the chief U.N.
inspector, Richard Butler, said he could not certify that Iraq had
eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction, as required for the
lifting of the sanctions imposed after Baghdad's forces invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   ``Let me ... make clear,'' Albright said, ``if necessary we will
use force on our timetable in response to threats, and at a time
and place of our choosing.''
	   The Iraqi spokesman said the U.S. threats were ``futile.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban militia claimed it had
captured a strategic town northwest of the capital on Saturday
after heavy fighting, inching closer to uniting Afghanistan under
its strict version of Islam.
	   Taliban fighters claimed to have captured Doshi, 160 kilometers
(100 miles) northwest of Kabul _ a crucial link between opposition
forces holed up in northern Panjshir valley and their allies in
central Bamiyan province.
	   The Hezb-e-Wahadat militia, a member of the anti-Taliban
alliance, denied that Doshi had fallen. The Salang Pass, which
links northern and southern Afghanistan, is controlled through
Doshi.
	   The Taliban also claimed victories in northern Badakshan
province and said the opposition was booted from six districts
after heavy fighting. Some local commanders and people revolted
against the opposition, according to a Taliban spokesman in Kabul
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Taliban ambassador in neighboring Pakistan, Maulvi
Saeed-ur-Rehman, told The Associated Press that the opposition was
also rooted from Nuristan, around 150 kilometers (90 miles)
northeast of Kabul and the capital of Laghman province. Rehman said
his fighters already held most of the area, and on Saturday moved
into nearby mountains.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, hammered badly by the Taliban in
recent weeks, controls only about 10 percent of Afghanistan,
including central Bamiyan province and the Panjshir Valley north of
Kabul.
	   The opposition's last strongholds are surrounded by Taliban
fighters, who snapped their enemy's only supply route from Central
Asia on Wednesday by capturing northern Hayratan.
	   The Taliban are on the verge of conquering all of Afghanistan.
They have vowed to restore peace in the war ravaged country and
transform it into a purist Islamic state.
	   In a radio address Friday, supreme Taliban leader Mullah Omar
assured Afghans that democracy and human rights will have a place
in this state, but added Muslim scholars will have to define these
terms.
	   In the parts of the country the Taliban already control, their
interpretation of Islam has angered human rights activists. Women
are confined to the home, girls are denied education, and
television, movies and books have been banned, thieves have their
hands cut off and murderers are publicly executed.
	   Muslim scholars in other countries say Taliban rules owe more to
tribal traditions than to the Koran _ Islam's holy book.
	   Omar also assured his neighbors they need not fear a total
Taliban victory.
	   Former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear that if the Taliban
gain control of all of Afghanistan, there will be an influx of
refugees and weapons across their borders.
	   On Saturday, Russia's envoy to the Commonwealth of Independent
States, which loosely groups former Soviet republics, said his
country would strike back if Taliban fighters crossed in Central
Asia.
	   Another neighbor, predominately Shiite Muslim Iran, has been
suspicious of the rise of the conservative Taliban, who adhere to
the Sunni sect of Islam. Iran accuses the Taliban of abducting 11
Iranians, including diplomats, in Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold
the anti-Taliban coalition recently lost.
	   In Tehran, the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister said Saturday
that Pakistan's ambassador to Kabul would fly Sunday to the
southern Afghan town of Qandahar to negotiate the release of the
Iranians.
	   Alaeddin Boroujerdi said he had received information from
various sources that the Iranians were well and being held in
Qandahar, about 360 miles (575 kilometers) southwest of
Mazar-e-Sharif, Iran Radio reported.
	   Iran, which is suspected of supporting the anti-Taliban
coalition, has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety.

Fun set to begin in season's final major
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with course record, Singh beginning play &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The club pros are gone, along with
the U.S. Open champion. The fun can finally begin under the
monstrous trees of Sahalee Country Club.
	   Two days of play weeded out the pretenders at the U.S. PGA
Championship and made Vijay Singh the midway leader. But it did
little else other than to turn the year's last major into a
wide-open event going into the final 36 holes.
	   On a golf course that grew more difficult by the hour Friday
afternoon, a cluster of big names lurked within a few shots of
Singh, while a handful of players seeking their first major
championship were close behind.
	   Early play Saturday had all the makings of a shootout, with
Singh still hanging onto the lead by a shot after parring the first
hole.
	   Under a light drizzle that should keep Sahalee soft, Ian Woosnam
and Fred Couples both shot 67s that put them six strokes off the
lead at 2 over.
	   Then Greg Kraft went out and set a course record with a 65 that
beat by a shot the mark set by Tiger Woods on Thursday and equaled
by Singh a day later.
	   The forecast called for a mix of sun and clouds for Saturday
afternoon, when the leaders were due to tee off. But it was still
overcast when Woods birdied the first hole to move within a shot of
the lead. Woods quickly gave the shot back on the second hole after
hitting his second shot into the trees.
	   The story lines abounded, from Davis Love III's attempt to
repeat as champion to Mark O'Meara's bid to become the first to win
three majors in one season since Ben Hogan 45 years ago.
	   Colin Montgomerie was a stroke back and trying not to finish
second in a major once again. Woods, meanwhile, was trying to win
his second major. U.S. Open champ Lee Janzen was not so lucky. He
was gone after a 148.
	   ``I've played a lot of weekends going into the lead or close to
the lead,'' Singh said. ``But this is something different, I think.
The pressure of a major tournament is always different than a
normal tournament.''
	   That pressure figures only to get worse if Singh takes a good
look at the leaderboard just behind him.
	   Singh's 66 tied the course record set by Woods a day earlier,
but did little more than give him a one-shot lead over a trio of
golfers led by Montgomerie and two over the likes of Woods, Love
and 1995 PGA champion Steve Elkington.
	   ``I haven't come over here to finish second,'' said Montgomerie,
who has done just that in three previous majors. ``The hardest
thing to do is get into contention. We'll go from there.''
	   Singh had the advantage of a morning tee time at Sahalee, where
the fairways and greens grew increasingly firm as the day went on
and players had trouble getting the ball close to pins tucked
behind traps and on ledges.
	   But the sunshine that was making the course more difficult
changed Saturday, with typical Seattle weather _ cool, damp and
overcast conditions _ greeting morning golfers.
	   Woods played in the afternoon Friday and struggled early. After
making seven birdies a day earlier, he made only one on the 16th
hole and had to make some putts just to salvage a 72.
	   Still, Woods liked his position going into the weekend.
	   ``Right now I'm in ideal shape,'' Woods said.
	   Love was right with Woods despite a blunder with his driver that
cost him a double bogey on No. 15 as he tried to add a second PGA
to the emotional win he had a year ago at Winged Foot. And he was
just as comfortable with his position two shots back after a 68.
	   ``It's a good spot to be in,'' Love said. ``I feel very
fortunate to be in the tournament.''
	   Love played late in the day with O'Meara, who was lurking in
contention for a third major title in 1998.
	   Just as he was at the Masters and British Open, O'Meara was not
in the lead, but wasn't too far out of it after two rounds.
	   ``At least I've given myself a chance going into the weekend,''
O'Meara said after an even-par round that included a pitch-in
birdie at No. 6 and an eagle on No. 11.
	   For the third straight major, par was beginning to be a score to
shoot at as the fairways and greens firmed up in unseasonable heat
and the pin positions got trickier.
	   ``It was like Sunday afternoon at a major,'' said Brad Faxon,
who was two back.
	   Woods led by two shots going into the round, but Singh passed
him with five front-nine birdies by the time Woods stepped to the
first tee.
	   Singh shot 30 on the front side, then added a 1-over 36 on the
back to give the rest of the field a score to shoot at.
	   ``End of the day, this is a major and I need to focus on what I
was doing,'' Singh said. ``I think that's what I did and I did
really good.''
	   Focus may be the key on a weekend where the slightest mistake
can be the difference between winning and losing.
	   Of the leaders, only Woods, Love and O'Meara have won majors.
Montgomerie has come in second three times, while players like
Scott Gump have never contended.
	   ``I think your nerves are a little bit edgy anytime you are
close to the lead whether you have won a major or not,'' O'Meara
said. ``The guys who have won, though, have a better understanding
of that pressure and how to deal with it.''

question a man who was reported to have confessed to bombing two
American embassies in East Africa, U.S. authorities said Saturday.
	   The Central Intelligence Agency made arrangements late Friday
for agents to question the man, who was arrested or detained by
Pakistani authorities, according to a U.S. law enforcement official
in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   An FBI legal attache permanently assigned to the U.S. Embassy in
Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, also was believed looking into
possible connections between the suspect in custody and the East
Africa bombings, the source said.
	   The suspect, identified as 32-year-old Mohammed Sadique, was
detained as he tried to slip into Afghanistan from Pakistan, the
Pakistani newspaper The News reported in its Sunday edition. The
paper quoted unidentified government officials as saying Sadique
confessed to planning the Aug. 7 bombings at the embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The nearly
simultaneous attacks killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500
people.
	   The embassy in Islamabad and the State Department and FBI in
Washington would not comment on the reported suspect. Pakistani
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said he had no knowledge of
the case, as did Pakistani intelligence sources contacted by The
Associated Press.
	   In a related development, a Kenyan guard at the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi identified a photograph shown to him by the FBI as someone
he had seen at the bombing, the U.S. official said. The official
would not identify the person in the photograph. But Knight Ridder
News Service said he was an associate of dissident Saudi
millionaire Osama bin Laden, an avowed foe of the United States who
has urged his followers to wage holy war on Americans in Saudi
Arabia and U.S. targets elsewhere.
	   The Pakistani newspaper did not report whether Sadique was
linked to bin Laden or whether he offered a motive. However, the
paper said he received help in Kenya from sympathizers with
connections to the Islamic Jihad organization in Egypt.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad, which translates
loosely into Islamic Holy War. Before the bombings, a group known
as the Islamic Jihad, considered the successor to the assassins who
killed Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981, reportedly vowed to
strike America interests because some of its members were arrested
in Albania.
	   The News reported that Sadique was detained on Aug. 7 at the
Karachi airport by immigration officials because he failed to match
his passport photograph. He was arrested after trying to bribe the
officials, the paper said.
	   Sadique reportedly confessed to the bombings under interrogation
and said two of his conspirators had left Nairobi and entered
Afghanistan a few days earlier.
	   Umat, a small Karachi newspaper that had reported Sadique's
arrest earlier in the week, said in a report Saturday that the
other two men to whom Sadique referred, identified only as Mohammed
Saleh and Abdullah, were later arrested.

Chris Webber fined for marijuana possession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHELLE FAUL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Basketball star Chris Webber
encountered more problems with the law when he was fined dlrs 500
for carrying marijuana in his luggage at San Juan's airport,
customs officials said Saturday.
	   Customs officials said the Sacramento Kings forward was briefly
detained Friday night. He then continued traveling from the
Dominican Republic to Barbados on a trip sponsored by the sporting
goods company Fila.
	   Webber is to play in a fundraiser game Monday in Barbados.
However, an official with the Barbados Amateur Basketball
Association said Webber had not arrived by Saturday morning.
	   Webber, who had 11 grams of marijuana in his luggage, was
traveling with Jerry Stackhouse of the Detroit Pistons and other
athletes. Stackhouse arrived in Barbados on Friday night but could
not be reached for comment.
	   The customs department said that because of the small amount of
marijuana involved, Webber was not cited for smuggling and would
not be prosecuted for possession.
	   A customs dog on a routine inspection in the transit lounge at
Luis Munoz Marin International Airport sniffed a carry-on bag that
was tagged with Stackhouse's name, customs said. Stackhouse denied
the bag was his, and Webber admitted it belonged to him.
	   It was the latest in a series of legal problems for Webber, who
was traded in May from the Washington Wizards to Sacramento. The
trade was prompted in part by his off-court turmoil.
	   Webber is awaiting trial for a January arrest that stemmed from
a traffic stop on his way to practice with the Wizards in Maryland.
He faces charges of marijuana possession, second-degree assault and
resisting arrest.
	   In May, a grand jury declined to prosecute Webber in a complaint
filed by a woman who said she was sexually assaulted at a party in
Maryland in April. Webber's lawyer said he left the party before
the attack is said to have happened.
	   The NBA and its players are in the midst of a lockout, and
contact between players and teams is prohibited.
	   ``Due to the lockout, the team has to decline all comments,''
Kings spokesman Troy Hanson said.
	   Only heroin and cocaine are covered in the drug agreement
between the NBA and the union. The league would like to add
provisions dealing with marijuana and alcohol abuse.
	   Union director Billy Hunter said last week the sides were near
an accord that would add marijuana to the list of banned
substances.

Car bomb kills 21, wounds 100 in Northern Ireland's deadliest

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb tore apart the crowded
center of this bustling market town Saturday, killing at least 21
people, maiming more than 100, and dealing a barbaric blow to
Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, was the
single most deadly act in three decades of conflict in Northern
Ireland. Among those slain were women and children, Protestant and
Catholic alike, many of them unwittingly evacuated towards the bomb
after police received a misleading phoned warning.
	   The local Tyrone County Hospital overflowed with wounded.
Survivors used blown-off doors as makeshift stretchers. Others were
ferried by ambulance or helicopter to hospitals in Belfast and
Londonderry. The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with
glass and rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Catholic resident of the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   Among the dead was an 18-month-old child.
	   ``The carnage, the children, a young baby _ pure black,
unrecognizable,'' said a Protestant local, Frank Hancock, too
stunned to cry over what he'd seen. ``A young girl down a manhole
that we had to pull out. A young lad burning, his hair pure
singeing.
	   ``Any man who puts that (bomb) there,'' he said, pointing
angrily at the bomb site, ``and says, `We're the ``real'' IRA' _
they're cowards.''
	   The attack coincided with the 29th anniversary of the deployment
of British troops in Belfast, a traditional rallying point for
Irish Republican Army supporters. It also came 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the compromise April
agreement among eight local parties on how this British-ruled
territory should be governed. The White House said Clinton's plans
would not be affected.
	   No group claimed responsibility for planting the 500-pound (200
kg) bomb in the religiously mixed town, which was crowded with
weekend shoppers and families attending a festival.
	   But politicians unanimously blamed IRA dissidents who are
committed to shattering the outlawed group's 13-month-old truce and
the peace agreement it helped inspire. Dissidents have planted
several car bombs in other Northern Ireland towns in recent months,
which caused many injuries but no deaths because of swift action by
police.
	   This time, a phoned warning to the BBC newsroom in Belfast
claimed that a bomb was left outside Omagh's courthouse on High
Street, atop a slope on the west end of town. Police began
directing people away from the area _ many of them east down Market
Street. The blast 20 minutes later occurred behind the security
cordon, tearing apart buildings and people alike.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder ... who
gave us a totally inaccurate warning,'' said Northern Ireland
Police Chief Ronnie Flanagan.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed that breakaway IRA
members _ believed to number no more than 100 and mostly based in
the Irish Republic _ would be ``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in France, told
the BBC that he found it ``impossible to get in the mind of anyone
who could possibly do such a thing.''
	   In a statement Queen Elizabeth II said she was ``shocked to hear
of the appalling crime in Omagh.''
	   Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic leader, John Hume, said the
atrocity was ``carried out by undiluted fascists. Obviously they're
trying to impose their will by murder on the people of Ireland,
north and south.''
	   Martin McGuinness, chief negotiator of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, said he was ``appalled and disgusted'' by this
``indefensible action.''
	   ``It's designed to wreck the peace process, and everyone should
work to ensure that the peace process continues,'' said McGuinness,
the IRA's reputed former commander.
	   The attack harkened back to the province's darkest days of the
1970s, when the IRA bombed commercial centers in Belfast,
Londonderry and England in hopes of wrecking Northern Ireland and
its British links.
	   Omagh's death toll eclipsed the previous worst attack in
Northern Ireland, when the IRA killed 18 soldiers with two bombs on
Aug. 27, 1979.
	   The IRA killed 21 in a double bombing of two pubs in Birmingham,
central England, in Nov. 21, 1974. The worst atrocity remains May
17, 1974, when three car bombs planted by a pro-British gang
fatally wounded 35 people in the Irish Republic.
	   The residents of normally content Omagh had never witnessed
anything like Saturday.
	   A retired fireman, Paddy McGowan, said his car ``lifted off the
ground'' when the Omagh bomb went off. He, like many drivers, saw
the billowing smoke, stopped their cars and ran to the scene to try
to help.
	   ``It was absolute carnage, the most horrific I have ever seen,''
said McGowan, a 25-year veteran of the fire service ``through the
worst of years.''
	   Shaking, he said: ``There were bodies everywhere, and people
covered in blood screaming. Everywhere there seemed to be a
terrible loss of blood, a terrible loss of limbs, and people
obviously dead.''

Fresh government attack on villages dims hopes for peace talks

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A new all-out Serbian attack against
Kosovo villages controlled by secessionist rebels Saturday dampened
hopes for early talks on the future of the embattled Serbian
province.
	   The government offensive in western Kosovo came two days after
ethnic Albanian pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a
negotiating team for talks with the government.
	   Government forces, using tanks, jets and helicopters, launched a
coordinated attack on at least nine villages in western Kosovo near
the Albanian border, the ethnic Albanians claimed. Fighting also
raged elsewhere in the province.
	   According to Belgrade's independent radio B92, both police and
the army apparently were involved in the attack in which tanks and
helicopters were used. It did not mention warplanes.
	   As the Serbian forces shelled the villages in an attempt to
force ethnic Albanian rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade
invited Rugova's team to start negotiations as early as next week.
	   However, a statement released by the Democratic League of
Kosovo, Rugova's party, said hopes for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to ``start to act seriously, once again turned out to be
futile.''
	   Rugova said already on Friday that the government offensive must
stop before peace talks can begin. The offensive appeared to rule
out an early start of such negotiations.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported that at 6 a.m. Saturday,
government forces opened fire on the village Logja and at least
eight other area villages, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Pristina near the Albanian border.
	   The center said in two hours a total of 200 hundred grenades hit
Logja. Later it reported that after they ebbed for a while, the
attacks on Logja resumed. There was no immediate word on
casualties.
	   The area remained inaccessible, but smoke could be seen from a
distance, and detonations could be heard ten kilometers (6 miles)
away.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attack on the villages, the
ethnic Albanian source said.
	   According to the Serbian version of events, the Media Center in
Pristina reported that early Saturday a group of ``extremists''
attacked Serbian police forces securing the Decani-Pec road. The
road runs close to the area of fighting. In a counterattack, police
forces reportedly pushed the rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army
into nearby forests.
	   Radio B92, citing its own military sources, said later Serbian
police had pushed the KLA from most of the contested villages,
forcing the guerrillas to move closer to Radonjicko Jezero, where
the army maintains a base.
	   Also in Belgrade, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug earlier
reported that KLA fighters were believed on the run in the
direction of Junik, a major KLA stronghold that has been under
recurrent heavy attack by government forces.

Arrests warrants issued against two priests in slaying of
</HEADLINE>
Guatemalan bishop &QL; 
 &UR; By ALFONSO ANZUETO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan police have issued arrest
warrants for two more priests in connection with the April killing
of a Roman Catholic bishop and human rights activist, the Guatemala
City archbishop said Saturday.
	   Bishop Juan Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in his garage on
April 26, two days after he delivered a church human rights report
blaming the military and pro-government death squads for most of
the deaths during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in
1996.
	   A gag order restricts official comment on the case, but
Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio confirmed that warrants were
issued against the Revs. Efrain Hernandez and Marco Aurelio
Gonzalez Idearte.
	   Penados del Barrio said Hernandez and Gonzalez would present
themselves to the investigating tribunal accompanied by defense
attorneys, but did not indicate when.
	   Police in July arrested the Rev. Mario Orantes Najera in
connection with Gerardi's death.
	   Last month, Ronalth Ochaeta of the Archbishop's Human Rights
Office claimed that two military men were involved in the slaying.
	   Guatemala's defense minister has said the military will hand
over to investigators information on the two _ identified by local
media as Capt. Byron Miguel Lima Oliva, a member of the
presidential military staff, and his father, retired Col. Byron
Disrael Estrada.

	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ The presidents of Peru and Ecuador
agreed Saturday to renew negotiations and settle a long-standing
border dispute that has caused armed skirmishes.
	   Meeting after the inauguration of Paraguayan President Raul
Cubas, Ecuador's Jamil Nahuad said that ``it is the will of both
our nations to seek peace.''
	   Peru's Alberto Fujimori said that ``there were tense moments
lately, when our armed troops met face to face, but through
dialogue we have agreed to separate our forces.''
	   Tensions flared this week when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorean
troops of entering its territory in a ``clear provocation.''
	   At the time, Ecuador insisted its troops were not in Peruvian
territory, and Peru refused to continue internationally brokered
peace talks that had appeared close to resolving the dispute.
	   But after a meeting Thursday with Brazilian President Fernando
Cardoso, Fujimori agreed to let neutral peacekeepers separate rival
troops on the troubled border.
	   And in Buenos Aires, with Argentine President Carlos Menem at
his side, Fujimori said Friday that it was ``realistic to think
that a final accord could be signed in September.''
	   Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States are the
guarantors of a 1942 treaty that established the 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   The two countries clashed in 1981 and 1995 over the Cordillera
del Condior, a 49-mile (79-kilometer) stretch of still unmarked
jungle border.

Bekegir of Ethiopia disqualified for pushing spectators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a rare finish to a race, first-place finisher
Tisfye Bekegir of Ethiopia was disqualified for pushing and shoving
spectators during the New York Road Runners Club Manhattan
Half-Marathon on Saturday.
	   As a result, Jerod Neas of Princeton, New Jersey was declared
the winner of the 13.1-mile (21.1-kilometer) race. Neas, who
finished 300 yards (273 meters) ahead of Kidane Gebremichael of the
Westchester Track Club, was timed in 1 hour, 7 minutes, 40 seconds.
	   Bekegir took out his anger at some people who were on the
Central Park course walking, bicycling, or roller skating, thus
blocking his progress.
	   ``They were crowding me and I had to push them,'' he said. ``I
should not have been disqualified. I knew I was going to win the
race.''
	   Milka Jepchirchir of the Westchester Track Club was the women's
winner in 1 hour, 17 minutes, 30 seconds.

Monaco, Bordeaux and Marseille each maintain winning starts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nigerian striker Victor Ikpeba scored twice
Saturday as Monaco, in spectacular attacking form, thrashed
newly-promoted Sochaux 4-1 in the second round of matches in the
French first division.
	   Monaco, the 1997 French champion, is one of three clubs that
have taken a maximum six points from two matches.
	   Bordeaux and Marseille also won Saturday to keep up their
winning streaks at the start of the season.
	   In a breathtaking start, Portuguese midfielder Francisco Da
Costa scored for Monaco after just two minutes.
	   Bernard Maraval equalized for the visitors two minutes later,
but after nine minutes Ikpeba grabbed a second for Monaco.
	   Thierry Henry, who said last week that he wanted to quit Monaco
to join English champion Arsenal, scored the most spectacular goal
of the match with a stunning 30-meter (yard) shot just after half
time.
	   Ikpeba made it 4-1 seven minutes from the end.
	   Bordeaux, which beat Paris Saint-Germain in its opening game,
squeezed past Le Havre 3-2.
	   Silvain Wiltord, who scored against PSG, netted twice.
	   Wiltord scored within the first minute and his strike partner
Lillian Laslandes added a second just before half time.
	   Cyril Pouget pulled one back for the home team but Wiltord was
on hand again in the 52nd minute to make it 3-1.
	   Yugoslav striker Miladin Becanovic scored for Le Havre in the
56th minute but Bordeaux held on for a victory.
	   Powerhouse Marseille maintained its winning start with a 1-0 win
at last season's runner-up, Metz.
	   New signing Jocelyn Gourvennec scored the winner just before
half time.
	   Paris Saint-Germain, another big spender, won its first points
of the season, beating Bastia 2-0 in front of 42,000 spectators at
the Parc des Princes.
	   The host scored in the 26th minute with a goal by German
defender Christian Woerns, one of several expensive signings made
by new manager Alain Giresse during the summer.
	   PSG striker Patrice Loko missed two good chances before Marco
Simone made the game safe ten minutes into the second half.
	   PSG's French record signing Jay-Jay Okocha created both goals.
	   Goalkeeper Bernard Lama made his first appearance for PSG since
returning from a spell in England with West Ham United.
	   Auxerre beat Nancy 3-2, with Bernard Diomede bagging two
first-half goals.
	   In other games Montpellier overcame Rennes 3-1, while Nantes got
its first points of the season, beating Strasbourg 1-0.
	   In Friday's matches Lyon pounded Toulouse 6-1 at the Stade
Gerland, with experienced striker Alain Caveglia grabbing a pair,
while champion Lens was held 1-1 by newly-promoted Lorient.

Car bomb kills 25, wounds more than 150 in Northern Ireland's

deadliest attack
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more than 150 injured, statement from Gerry
Adams &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb tore apart the crowded
center of this bustling market town Saturday, killing at least 25
people, injuring more than 160, and dealing a barbaric blow to
Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, was the
single most deadly act in three decades of conflict in Northern
Ireland. Among those slain were women and children, Protestant and
Catholic alike, many of them unwittingly evacuated towards the bomb
after police received a misleading phoned warning.
	   The local Tyrone County Hospital overflowed with wounded.
Survivors used blown-off doors as makeshift stretchers. Others were
ferried by ambulance or helicopter to hospitals in Belfast and
Londonderry. The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with
glass and rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Catholic resident of the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   Among the dead was an 18-month-old child, and four others
younger than 18, police said.
	   ``The carnage, the children, a young baby _ pure black,
unrecognizable,'' said a Protestant local, Frank Hancock, too
stunned to cry over what he'd seen. ``A young girl down a manhole
that we had to pull out. A young lad burning, his hair pure
singeing.
	   ``Any man who puts that (bomb) there,'' he said, pointing
angrily at the bomb site, ``and says, `We're the ``real'' IRA' _
they're cowards.''
	   The attack coincided with the 29th anniversary of the deployment
of British troops in Belfast, a traditional rallying point for
Irish Republican Army supporters. It also came 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the compromise April
agreement among eight local parties on how this British-ruled
territory should be governed. The White House said Clinton's plans
would not be affected.
	   No group claimed responsibility for planting the 500-pound (200
kg) bomb in the religiously mixed town, which was crowded with
weekend shoppers and families attending a festival.
	   But politicians unanimously blamed IRA dissidents who are
committed to shattering the outlawed group's 13-month-old truce and
the peace agreement it helped inspire. Dissidents have planted
several car bombs in other Northern Ireland towns in recent months,
which caused many injuries but no deaths because of swift action by
police.
	   This time, a phoned warning to the BBC newsroom in Belfast
claimed that a bomb was left outside Omagh's courthouse on High
Street, atop a slope on the west end of town. Police began
directing people away from the area _ many of them east down Market
Street. The blast 20 minutes later occurred behind the security
cordon, tearing apart buildings and people alike.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder ... who
gave us a totally inaccurate warning,'' said Northern Ireland
Police Chief Ronnie Flanagan.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed that breakaway IRA
members _ believed to number no more than 100 and mostly based in
the Irish Republic _ would be ``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in France, told
the BBC that he found it ``impossible to get in the mind of anyone
who could possibly do such a thing.''
	   In a statement Queen Elizabeth II said she was ``shocked to hear
of the appalling crime in Omagh.''
	   Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic leader, John Hume, said the
atrocity was ``carried out by undiluted fascists. Obviously they're
trying to impose their will by murder on the people of Ireland,
north and south.''
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said he
was ``totally horrified'' by the bombing. ``I condemn it without
any equivocation whatsover,'' Adams said.
	   The wording was significant, since Adams in the past refused to
``condemn'' republican violence.

U.S. to question man Pakistanis say confessed to embassy bombings

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. investigators are heading to Pakistan to
question a man who was reported to have confessed to bombing two
American embassies in East Africa, U.S. authorities said Saturday.
	   The Central Intelligence Agency made arrangements late Friday
for agents to question the man, who was arrested or detained by
Pakistani authorities, according to a U.S. law enforcement official
in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   An FBI legal attache permanently assigned to the U.S. Embassy in
Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, also was believed looking into
possible connections between the suspect in custody and the East
Africa bombings, the source said.
	   The suspect, identified as 32-year-old Mohammed Sadique, was
detained as he tried to slip into Afghanistan from Pakistan, the
Pakistani newspaper The News reported in its Sunday edition. The
paper quoted unidentified government officials as saying Sadique
confessed to planning the Aug. 7 bombings at the embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The nearly
simultaneous attacks killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500
people.
	   The embassy in Islamabad and the State Department and FBI in
Washington would not comment on the reported suspect. Pakistani
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said he had no knowledge of
the case, as did Pakistani intelligence sources contacted by The
Associated Press.
	   In a related development, a Kenyan guard at the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi identified a photograph shown to him by the FBI as someone
he had seen at the bombing, the U.S. official said. The official
would not identify the person in the photograph. But Knight Ridder
News Service and Newsday reported he was an associate of dissident
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, an avowed foe of the United
States who has urged his followers to wage holy war on Americans in
Saudi Arabia and U.S. targets elsewhere.

Hamas leader escapes from Palestinian jail in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Imad Awadalla, a Hamas leader wanted by both
Israel and the Palestinians escaped from a Palestinian prison in
Jericho on Saturday, a Palestinian security official said.
	   Awadalla was arrested last spring and accused of killing Hamas
bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif.
	   Sharif's body was found March 31 after an explosion in a garage
in the Palestinian controlled city of Ramallah. It was initially
believed he was preparing a bomb that went off prematurely.
However, a Palestinian pathologist said Sharif was shot and killed
about three hours before the blast.
	   Palestinian officials first blamed Israel for Sharif's death but
later said it was the result of rivalries inside Hamas. Awadalla
was arrested by Palestinian police about two days after Sharif's
death.

Fresh government attack on villages dims hopes for peace talks

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A new all-out Serbian attack
Saturday against Kosovo villages controlled by secessionist rebels
dampened hopes for early negotiations on the future of the
embattled Serbian province.
	   The government offensive in western Kosovo came two days after
ethnic Albanian pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a
negotiating team for talks with the government.
	   Government forces, using tanks, jets and helicopters, launched a
coordinated attack on at least nine villages in western Kosovo near
the Albanian border, the ethnic Albanians claimed. Fighting also
raged elsewhere in the province.
	   Belgrade's independent radio B92 reported that both police and
army troops attacked the rebels using tanks and helicopters.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence for the
southern Serbian province whose population of 2 million is 90
percent ethnic Albanian. Serbia is the dominant of two republics
remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova said Friday that the government offensive must stop
before peace talks can begin. The offensive appeared to rule out an
early start of such negotiations.
	   As the Serbian forces shelled the villages to force ethnic
Albanian rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade invited
Rugova's team to start negotiations as early as next week.
	   However, a statement released by the Democratic League of
Kosovo, Rugova's party, said hopes for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to ``start to act seriously, once again turned out to be
futile.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported that government forces
opened fire Saturday morning on the village Logja and at least
eight other area villages, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Pristina, near the Albanian border.
	   The center said in 200 hundred grenades hit Logja in the
two-hour barrage. Later it reported that after they ebbed for a
while, the attacks on Logja resumed. There was no immediate word on
casualties.
	   The area remained inaccessible, but smoke could be seen from a
distance, and detonations could be heard ten kilometers (six miles)
away.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attack on the villages, the
ethnic Albanian source said.
	   According to the Serbian version of events, the Media Center in
Pristina reported that early Saturday a group of ``extremists''
attacked Serbian police forces securing the road from Decani to
Pec. The road runs close to the area of fighting. In a
counterattack, police forces reportedly pushed the KLA rebels into
nearby forests.
	   Radio B92, citing its own military sources, said later Serbian
police had pushed the KLA from most of the contested villages,
forcing the guerrillas to move closer to Radonjicko Jezero, where
the army maintains a base.
	   Also in Belgrade, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug earlier
reported that KLA fighters were believed on the run in the
direction of Junik, a major KLA stronghold that has been under
recurrent heavy attack by government forces.
	   Serbian Interior Ministry officials in Pristina Saturday showed
reporters and photographers what they said were weapons and
documents seized from rebels after recent battles, including
Chinese antitank mines, German uniforms and American helmets.
	   The Albanian source also said fighting resumed at another
location, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina, where
government forces reportedly burned two villages and kept firing
grenades on a number of others to flush out the guerrillas. In an
earlier report, it spoke of five people killed. There were no other
details.
	   A decision by a prominent Albanian opposition politician to lead
the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army has widened the
split between the rebel organization and Rugova, the longtime
ethnic Albanian leader.
	   Adem Demaci, Rugova's chief rival, announced his decision Friday
after Rugova failed to persuade the KLA to join his team. By doing
so, Demaci in effect established himself as an alternative leader
of the province's Albanians.

Guatemalan bishop &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with archbishop comment on arrests. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALFONSO ANZUETO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan police have issued arrest
warrants for two more priests in connection with the April killing
of a Roman Catholic bishop and human rights activist, the Guatemala
City archbishop said Saturday.
	   Bishop Juan Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in his garage on
April 26, two days after he delivered a church human rights report
blaming the military and pro-government death squads for most of
the deaths during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in
1996.
	   A gag order restricts official comment on the case, but
Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio confirmed that warrants were
issued against the Revs. Efrain Hernandez and Marco Aurelio
Gonzalez Idearte.
	   Penados del Barrio said Hernandez and Gonzalez would present
themselves to the investigating tribunal accompanied by defense
attorneys, but did not indicate when.
	   The archbishop said he was ``surprised'' by the arrest orders.
	   Police in July arrested the Rev. Mario Orantes Najera in
connection with Gerardi's death.
	   Last month, Ronalth Ochaeta of the Archbishop's Human Rights
Office claimed that two military men were involved in the slaying.
	   Guatemala's defense minister has said the military will hand
over to investigators information on the two _ identified by local
media as Capt. Byron Miguel Lima Oliva, a member of the
presidential military staff, and his father, retired Col. Byron
Disrael Estrada.

De Swardt and Shett advance to BostonCup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Mariaan de Swardt of South
Africa defeated third-seeded Lisa Raymond of the United States,
4-6, 6-4, 7-5 Saturday to advance to the final of the BostonCup.
	   De Swardt's victory continued a string of upsets in the WTA
Corel Tour tournament at Babson College.
	   Seventh-seeded Barbara Schett of Austria beat Cara Black of
Zimbabwe 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 in the other semifinal.
	   De Swardt and Schett will play for the championship Sunday.
	   Raymond took the opening set when de Swardt double-faulted at
set point. Afterward, de Swardt was in charge.
	   ``I wanted to play aggressively,'' de Swardt said. ``I knew it
wasn't going to be an easy match. I mixed things up and tried to
set up my forehand.''
	   In the third set, both players stayed on serve until the 11th
game. De Swardt then earned a crucial break point when Raymond
double-faulted. In the final game, de Swardt smashed three
cross-court forehand winners to win the match.
	   In the other semifinal, Shett took the first set by attacking
the net. Black broke her twice in the second set to force a third.
	   ``I was surprised at how well she charged the net,'' Black said.
``I had trouble picking up her backhand. It was a great shot for
her.''

Hamas leader escapes from Palestinian jail in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Imad Awadalla, a Hamas leader wanted by both
Israel and the Palestinians escaped Saturday from a Palestinian
prison in Jericho, a Palestinian security official said.
	   Awadalla was arrested last spring and accused of killing Hamas
bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif.
	   Sharif's body was found March 31 after an explosion in a garage
in the Palestinian-controlled city of Ramallah. It was initially
believed he was preparing a bomb that went off prematurely.
However, a Palestinian pathologist said Sharif was shot and killed
about three hours before the blast.
	   Palestinian officials first blamed Israel for Sharif's death but
later said it was the result of rivalries inside Hamas. Awadalla
was arrested by Palestinian police about two days after Sharif's
death.

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan colonel who was disciplined
for criticizing the army's role in the country's 36-year civil war
has been released from detention and nominated for an
administrative post at a military high school.
	   Col. Otto Noack Sierra completed his 30-day detention Friday
night, a military press statement said.
	   In July, Noack Sierra told a radio station that military leaders
should publicly admit their responsibility in the excesses
committed by the army during the war, which ended in 1996.
	   In response, the army's public relations department said the
colonel had no authority to state opinions on military actions.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Chiapas officials have paid 35,000 pesos _
about dlrs 3,900 _ in compensation to each of 18 women whose
husbands were killed last year in political violence in the
southern province, site of an indigenous rebellion.
	   State deputy secretary Roberto Munoz Lievano delivered the
checks Friday in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state capital 430 miles (700
kilometers) southeast of Mexico City, to help the families cope
with the loss of the primary wage-earner.
	   The women's husbands were killed between May and December 1997
in the municipality of Chenalho, where tension between rebel and
government supporters is high.
	   The deaths were separate from the massacre of 45 people on Dec.
22 in Acteal, a village within Chenalho that is sympathetic to
leftist Zapatista rebels.
	   The government in July paid a total of 2,032,082 pesos, or dlrs
225,786, to 33 relatives of the Acteal victims.
	   The Zapatistas took up arms in January 1994 to demand greater
democracy and land rights for the state's indigenous communities.
Peace talks with the government have been stalled since 1996.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Emergency workers cleared wreckage Saturday
after storms caused flooding and the death of three people here and
in another state.
	   A motorist was swept away and died in this city during Friday
night's storm in which flood waters rose to five feet, government
news agency Notimex reported.
	   In the western state of Michoacan, 115 miles (184 kms) west of
Mexico City, a man and a girl were killed when swept away by water,
daily newspaper Reforma reported.
	   Dozens of families in central-west states were forced to flee
their homes and move to temporary shelters, newspapers said.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Fourteen passengers died and 24 were
seriously injured when a bus fell off a 560-foot (170-meter)
precipice on the Andean highlands, police said Saturday.
	   The accident occurred Friday 75 miles (120 kms) from the
colonial mining city of Potosi.
	   Passengers were going to an annual festival in honor of the
Virgin of Urkupini which attracts hundreds of thousands of devotees
to the city of Cochabamba.
	   Survivors say the driver was speeding on a narrow dirt road and
overturned when he tried to pass a truck.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Hurricane Georgette weakened considerably
Saturday and moved out into the Pacific Ocean far from Mexico's
western coast.
	   Maximum winds dropped to 75 mph (120 kph), just above the
threshold for hurricane status, after reaching speeds of 115 mph
(185 kph) a day earlier. The U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said
the storm would further weaken as it moved over colder water.
	   Georgette, which never approached land, was about 970 miles
(1,560 kilometers) west of the Baja California Peninsula and moving
to the northwest at 11 mph (18 kph).

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb tore apart the crowded
center of this bustling market town Saturday, killing at least 26
people, injuring more than 200, and dealing a barbaric blow to
Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, was the
single most deadly act in three decades of conflict in Northern
Ireland. Among those slain were women and children, Protestant and
Catholic alike, many of them unwittingly evacuated towards the bomb
after police received a misleading phoned warning.
	   The local Tyrone County Hospital overflowed with wounded.
Survivors used blown-off doors as makeshift stretchers. Others were
ferried by ambulance or helicopter to hospitals in Belfast and
Londonderry. The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with
glass and rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Catholic resident of the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   Among the dead was an 18-month-old child, and four others
younger than 18, police said. Hospitals as far away as Belfast and
Londonderry helped to cope with the wounded, treating more than 200
people, of whom 17 were reported in critical condition Saturday

Rafter rolls into ATP final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter advanced to
a final for the second straight week with a 7-5, 6-0 victory over
Yevgeny Kafelnikov on Saturday in the dlrs 2.45 million ATP
Championship.
	   He will play for the title Sunday against the winner of Saturday
night's semifinal between top-seeded Pete Sampras and Magnus
Larsson.
	   Rafter has reached the finals of four ATP tournaments this
season, winning the first three. The Australian captured last
weekend's tournament in Toronto and has won nine consecutive
matches, including five against top-15 opponents.
	   ``My whole game is coming together,'' Rafter said. ``I'm serving
well, I'm volleying well, I'm moving well. I've been returning
well. That's been the biggest thing that's stood out. Usually I
don't return this great.''
	   Kafelnikov, a Russian ranked 10th )n the world and seeded eighth
in the tournament, lost to Rafter for the first time in four
matches.
	   Rafter, ranked No. 3 in the world and seeded fifth in this
event, won 24 of 29 second-set points and 26 of the last 31 points.
	   ``I couldn't read which side Patrick was going to serve,''
Kafelnikov said. ``That just shows that I was a little bit tired.''
	   The players were on serve through the first two games before
Kafelnikov poked a forehand volley into the net to lose his serve.
Rafter set up set point with a 105 mph (168 kmph) ace and
Kafelnikov followed by backhanding Rafter's second serve into the
net to close the set. Rafter won the next 11 points.

Chris Webber fined for marijuana possession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Webber arriving in Barbados &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHELLE FAUL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Basketball star Chris Webber
encountered more problems with the law when he was fined dlrs 500
for carrying marijuana in his luggage at San Juan's airport,
customs officials said Saturday.
	   Customs officials said the Sacramento Kings forward was briefly
detained Friday night. He then continued traveling from the
Dominican Republic to Barbados on a trip sponsored by the sporting
goods company Fila.
	   Webber arrived Saturday in Barbados, where he appeared at two
public events but made no comments on his troubles in Puerto Rico.
Webber is to play in a fundraiser game in Barbados on Monday.
	   Webber, who had 11 grams of marijuana in his luggage, was
traveling with Jerry Stackhouse of the Detroit Pistons and other
athletes. Stackhouse arrived in Barbados on Friday night but could
not be reached for comment.
	   The customs department said that because of the small amount of
marijuana involved, Webber was not cited for smuggling and would
not be prosecuted for possession.
	   A customs dog on a routine inspection in the transit lounge at
Luis Munoz Marin International Airport sniffed a carryon bag that
was tagged with Stackhouse's name, customs said. Stackhouse denied
the bag was his, and Webber admitted it belonged to him.
	   It was the latest in a series of legal problems for Webber, who
was traded in May from the Washington Wizards to Sacramento. The
trade was prompted in part by his off-court turmoil.
	   Webber is awaiting trial for a January arrest that stemmed from
a traffic stop on his way to practice with the Wizards in Maryland.
He faces charges of marijuana possession, second-degree assault and
resisting arrest.
	   In May, a grand jury declined to prosecute Webber in a complaint
filed by a woman who said she was sexually assaulted at a party in
Maryland in April. Webber's lawyer said he left the party before
the attack is said to have happened.
	   The NBA and its players are in the midst of a lockout, and
contact between players and teams is prohibited.
	   ``Due to the lockout, the team has to decline all comments,''
Kings spokesman Troy Hanson said.
	   Only heroin and cocaine are covered in the drug agreement
between the NBA and the union. The league would like to add
provisions dealing with marijuana and alcohol abuse.
	   Union director Billy Hunter said last week the sides were near
an accord that would add marijuana to the list of banned
substances.

41 foreigners escape from juvenile prison

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with 41 prisoners escaping, seven recaptured &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police Saturday were searching for 34
foreign teenagers who escaped from a juvenile prison just north of
the capital, police said.
	   A total of 40 Albanians and one Romanian had fled the prison,
located in the town of Avlona, by jumping over a four-meter high
outer wall, Athens' private Mega channel reported. Six were
recaptured by guards just outside the prison, while another one was
arrested in the northern Athens suburb of Kifissia following a
gunfight, police said. The escapee was injured and was transported
to a hospital. His injuries were not life-threatening, authorities
said.
	   According to media reports, a large group of foreign teenagers
was exercising in the prison courtyard when the 41 fled. Mega
reported that security was apparently low at the prison because
many of the guards had taken the day off to celebrate the
Assumption of the Virgin, one of Greece's most important religious
holidays.

Team Rahal qualify second and third

<TEXT>
	   ELKHART LAKE, Wisconsin (AP) _ Bobby Rahal didn't know whether
to laugh or cry.
	   Bryan Herta, his teammate and employee, bumped him from second
place at the end of Saturday's qualifying for the Texaco-Havoline
200 at Road America, then spun 2 1/2 times just past the timer.
	   ``I was pleased I was second and then my teammate dropped me to
third. I wasn't so pleased then,'' said Rahal, who sported the
smile of a proud team owner nonetheless.
	   ``I knew it was going to be really, really close,'' Herta said.
``So, I just threw everything I had at it in that last corner and
made it to the light and figured I'd sort it out after that.''
	   As an owner, Rahal had no qualms with the maneuver.
	   ``Well, he fixes whatever he wrecks,'' Rahal said with a shrug.
	   As a driver, though, Rahal winced at being bumped from the front
row.
	   ``I knew this was my last ever qualifying session here and I
wanted to make sure I did the best possible job,'' said Rahal, who
is retiring after this season. ``As an owner, I'm thrilled that
we're 2-3 on the grid and hopefully we can do one better
tomorrow.''
	   Rahal and Herta were surpassed only by Michael Andretti, who
turned in a record lap of 145.745 mph (233.192 kmph) in a
Swift-Ford, besting Gil de Ferran's track mark of 145.055 mph
(232.088 kmph) set in provisional qualifying Friday on the 4-mile
(6.4 kilometer), 14-turn road course.
	   Herta lapped at 145.628 mph (233.005 kmph) and Rahal at 145.228
mph (232.365 kmph).
	   Rahal, the only driver to compete in all 16 CART events on the
big, fast track that winds through the lush, forested hills of
Central Wisconsin, said Herta knows what he has to do Sunday.
	   ``Bryan is to move over and follow me, basically,'' Rahal said.
	   ``The policy is may the best man win. Just one thing, don't run
into each other, that's the cardinal rule.''
	   Andretti's pole is his first in 60 races since Long Beach in
1995.
	   ``This feels as good as a win to me because it's been so long
since I've had a pole,'' Andretti said.
	   Scott Pruett, who announced Saturday he was leaving Patrick
Racing for Arciero-Wells-Panasonic Racing in 1999, placed fourth,
giving American drivers the top four starting spots in a CART event
for the first time since July 5, 1992, at Loudon, New Hampshire.
	   Like many others in the field of 28 drivers who will race 50
laps, Herta used a low downforce setup in qualifying that
sacrificed stability on the turns for more straightaway speed.
	   Thus, there were several spins and mishaps.
	   Andre Ribeiro of Marlboro Team Penske, who broke a bone in his
lower left leg Friday, didn't race Saturday but qualified 13th
nonetheless.
	   Ribeiro's crew constructed a special shin guard and installed
some padding in his Penske-Mercedes, which will allow him to race
Sunday.
	   His crew used aluminum foil to shape a mold of his leg, then
employed wire screen, lightweight filler and four layers of carbon
fiber to protect the outside of his leg. Ribeiro also will use a
special heel rest on the clutch pedal and the crew built a shelf to
keep his foot off the floor of the cockpit.
	   ``I am thankful to have such a resourceful team,'' Ribeiro said.
``Today, during practice, the leg felt pretty good considering the
injury. It's still sore, but I think with some rest and if I can
keep the leg elevated, we should be ready tomorrow.''
	   De Ferran was among the many who spun Saturday.
	   ``We might have had the car for the pole today, but
unfortunately I went off on my last set of tires and spun in the
gravel'' at turn three, de Ferran said. ``You have to run with so
little downforce there, and that makes the back end of the car very
nervous.''
	   Mauricio Gugelmin's misfortune also persisted.
	   ``It's been a tough weekend,'' he said. ``We've been through
three engines, two turbos and a throttle linkage _ and there's
still a day to go.''
	   Points leader and defending champion Alex Zanardi, still fuming
over the record dlrs 50,000 fine he received for contact with two
cars at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, qualified 11th.

Guatemalans return home after years as refugees in Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ More than 200 refugees returned to
Guatemala on Saturday, leaving behind camps in southern Mexico
where they had sought safety during their country's civil war.
	   A caravan of buses carrying about 60 families crossed the
Guatemala-Mexico border at La Mesilla, 180 kilometers (400 pounds)
west of the capital, Oswaldo Cardona of the local commission for
refugees said by telephone.
	   The group of 234 people _ including many children born in Mexico
_ was to continue on to Guatemala City, where they planned to
attend a welcoming ceremony and a Mass in the Metropolitan
Cathedral.
	   Thousands of Guatemalans fled their homeland during a 36-year
civil war which ended with peace accords in 1996. So far, a total
of 38,639 people have returned home. Thousands of others chose to
remain in Mexico.
	   The national refugee commission will help the families
reestablish themselves in Guatemala, setting up housing for them at
a coffee plantation near Guanagazapa, south of the capital. The
families also will receive tools, medical assistance, and a
nine-month supply of food.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. ended a 12-game home run drought,
his longest in more than a year, hitting his league-leading 42nd
Saturday as the Seattle Mariners beat the Chicago White Sox 13-7.
	   Griffey, who homered off Jaime Navarro (8-14) in the first
inning, had gone 54 at-bats since connecting July 30, his longest
homerless streak since July 5-July 25, 1997.
	   He is third in the major league home run race, trailing Mark
McGwire, who began the day with 47, and Sammy Sosa, who came in
with 46.
	   Russ Davis and Jay Buhner also homered for Seattle, and Bill
Swift (10-6) got his first win since July 17.
 &UR; Rangers 16, Yankees 5
	   In New York, Todd Stottlemyre (2-1) helped stop the Yankees'
nine-game winning streak as father Mel _ New York's pitching coach
_ watched from the opposite dugout. The victory gave Stottlemyre
and his dad 284 wins, the most ever by a father-son tandem.
	   Texas overcame New York's four-run first as Rusty Greer hit a
grand slam in a six-run second inning against Hideki Irabu (11-6).
Greer also had an RBI single in a six-run ninth, and Mike Simms
homered and drove in four runs.
	   Irabu (11-6) lasted only 2 1-3 innings in his shortest outing of
the season, and the Yankees allowed their most runs since July 18,
1996, a 16-4 loss at Milwaukee.
 &UR; Orioles 9, Indians 8
	   In Cleveland, Brady Anderson homered leading off the 10th and
Eric Davis went 4-for-4 to extended his hitting streak to 30 games,
the longest in the major leagues this season.
	   After Armando Benitez (5-3) wasted a two-run lead in the ninth _
walking in the tying run _ Anderson connected on the first pitch of
the 10th from Doug Jones (0-1).
	   Baltimore is 27-7 since the All-Star break, while Cleveland is
16-20. Cal Ripken played in his 2,600th consecutive game, 486 more
then the previous record set by Lou Gehrig.

Argentina's Pumas trounce United States 52-24 in rugby qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The Argentina national rugby
union team trounced the U.S. Eagles 52-24 Saturday in a world cup
qualifying match.
	   Earlier Saturday, Canada defeated Uruguay 38-15 in the four-team
tournament that qualifies one side for the 1999 world cup in Wales.
	   Barely two minutes into the game the Argentines opened the
scoring when Federico Mendez went into the end zone for a try.
	   Gonzalo Quesada converted and immediately increased the score
with penalties in the 5th, 12th and 13th minutes.
	   A try by Facundo Soler in the 18th minute, converted by Quesada
and a penalty in the 39th also by Quesada further widened the lead.
	   The Eagles fought back with penalties by Mark Williams in the
9th, 17th, 22nd and 34th minutes, and by halftime the score was
31-12 for the Argentines.
	   In the second half the Argentines continued to dominate the
action. They scored with tries by Manuel Contempomi, Soler and
Pablo Camerlinckx, plus a penaltry try, all converted by Quesada
	   However, the Eagles put up a stronger fight and broke the
heavily-favored Argentine team's defense to score two tries, one by
Andre Blom in the 47th minute and another in injury time by Varea
Anitoni, converted by Blom, to end the match.
	   The tournament will continue Aug. 18 when the United States
faces Canada and Argentina goes up against Uruguay.
	   In the final games on Aug. 22, the United States will face
Uruguay and host Argentina will play Canada.

Summerhays leads after two rounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADA, Michigan (AP) _ Bruce Summerhays made every putt he faced
inside 15 feet (4.5 meters) on Saturday on the way to a 7-under-par
65 in the second round of the First of America Classic.
	   Summerhays, 54, who lives in Heber City, Utah, was at 11-under
133, two ahead of George Archer entering Sunday's final round at
Egypt Valley Country Club. Archer shot a 67.
	   Jim Dent and Jose Maria Canizares trail Summerhays by two
strokes, while defending champion Gil Morgan is four strokes off
the pace after matching Summerhays' 65.
	   Summerhays, who has won twice on the Senior PGA Tour, bogeyed
the third hole Saturday but then birdied eight of the next 14
holes.
	   ``Today I hit the tee ball as well as I ever have hit the tee
ball in my four years on the tour,'' Summerhays said.
	   ``My putting was phenomenal today, too. ... It was a marvelous
putting day and a good driving day. When you putt that well and
drive OK, you are going to have a pretty good day.''
	   Summerhays birdied three straight holes on the back nine, each
time converting a 9-foot (3.3-meter) putt that broke from left to
right.
	   Archer, 58, who won here in 1993 with a tournament-record 199,
opened the second round tied with Summerhays at 4-under.
	   ``It is nice to be shooting some low numbers,'' said Archer, the
senior comeback player of 1997 after undergoing hip replacement
surgery. ``The hip is not that strong yet and I'm not that
physically strong yet to walk in tournaments. He (Summerhays) is
playing a lot better than I am and he's a lot younger than I am but
you never know. I'm only two shots back and that can swing on one
hole.''
	   Morgan, who is second on the earnings list this season, shot a
65 Saturday but it could have been better had he not missed two
short birdie putts.
	   Morgan has won five times this season and won here last year
with a 9-under 207. He saved par on his first two holes Saturday
but then went 5-under on the six holes prior to the turn, including
an eagle on the 534-yard (486-meter), par-5 seventh.
	   The winner of the First of America Classic will collect dlrs
150,000 of the dlrs 1 million purse.

Crafty Kraft blazes to a course record 65
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM COUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Just call him crafty Greg Kraft. He
sounds like he knows exactly what he's doing.
	   Maybe that knowledge will help him get a victory in a major
someday.
	   On Saturday, Kraft shot a Sahalee Country Club course record 65,
five under par, in the U.S. PGA Championship. Not bad for a
34-year-old who doesn't have an official PGA Tour win.
	   The former University of Tampa golfer won the 1993 Deposit
Guaranty Golf Classic before it became a regular PGA Tour event.
And he's had two runner-up finishes on the Tour; the 1994 Motorola
Western Classic and the 1993 Walt Disney World-Oldsmobile Classic.
	   ``It's funny,'' Kraft said, after breaking the course record of
66 set by Tiger Woods in the opening round, then tied by Vijay
Singh in round two. ``I've been out here for seven years and I've
had a lot of chances. But mechanically I haven't been as sound as I
am now. I haven't been as focused and dedicated as I am now.''
	   So Kraft feels he's ready to win a regular tournament for the
first time. And soon.
	   ``In the offseason, I took some time off and worked out,'' he
said. ``I figure I'm on the right track.''
	   The Sahalee course record meant a lot to him. He had a couple of
63s on other courses.
	   ``I thought about it when I was on 17,'' he said, after sinking
a 40-foot (12-meter) putt for his seventh birdie. He bogeyed the
fifth and eighth holes.
	   ``I said to myself, 'Wouldn't it be sweet to get the course
record?''' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WEE WELSHMAN: Little guys can sneak up on you sometimes.
Especially Ian Woosnam when he's playing well.
	   ``I was pleased with the way I played,'' Woosnam said, after
shooting a 3-under 67 Saturday. ``If a few more putts would have
gone in, it could have been a heckuva round.''
	   Playing in his 13th PGA Championship, Woosnam was at 212 after
barely making the cut at 145.
	   ``I was annoyed with the way I played yesterday,'' said Woosnam,
the 1991 Masters champion who has 28 PGA European tour victories
and a total of 41 worldwide wins.
	   ``I wasn't feeling very happy about it. But I calmed down a
little and did a bit of practice putting in my room.''
	   One hour later, Woosnam put down his putter and went to bed.
	   ``My putting is getting better,'' Woosnam, 40, said. ``But it's
still got a ways to improve.''
	   Pro golf's Wee Welshman missed an 8-footer (2.4 meters) for par
at the 16th that left him muttering to himself.
	   ``It was a poor putt,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; KELLY JOY: Jerry Kelly's quick departure after the first round
of the PGA Championship was well worth it.
	   After shooting a 75 Thursday, he returned home to Hobe Sound,
Florida, just in time for the birth of his first baby, a son,
Cooper Patrick.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ANDRADE'S WEEK: Billy Andrade was playing tennis in Bristol,
Rhode Island, Monday and Tuesday _ just one of the alternates for
the PGA Championship.
	   When he flew here Wednesday, he didn't think he had a chance to
be in the elite field.
	   At the last minute, Steve Jones withdrew because of the death of
a close friend. Andrade was in for his 10th PGA.
	   On Saturday, Andrade shot a 2-under 68 for a 213 total, 3 over.
He had 68 and 77 in the first two rounds.
	   ``My mindset coming out was that I wasn't going to get to
play,'' he said. ``It hasn't been the best of years.
	   ``When I got here, I went to the PGA offices and asked a
secretary where I stood. She surprised me when she said, 'I think
you're in.' I said, I don't care what you think. Do you know?'''
	   In 20 previous PGA Tour events, Andrade had missed the cut nine
times.
	   ``This year has been such a struggle,'' Andrade said. ``I'm
trying too hard. I've been making it too hard on myself.''

Athletics finds niche at world's largest philosophy conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE HOWLAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Simon Eassom envisions a day in the near future
when elite athletes are no longer entirely human.
	   Eassom, a philosophy professor at DeMontfort University in
Bedford, England, has spent a lot of time thinking about it:
	   An Olympic marksman could use a transplanted cornea for better
vision and surgically altered nerves for a steadier trigger finger.
Track competitors, chasing faster times, might someday run on
artificial hearts with better circulation.
	   ``The future of sports as we know it, the future of the Olympic
Games, is by no means certain,'' Eassom said. ``Given another 100
years, I'm not even sure we'll be having things like the
Olympics.''
	   Eassom's work in the obscure field of athletics and philosophy
is on display this week at the 1998 World Congress of Philosophy in
Boston _ billed as the world's largest gathering of philosophers in
history. The conference meets every five years.
	   About 3,000 scholars are sharing their thoughts on the human
condition and debating issues ranging from the ethics of
biotechnology and corporate responsibility to religion in public
schools.
	   ``Some of this is probably just nonsense, but some of it is
pretty good,'' said Alan Olson, a professor of religion and
philosophy at Boston University who organized the conference.
	   Eassom and colleagues say their brand of philosophy cuts to the
root of some fundamental questions about the human condition. For
example, what is an athlete, and for that matter, how do you define
a human being?
	   Sigmund Loland, a philosophy professor from the Norwegian
University of Sport and Physical Education of Oslo, said it's not
farfetched to picture a future of cyborg athletes _ part human,
part mechanical.
	   With rapid advances in biotechnology and engineering, athletes
will be tempted to experiment with new ways to improve their game,
he said.
	   There are some disturbing examples already. An international
debate is under way on performance-enhancing substances after a
series of high-profile doping cases in the Tour de France, as well
as in track and field and swimming.
	   Cyclists recently used an undetectable synthetic hormone called
EPO which boosts endurance by stimulating the production of
oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Others have taken human growth
hormone, a popular alternative to steroids that also can't be
detected.
	   Eassom said some athletes who have trained using steroids have
undergone dialysis to cleanse their blood in advance of drug tests.
	   ``If athletes are prepared to go to those sort of lengths it
would kind of make sense that they would be prepared to go to the
length of putting an artificial heart valve in them to make their
blood pump better,'' Eassom said.
	   Like motley characters in a futuristic video game, each athlete
might bring to competition their own technology-enhanced trait. For
example, a pitcher might trade in his mortal arm for a faster
machine version a la Luke Skywalker, the ``Star Wars'' hero with a
mechanical hand.
	   But will sports fans like it? Eassom thinks so.
	   ``There will be an element of a circus atmosphere _ `Oh let's go
see the freak play.' But that will soon become commonplace,'' he
said. ``It's mass entertainment, and provided there are still the
elements of suspense, drama and excitement, people are still going
to watch it.''
	   Loland said the athletes at greatest risk for seeking new body
parts or blood chemistry are those pushing to break Olympic
records.
	   ``We're looking at quite a drastic scenario,'' he said. ``The
logic of record sports is that enough is never enough. It's when
victory means hundreds of thousands of dollars, then you have a
problem because people will invest whatever it takes to win.''
	   The International Olympic Committee has taken notice of the
latest drug controversy and admits it's still looking for a precise
definition of doping. The committee has scheduled a special meeting
for Aug. 20 at Lausanne, Switzerland to discuss drug use in sports.
	   Despite the Orwellian predictions for elite competition, Eassom
predicts at least one sport will stay cyborg free.
	   ``Golf is a game of life,'' the philosopher said. ``This is a
very difficult game and most people who pickup the golf clubs for a
first time would never pick them up a second time.''

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb tore apart the crowded
center of this bustling market town Saturday, killing 26, injuring
more than 200, and dealing a barbaric blow to Northern Ireland's
peace agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, was the
single most deadly act in three decades of conflict in Northern
Ireland. Among those slain were women and children, Protestant and
Catholic alike, many of them unwittingly evacuated towards the bomb
after police received a misleading phoned warning.
	   The local Tyrone County Hospital overflowed with wounded.
Survivors used blown-off doors as makeshift stretchers. Others were
ferried by ambulance or helicopter to hospitals in Belfast and
Londonderry. The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with
glass and rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Catholic resident of the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   Among the 26 dead were a baby girl, 14 other females and 10 men,
said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Hospitals as
far away as Belfast and Londonderry helped to cope with the
wounded, treating more than 200 people, of whom 17 were reported in
critical condition Saturday night.
	   The Rev. John Gilmore, a Catholic priest, said that he gave last
rites to many of the injured in Tyrone County Hospital.
	   ``To start with it was just nonstop. There were people on the
floors, mattresses and chairs,'' said Gilmore. ``Some of the early
ones were very badly injured. Some I anointed on mattresses on the
floor.''
	   ``The carnage, the children, a young baby _ pure black,
unrecognizable,'' said a Protestant local, Frank Hancock, too
stunned to cry over what he'd seen. ``A young girl down a manhole
that we had to pull out. A young lad burning, his hair pure
singeing.
	   ``Any man who puts that (bomb) there,'' he said, pointing
angrily at the bomb site, ``and says, `We're the ``real'' IRA' _
they're cowards.''
	   The attack coincided with the 29th anniversary of the deployment
of British troops in Belfast, a traditional rallying point for
Irish Republican Army supporters. It also came 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the compromise April
agreement among eight local parties on how this British-ruled
territory should be governed. The White House said Clinton's plans
would not be affected.
	   No group claimed responsibility for planting the 500-pound (200
kg) bomb in the religiously mixed town, which was crowded with
weekend shoppers and families attending a festival.
	   But politicians unanimously blamed IRA dissidents who are
committed to shattering the outlawed group's 13-month-old truce and
the peace agreement it helped inspire.
	   Dissidents have planted several car bombs in other Northern
Ireland towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no
deaths because of swift action by police. On July 10, an imminent
bombing attack in London was foiled in a joint British-Irish
operation against IRA splinter groups.
	   This time, a phoned warning to the BBC newsroom in Belfast
claimed that a bomb was left outside Omagh's courthouse on High
Street, atop a slope on the west end of town. Police began
directing people away from the area _ many of them east down Market
Street. The blast 20 minutes later occurred behind the security
cordon, tearing apart buildings and people alike.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder ... who
gave us a totally inaccurate warning,'' said Northern Ireland
Police Chief Ronnie Flanagan.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed that breakaway IRA
members _ believed to number no more than 100 and mostly based in
the Irish Republic _ would be ``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in France, told
the BBC that he found it ``impossible to get in the mind of anyone
who could possibly do such a thing,'' and the Northern Ireland
Office said Saturday that Mo Mowlam, the senior British politician
in charge of the province, had cut short her holiday and was
heading back to Belfast.
	   In a statement Queen Elizabeth II said she was ``shocked to hear
of the appalling crime in Omagh.''
	   Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic leader, John Hume, said the
atrocity was ``carried out by undiluted fascists. Obviously they're
trying to impose their will by murder on the people of Ireland,
north and south.''
	   Martin McGuinness, chief negotiator of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, said he was ``appalled and disgusted'' by this
``indefensible action.''
	   ``It's designed to wreck the peace process, and everyone should
work to ensure that the peace process continues,'' said McGuinness,
the IRA's reputed former commander.
	   The attack harkened back to the province's darkest days of the
1970s, when the IRA bombed commercial centers in Belfast,
Londonderry and England in hopes of wrecking Northern Ireland and
its British links.
	   Omagh's death toll eclipsed the previous worst attack in
Northern Ireland, when the IRA killed 18 soldiers with two bombs on
Aug. 27, 1979.
	   The IRA killed 21 in a double bombing of two pubs in Birmingham,
central England, in Nov. 21, 1974. The worst atrocity remains May
17, 1974, when three car bombs planted by a pro-British gang
fatally wounded 35 people in the Irish Republic.
	   The residents of normally content Omagh had never witnessed
anything like Saturday.
	   A retired fireman, Paddy McGowan, said his car ``lifted off the
ground'' when the Omagh bomb went off. He, like many drivers, saw
the billowing smoke, stopped their cars and ran to the scene to try
to help.
	   ``It was absolute carnage, the most horrific I have ever seen,''
said McGowan, a 25-year veteran of the fire service ``through the
worst of years.''
	   Shaking, he said: ``There were bodies everywhere, and people
covered in blood screaming. Everywhere there seemed to be a
terrible loss of blood, a terrible loss of limbs, and people
obviously dead.''
	   At an emergency center in Omagh people gathered Saturday night
to find out if their friends and relatives had been killed in the
blast. Police said that the dead were being taken to a temporary
mortuary at a British army barracks nearby.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Chiapas state police
arrested six suspected robbers Saturday who allegedly targeted
tourists visiting the ancient Mayan ruins at Palenque.
	   Officers captured the suspects in Belisario Dominguez, the
band's center of operations about 10 miles (15 kilometers)
southeast of Palenque.
	   The state attorney general's office said the six men were caught
with U.S. currency, several cameras and credit cards. Police also
confiscated five guns and masks allegedly used by the robbers as
disguises.
	   The men, between ages 17 and 25, were taken to the Cerro Hueco
prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state capital.

Police arrest man suspected of killing Mexico City society

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico City police arrested a 23-year-old man
Saturday who is suspected of killing a society columnist and her
servant two weeks ago.
	   Officers captured Pedro Saucedo Avendano at a train station
where he was about to board a train to the southern Chiapas state,
the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Judicial agents at the station had matched Saucedo to images
distributed by police and noticed an apparent injury on his right
hand that may have been the result of a struggle with his alleged
victims, the report said.
	   Sally-Sue Hulse, 60, a columnist for the English-language Mexico
City Times, was stabbed to death Aug. 3 in her Mexico City
apartment. Her servant, Alberto Chavez, was found beaten to death
in a back room.
	   Police said Saucedo admitted that he had entered Hulse's
apartment, near the popular Zona Rosa district, intending to steal
valuables and cash in order to buy a police badge on the black
market.
	   However, he also said that he and Chavez, 62, had a personal
relationship and that the two of them fought before Saucedo killed
him, according to police.
	   Hulse, who was born to British parents in Belize, had lived in
Mexico for 47 years. Her column, ``Pulse by Hulse,'' described
social events in Mexico City's large foreign community.
	   She earlier had worked for El Sol and another capital
English-language daily, The News.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Andres Galarraga hit a three-run homer for
the second straight game and John Smoltz won his sixth straight
decision as the Atlanta Braves beat the slumping Los Angeles
Dodgers 5-3 Saturday.
	   Galarraga connected off Chan Ho Park (10-7) in the first,
helping Atlanta improve to 5-0 this year against Los Angeles, which
lost for the eighth time in 11 games overall. Galarraga hit a
three-run homer in the fourth inning of the Braves' 5-2 win Friday
night.
	   Smoltz (11-2) won for the seventh time in eight decisions since
coming off the disabled list June 20, striking out eight in seven
innings. Kerry Ligtenberg pitched the ninth for his 20th save.
 &UR; Giants 4, Marlins 3
	   In San Francisco, J.T. Snow hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th
after the Giants rallied from a 3-1 deficit in the sixth against
Livan Hernandez.
	   Jose Mesa (4-2) pitched one inning as the Giants won their fifth
straight over the Marlins, who swept them in the first round of the
playoffs last year. Matt Mantei (3-3) walked Bill Mueller and Ellis
Burks opening the 10th.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Sophia Loren, Julio Inglesias, Marco Antonio
Muniz, Sylvester Stallone, celebrity weed. Some items may also have
moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Sophia Loren was hospitalized with an
irregular heartbeat while visiting a friend in New York, her
publicist said Saturday.
	   ``She will stay for a few days for observation because of
defibrillation, but she didn't have a heart attack,'' said Beebee
Kline, Loren's longtime publicist. ``She'll have some tests on
Monday. I'm encouraging her to take a little rest.''
	   Earlier newspaper reports said Loren, 63, had more serious heart
trouble, but Kline insisted she was treated for arrhythmia, a
variation in the normal rhythm of the heartbeat that can be fatal
if untreated.
	   Kline denied reports that the Italian-born actress was
undergoing plastic surgery when she fell ill. She said Loren became
fatigued after arriving in New York on Monday following a trip to
Geneva, Switzerland.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Spanish singer Julio
Iglesias and Mexican Marco Antonio Muniz are the first
non-Dominicans to be honored on Santo Domingo's Boulevard of Stars.
	   Their names will be inscribed on a downtown street Sunday.
	   The Boulevard of Stars, inaugurated in May, already honors
famous Dominican musicians including Juan Luis Guerra, Julio
Alberto Hernandez, Eduardo Brito, Maria Montes, Monina Sola and
Casandra Daminron.
	   ___
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Sylvester Stallone headed for the
Formula One track to meet race circuit legend Jackie Stewart and
see how it's really done.
	   Stallone's next movie will feature the fast cars, and the toned
actor arrived Friday in Budapest for some tips.
	   Accompanied by Hungarian-born Hollywood producer Andy Vajna,
producer of the ``Rocky'' movies and 1996's ``Evita,'' Stallone
chatted with fans and reporters.
	   He said he'll begin work on the picture in January ``and we hope
to have it finished in the spring.''
	   It was the actor's third visit to Budapest. In 1980, he shot the
World War II film ``Victory,'' about American prisoners in a soccer
match against their Nazi captors. Thirteen years later, he was a
guest of Vajna's at the opening of a gambling casino.
	   ___
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Turns out the suspected marijuana plant
rooted outside a Louisiana criminal court was just a weed.
	   Court officials ordered the plant tested after the 8-inch
(20-centimeter) stalk _ discovered growing through a crack in steps
outside the Orleans Parish Criminal Court _ grew from an oddity
into a media attraction.
	   But a crime lab report found the plant did not deserve its
notoriety.
	   ``One dried plant with green leaves . . . NEGATIVE for violation
drugs,'' the report said.
	   Chief Judge Leon Cannizzaro Jr. was relieved.
	   ``I know that there are problems in the criminal court building.
We are just glad to see this is not one of them,'' he said
Thursday.
	   The plant resembled marijuana with its five-point leaf clusters
and sturdy brown stem. It took root in front of the court's main
entrance, where all manner of law enforcement personnel nearly
stepped on it for at least two weeks.
	   It went largely unnoticed until a former narcotics detective
pointed it out.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb tore apart the crowded
center of a bustling market town on Saturday, killing at least 26
people, injuring more than 200, and dealing a barbaric blow to
Northern Ireland's peace agreement. The blast in Omagh, 70 miles
(110 kilometers) west of Belfast, was the single most deadly act in
three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. Among those slain
were women and children, Protestant and Roman Catholic alike, many
of them unwittingly evacuated towards the bomb after police
received a misleading phoned warning. No group claimed
responsibility, but politicians unanimously blamed IRA dissidents
committed to shattering the outlawed group's 13-month-old truce and
the peace agreement it helped inspire. The attack was roundly
condemned by British and Irish leaders, including Gerry Adams,
leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Amid a growing exodus of foreigners from
Congo's capital, rebel gunmen trying to oust President Laurent
Kabila were battling government troops in the country's west. A
military commander and a western diplomat, both speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the government was putting up
resistance to rebel advances from the western edge of the country,
near the Atlantic coastline. Precise locations of the western
fighting were not available, although the rebels had said earlier
they were within 250 kilometers (150 miles) of Kinshasa, the
capital. The rebel army of Congolese Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and
disenchanted members of Kabila's military has been pushing toward
Kinshasa with the aim of toppling the president's 15-month-old
regime. Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by his government. (CONGO)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators were laboring to identify
the bombers who killed 257 people in attacks on U.S. embassies in
East Africa. The FBI says it will take at least another month to
finish examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S.
embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. In Washington, officials
said U.S. investigators were heading Saturday to Pakistan to join
the investigation of a man who is reported to have confessed to
planning the bombings. Pakistani newspapers, citing unidentified
government sources, said 32-year-old Mohammed Sadique was detained
at the Karachi airport after flying back from Nairobi the day of
the bombings. Detained because he did not match the photograph in
his passport, he reportedly confessed to a role in the bombings
under interrogation. Five people remained in custody in connection
with the Kenya bombing, according to police. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A new all-out Serbian attack against
Kosovo villages controlled by secessionist rebels dampened hopes
Saturday for early negotiations on the future of the embattled
Serbian province. The government offensive in western Kosovo came
two days after ethnic Albanian pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova
announced a negotiating team for talks with the government.
Government forces, using tanks, jets and helicopters, launched a
coordinated attack on at least nine villages in western Kosovo near
the Albanian border, the ethnic Albanians claimed. Fighting also
raged elsewhere in the majority Albanian province, where the Kosovo
Liberation Army is fighting for independence. Rugova said Friday
that the government offensive must stop before peace talks can
begin. The offensive appeared to rule out an early start of such
negotiations. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban army claimed it had
captured a strategic town northwest of the capital after heavy
fighting Saturday, inching closer to uniting Afghanistan under its
strict version of Islam. Taliban fighters claimed to have captured
Doshi, 160 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Kabul _ a crucial
link between opposition forces holed up in northern Panjshir valley
and their allies in central Bamiyan province. The Hezb-e-Wahadat
militia, a member of the anti-Taliban alliance, denied it had lost
control of the connection to the Salang Pass, which links northern
and southern Afghanistan. The Taliban also claimed victories in
northern Badakshan province. The anti-Taliban alliance, hammered
badly by the Taliban in recent weeks, controls only about 10
percent of Afghanistan, including central Bamiyan province and the
Panjshir Valley north of Kabul. The Taliban are on the verge of
conquering all of Afghanistan, which they want to transform into a
strict Islamic state. (AFGHANISTAN)

Glassmaker's centenary celebrates Sweden's stripped-down aesthetic

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sunny days are so infrequent in
Stockholm that spending one of them indoors could seem like a waste
_ but they're the best time to see the Swedish National Museum's
exhibition of Orrefors glass.
	   When the pure sunlight pours through the windows, some of the
clear glass pieces sitting in front of them virtually disappear:
all the eye can see is the engravings on the glass.
	   It's a dramatic demonstration of the modern Swedish aesthetic of
which the Orrefors company has been one of the leading exponents:
quiet, spare design that pleases the eye without calling attention
to itself.
	   The exhibit, which runs through Oct. 11, marks the 100th
anniversary of Orrefors, which along with Kosta Boda has made
Swedish glass a prize both for the well-heeled connoisseur and the
tourist browsing duty-free shops for a souvenir.
	   The aesthetic that Orrefors embodies wasn't born with the
company. Some of the early pieces in the exhibition show Art
Nouveau's tangle of jungle-vine lines _ but executed a bit
clumsily, as if the designers wanted to be Parisian libertines but
were too shy.
	   But in the mid-1910s, two remarkable designers came to the
company: Simon Gate and Edvard Hald. They simplified both the glass
itself and the decorations on it.
	   For those who conflate elegance with self-indulgence, that
design strategy sounds austere. Gate and Hald did it without
sacrificing joy. An unadorned green bowl by Gate from 1923 carries
the same distinct eroticism as a Georgia O'Keefe flower painting
and Hald's globe from 1929 is engraved with wacky animals and
buffed-up gods and goddesses.
	   In both cases, the simplicity of the lines makes the effect
stronger: there's nothing to distract the eye from the piece's
essences.
	   These works came along at the time when Sweden was undergoing
rapid change from a generally poor and obscure country to an
industrial powerhouse. Politicians of the time decided that the
country should provide a life of basic decency for all and the
Orrefors work reflects the national temper of populist comfort.
	   Orrefors refined the approach over the next few decades, with
decorations increasingly giving way to emphasis on form and color:
the best pieces being of a single color, especially an eerily
glowing blue that looks like a piece of the northern summer sky
made solid.
	   The 1960s was a period of revolt for Orrefors as designers such
as Gunnar Cyren adopted the cartoony colors and retina-challenging
designs of Pop and Op Art. Every revolt has its counterrevolution,
often as distressing as the uprising itself and Orrefors' glass of
the 1970s is its least satisfying: the return to simplicity seems
cold and didactic.
	   The glass from the present decade shows designers blundering
into the post-modern thicket or thrashing their way out of it. Anne
Nilsson's white bowl, with a classic simple shape enlivened by a
rough texture as if woven from reeds, is a successful combining of
influences. Per Sundberg's ``Object'' is an undisciplined mess of a
wadlike glass shape and tacky drawings of cute dogs and clumsy
flowers.
	   Despite that one and a few other distressing pieces, the overall
effect of the exhibition is head-clearing. After seeing it,
visitors who walk across the hall from the Orrefors show to a room
crammed with 19th-century objets so gilded and overwrought may feel
claustrophobia setting in.
	   Then they can head outside into the sun _ if there's any left.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Nicholas Pileggi writes real-life best sellers,
films and TV series about the Mafia. And it's a wonder to many
citizens hereabouts that nobody has yet busted his kneecaps or
invited him to sleep with the fishes in cement pajamas.
	   The Boswell of the bosses and underbosses protests that firstly
``these knees aren't worth busting.'' And secondly, he is not one
to pass judgment on the peccadilloes of the Cosa Nostra or its
perpetrators. He merely chronicles them after the fact. ``I'm a
recorder of that world, not an investigator. All I do is write up
stuff that already happened.''
	   Nick, as he is known to one and all since his stickball playing
days in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, has made crime pay without packing a
roscoe.
	   From humble beginnings as a legman on the police beat, he hit
the best-seller list with ``Wiseguy _ Three Decades of Life in the
Mafia,'' all about the zillion-dollar Lufthansa heist at Kennedy
Airport. This became the movie ``GoodFellas,'' which was nominated
for six Academy Awards, including his film script with director
Martin Scorsese, and won a supporting-role Oscar for Joe Pesci.
	   Next he scored with ``Casino,'' true life and not-so-true love
in Las Vegas. Again he teamed with Scorsese on the movie script.
His TV series, ``Michael Hayes,'' has just finished a season on
CBS.
	   He pursues the ways of organized crime in a cluttered den on the
penthouse floor of Manhattan's Apthorp apartments. This posh pile
is a 20-minute walk up Broadway from Mindy's, the fictional
restaurant where Damon Runyon's ``Guys and Dolls'' used to meet and
eat when not lying low from the gendarmes or other unfriendlies.
	   But the inhabitants of Nick's world are real, even if they have
Runyonesque names like Vincent ``The Chin'' Gigante, Carmine ``The
Snake'' Persico, Albert ``Mad Hatter'' Anastasia, Anthony ``Gas
Pipe'' Casso and the brothers Albert ``Kid Blast'' and ``Crazy
Joe'' Gallo, who are credited with 15 gangland slayings in the
service of Joe ``The Olive Oil King'' Profaci.
	   Several floors below his rooftop atelier, Nick Pileggi resides
in a luxury apartment with his wife, Nora Ephron, author of best
sellers such as ``Heartburn'' and the Oscar-nominated screenplays
for ``Silkwood'' and ``Sleepless in Seattle.''
	   Nick and Nora might seem like a Hollywood remake of the Thin Man
series. He is tall and courtly with the charming manners and
restrained wardrobe of a consigliere, while she is pert and sassy
and in the know.
	   She writes downstairs in the apartment, while he is topside in
that den near the elevator shaft lined wall to wall with his
``library of louses'' _ tomes such as ``Mafia Wife,'' ``Fascism and
the Mafia,'' ``The French Connection,'' ``Brothers in Blood,'' and
``The Luciano Project.''
	   They do not engage in professional collaboration, Nick and Nora
do edit each other and, he attests, ``are thick-skinned enough to
swap some very blunt criticism'' without fomenting marital strife.
``Nora's writing is much more elegant than mine,'' he admits, ``and
from her stint at Esquire, she is a really savvy editor.''
	   Win or lose, both enjoy dressing to the nines and climbing into
a studio limo together to attend the Oscar awards. So far they have
not experienced rival nominations in the same year. ``That might
stretch the marriage contract beyond the limit,'' Pileggi concedes
with the impish grin that won him his first job in the crime-watch
profession.
	   Growing up in the mean Brooklyn streets fought over by the
Profaci and Colombo crime families, Pileggi identified with those
Warner Bros. gangster flicks starring Bogey, Cagney and Edward G.
Robinson. But unlike Henry Hill, his eponymous ``Wiseguy,'' he
showed no inclination toward a mob career. In homage to his father,
who ``came from Calabria far down in the boot of Italy and spoke
with an accent,'' Pileggi set out to do the family proud by
becoming an English professor.
	   In his sophomore year at Long Island University, he got a night
job at The Associated Press. ``I ran copy for the city desk, went
for coffee and delivered paychecks to reporters working the beats
at City Hall, the courts and police headquarters.''
	   ``I was enthralled. I found a really fascinating collection of
characters. Some were nuts, some brilliant, but for the most part
they were talented, generous people.'' Upon graduation, he jumped
at the surprise offer of a reporter's job from city editor Joe
Nicholson, ``who only communicated in growls.''
	   His first break came covering a Teamsters union election.
``Jimmy Hoffa and the mob,'' he relates, ``were moving in to take
over with a lot of paper or fake locals run by racketeers like
Johnny Dio. It was a night to remember, but I knew from nothing.
Fortunately Abe Raskin, the (New York) Times labor expert, took
pity on a kid who a week ago was running for coffee and let me read
his story.''
	   Pileggi came to the police beat at a time when organized crime
was about to unfold as a major story over the next 10 years, with
televised Senate committee hearings enthralling the nation.
	   The same names kept coming up: Costello, Gambino, Genovese,
Bonanno, Lansky. Pileggi wondered, ``Who are these people? What are
they all about? There were no files. You couldn't call the cops;
they wouldn't tell you. So I began keeping my own files on 3-by-5
cards. Any newspaper story, any indictment, any public record, I'd
enter the name and the date. I began to develop a record on these
characters. I've kept it up ever since, and here they all are.''
His hand swept over rows of metal file cabinets in his den.

NEW YORK: his den.

	   He began pulling out tray after tray of color-coded file cards,
a veritable ``Who's Hoods.'' Green, he explained, tracks legitimate
mob business like laundries, juke boxes, cement and construction
firms. Yellow tabulates political connections. Red is for murder,
incorporated or freelance.
	   ``If I get a picture of these guys,'' he adds, ``I reduce it on
my Xerox and glue it to the page. I've got more files stored in the
basement. Yet for years people who should know, like J. Edgar
Hoover and Attorney General John Mitchell, claimed there was no
such thing as the Mafia. It's like flying saucers. Where's the
proof?''
	   That attitude changed in 1959, Pileggi vividly recalls, ``when a
Sgt. Edgar Croswell of the New York State Police parked his radio
car in the driveway of Joe Barbara's stone mansion near the little
town of Apalachin. The trooper was curious about all those trucks
unloading ice and wine and steaks. But the boys overreacted. Half
of them ran into the bushes in their chalk-striped suits and
wingtip shoes, tossing away money and guns. The others drove out.''
	   Of the 58 identified by license plates, 49 had arrest records,
35 had convictions, and the woods yielded dlrs 300,000 in scattered
cash. Croswell had crashed a summit that was critical in mob
history. Fidel Castro had just shut down the syndicate's lucrative
casinos in Cuba. Motions were on the table to move into narcotics,
and to recruit Corsican thugs to keep the Communists from taking
over the port of Marseilles, the French connection to the opium
suppliers in Turkey.
	   Narcotics changed everything, and every boss who tried to buck
the trend was eliminated, Pileggi relates. ``Frank Costello was
wounded by a hit man outside his apartment because he didn't want
any part of the drug scene. Albert `the Mad Hatter' Anastasia was
shot dead under a candy-striped towel in a hotel barbershop.''
	   By 1965 the narcotics guys had won, Pileggi says. But the bloom
was off. ``My first 10 years on the street, mobsters were
considered colorful characters out of ``Guys and Dolls.'' You know:
natty dressers, charming men about town. Now nobody wants to sit
next to a drug dealer in a restaurant.''
	   The old mob funerals with 20 flower cars and a mile-long
(kilometer-long) convoy of mourners became a thing of the past.
Terence Cardinal Cooke denied a Requiem Mass for Carmine Galante,
blown away in the rear garden of a Brooklyn pasta palace, his
signature cigar still in his jaw. Similarly, John Cardinal O'Connor
cited Canon Law 1184, dealing with ``manifest sinners,'' in
refusing a church send-off for top capo Paul Castellano, gunned
down outside a midtown steakhouse.
	   ``This is a heavy sentence,'' says Pileggi. ``I know gangsters
who are very religious. Mike Miranda was a daily communicant. On
the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, `Dandy' Jack Paresi of
Murder Inc. always went barefoot in the procession, hefting the
statue. One day I ask Dandy point-blank what he prays for.'' The
hood replied: ``I pray to God for the strength to steal some
more.''
	   The drug wars let loose the canaries. ``From the early 1900s
when the old mustache Petes arrive as the Black Hand, nobody ever
squeals to the cops,'' Pileggi points out. ``Then in 1962, Joe
Valachi in the federal slammer at Atlanta thinks the mob is out to
murder him. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy and the McClellan
Committee are very anxious to hear him out. He's the first to
violate `omerta,' the code of silence.
	   ``The lid is off. Down the years to Salvatore `Sammy the Bull'
Gravano, you've got more than 5,000 defectors or their victims in
the Federal Witness Protection Program.''
	   Pileggi's years on the police beat, playing cards with the cops
and chatting with mob lawyers in courthouse corridors, give him
more than a press pass to the underworld. ``You work the beat, they
trust you, you get the contacts.''
	   Editors at Simon and Schuster contacted him when Henry Hill,
under federal protection, sought a book deal to pay his legal
bills. Pileggi had ``many rendezvous at obscure places and remote
airports'' before ``Wiseguy'' donned its book jacket.
	   There is no national society of Mafia writers, he says,
``because we all know each other.'' His first cousin, Gay Talese,
wrote the best seller ``Honor Thy Father'' and persuaded him to
forsake the newspaper crime beat and turn his files into books.
	   Over dinner at the family home, Pileggi's father urged Mario
Puzo to ``do more'' with a character in an earlier book on Italian
immigrants and a baker tempted to join the Mafia. The result was
``The Godfather.''
	   Director Scorsese, raised in Manhattan's Little Italy, has a
town house near Pileggi's place. There, at writing sessions
punctuated by a pasta lunch, Pileggi does the typing while both
speak dialogue into a tape recorder. They are collaborating on
``Dino,'' a biography of Dean Martin.
	   ``Basically,'' Pileggi laments, ``we're in a dying business.
John Gotti's in jail for life. The Italians are pretty much out of
it. Maybe you've got one generation left. Not enough to hold
another Apalachin summit, unless it's in a home for retired hoods
someplace.
	   ''Hey, wouldn't that make a great book?''

Jodie Foster does 'The Baby Dance' for TV and in life
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Television Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Jodie Foster, the thinking person's actor, is
now the thinking baby's mother.
	   Any kid with sense would be delighted to land a mom like this:
brainy, beautiful, accomplished and with the smarts to recognize
that even the most dedicated parent doesn't know everything.
	   The lucky heir to this mother lode is Charles Foster, who was
born July 20. Just one week before, in a Hollywood touch, the
mom-to-be was promoting a Showtime movie she had co-produced.
	   Its title: ``The Baby Dance.''
	   The film, which stars Stockard Channing and Laura Dern, debuts
Sunday on the cable channel. It is about parents and would-be
parents who seem to get things wrong as much as right.
	   Ms. Channing and Peter Riegert are a high-powered professional
couple who, unable to conceive, contract with hard-luck Wanda and
Al (Ms. Dern and Richard Lineback) to adopt the baby Wanda is
carrying and can't afford to keep.
	   Written and directed by Jane Anderson and based on her play, the
film pits jarringly different people against each other and, at
times, against the baby's best interests. The simplest of wishes,
to have a child, becomes the catalyst for dark humor and tragedy.
	   The drama appealed to Ms. Foster, 35, who doesn't like to keep
things simple.
	   ``I love the complicatedness of all the characters, how nobody's
a hero or villain,'' she said. ``I like movies about people, the
things we do to each other and why we do them.''
	   Ms. Foster's own decision to rear a child alone seems thorny and
even morally questionable to some observers. It wasn't an
unconsidered or uninformed step: She is one of four children raised
by a single mom who had little money or family help.
	   By comparison, Ms. Foster said, ``What do I have to complain
about?''
	   She's managed other life transitions, including her evolution
from precocious child star (``Taxi Driver,'' ``Bugsy Malone,'' both
1976) to Yale scholar to Oscar-winning actor (1988's ``The
Accused,'' 1991's ``The Silence of the Lambs'') to director
(``Little Man Tate'' in '91).
	   But Ms. Foster, unpretentious and articulate, can speak for
herself. Here's what she had to say about family, career, and what
happens when the two combine.
	   Q: How would you describe your own childhood?
	   A: I think it was a happy childhood, but it was a complicated
childhood. We're all very complicated people in my family. I know I
didn't have the Ozzie and Harriet family, but I'm very happy for
the childhood that I had. Much like the boy in 'Little Man Tate,'
part of what made me into a sensitive, perceptive person ... was
that I did come from that place.
	   I'm sure there are things that I've missed and parts of me that
are completely neurotic, but who isn't (laughs)?
	   Q: Can you envision what kind of parent you'll be?
	   A: Gosh, I really don't know. I think the best advice is really
to try and be yourself and try to be as true to yourself as you
possibly can and as honest with your kids as you possibly can.
Beyond that, I've got all the books. And I'm a little older. I'm
not a 19-year-old kid.
	   Q: How do you balance baby and career?
	   A: I am directing a film next spring-summer, '99, which seems
like a nice amount of time (after the baby's birth). The nice thing
about the movie business is you can bring your kids wherever you
go. I'll just see as I go along. I mean, I've been working for 32
years, so I don't have this burning desire to act. And if I ever
had it, it's probably 15 years ago. I got cured of it very quickly.
... I only like to make things, if I can help it, that move me. I
don't need to go out and do some buddy cop comedy. I'd rather
travel and learn new things.
	   Q: How would you feel if your child wanted to act?
	   A: There's a part of me that would want him to think twice about
it. But at the same time, you can't control people. Just my luck,
to get some show bizzy kid (laughs). It's been a great life for me.
I got to travel at a young age, I got to talk to grown-ups who
would listen to me. I would have conversations about life with
them. For me, it's been an amazing education. But I know that's not
true for a lot of kids. I think the pitfalls are really big for a
lot of kids. I don't know how I survived intact; it's a tough
profession.
	   Q: How will you deal with the effect of your celebrity on your
child's life?
	   A: That's really too bad. I don't know what to do about it. You
just try to be as healthy as possible. I can't say being a
celebrity is a great thing; there's nothing good about it besides
the work. The work is terrific, and you meet people and have access
to people you wouldn't have had otherwise. But the rest of it, the
lack of anonymity, there's just nothing fun about it. It will just
be another obstacle he (Charles) will have. I have to think about
how to minimize the damage.
	   Q: Describe your career over the next 10 or 20 years.
	   A: I want to get better as a director. ... I love directing. I
love thinking of the movie that way and everything that goes into
it. The funny thing about it is that it's effortless for me,
whereas acting actually requires a lot of effort from me because
it's not my personality. I wish I was more of an extrovert and
liked to do accents and jump on tables with a lampshade on my head
... but it's just not who I am. I'm not that much of an
exhibitionist.

Car bomb kills 26 in Northern Ireland's deadliest attack

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb that killed 26 people
and injured more than 200 _ the worst single attack in three
decades of conflict in Northern Ireland _ demonstrates the ability
of diehard dissidents to sabotage Northern Ireland's peace
agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Catholics.
	   Police said a misleading telephone warning caused them to move
people close to a car packed with an estimated 500 pounds (220
kilos) of explosives.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder ... who
gave us a totally inaccurate warning,'' a visibly moved Ronnie
Flanagan, Northern Ireland's police commander, said at the scene.
	   No group claimed responsibility, but politicians blamed IRA
dissidents who are committed to shattering the outlawed group's
13-month-old truce and the April peace accord it helped inspire.
Dissidents have planted several car bombs in other Northern Ireland
towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no deaths.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said he
was ``totally horrified'' by the bombing. ``I condemn it without
any equivocation whatsoever,'' Adams said.
	   Political analysts considered his phrase significant. In the
past, Adams has steadfastly refused to ``condemn'' violence by the
IRA or its dissident factions.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed that breakaway IRA
members _ believed to number no more than 100 and mostly based in
the Irish Republic _ would be ``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   The explosion came 40 minutes after a telephoned warning to the
BBC in Belfast claimed a bomb had been left outside Omagh's
courthouse on the west end of downtown. Police directed people away
from the area, many of them nearer to the bomb.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Roman Catholic resident of the
town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   ``The carnage, the children, a young baby _ pure black,
unrecognizable,'' said a Protestant local, Frank Hancock, too
stunned to cry over what he'd seen. ``A young girl down a manhole
that we had to pull out. A young lad burning, his hair pure
singeing.
	   ``Any man who puts that (bomb) there,'' he said, pointing
angrily at the bomb site, ``and says, `We're the ``real'' IRA' _
they're cowards.''
	   The local Tyrone County Hospital overflowed with wounded.
Survivors used blown-off doors as makeshift stretchers. Others were
ferried by ambulance or helicopter to hospitals in Belfast and
Londonderry. The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with
glass and rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   The attack coincided with the 29th anniversary of the deployment
of British troops in Belfast, a traditional rallying point for
Irish Republican Army supporters. It also came 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the compromise April
agreement among eight local parties on how this British-ruled
territory should be governed. The White House said Clinton's plans
would not be affected.
	   Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic leader, John Hume, said the
atrocity was ``carried out by undiluted fascists. Obviously they're
trying to impose their will by murder on the people of Ireland,
north and south.''

Investigation proceeds amid Kenya grieving; new lead in Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ While Kenyans grieved at dozens of
funerals for victims of the embassy bombing, hundreds of
investigators worked through the weekend pursuing leads in a probe
that has expanded to Pakistan.
	   Two days after saying the investigation was progressing, the
head of the intensive FBI-led effort again expressed confidence it
was on the right track toward learning the terrorists' identities.
	   ``We're proceeding with numerous leads,'' Sheila Horan, special
FBI agent in charge, said Saturday at the bombed U.S. embassy site,
while specialists studied evidence in striped tents nearby.
	   ``Many individuals are coming to us. We are identifying many
individuals in the community that we wish to speak with,'' she
said.
	   A potentially crucial new development has emerged that may be
unrelated to their efforts, however.
	   In Washington, officials said U.S. investigators were heading to
Pakistan to join the investigation of a man who is reported to have
confessed to planning the bombings.
	   The CIA made arrangements late Friday for agents to question the
man, who was arrested or detained by Pakistani authorities,
according to a U.S. law enforcement official who spoke on condition
of anonymity Saturday.
	   The suspect, identified as 32-year-old Mohammed Sadique, was
detained as he tried to slip out of Pakistan into Afghanistan, the
Pakistan newspaper The News reported Sunday. The paper quoted
unidentified government officials as saying Sadique had confessed
in the twin embassy bombings, which killed 257 people in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   Five people remained in custody in Nairobi in connection with
the Kenya bombing, according to police.
	   In Tanzania, two foreigners were still being questioned for
assistance but are not among ``the perpetrators of the offense,''
said Rajabi Adabi, director of criminal investigations.
	   For the first time since the bombing, a TV cameraman was allowed
into the devastated embassy, recording hints of the terror those
inside experienced immediately after the blast.
	   Bloody handprints were smeared on a hallway wall, presumably
those of a survivor trying to stagger to safety. A jumble of beams,
plaster, glass and other debris filled halls and offices.
	   Funerals are being held through the weekend across Kenya, which
lost 247 citizens in the bombing. In keeping with tradition, most
of the dead are buried in their villages. Coffins are loaded in
pickups or tied atop buses for the final journeys home.
	   At one funeral Saturday, beneath a eucalyptus tree in a Nairobi
cemetery, mourners sobbed at the grave of a 36-year-old woman who
was working in an office tower overlooking the embassy when the
explosion occurred.
	   Alice Ndutu Gachiri was ``our guiding light,'' her younger
brother Peter Njao said as he watched dirt shoveled onto her dark
wooden coffin.
	   The woman's two young daughters stood by, weeping.
	   In the wake of accusations that the Americans were callous about
Kenyan victims outside the embassy property, U.S. government
officials are making a special effort to reach out to East
Africans.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, shelving her
vacation plans, was to leave Sunday for the two bomb-hit capitals
in a show of support.
	   On Saturday, a day after the U.S. ambassador to Kenya reiterated
Americans' commitment to the nation, President Bill Clinton
extended condolences to the victims' families in East Africa in a
videotaped message, saying ``we grieve together.''

Flooding widespread in town where 185,000 forced to flee

	   ANZAOYUAN, China (AP) _ Zhu Desheng and her neighbors got the
warning late one sultry July night: the dike on the Songzi River
was leaking.
	   Thousands of villagers took refuge on still-solid parts of the
earthen barrier. Over the next two days, they watched the trickle
became a torrent, ripping open the dike and making a lake of this
town in the central Chinese province of Hunan. Some 185,000 people
fled what local officials call one of the worst disasters in China
during a summer of record flooding.
	   ``That's my house there,'' said Mrs. Zhu, a 48-year-old farmer,
pointing to a rooftop of ceramic tiles poking out of the water 100
yards (meters) from the tent where her family of five lives on the
grassy dike.
	   Little could depict better than Anzaoyuan the vast scale of
damage from two months of flooding along the Yangtze River and
tributaries including the Songzi. Water covering the town stretches
for miles (kilometers), punctuated by an occasional rooftop, tree
or telephone pole.
	   Until now, the outside world heard little about such areas.
Reports by state media are limited, and foreign reporters have been
refused permission to visit. Many who tried were turned back or
detained.
	   In the first officially sanctioned look at the devastation, a
group of foreign reporters was escorted by government officials
into Anzaoyuan this weekend to see relief work and dike-repair
efforts.
	   Flooding has killed 569 people in Hunan and destroyed 940,000
houses and 400,000 hectares of crops, according to provincial
Deputy Governor Pang Daomu. Losses total 1.7 billion yuan (dlrs 200
million).
	   Despite that, Pang insisted such damage was limited compared
with previous disasters, especially 1954 flooding on the Yangtze
that killed 30,000 people.
	   ``We have reduced the level of casualties to the lowest
possible,'' he told reporters in the provincial capital of
Changsha.
	   The impact of annual summer deluges is worsened by excessive
farming and tree-cutting that leaves hillsides unable to trap
rainfall. Many areas that flood regularly are settled and heavily
farmed, increasing the possibility of deaths and damage.
	   Pang blamed record rains. In June, he said, one area of Hunan
got 676 millimeters (26.6 inches) of rain in three days.
	   ``That's close to half the annual precipitation in most years,''
he told reporters in Changsha, the Hunan provincial capital.
	   The leak in the Anzaoyuan dike began at night on July 24, and
eventually grew into a 130-meter-long (420-foot-long) hole, said
Hong Mingxiang, a local official in charge of repairs.
	   By the time it finally was plugged with bags of stones and sand
on Aug. 11, about 10,500 hectares (25,950 acres) of the flat,
low-lying land in and around Anzaoyuan was flooded.
	   Residents pointed to places where they said they had seen
bodies, but Hong said no one in the town had died.
	   The force of water rushing through the dike ripped the walls off
some buildings. A barge carrying sandbags to plug the hole was
pulled through and sank, its stern jutting into the air.
	   Hong said that only Jiujiang, a major city in eastern China
where a dike on the Yangtze collapsed earlier this month, has
suffered more severe losses.
	   When reporters visited Anzaoyuan, about 100 soldiers were adding
bags of stones to the dike in what appeared to be a staged event.
When the reporters passed by again four hours later, the soldiers
were nowhere to be seen.
	   All but 10,000 of the 100,000 people who moved onto the dike
have moved in with friends or into government housing, according to
local officials.
	   The remaining row of government-issue blue canvas tents and
lean-tos made of bamboo and nylon sheet on the dike still stretches
for miles (kilometers). Pigs, goats and chickens forage for food on
its grassy banks.
	   While there are rumors of disease outbreaks among flood refugees
elsewhere, there was no sign of it in Anzaoyuan. Children were
bright-eyed and energetic, despite living in rudimentary conditions
where temperatures daily reach the upper 90s F (30s C).
	   North of Anzaoyuan, an army of 4,000 laborers was reinforcing
another earthen dike. The line of workers, some using tractors or
bulldozers but most armed only with shovels, stretched out of
sight, working into the night under electric lights strung up from
bamboo poles.
	   In many areas of central China, flooding is aggravated by
land-hungry farmers who have cultivated and settled flood plains,
increasing the risk of death and damage. But officials indicated
they aren't considering barring villagers from returning to areas
that routinely are inundated.
	   ``Forty years ago, no one lived there'' in Anzaoyuan, conceded
Deputy Mayor Liu Benzi of Changde, which governs the town.
	   ``But now, we can't tell everyone to leave. We can't destroy
everything they've built.''

	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Raul Cubas Grau took the presidential
oath of office Saturday, promising to rejuvenate Paraguay's
foundering economy and attack the ``scourges of drug trafficking
and piracy.''
	   The ceremony, which took place in the red-carpeted congressional
chamber, marked this South American nation's first transition
between elected civilians since a 34-year dictatorship led by Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner ended in 1989.
	   After taking the red, white and blue sash and the gold cane that
symbolize Paraguay's presidency, Cubas, a 54-year-old engineer,
said he would overhaul the public banking system and take steps to
end corruption.
	   ``We will begin a frontal assault against poverty, implement
social programs, fight drug trafficking and recover the
international credibility of our country,'' Cubas said in his
inaugural address to Congress.
	   Cubas succeeded President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who was barred
from seeking a second consecutive term. At one time, Cubas served
as Wasmosy's economics minister.
	   But enmity between the two has become so strong that Wasmosy did
not even place the presidential sash directly on Cubas' shoulders
Saturday. Instead, a congressional leader handed over the sash and
gold cane.
	   Seven Latin American presidents looked on while Cubas assumed
the presidency. A Roman Catholic Mass followed.
	   Cubas originally was the vice-presidential nominee of the
Colorado Party, but presidential nominee Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo was
imprisoned in the middle of the campaign. Oviedo is now serving a
10-year sentence for refusing Wasmosy's order to resign as
commander of the army in 1996.
	   Cubas easily defeated Domingo Laino of the opposition Democratic
Alliance in May 10 elections in this nation of 5.7 million people.
The Colorado Party has dominated Paraguayan politics since 1947.
	   In his speech, Cubas also pledged to fight the piracy of
intellectual property and said he would try to create more
manufacturing jobs, which this South American nation has lost by
the tens of thousands this decade.
	   Cubas was to unveil his economic policies Monday.
	   Wasmosy said he was proud of his ``place in history'' as the
first elected civilian since Stroessner's fall.
	   ``I am sorry I was not able to develop my government program to
the fullest and leave the country more prosperous. But even so, I
am proud to have guided this country in the hour of peril,'' he
said Saturday.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A crowd surrounds a foreigner in Congo's
capital, screaming against the United States and France. They grab
his shirt, spit and punch into the air over his head.
	   A local newspaper headline on Saturday blasted the United
States, accusing it of sending aid to neighboring Rwanda; France,
another paper says, is trying to destabilize the country and impose
neocolonial rule.
	   Fed on a diet of government propaganda broadcast on state radio
and television, many Congolese are venting newfound frustration at
western nations, blaming them in part for their the country's
latest crisis.
	   An army of rebel Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted
members of President Laurent Kabila's military staged an uprising
earlier this month that has escalated into an insurgent war. The
rebels claim to be closing in on Kinshasa, the capital, where
tensions are boiling over.
	   Much of Kinshasa was calm Saturday, but at flashpoints _ near
the French embassy and military installations _ tempers ran high
until mid-afternoon, when crowds began to disperse.
	   Two weeks into a rebel war that Congo says was instigated by
Rwanda _ and which already has sparked random arrests and violence
against Tutsis in Kinshasa _ anger is brewing into rage directed at
any foreigner.
	   ``You! What's your nationality? Are you French?'' a group of
young men shout at several foreigners who were leaving their hotel.
	   Thousands of students and government functionaries marched
Saturday down Kinshasa's main June 30th Boulevard, carrying banners
accusing Rwanda of attacking Congo; other banners accuse Washington
of complicity. The march ended up at a local U.N. office.
	   ``Why are you here?'' Adolf Mundeke spat out. ``Get out and
leave Congo to the Congolese.''
	   Student demonstrators in particular were voicing rage at
foreigners, while the government employees marched peacefully
merely to express their support for Kabila.
	   Responding to the mounting concern of violence in Kinshasa,
Britain and the United States are telling their nationals to leave
Congo. Other countries, including France and Canada, have issued
the same warning.
	   ``We're telling everyone to get out now,'' said a western
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa shut down Saturday and the 20
remaining Americans were flown to Yaounde, Cameroon, U.S. officials
said in Washington.
	   Evacuations for French and other nationals were being arranged
Saturday, Western diplomats said. The French Foreign ministry said
in Paris that departures were voluntary and about 250 people had
asked to be evacuated.
	   At the French Embassy in central Kinshasa, several hundred
protesters vented their anger.
	   A hundred yards (meters) away at the Memling Hotel, about a
dozen soldiers carrying assault rifles and grenade launchers
searched the rooms of foreign journalists. Two members of a French
television crew were led away while souvenir vendors jeered outside
the hotel. Soldiers have detained and released several journalists
in the past week.
	   Reporters have become a target of anger that stems from local
media reports and a growing campaign by the government to discredit
foreign news coverage of the war.
	   ``You are telling lies,'' one protester yells as he grabs a
journalist by the shirt. ``You want to make us panic and help the
aggressors.''
	   Police officers and soldiers look on, but don't move to help.
	   A banner headline in the daily Future newspaper blares: ``U.S.
Navy ships coming to help Rwanda.''
	   The United States earlier the week said it was dispatching two
ships to help with the evacuation of U.S. citizens if needed. The
ships were not expected arrive in waters near Congo for at nine or
10 days.
	   Fearing mob violence, most foreigners are staying inside their
homes.

Fresh government attack on villages dims hopes for peace talks

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces have launched a military
offensive on several rebel-controlled villages in the southern
province of Kosovo, dampening hopes that peace talks would begin
any time soon.
	   Saturday's attacks in western Kosovo came two days after Ibrahim
Rugova, an ethnic Albanian leader, announced a negotiating team for
talks with the Serbs, who govern the predominantly ethnic Albanian
province.
	   Government forces launched coordinated attacks on at least nine
villages, the ethnic Albanians claimed. Fighting also raged
elsewhere in the province.
	   In Belgrade, independent radio B92 reported that police and the
Yugoslav army used tanks and helicopters in the attacks. Kosovo
province is in Serbia, the larger of the two Yugoslav republics.
	   While Serb forces shelled the villages in an attempt to force
independence-seeking rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade
invited Rugova's team to start negotiations as early as next week.
	   But his party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, said its hopes
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was serious about peace
talks ``once again turned out to be futile.''
	   Rugova had said earlier that the government offensive must stop
before peace talks can begin. In any event, Rugova has been unable
to persuade the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army to join him.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported that government forces opened fire at
dawn Saturday on Logja and at least eight other villages west of
Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   There was no word on casualties. The area is inaccessible to
journalists, but smoke was seen from a distance and detonations
were heard.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attacks, an ethnic Albanian
source said. The B92 radio report did not mention warplanes.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina, meanwhile, reported that
separatists attacked Serb police who were securing a road near the
villages early Saturday. In a counterattack, it said, police forces
pushed KLA rebels into nearby forests.
	   Radio B92, citing its own military sources, said later that Serb
police had pushed the KLA from most of the contested villages.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also said fighting resumed about
20 miles (30 kilometers) south of Pristina, where government forces
reportedly burned two villages and rained grenades on others to
flush out guerrillas.

Balloonist bests distance mark in attempt to circle globe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett broke his
own record for distance in a balloon Saturday, floating over
Australia as he reached the halfway point in his attempt to be the
first balloonist to circle the globe.
	   The Chicago financier flew over the small beach town of
Geraldton, Australia, poking his head over the enclosed gondola to
view the last continent he'll pass before heading across the
Pacific Ocean towards South America.
	   ``It's certainly going well so far,'' Fossett said in a
conversation with mission control here. ``Although I was very
worried over the Indian Ocean that I would be caught and captured
by the high pressure area ... and never be able to get out of it.''
	   His ground crew, many of whom are meteorologists, burst into
applause shortly upon learning that he had traveled 10,480 miles
(16,865 kilometers), breaking his own distance mark of 10,360 miles
(16,670 kilometers) set in January 1997. This is Fossett's fourth
attempt at circumnavigation.
	   A balloon has no way to propel itself or steer, and moves by
climbing or descending into winds going in the desired direction.
	   That makes the meteorologists on his crew critical to the
flight's success. Fossett communicates with his crew by e-mail,
using a computer that transmits to a satellite, getting immediate
reports on how to avoid winds that could blow him off course.
	   Alan Blount, director of mission control at Washington
University in St. Louis, said there was a concern Fossett would run
out of oxygen before making it to South America, his final
destination and where he took off from eight days ago.
	   But the balloonist is expected to have enough left to finish the
quest, which is expected to take at least six more days. To
officially circle the globe, Fossett must land anywhere east of
Mendoza, Argentina, where he lifted off from Aug. 7.
	   Fossett still has further to go before breaking the
longest-lasting flight ever. That record, of nine days, 17 hours
and 55 minutes, was set in January by Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard
and his crew. Piccard's round-the-world bid was abandoned when
China refused to let him cross its airspace.
	   If Fossett is successful, he will win a dlrs 1 million prize
offered by Anheuser-Busch. He plans to donate half the money to
Washington University.
	   Fossett was about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) into Australia at

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb that killed 27 people
and injured more than 200 _ the worst single attack in three
decades of conflict in Northern Ireland _ demonstrates the ability
of diehard dissidents to sabotage Northern Ireland's peace
agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Roman Catholics.
	   Police said a misleading telephone warning caused them to move
people close to a car packed with an estimated 500 pounds (220
kilos) of explosives.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder ... who
gave us a totally inaccurate warning,'' a visibly moved Ronnie
Flanagan, Northern Ireland's police commander, said at the scene.
	   No group claimed responsibility, but politicians blamed IRA
dissidents who are committed to shattering the outlawed group's
13-month-old truce and the April peace accord it helped inspire.
Dissidents have planted several car bombs in other Northern Ireland
towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no deaths.
	   Among the dead from Saturday's blast are three teen-age girls
and a teen-age boy.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said he
was ``totally horrified'' by the bombing. ``I condemn it without
any equivocation whatsoever,'' Adams said.
	   Political analysts considered his phrase significant. In the
past, Adams has steadfastly refused to ``condemn'' violence by the
IRA or its dissident factions.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed that breakaway IRA
members _ believed to number no more than 100 and mostly based in
the Irish Republic _ would be ``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   The explosion came 40 minutes after a telephoned warning to the
BBC in Belfast claimed a bomb had been left outside Omagh's
courthouse on the west end of downtown. Police directed people away
from the area, many of them nearer to the bomb.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Catholic resident of the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   ``The carnage, the children, a young baby _ pure black,
unrecognizable,'' said a Protestant local, Frank Hancock, too
stunned to cry over what he'd seen. ``A young girl down a manhole
that we had to pull out. A young lad burning, his hair pure
singeing.
	   ``Any man who puts that (bomb) there,'' he said, pointing
angrily at the bomb site, ``and says, `We're the ``real'' IRA' _
they're cowards.''
	   The local Tyrone County Hospital overflowed with wounded.
Survivors used blown-off doors as makeshift stretchers. Others were
ferried by ambulance or helicopter to hospitals in Belfast and
Londonderry. The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with
glass and rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   The attack coincided with the 29th anniversary of the deployment
of British troops in Belfast, a traditional rallying point for
Irish Republican Army supporters. It also came 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the compromise April
agreement among eight local parties on how this British-ruled
territory should be governed. The White House said Clinton's plans
would not be affected.
	   Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic leader, John Hume, said the
atrocity was ``carried out by undiluted fascists. Obviously they're
trying to impose their will by murder on the people of Ireland,
north and south.''

Belfast agreement hasn't stopped diehard dissidents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Northern Ireland &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Saturday's devastation of this
peaceful town cruelly demonstrates that the Northern Ireland
agreement may have charted a hopeful way forward, but can't stop
diehard dissidents.
	   Several shadowy armed groups are opposed to April's accord among
eight parties, which envisioned a new power-sharing government for
Northern Ireland that cooperates formally with the neighboring
Irish Republic.
	   Public referendums in both parts of Ireland approved the plans
in May, and a new 108-seat Belfast Assembly was elected in June.
Its members hope to select a 12-member administration from several
parties in September.
	   But after 30 years of violence that has left more than 3,400
dead, both sides' extremists cannot stomach the idea that their
side hasn't achieved victory. These people believe that power comes
through bombs and bullets, not ballots.
	   Both the Ulster Unionists, the north's major British Protestant
party, and the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party back the agreement. But
since leaving the negotiating table, these polar opposites have
crowed about having outmaneuvered the other _ and both can't be
right.
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, now elected leader of the
Assembly, maintains that the agreement makes Northern Ireland's
place in the United Kingdom alongside Britain more secure than
ever. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams _ committed to breaking the
British link and to abolishing, not reforming, Northern Ireland _
asserts the oppose.
	   Ironically, anti-British militants opposed to the agreement
think Trimble is right, while many Protestants are just as fearful
that Adams is correct. So, to them, the agreement represents
defeat.
	   Since April, extremists on both sides have demonstrated their
belief that more violence will poison the next steps forward, such
as Trimble and Adams cooperating in the same administration.
	   The two main pro-British gangs in poor Protestant areas support
the agreement and have held, with violations, to a 1994 truce.
Another renegade gang, the Loyalist Volunteers, announced a truce
in May but has no dependable political leadership and has
frequently killed Catholics without claiming responsibility.
	   Rooted in the most bitter Catholic areas are three small
factions critical of Adams' coaxing of the modern Irish Republican
Army down a pragmatic political path.
	   The Irish National Liberation Army, founded during the IRA's
lengthy 1975 cease-fire, claimed responsibility for a car bomb that
wounded a dozen people in a border village on June 25, the same day
as the Assembly election.
	   Another splinter group, the Continuity IRA, was formed during
the IRA's 1994 cease-fire and has since attacked several Northern
Ireland towns with car bombs and mortar shells.
	   The most dangerous and growing gang, formed in 1997 after the
IRA resumed its truce, is commanded by the outlawed group's former
``quartermaster'' _ the figure in charge of IRA's hidden arms
dumps.
	   He has reportedly recruited 50 to 100 people into a group dubbed
``Real IRA'' by Irish media because it refuses to use another name.
	   The dissidents' goal is to unravel the parent organization and
the peace agreement, which they believe will ensure Ireland's
lasting partition.
	   While police in the Irish Republic claim they know the
identities of most of the ``Real IRA'' activists, they say they
can't arrest and convict them without firm evidence.

Quakes continue to shake central Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A series of moderate earthquakes hit Japan early
Sunday, rattling communities in mountainous central Japan.
	   In the first five hours of the day, 228 earthquakes jolted the
area near Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   No damage or casualties have been reported, although 11 of the
quakes were strong enough to be felt by humans.
	   The agency said a total 4,066 tremors have hit the region since
Aug. 7, leaving seismologists baffled. On Saturday alone, the
agency recorded 691 quakes, with 28 detectable by humans.
	   One tremor had a preliminary magnitudes of 5.2, rattling the
nerves of locals and spooking tourists to the region's hot spring
resorts into canceling reservations.
	   The epicenter of Sunday morning's largest quake, which struck at
3:31 a.m. (1831 GMT), was located in the sparsely inhabited Hida
region of Gifu prefecture (state), 220 kilometers (140 miles) west
of Tokyo, the agency said.
	   Members of the Science and Technology Agency's seismological
committee held an emergency meeting Friday and proclaimed that the
earthquakes will continue for several more weeks. The committee
warned that tremors could be intense near the epicenter.
	   The same area experienced similar spates of seismic activity in
1990 and 1967.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations,
sitting atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. ended a 12-game home run drought,
his longest in more than a year, hitting his league-leading 42nd
Saturday as the Seattle Mariners beat the Chicago White Sox 13-7.
	   Griffey, who homered off Jaime Navarro (8-14) in the first
inning, had gone 54 at-bats since connecting July 30, his longest
homerless streak since July 5-July 25, 1997.
	   He is third in the major league home run race, trailing Mark
McGwire, who began the day with 47, and Sammy Sosa, who came in
with 46.
	   Russ Davis and Jay Buhner also homered for Seattle, and Bill
Swift (10-6) got his first win since July 17.
 &UR; Rangers 16, Yankees 5
	   In New York, Todd Stottlemyre (2-1) helped stop the Yankees'
nine-game winning streak as father Mel _ New York's pitching coach
_ watched from the opposite dugout. The victory gave Stottlemyre
and his dad 284 wins, the most ever by a father-son tandem.
	   Texas overcame New York's four-run first as Rusty Greer hit a
grand slam in a six-run second inning against Hideki Irabu (11-6).
Greer also had an RBI single in a six-run ninth, and Mike Simms
homered and drove in four runs.
	   Irabu (11-6) lasted only 2 1-3 innings in his shortest outing of
the season, and the Yankees allowed their most runs since July 18,
1996, a 16-4 loss at Milwaukee.
 &UR; Orioles 9, Indians 8
	   In Cleveland, Brady Anderson homered leading off the 10th and
Eric Davis went 4-for-4 to extended his hitting streak to 30 games,
the longest in the major leagues this season.
	   After Armando Benitez (5-3) wasted a two-run lead in the ninth _
walking in the tying run _ Anderson connected on the first pitch of
the 10th from Doug Jones (0-1).
	   Baltimore is 27-7 since the All-Star break, while Cleveland is
16-20. Cal Ripken played in his 2,600th consecutive game, 486 more
then the previous record set by Lou Gehrig.
 &UR; Twins 3, Red Sox 2
	   In Boston, Pat Meares singled home the go-ahead run and Frankie
Rodriguez worked seven strong innings in Minnesota's victory.
	   Rodriguez (2-2), traded to Minnesota from Boston in the 1995
deal that sent Rick Aguilera to the Red Sox, gave up two runs and
seven hits while striking out seven and walking one, helping stop
the Twins' five-game losing streak.
	   The Twins scored the go-ahead run against reliever Pete Schourek
(0-1) in the sixth. Marty Cordova hit a leadoff triple and scored
on Meares' one-out single to make it 3-2.
	   The teams combined for 40 runs and 60 hits in the first two
games of the series, both one-run victories by Boston.

	   ANZAOYUAN, China (AP) _ Zhu Desheng and her neighbors got the
warning late one sultry July night: the dike on the Songzi River
was leaking.
	   Thousands of villagers took refuge on still-solid parts of the
earthen barrier. Over the next two days, they watched the trickle
became a torrent, ripping open the dike and making a lake of this
town in the central Chinese province of Hunan. Some 185,000 people
fled what local officials call one of the worst disasters in China
during a summer of record flooding.
	   ``That's my house there,'' said Mrs. Zhu, a 48-year-old farmer,
pointing to a rooftop of ceramic tiles poking out of the water 100
yards (meters) from the tent where her family of five lives on the
grassy dike.
	   Little could depict better than Anzaoyuan the vast scale of
damage from two months of flooding along the Yangtze River and
tributaries including the Songzi. Water covering the town stretches
for miles (kilometers), punctuated by an occasional rooftop, tree
or telephone pole.
	   Until now, the outside world heard little about such areas.
Reports by state media are limited, and foreign reporters have been
refused permission to visit. Many who tried were turned back or
detained.
	   In the first officially sanctioned look at the devastation, a
group of foreign reporters was escorted by government officials
into Anzaoyuan this weekend to see relief work and dike-repair
efforts.
	   Flooding has killed 569 people in Hunan and destroyed 940,000
houses and 400,000 hectares of crops, according to provincial
Deputy Governor Pang Daomu. Losses total 1.7 billion yuan (dlrs 200
million).
	   Despite that, Pang insisted such damage was limited compared
with previous disasters, especially 1954 flooding on the Yangtze
that killed 30,000 people.
	   ``We have reduced the level of casualties to the lowest
possible,'' he told reporters in the provincial capital of
Changsha.
	   The impact of annual summer deluges is worsened by excessive
farming and tree-cutting that leaves hillsides unable to trap
rainfall. Many areas that flood regularly are settled and heavily
farmed, increasing the possibility of deaths and damage.
	   Pang blamed record rains. In June, he said, one area of Hunan
got 676 millimeters (26.6 inches) of rain in three days.
	   ``That's close to half the annual precipitation in most years,''
he told reporters in Changsha, the Hunan provincial capital.
	   The leak in the Anzaoyuan dike began at night on July 24, and
eventually grew into a 130-meter-long (420-foot-long) hole, said
Hong Mingxiang, a local official in charge of repairs.
	   By the time it finally was plugged with bags of stones and sand
on Aug. 11, about 10,500 hectares (25,950 acres) of the flat,
low-lying land in and around Anzaoyuan was flooded.
	   Residents pointed to places where they said they had seen
bodies, but Hong said no one in the town had died.
	   The force of water rushing through the dike ripped the walls off
some buildings. A barge carrying sandbags to plug the hole was
pulled through and sank, its stern jutting into the air.
	   Hong said that only Jiujiang, a major city in eastern China
where a dike on the Yangtze collapsed earlier this month, has
suffered more severe losses.
	   When reporters visited Anzaoyuan, about 100 soldiers were adding
bags of stones to the dike in what appeared to be a staged event.
When the reporters passed by again four hours later, the soldiers
were nowhere to be seen.
	   All but 10,000 of the 100,000 people who moved onto the dike
have moved in with friends or into government housing, according to
local officials.
	   The remaining row of government-issue blue canvas tents and
lean-tos made of bamboo and nylon sheet on the dike still stretches
for miles (kilometers). Pigs, goats and chickens forage for food on
its grassy banks.
	   While there are rumors of disease outbreaks among flood refugees
elsewhere, there was no sign of it in Anzaoyuan. Children were
bright-eyed and energetic, despite living in rudimentary conditions
where temperatures daily reach the upper 90s F (30s C).
	   North of Anzaoyuan, an army of 4,000 laborers was reinforcing
another earthen dike. The line of workers, some using tractors or
bulldozers but most armed only with shovels, stretched out of
sight, working into the night under electric lights strung up from
bamboo poles.
	   In many areas of central China, flooding is aggravated by
land-hungry farmers who have cultivated and settled flood plains,
increasing the risk of death and damage. But officials indicated
they aren't considering barring villagers from returning to areas
that routinely are inundated.
	   ``Forty years ago, no one lived there'' in Anzaoyuan, conceded
Deputy Mayor Liu Benzi of Changde, which governs the town.
	   ``But now, we can't tell everyone to leave. We can't destroy
everything they've built.''

Festival indicates Vietnam's church-state relations may be

	   LA VANG, Vietnam (AP) _ A sharp, ongoing rise in drug abuse and
other vices is turning Vietnam's communist government and the Roman
Catholic Church into uneasy allies.
	   The two long have been at odds over government controls on
organized religion and alleged persecution of those who don't toe
the party line.
	   But a three-day Catholic festival that wrapped up Saturday with
a record crowd was further evidence of the government's desire to
improve relations with such an influential sector of society.
	   Mostly, the government kept a low profile and let the church
take responsibility for security. Organizers, meanwhile, praised
the support they got from provincial officials and avoided anything
that could be construed as criticism.
	   That's not to say the two sides are ready to embrace each other.
	   The government did all it could to keep the crowd size down,
warning people that they would face shortages of water, food and
accommodations. Tourism organizations were told not to advertise
the festival.
	   Quang Tri provincial officials were invited to the final
ceremonies, but only a few low-level types showed up. With the
province in the throes of a drought, top officials said they were
too busy.
	   Still, pleas during the Masses for people to set examples by
avoiding temptation were right in line with the government's recent
statements that it sees religion as a way to attack vices such as
drug use and prostitution that have accompanied economic reform.
	   And it appeared that the message struck home. Young people
talked of being strengthened by the festival.
	   ``I'm very sad that some of the country's youth have been
affected,'' said Nguyen Xuan Phuong, a 23-year-old kindergarten
teacher from nearby Hue. ``I think that with strong belief, I can
overcome all the difficulties and challenges I may face.''
	   One of the keys to the church's success was its efforts to
intertwine Catholic and Vietnamese traditions, a blend that kept
most people riveted for hours at a time under a sweltering sun.
	   Alongside all the trappings of a full Mass and communion were
bright traditional costumes, fan dances and musical instruments.
	   That also fits in nicely with the government making the
maintenance of national identity a priority amid the steady
encroachment of Western culture.
	   The crowd, estimated by organizers at 200,000 for Saturday's
final festivities but probably slightly lower than that, was
significant on several levels.
	   It was believed to be the largest gathering not organized by the
Communist Party since the country was reunified in 1975, and
certainly the biggest not to fly the national flag or prominently
display a bust of revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh.
	   Uniformed police were limited to traffic duty outside the
festival site. Church officials seemed to take in stride the
plainclothes officers who videotaped virtually everyone and
everything.
	   Several Vietnamese who have moved abroad said they were
pleasantly surprised at the lack of an overt government presence.
	   ``I think that Catholics enjoy more freedom to practice their
religion,'' said Nguyen Thuong, 43, of Tampa, Florida, who was
making her first trip back to Vietnam since leaving three years
ago.
	   It is easy to see why the government _ which relies on strong
controls, preaches that patriotism always comes first and is led by
a ruling triumvirate to avoid too much power in one person's hands
_ would feel threatened by the church.
	   The church's leaders were accorded the kind of attention often
reserved for rock stars. When Cardinal Phaolo-Giuse Pham Dinh Tung
arrived, people rushed to try to touch him.
	   But the church also made sure that the government would have no
slights to complain about. Although Pham Minh Man, the recently
appointed archbishop for Ho Chi Minh City, described how past
generations of Vietnamese Catholics faced persecution, there was no
direct criticism of the current leadership.
	   Still, it won't be easy to eradicate social evils. Just outside
the church's compound, a marketplace sprang up that mostly supplied
pilgrims with food and drink.
	   Set among the stalls was a string of carnival-style gambling
games that were thriving at night.

Stricker, Singh take lead into final round of PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Steve Stricker and Vijay Singh saved
their best shots for the end Saturday in the PGA Championship.
Everyone else will have to play their best to catch them.
	   The shootout at Sahalee, which began with 13 players within
three strokes of the lead, turned into a duel between Stricker and
Singh that culminated with great shotmaking on the treacherous back
nine.
	   Stricker, of the United States, hit a 7-iron from the bunker on
No. 16 to 10 feet (3 meters) for birdie, then hit a spectacular
chip from under a tree and over a bunker to save par on the
difficult 18th for a bogey-free round of 4-under-par 66.
	   Singh, of Fiji, recovered from a shaky start by firing at the
pins, but he kept pace with Stricker by getting up and down from
off the green on the last two holes for a 67, including a two-putt
from the fringe and over a ridge on No. 18.
	   Both were at 7-under 203 and had a four-stroke lead over
defending champion Davis Love III, fellow American Billy Mayfair
and 1995 PGA champion Steve Elkington, of Australian.
	   Lurking another stroke back at 208 were Americans Mark O'Meara,
trying to join Ben Hogan as the only player to win three majors in
a year, and Tiger Woods.
	   ``If I get out there and play the way I did today _ only make
the putts _ I've got a reasonable shot,'' said O'Meara, who made
only two birdies in his round of 69. ``I'll probably be three or
four shots back, and that's never that bad.''
	   O'Meara was two strokes back after three rounds when he won both
the Masters and the British Open. A victory Sunday at Sahalee
Country Club _ is it really possible? _ would match Hogan's 1953
trifecta of the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open.
	   The 31-year-old Stricker has never been in contention in a
major, and considers it a victory that he's even in contention at
all. After a sensational season in 1996, when he won twice and was
fourth on the money list, he changed equipment and went into a deep
slump.
	   But he's finished in the top 10 in five of his last seven
tournaments dating to the Byron Nelson Classic in May.
	   ``I hope I come out like I did today, real aggressive,''
Stricker said.
	   Singh had a close call in the PGA Championship five years ago,
when he tied the record for lowest score in a major with a 63 in
the second round, but stumbled on the weekend with 73-70 and
finished two strokes out of a playoff.
	   ``I've just got to be thinking about what I'm supposed to do out
there, not what I'm feeling,'' Singh said.
	   Stricker was in control from the start, swinging purely, quickly
picking up his tee as his drives split through the corridor of
trees and onto the fairway.
	   When he holed an 18-foot putt for birdie on the 444-yard eighth
hole, he became the first player all week to get to 6-under.
	   But Singh didn't back off, not after two bogeys on the back nine
stopped his momentum and not when his approach was swatted down by
a Douglas fir on the par-5 11th.
	   Just when it looked like the PGA would come down to a duel
between two players looking for their first major, Elkington,
O'Meara, Love and even Woods gave a tantalizing peak at Sunday.
	   Love, trying to become the first repeat champion since the PGA
went to stroke play in 1958 _ and the first since Denny Shute in
1937 _ bogeyed three of the first six holes before turning it
around with back-to-back birdies.
	   His chance for a rare birdie on No. 18 lipped the cup, but he
finished at 69 and was just four strokes off the lead.
	   ``I only had one guy to beat last year at Winged Foot,'' said
Love, who dusted off American Justin Leonard for a five-stroke
victory. ``This time, I have to have some help and play a great
round. It's a much tougher situation. But I feel I have at least a
chance, because I've done it before.''
	   Woods shot 70, a score that easily could have been much worse.
	   Despite a birdie putt from the fringe on the first hole, Woods
struggled with accuracy from the tee and even the fairways, but
managed to stay in the hunt for his first major since the 1997
Masters with a gutsy short game.
	   He made bogey on the par-5 second hole with a 5-iron in his
hands for a second shot, and also bogeyed the par-3 fifth hole by
flying the green. But he made nine straight pars from there,
including a save from the back lip of the bunker on No. 10.
	   ``I felt I couldn't control my shots that well,'' Woods said.
``I had to somehow manage my way around and gut it out. I did a
pretty good job of that today.''

Free House beats Gentlemen in Pacific Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEL MAR, California (AP) _ A more confident and relaxed Free
House made it look easy in the dlrs 1 million Pacific Classic at
Del Mar.
	   Free House, who finished in the top three in each race of the
1997 Triple Crown, earned an impressive four-length victory over
co-favorite and defending champion Gentlemen over 1 1/4 miles (2
kilometers) on Saturday.
	   The strapping 4-year-old gray colt, ridden by Chris McCarron,
took the lead turning into the stretch and pulled away from the
6-year-old Gentlemen. It was another five lengths back to
Pacificbounty, with Lazy Lode another head back.
	   Touch Gold, who spoiled Silver Charm's shot at the Triple Crown
last year, was never in contention and finished fifth, 4 1/2
lengths back of Lazy Lode.
	   Free House beat Silver Charm by a head in the 1997 Santa Anita
Derby, but was not quite as good as Silver Charm during the Triple
Crown, finishing third in the Kentucky Derby, losing by a head to
Silver Charm in the Preakness and then finishing third in the
Belmont as Touch Gold upset Silver Charm.
	   After bleeding in the Super Derby last September, Free House was
given a layoff.
	   McCaffery said trainer Paco Gonzalez ``brought him along in such
a way that I think this horse has just absolutely blossomed into a
really good champion horse.''
	   Free House was fresh from his only start of 1998, a seven-length
victory in the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park on July 11. He
possibly faces a major state inquiry about that victory.
	   Ayrton S, a 185-1 longshot, set the early pace. Gentlemen made
his move on the backstretch, and Free House went right along. Free
House took the lead outside of Gentlemen into the stretch and
drifted in and out a bit in midstretch but pulled away.
	   ``My horse was much the best,'' McCarron said. ``When I came up
alongside Gentlemen coming for home, I knew I had more horse than
Corey (Nakatani). My concern was with Touch Gold; that's why I
looked back.''
	   Said Nakatani: ``We were in a great spot all the way. He tried
hard. Both horses ran terrific races.
	   The California Horse Racing Board recently informed Free House's
connections that the colt tested positive for the prohibited
substance clenbuterol after winning the Bel Air Handicap. Gonzalez,
McCaffery and co-owner John Toffan have all denied using the
substance.
	   The investigation is at the split-sample stage, meaning a second
test will either conform or deny the initial findings.
	   Either way, the investigation had no effect on the Pacific
Classic.
	   Including Saturday, Gentleman has won just one of five starts
since last year's Pacific Classic.
	   Free House won dlrs 600,000, Gentlemen dlrs 200,000 and
Pacificbounty dlrs 120,000

Possible ruble devaluation spooks Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new specter is haunting Russia, spooking
financial markets and making political leaders tremble: devaluation
of the ruble.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's government is fighting to defend the
currency, spending down precious bank reserves. The West, fearful
that a Russian financial collapse could rattle markets still shaky
a year after the Asian crisis, has tried to shore up Russia's
reserves with a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout.
	   A devaluation would certainly hurt anyone holding
ruble-denominated assets. Most foreign investors have sold off such
securities in recent weeks, but some German banks are said to still
be heavily invested.
	   Few ordinary Russians hold stocks or bonds, and most of the
world of high finance takes place on a level far removed from
day-to-day reality. So far, few Russians have seen any fallout from
the summer's financial crisis.
	   That could change if the ruble falls, and it could have serious
political consequences.
	   The most immediate possible effect on ordinary people is that
consumer prices would rise sharply, especially on imports. More
than half of the food in Russian stores is imported.
	   That could raise the possibility of social unrest. While there
have been scattered strikes across Russia this summer, so far they
have been uncoordinated and largely ineffective.
	   ``Right now, the population is totally calm,'' says Igor Bunin
of the Moscow branch of the Heritage Foundation, a think tank.
``But devaluation could set them off.''
	   Other analysts don't see a danger of widespread protests. Alan
Rousso of the Carnegie Endowment says uprisings in Russia have
historically been small and localized.
	   ``There are always going to be pockets of social unrest,'' he
says. ``But there's not going to be a wildfire that they can't put
out.''
	   Another consequence of devaluation would likely be the collapse
of as many as half of Russia's 1,500 banks.
	   The first signs of a banking crisis appeared last week, with the
Central Bank suspending some interbank dollar sales and rumors
spreading of some bank defaults. The Central Bank denied the
rumors, but depositors at some banks were told they could withdraw
funds only in rubles, not dollars. Prices at some exchange booths
rose above the official rate.
	   But Russians have been getting by on very little for a long
time. Most of them grow at least some of their own food and have
learned to survive economic and political upheaval.
	   Many Russians, burned by hyperinflation after the Soviet
collapse, now hold their money in dollars _ in accounts or under
the mattress. Those with ruble deposits have placed them
overwhelmingly with the state-backed Sberbank, where the deposits
are guaranteed.
	   Moreover, analysts say most of the banks that would collapse
probably don't deserve to be in business. Many are not traditional
banks and don't hold deposits for customers. Instead, they are
essentially money exchange companies that speculate on the
financial markets and hold most of their assets in over-valued
rubles.
	   In some ways, devaluation could even be beneficial. Banks and
the government would get a break on ruble-denominated debt, paying
it off with cheaper rubles. Russian goods would become more
competitive in relation to imports, giving hard-pressed Russian
companies a boost and perhaps spurring investment in new ones.
	   In the absence of a serious run on the ruble, the government can
probably hold out for a few months. But if current trends continue,
analysts say they can't hold up the ruble indefinitely.

Five Questions with Minnie Driver: feeling foreign in L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 'The Governess' opened Aug. 14 &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHLEEN SAMPEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Her ability to cultivate accents makes Minnie
Driver seem anything but alien in her numerous and varied film
roles.
	   From ``Circle of Friends,'' in which she affected an Irish
brogue, to ``Big Night,'' in which she played an American, Ms.
Driver has exhibited a remarkable ability to blend in perfectly
with her surroundings.
	   In her latest film, ``The Governess,'' the British actress plays
Rosina Da Silva, a Sephardic Jew in 1840s London who must help
support her family by taking a position in Scotland as a governess.
All the while, she hides her Jewish identity to avoid being
dismissed from the job.
	   The experience of being ``alien'' is one Ms. Driver can relate
to as an Englishwoman living in Los Angeles.
	   ``You don't really have reference points culturally with which
to ground yourself,'' she says of her life in these United States.
``Like one's experiences of one's parents talking about the (Second
World) war here is quite different from my parents talking about
the war in England. There is a different set of references. You
have to work very hard to maintain a sense of self when you don't
have people around you that are your people.''
	   The middle of five children, Ms. Driver, 27, attended Bedales, a
Hampshire, England, boarding school from the ages of 6 to 18. She
credits its well-rounded curriculum (``a place where you could play
musical instruments, learn yoga, milk cows'') with helping shape
her self-confidence enough to pursue an acting career.
	   ``I would love to when I'm 65 have a school like that,'' she
says.
	   In the meantime, the best-supporting actress nominee for ``Good
Will Hunting'' continues to beguile audiences with her film work
and is now producing projects under the auspices of Two Drivers,
the Los Angeles-based production company she formed with older
sister, Kate.
	   1. In 'The Governess,' your character sings. Is that really your
voice or was it dubbed?
	   Driver: Yeah, it is my voice. I sing in the shower. I've been
singing 'Polaroids' by Shawn Colvin, which is a really
fantastically brilliant song. I sing Patti Smith when I'm in a bad
mood. ... She's very articulate with her anger.
	   2. Do you have any skittishness about the nude scenes in the
film?
	   Driver: No, because they were completely appropriate. I have a
real problem with gratuitous nudity. That's when I feel like a
whore _ if it were just for titillation. But what that says about
this time period and what that says about (Rosina) _ the
willingness to expose her breasts. It's rather revolutionary.
	   2 1-2 . Did they use a body double for you in any of the nude
scenes?
	   Driver: Yes, they did, which I'm sort of annoyed about because I
prefer my bottom to hers. It's the scene where I'm lying on my
side. ... I may just stand up in cinemas across the country going,
'That's not my bottom!'
	   3. What would you like to see more of in terms of films that
come out of Hollywood?
	   Driver: I think they're underestimating how much people want to
see realistic characters, especially in films like 'Good Will
Hunting' and 'The Opposite of Sex.' People want these types of
character-driven stories.
	   4. What's the best aspect of being a working actress?
	   Driver: The working bit. Being able to utilize your talents on a
day-to-day basis. And not just sit around thinking, 'God, I wish
someone would appreciate and acknowledge this aspect of myself.'
The utilization of creativity is what I find most fulfilling.
	   5. What advice would you give to young girls who see you on
screen and might be inspired to go into acting?
	   Driver: Read. Read. Read. Go back to all the great novels that
they told you to read but that you put down in favor of picking up
Vogue. Go and read Jane Austen, Emily Bronte. See how characters
are created in the minds of old men and old women. How could Thomas
Hardy so understand what it was to be 17 and in love and a woman?
They should think that if 60-year-old Thomas Hardy can create Tess
of the D'Urbervilles, then I can feel her and create her inside,
too.

	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Pete Sampras overcame a determined attack by
Sweden's Magnus Larsson on Saturday night to reach the ATP
Championship finals for the second consecutive year.
	   Sampras celebrated a hard-fought, 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 victory in the
1-hour, 34-minute match by raising his arms to the cheers of the
crowd. This victory took almost twice as long as Sampras' 48-minute
defeat of Vince Spadea on Friday.
	   Sampras, the tournament's top seed, will defend his ATP title on
Sunday against Patrick Rafter, who earlier on Saturday beat
Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 6-0. Rafter, coming off a victory
last week in Toronto, is the first Australian to reach the ATP
final since the tournament began in 1979.
	   Sampras can regain the No. 1 world ranking if he wins Sunday's
final in the dlrs 2.45 million tournament.
	   Larsson, who had won his three previous matches against Sampras,
seized the momentum in the second set with his 120-plus mph
(190-plus kph) serve and powerful forehand returns.
	   But Sampras put aside his frustration and seized the match in
the third set with fiery serves and precise returns as Larsson
tired and faded. Larsson's frustration showed at one point when he
kicked a missed serve by Sampras into the seats.
	   ``Pete has such a great serve. When he gets confident, it's
tough to catch up,'' Larsson said.
	   Sampras made adjustments in the third set to disrupt Larsson's
searing serve and forehand returns.
	   ``I wanted to keep the ball low on Magnus. He's a big guy,''
Sampras said. ``His serve was kicking up. It was giving me
problems.
	   ``He had the momentum. It switched over to me,'' Sampras said.
	   Rafter has reached the finals of four ATP tournaments this
season, and he won the first three.
	   Rafter's win was his first in four matches against Kafelnikov,
who was ranked 10th in the world and seeded eighth in the
tournament. Rafter has won nine consecutive matches, including five
over top-15 opponents.
	   ``He's the hottest player on the tour right now,'' Sampras said.
	   ``My whole game is coming together,'' Rafter said. ``I'm serving
well, I'm volleying well, I'm moving well. I've been returning
well. That's been the biggest thing that's stood out. Usually I
don't return this great.''
	   Rafter, ranked No. 3 in the world and seeded fifth in the
tournament, won 24-of-29 second-set points and 26 of the last 31
points against Kafelnikov.
	   ``I couldn't read which side Patrick was going to serve. (That)
just shows that I was a little bit tired,'' Kafelnikov said.
	   The semifinalists were on serve through the first two games
before Kafelnikov poked a forehand volley into the net to lose his
serve. Rafter set up the set point with a 105-mph ace and
Kafelnikov followed by backhanding Rafter's second serve into the
net to close out the set.
	   Rafter won the next 11 points.

Swing dancing hot in the United States

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ D. Morgan Jahnig and dance partner Kate
Bartoldus spin, swing and gracefully fly across a crowded dance
floor.
	   These two New York University students met earlier this year at
a friend's party. ``When we met,'' Bartoldus gushes, ``it was like
there was no one else in the room except us.'' They became best
friends and dance partners.
	   Swing dancing is hot, from The Masquerade in Atlanta to The
Derby in Los Angeles and Cafe du Nord in San Francisco. Clubgoers
dressed in vintage clothes pack New York's Supper Club and Swing 46
on Friday and Saturday nights.
	   As with most music-inspired trends, what you wear is as
important as the music.
	   But with swing, you also need to know how to move.
	   ``When you go to a club,'' says Bartoldus, 19, ``you should
spend half the time watching and half the time dancing.'' She
scoffs at those who only look the part. ``There was this one guy
who was wearing a fedora and thought he was Frank Sinatra. ... He
wouldn't even go out on the dance floor!''
	   One of her first times out on the dance floor, she wore heels
that were too high. When she was asked to dance by a ``whirling
dervish of swing,'' her feet got tangled and she landed on the
floor. Now her movements are animated yet refined. She and Jahnig
are frequently complimented on their carefree style of dancing.
	   When Bartoldus gets dressed up _ either for work as a hostess at
Swing 46 or for a night of swing _ she might be mistaken for
Marilyn Monroe, Jean Harlow or Kim Basinger's character in ``L.A.
Confidential.'' (Miss Basinger won a best supporting actress Oscar
for her role as the enigmatic call girl made up to resemble
Veronica Lake in the film.)
	   ``I don't think I look like any of those actresses,'' she says.
``It's like people think of me as the first 1940s actress they can
remember and that's how I am.''
	   She does feel ``out of place in the '90s. I don't have a long,
skinny body. I'd do better in the '40s because of my shape.''
	   Bartoldus fancies herself as a ``downtown'' girl. ``If it looks
good and it's cheap, I buy it.''
	   Her partner, also 19, fancies himself an ``uptown'' kind of guy.
Jahnig will spend dlrs 600 on a good suit or dlrs 80 on a nice pair
of cuff links or suspenders. He defends himself against Bartoldus'
teasing, ``It's not snooty, it's classy!''
	   Jahnig learned to dance in Atlanta, where the swing style varies
a bit from the New York style. ``Atlanta style is like Miami style,
not as much jump, but with more turns and spins,'' he says. ``New
York style seems to emphasize footwork and aerials.''
	   ``Everyone thinks 'Swingers' is a swing dance movie,'' laughs
Jahnig, referring to the 1996 movie, which is primarily West Coast
swing. ``But there is about 30 seconds of actual dancing and then
the main character does the same combo over and over again!''
	   Serious dancers insist that for them, swing is not a fad; it's a
way of life.
	   ``I've been dressing this way for years,'' says Louis Vincie of
North Arlington, New Jersey, dressed in a long-sleeve shirt and
tie. ``When the trend dies out, I'm not just going to go and throw
my fat ties away!''
	   At Swing 46, Vincie and Jahnig smoke anisette-flavored cigars
while debating the virtues of wearing silver vs. gold men's jewelry
and discussing the best hair pomades to wear while dancing long
hours.
	   ``You are such GIRLS!'' exclaims Bartoldus.
	   ``Is there anything wrong with taking pride in the way we
look?'' Jahnig responds.
	   Jahnig manages his own swing-devoted Web site that lists the
latest swing releases by local bands, special swing events and a
swing dictionary.

	   In the spotlight: Valerie Harper
	    &UR; Personal stats: Valerie Harper was born in Suffern, New York,
on Aug. 22, 1940. Her father was a traveling salesman; her mother
was a nurse. When Harper was 6, the family moved to Pasadena,
California, before settling down in New Jersey when she was 12.
	    &UR; First job: She got a job with the ballet corps at New York
City's famed Radio City Music Hall. From there, she went into the
chorus lines of various Broadway shows. Her first acting teacher
was the intense, cult star John Cassavetes. (``I was this kid from
ballet with a little Sandra Dee ponytail,'' Harper says.)
	   When she was approached by a casting director for the role of
Mary Tyler Moore's best friend in a new comedy series, Harper had
this reaction: ``I thought, 'forget it. I have dark hair and a
short nose. They'll get a short, fat blonde for contrast.' But they
saw me and told me to come back and read a scene with Mary.''
	   The chemistry worked. Moore and Harper co-starred in ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show'' (1970-77), with Harper leaving the series after
the fourth season to star in the spin-off ``Rhoda,'' which aired
from 1974-78.
	   ``I'd like to be a little more like Rhoda than I am,'' Harper
says. ``She's very aware of who she is, without apologies. I'm a
little more concerned with approval and not rocking the boat than
Rhoda is. It's an area of myself I don't like, but I'm working on
it.''

Car bomb kills 28 in Northern Ireland's deadliest attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 28 dead, 220 injured graf 1; reaction from Prime
Minister Tony Blair graf 10, Sen. George Mitchell graf 11; priest
giving last rites grafs 18,19
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb that killed 28 people
and injured 220 _ the worst single attack in three decades of
conflict in Northern Ireland _ demonstrates the ability of diehard
dissidents to sabotage Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Roman Catholics.
	   Police said a misleading telephone warning caused them to move
people close to a car packed with an estimated 500 pounds (220
kilos) of explosives.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder ... who
gave us a totally inaccurate warning,'' a visibly moved Ronnie
Flanagan, Northern Ireland's police commander, said at the scene.
	   No group claimed responsibility, but politicians blamed IRA
dissidents who are committed to shattering the outlawed group's
13-month-old truce and the April peace accord it helped inspire.
Dissidents have planted several car bombs in other Northern Ireland
towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no deaths.
	   Among the dead from Saturday's blast are three teen-age girls, a
teen-age boy and a young child.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said he
was ``totally horrified'' by the bombing. ``I condemn it without
any equivocation whatsoever,'' Adams said.
	   Political analysts considered his phrase significant. In the
past, Adams has steadfastly refused to ``condemn'' violence by the
IRA or its dissident factions.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed that breakaway IRA
members _ believed to number no more than 100 and mostly based in
the Irish Republic _ would be ``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in France, told
the BBC that he found it ``impossible to get in the mind of anyone
who could possibly do such a thing,'' and the Northern Ireland
Office said that Mo Mowlam, the senior British politician in charge
of the province, had cut short her holiday and would be in Belfast
on Sunday morning.
	   George Mitchell, the former U.S. Senate majority leader who
chaired Northern Ireland's peace talks said the bomb explosion was
the work of ``a very tiny minority of cowards and murderers that
are trying to destroy a process that is supported by an
overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   The explosion came 40 minutes after a telephoned warning to the
BBC in Belfast claimed a bomb had been left outside Omagh's
courthouse on the west end of downtown. Police directed people away
from the area, many of them nearer to the bomb.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Catholic resident of the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with glass and
rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   ``The carnage, the children, a young baby _ pure black,
unrecognizable,'' said a Protestant local, Frank Hancock, too
stunned to cry over what he'd seen. ``A young girl down a manhole
that we had to pull out. A young lad burning, his hair pure
singeing.
	   ``Any man who puts that (bomb) there,'' he said, pointing
angrily at the bomb site, ``and says, `We're the ``real'' IRA' _
they're cowards.''
	   The local Tyrone County Hospital overflowed with wounded.
Survivors used blown-off doors as makeshift stretchers. The Rev.
John Gilmore, a Catholic priest, said that he gave the last rites
to many of the injured.
	   ``To start with it was just nonstop. There were people on the
floors, mattresses and chairs,'' said Gilmore. ``Some of the early
ones were very badly injured.''
	   Other injured people were ferried by ambulance or helicopter to
hospitals in Belfast and Londonderry.
	   The attack coincided with the 29th anniversary of the deployment
of British troops in Belfast, a traditional rallying point for
Irish Republican Army supporters. It also came 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the compromise April
agreement among eight local parties on how this British-ruled
territory should be governed. The White House said Clinton's plans
would not be affected.
	   Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic leader, John Hume, said the
atrocity was ``carried out by undiluted fascists. Obviously they're
trying to impose their will by murder on the people of Ireland,
north and south.''

Attenborough promises new material in NBC documentary, 'Diana'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY383 &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Just when you thought we'd heard and seen
everything possible about Princess Diana, along comes NBC with a
two-hour special, timed to the first anniversary of her death.
	   ``Diana,'' appearing Monday (Aug. 31), is no rip-off of stock
footage and tired reminiscence. The Hallmark documentary bears
impressive credentials: The presenters are Lord Richard
Attenborough, Oscar winner as producer-director of ``Gandhi'' and
friend of Diana; and Robert Halmi Sr., maker of TV
super-productions such as ``Lonesome Dove,'' ``Gulliver's Travels''
and ``Merlin.''
	   Attenborough narrates the film, which includes several talking
heads: Diana's close friends Lucia Flecha de Lima and Lana Marks;
her nanny and schoolteachers; her employer when Diana was a nanny;
and her makeup artist, hairdresser, astrologer and acupuncturist.
Americans contributing interviews include first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Katharine Graham of The Washington Post.
	   His lordship (he announces himself on the phone as Dickie
Attenborough) called from the south of France to discuss the
special and tell how he became involved.
	   ``Robert Halmi apparently had this idea that it would be very
interesting to have a program that would be focused for American
audiences,'' said the filmmaker and veteran actor (``Jurassic
Park''). ``It would be relevant to those in America who might not
be as familiar with the princess as people were in the U.K.''
	   Brian Eastman, who had produced Attenborough's film
``Shadowlands,'' knew of Attenborough's 16-year friendship with
Diana when he proposed the project. Attenborough agreed, provided
the film would benefit his charity, the Royal Academy of Dramatic
Arts, and the Princess Diana Fund.
	   Attenborough recalled meeting Diana through Prince Charles
shortly after their marriage.
	   ``I had known Charles for quite a long time, and he wrote to me
and said, 'My young bride finds public speaking very difficult.
She's very shy, she doesn't know about microphones, she doesn't
know about projection, she doesn't know about engaging an audience.
If you have the time, would you like to coach her?'
	   ``Me being me, (I knew) she was a very good-looking young woman.
I said, 'Yes, I'd be thrilled, but I'm not sure she would be. Let
me go meet her, and if she likes the idea, we could work out a
program.'''
	   For the better part of a year, Attenborough visited Kensington
Palace to coach the royal Eliza Doolittle. She proved, he said, to
be a ``tremendous'' student.
	   ``Academically, no, she would never stretch in those terms,'' he
observed. ``But in terms of intuition and human relationships, she
was marvelous.''
	   Technique came fast: 10 minutes. Then Attenborough turned to
``giving her self-confidence, trying to convince her that what she
set out to do she was totally capable of doing. If she felt
strongly and deeply about certain things in life _ provided those
things were real _ she should have absolutely no difficulty in
conveying them.''
	   ``Diana'' contains new footage of a much-photographed life,
Attenborough said. But the documentary's impact may come from the
testimony of those whose lives she touched, from people in
positions of power to AIDS patients to victims of land mines.
	   Since her death in the Paris car crash, Princess Diana has been
eulogized, analyzed and scrutinized from every possible point of
view. Attenborough offers one more:
	   ``She was an exceptional young woman who never dreamt that she
was going to be thrown into a maelstrom, never felt that she would
have to battle the infrastructures of royalty and the whole panoply
of problems of the Establishment, many of which she found
unacceptable, particularly in relation to her sons.
	   ``She was determined that they would know something of ordinary
people's lives...She was absolutely determined that the
Establishment would not prevent the two boys from knowing what life
was really like and what royalty, if it was to continue, would have
to rectify.''

MGM lion surviving by a whisker _ business as unusual at troubled
</HEADLINE>
studio &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The lion wept the day MGM started selling
memories. In an infamous Hollywood garage sale in 1970, the
money-starved studio sold a trove of film treasures _ from a
``Ben-Hur'' chariot to the gown Elizabeth Taylor wore in ``Raintree
County'' _ for a paltry dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Since then, the once-glorious movie factory has been knocked
around, hacked apart, sold and resold so many times that there's
hardly any energy left for tears of nostalgia or regret, just a
drive to survive or divide. With MGM you never know which is next.
	   The studio that still represents all that was grand and
glamorous about Hollywood has sent out word that it's in serious
trouble again and is looking for help in the form of a merger
partner.
	   Bleeding money and producing box office duds, MGM said it would
prune its annual film slate by a couple of movies, freeze TV
production and raise dlrs 250 million in a stock offering.
	   Business at MGM has operated under such clouds for some time,
ever since the golden age of the 1930s and '40s yielded to years
plagued by everything from management upheaval to alleged corporate
wrongdoing. The last 29 years, since MGM was taken over the first
of three times by financier Kirk Kerkorian, have been the most
volatile.
	   ``It's a very rocky history. It's a very complicated history,''
said securities analyst Harold Vogel of Cowen and Co. ``It's been
bought and sold a number of times. It's been destabilized and
chopped apart over the years.''
	   Ironically, the studio began as a merger, created in 1924 as a
combination of three pioneering film companies: The Metro Picture
Corp., the Goldwyn Picture Corp. and Louis B. Mayer Pictures. It
was all placed under the corporate watch of movie house giant
Loew's Inc.
	   At its peak, MGM had under contract the biggest stars in motion
pictures: Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Judy Garland, Greta Garbo,
Spencer Tracy, William Powell, James Stewart, Norma Shearer and
Elizabeth Taylor.
	   The films opened with a roar from Leo the lion in the famous
logo that featured the motto, ``Ars Gratia Artis,'' roughly
translated as ``Art for art's sake.''
	   This was the studio of ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' ``Ben-Hur,'' ``Mutiny on the Bounty,'' ``The Thin Man,''
``Dinner at Eight,'' ``The Good Earth,'' ``An American in Paris,''
``Singin' in the Rain,'' and the low-budget ``Andy Hardy'' and
``Tarzan'' series.
	   As the golden era came to a close amid antitrust actions and the
exodus of audiences to television, MGM went through periods of boom
and bust, finally being scooped up in 1969 by Kerkorian, who
instituted a draconian cost-cutting campaign that Hollywoodstill
talks about. The purge included the sale of thousands of props and
wardrobe items in the 1970 auction.
	   ``Kirk gets a lot of the blame for the troubles MGM is in. On
the other hand, if it hadn't been for Kirk, there probably wouldn't
have been an MGM that survived,'' said Art Murphy, a longtime
entertainment writer, lecturer and former box office analyst for
the trade papers.
	   But Peter Bart, a former MGM executive and now editor in chief
of the trade paper Variety, wrote in ``Fade Out,'' his 1990 book
about the studio, that Kerkorian was a ``one-man wrecking crew''
who picked his managers ineptly and made a fortune by carving up
and selling off pieces of the studio.
	   Kerkorian, who is notoriously press-shy, has actually bought MGM
three times and controls it today. He first sold it to Ted Turner
in 1986 for a reported dlrs 1.5 billion. Turner sold it back to him
just three months later for dlrs 300 million but kept the library
of pre-1986 MGM films, including Turner's favorite, ``Gone With the
Wind.''
	   Four years later, Kerkorian sold the studio to Italian financier
Giancarlo Parretti for dlrs 1.3 billion, beginning what is
considered to be MGM's darkest era. The studio's money problems
were so bad at times that it couldn't afford to distribute movies
it had already made.
	   Kerkorian purchased MGM a third time in 1996 when an investment
group he led picked up the studio for dlrs 1.3 billion from a
French state bank, which had sized control of MGM from Parretti in
1991.
	   Since then it's been a rocky road, even under the stewardship of
respected executive Frank Mancuso, the former Paramount Pictures
studio chief who had been hired by the bank.
	   This year, MGM lost dlrs 55 million in the second quarter and
said it would try to get a cash infusion through the dlrs 250
million stock offering. Its corporate credit card is nearly tapped
out; dlrs 1.3 billion in credit is down to about dlrs 132 million.
	   MGM accelerated its production to guard against an actors strike
that failed to materialize, and thus far in 1998 has had a string
of turkeys, with a particularly awful summer, low-lighted by
``Dirty Work,'' a comedy so bad that MGM dared not show it to
critics before it opened. The movie has grossed a puny dlrs 10
million to scathing reviews.
	   ``Disturbing Behavior'' got better notices but has collected
just dlrs 15.7 million.
	   Through last weekend, MGM was dead last among the major
Hollywood studios in market share, behind even the moribund
Universal Studios. Its films have collected just dlrs 138.7
million, or 3.4 percent of the market. By contrast, industry leader
Paramount's films have grossed of dlrs 804 million, or 19.5 percent
of the market.

LOS ANGELES: the market.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Only one MGM movie this year has grossed more than dlrs 20
million at the box office. ``The Man in the Iron Mask,'' basking in
the post-''Titanic'' Leonardo DiCaprio glow, grossed dlrs 57
million.
	   The best thing MGM has going for it is the James Bond franchise.
The latest installment, ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' released last
December, grossed dlrs 125 million domestically and represents the
biggest chunk of MGM's 1998 market share.
	   The next 007 movie out of the pipeline isn't due until November
1999, with Pierce Brosnan returning in ``Bond 19.'' But even if MGM
survives that long, there's no guarantee its hold on the Bond
franchise will.
	   Sony has been fighting MGM in court for the right to develop its
own Bond movie, possibly under the guidance of Roland Emmerich and
Dean Devlin, the filmmakers behind ``Independence Day'' and
``Godzilla.'' MGM has won the early rounds, and the case is set for
trial in December.
	   MGM is expected to have enough cash to complete 10 movies now in
various stagesof production, including ``Ronin,'' starring Robert
DeNiro; ``Carrie II,'' a belated sequel to the 1976 prom-night
blood-fest picture, and an adaptation of the hippie-era ``Mod
Squad'' TV show.
	   After that, who knows?
	   Even if MGM finds a suitor, that doesn't necessarily ensure the
survival of the film factory that created the magic of Dorothy
following the yellow brick road and Gene Kelly singing in the rain.
MGM's appeal right now is the value of what's left of its library
and that lion logo, designed so many years ago by a publicist.
	   ``I'm just amazed MGM has survived this long,'' said Murphy.

Timor leader calls Australia's support for Indonesian rule
</HEADLINE>
``racist''

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ East Timor resistance leader Jose
Ramos Horta has accused Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer of ``white supremacist views'' for opposing a referendum on
East Timor's future.
	   The Sunday Age quoted Ramos Horta as saying Downer's attitude on
East Timor's future ``verges on racism.''
	   He claimed successive Australian governments had helped
Indonesia cover up its atrocities in East Timor.
	   The Melbourne newspaper said Downer last week welcomed a
Portugal-Indonesia agreement to begin negotiations on limited East
Timor autonomy but had said the Australian government wanted East
Timor to remain part of Indonesia.
	   During a brief visit to Australia, Ramos Horta, one of the
winners of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, said Downer was parroting
Indonesian views and clinging to the discredited leadership in
Jakarta, the paper reported.
	   ``It is ignorance and lack of humility and courage to realize
Australia was wrong all these years,'' he said. ``I guess it is
this white supremacist view that we can do no wrong.''
	   Ramos Horta said Australia's views were increasingly irrelevant
and out of step with world opinion.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 after Portugal's withdrawal
and annexed the territory the next year. The seizure has been
repeatedly condemned by U.N. resolution.
	   Tens of thousands of East Timorese are believed to have died as
a result of the Indonesian invasion and Jakarta's heavy-handed
suppression of the independence movement.

Howard says peace process must not be derailed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
said Sunday the Northern Ireland car bombing was the ultimate evil
which should not be allowed to derail the region's peace process.
	   ``They are terrible events, it is just the ultimate evil to use
barbaric acts of terrorism to try and stop the peace process that
the agony of that country cries out for,'' Howard said on a current
affairs television program.
	   The bomb killed 27 people and injured more than 200 _ the worst
single attack in three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Roman Catholics.
	   ``I can only express on behalf I know of all Australians my
repugnance and horror at what has occurred to say to both (British
Prime Minister Tony) Blair and (Irish Prime Minister Bertie) Ahern
. . . keep your resolve as I know you will about the peace
process,'' Howard said.
	   ``To the people of Northern Ireland who have suffered so much
this is an act of barbarism designed to deny you the peace to which
you are entitled.'' (djp)

Putting John Irving's `The Cider House Rules' on stage
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MICHAEL KUCHWARA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Drama Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The task appears daunting: how to put on
stage a visual and verbal equivalent of ``The Cider House Rules,''
John Irving's lengthy novel of one man's coming of age.
	   The saga of orphan Homer Wells is Dickensian in scale and
ambition. Twenty-two actors portray scores of characters in a
time-traveling story that spans decades _ from the 1920s into the
'50s with an important flashback into the late 19th century.
	   Not the least of the play's ambitions is its attempt to deal
with the divisive question of abortion.
	   Its major characters include Homer's mentor, Dr. Wilbur Larch.
The good doctor is the guiding spirit of a Maine orphanage, doing
what he calls the Lord's work: Delivering babies and, if asked,
terminating pregnancies.
	   No wonder that what comes to life on stage at the Mark Taper
Forum is performed in two parts, lasting a total of six hours.
Audiences can see them over a two-day period or in day-long
marathons on Saturdays or Sundays through Sept. 27.
	   That makes for a difficult sell, but one that Gordon Davidson,
artistic head of the Taper, said was worth the time and expense.
	   ``With that novel and the quality of it comes a subject of real
importance _ the question of a woman's right to choose,'' Davidson
says. ``I'm less interested in advocacy than I am in getting the
issues out there, so people can think about them.
	   ``The power of the play is how complicated those issues are.
It's one thing when it is on the abstract level. It's another thing
when it starts to hit closer to home.''
	   For example, Davidson says, in Part 1 of the play, Homer Wells,
as Dr. Larch's protege, proclaims he will not perform abortions. In
Part 2, those issues come home very personally for him: On one
hand, fathering an illegitimate child and then, saving someone's
life.
	   The stage adaptation was the brainchild of Tom Hulce, best known
for playing Mozart in the film version of ``Amadeus'' and, not
surprisingly, a big fan of the novel since it was published in
1985.
	   Yet Hulce didn't know how strongly he felt about the book until
about eight years ago when he had a meeting with a director who was
going to make a film version _ with the actor possibly playing the
young hero.
	   ``I found out I had such a passion for this story,'' says Hulce,
recalling his two-hour discussion with the filmmaker. ``Yet I
realized that the moments I was talking about were moments that
required your imagination, which the literalness of film couldn't
embrace as easily.''
	   That movie version _ another is upcoming _ never materialized.
Yet out of those two hours Hulce got the idea to pursue a theater
version, one he would co-direct with Jane Jones who runs the
Book-It Repertory Theater in Seattle.
	   Book-It adapts great works of literature for the theater,
preserving the author's original narrative. Jones had always wanted
to work on a stage adaptation of John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of
Wrath.'' Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago got there first.
	   Hulce first met Jones while working off-Broadway in 1982 in
``The Rise and Rise of Daniel Rocket,'' a play by Peter Parnell.
	   ``When the novel first came out, Tom told me I should read it,''
Parnell says. ``Because I am a slow reader, I didn't. Then, when he
started thinking about adapting it, I did.''
	   It took some persuading to get Parnell to agree to tackle the
project. More than five years later, he is still at it.
	   ``I did run in the other direction for a while because I didn't
know where to begin,'' the playwright says. He finally was inspired
by a section of the novel where Homer Wells reads ``David
Copperfield,'' and becomes an apprentice to Dr. Larch. It
eventually became the first act ending of Part 1.
	   This ``Cider House Rules'' uses a concept Davidson pioneered
more than 30 years ago with ``Story Theater,'' productions which
used narrative as a strong part of the theater experience.
	   ``We very much wanted to celebrate John's novel rather than go
about it in a much more common way, in which you sort of write a
play inspired by the book,'' Hulce says. ``We wanted to retain his
voice and explore every way we could to tell his story on the
stage.'' Large chunks of the novel were spoken directly to the
audience.
	   ```Cider House' doesn't have the same kind of melodramatic
mechanism that a `Nicholas Nickleby' has, where it is just full-out
heroes and villains,'' Hulce says. ``It is a gentler, more lyrical
world.''
	   Irving was skeptical too. Theater had never interested him, he
says. In fact, he had only seen one play in the last 10 years.
Still, he gave tentative approval for an exploratory production.
	   So far, audience reaction to the play's take on abortion has
been muted.
	   ``I think because both sides of the abortion debate are well
spoken for in this piece, it hasn't inflamed people,'' Hulce says.
``The play also takes place, as the book does, in a kind of fable
world. It allows us to go into the areas we do in a way that is
more comfortable for audiences.
	   ``The hardest thing is to find where the common ground is
between the two sides,'' Hulce says. ``The way it is positioned in
this story, where Homer clearly finds himself on the other side of
the issue from Dr. Larch and yet finds a way to be respectful of
Larch's choice. But it is definitely tricky business.''

	   ``Hello Nasty'' (Capitol) _ Beastie Boys
	   For anyone who came of age in the 1980s, the Beastie Boys'
``Hello Nasty'' is probably this year's mandatory buy _ with
reservations.
	   On their latest chart-topping release, smarmy nonsense still
prevails. ``Don't mean to brag/Don't mean to boast/But I'm
intercontinental when I eat French toast,'' they sing on ``The
Move.'' The song proves the group's loose demeanor is still intact
from the days of ``Brass Monkey.''
	   The best tracks employ deep, reverberating beats. ``Putting
Shame in Your Game'' and ``Three MCs and One DJ'' both succeed
where hackneyed instrumental offerings fail.
	   But about halfway through ``Hello Nasty'' it is apparent that
the Boys' vocal talents are mostly overshadowed by better mixing
effects and good DJ work. Much of the handiwork is juggled by
turntablist Mix Master Mike. Indeed, the trademark ``pass-the-mic''
rhyme schemes quickly wear thin.
	   The exception is ``Intergalactic.'' Here, the marriage of beats
and rhymes is handled deftly, with sampling and record scratching
giving way to powerful vocals.
	   Perhaps the drawback of each ensuing Beastie Boys album is the
absence of peer pressure. Whereas rap bands are traditionally
compelled to do long segments of braggadocio to position themselves
as better than the next group, the Beastie Boys are often
self-deprecatingly distinct.
	   What competition? They've been the only frat-rap group in the
record bin worth listening to for the last decade. Who are they
going to battle? Only themselves and their previous efforts.
	   If the goal of this album is to display versatility _ job well
done. But when the Beastie Boys are remembered 20 years from now,
it will be for their bare-chested, beer-swilling bravado, and not
their experimentalists-cum-Tibetan-freedom-fighters posturing.
	   I liked them better when they cared less. Proof positive that
maturity kills rap.
	   _ By Ron Harris, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Embrya'' (Columbia) _ Maxwell
	   Maxwell's fans and his record label media machine would have you
think that he is the embodiment of artistry and soul. Don't believe
them.
	   When it comes to follow-ups, ``Embrya'' hits sophomore slump big
time. There are a couple of interesting moments here and there, but
for the most part, it's uninspiring.
	   Yes, there are a lot of different sounds layered here, and
different styles of music, but few of the songs have the hook that
will grab the listener in the way ``Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder)''
from the first album did.
	   ``Luxury:Cococure,'' the first single, is decent, as are
``Matrimony:Maybe You'' and ``Gravity:Pushing to Pull.'' The rest
of the album is blah, and painful to listen to, as when he sings
poorly in Spanish on ``I'm You: You Are Me and We Are You (pt me
and you).''
	   Talking about ``Embrya'' in the media materials, Maxwell says,
``It represents a birthing of myself, of a whole other person, but
at this point I'm in that period of change, that moment of limbo
where I'm going to be that thing but I'm not there yet.''
	   Obviously.

	   ``Comin' Atcha'' (Maverick) _ Cleopatra
	   It should not be this easy to love this disc.
	   At first glance, there would seem to be too many layers of
cloying cuteness to get through _ three beautiful teen sisters from
England, daughters of a former session singer, singing lyrics
written by the middle sister, set to infectious rhythm 'n' blues
and pop beats. How very precious.
	   Saving it from being relegated to the back of the shelf is the
sheer talent and potential that come through, largely because of
the efforts of lead singer and middle sister Cleopatra.
	   All three of the girls _ Zainam, 17, Cleo, 16, and Yonah, 14 _
have good voices. But since Cleo is heard most, it's up to her to
set the tone and catch the listener's interest. She does.
	   Her voice ranges from childlike to powerful. And on ``I Want You
Back,'' a cover of the Jackson 5 song, she sounds like she could
give Michael a run for his money.
	   Her lyrics show considerable promise. Some, like ``Life Ain't
Easy'' and ``The World We Live In,'' were very obviously written by
a teen. But others, like ``A Touch of Love,'' ``What You Gonna Do
Boy?'' and ``The Bird Song,'' show that Cleo could easily make a
living as a songwriter if the singing gig gets old.
	   The melodies are infectious on the high-energy songs, and
beautiful on the ballads. ``Cleopatra's Theme'' is guaranteed to
stick in your head, and ``The Bird Song'' is hauntingly gorgeous.
	   All this on a debut release. The future looks bright.
	   _ By Deepti Hajela, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Live at the Old Absinthe House Bar'' (Justin Time) _ Bryan Lee
	   This disc is as much about an irreplaceable club as it is about
an unsung performer recorded in his best live element. There are
better blues performances to be found, but no better finds for
sentimental collectors.
	   Bryan Lee and The Jumpstreet Five were an attraction for 14
years at the Old Absinthe, a must-stop on Bourbon Street where
Jimmy Page, Johnny Winter and Sting had stopped to catch the blind
guitar impresario and to mix with his band. Guests for this show
include the esteemed James Cotton and young guitar sensation Kenny
Wayne Shepherd.
	   All were there to bid farewell to a smoky, brick wall club
founded in 1800. It has been remodeled as a tropical tourist bar,
an incomprehensible loss to Bourbon Street. The poignancy of the
event does not tighten the loose musical edges or freshen up the
band's lack of originality on this disc, but Bryan Lee is all heart
and does not hold back.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It's easy to picture Nanci Griffith as a
schoolmarm, bustling into classrooms with an autoharp and
well-thumbed songbook.
	   She's a teacher for the 1990s, though _ one who can bring Lyle
Lovett, Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle, Richard Thompson, Lucinda
Williams, Guy Clark and Jerry Jeff Walker along to class.
	   Through her Grammy Award-winning album, ``Other Voices, Other
Rooms,'' and its recently released sequel, Griffith is the heir to
a tradition of folk singers who believe it's important to pass
along songs from generation to generation.
	   Genetics helped make the 43-year-old singer this way. Her
musicologist father who sang in a barbershop quartet. Her
jazz-loving mother still fumes when her daughter is described as a
country singer. So Griffith couldn't help but become absorbed in
music's history.
	   And as someone who appreciates tradition, nothing annoys her
more than seeing it ignored.
	   During the '80s, folk music was treated like a pariah in the
music industry, Griffith said in an interview while visiting New
York City. ``Everyone was so afraid of being called a folk
songwriter or a folk singer. You had to be called a
singer-songwriter,'' she recalled.
	   Many of these singer-songwriters _ no, she won't name names _
arrogantly refused to give credit to their influences.
	   ``That really offended me,'' she said, ``because songs should
have a life. They should be sung. As Pete Seeger said, 'They should
be on the lips of babes.' This is an American genre, and if we
don't preserve it, it will die.''
	   Griffith's definition of modern folk is refreshingly broad: Pete
Seeger's traditional ``If I Had a Hammer,'' bracing pop nuggets
from the '60s, irony-laced rock songs from British bards, the work
of her fellow Texas troubadours and rap all have a home.
	   Except for the rap, those styles are all part of ``Other Voices
Too (A Trip Back to Bountiful),'' a 19-song collection with a
staggering list of 67 guests.
	   The first collection took two years to pull together because no
one could understand why a songwriter would want so much help
singing songs other people wrote. This time, Griffith had no
trouble recruiting peers. During the recording of ``Wasn't That a
Mighty Storm,'' 37 people crowded around microphones.
	   ``The food was great, the beer was good, everyone stayed,'' she
said. ``We had to push Jerry Jeff Walker out the door because he
had a show. It was so much warmth and companionship and fun. That
was a blessing.''
	   It was also somewhat surreal: Griffith and Harris giggled from
an adjoining room listening to Texas macho men Earle, Walker,
Clark, and Jimmie Dale Gilmore argue over who would sing a line
about being a sidekick. Walker won.
	   Some of the songwriters featured, like Seeger and Stephen
Foster, are well-known. But Griffith also covers the work of
colleagues who can use attention, like fellow Texas songwriters
Mickie Merkens and John Grimaudo. Vince Gill was noticed and signed
a record contract because of his work on the first album.
	   Griffith is adamant that there will be no third volume. The
concept becomes less special when it is repeated, and she doesn't
want to repeat the logistical nightmare of pulling it all together.
	   Even with all the participants, there were people she wanted
whose schedules kept them away, like Billy Bragg and Nick Lowe.
Seeger missed the re-recording of ``If I Had a Hammer'' because,
appropriately enough, he was attending a children's music workshop.
	   ``Once everybody gets together, it's great,'' she said. ``But
it's kind of like childbirth _ am I going to forget the pain of
what it takes to get it all done? There will be no more children.
I'm not going to forget how much this hurts.''
	   Griffith authored a companion book, ``Other Voices,'' that will
be published in September. It tells of her personal love of music
and journey of discovery.
	   She's convinced that the reluctance of radio stations to mix
different styles makes it much harder for young people today to
discover new and different music.
	   ``If I were growing up now, I would have never heard Loretta
Lynn, I would never have heard Buck Owens,'' she said. ``I would
never have heard these artists, because I wouldn't have been
listening to country music stations.''
	   The new album concentrates on music of the 1960s and early 1970s
because, she believes, that was a time of fewer boundaries in
music. Yet her own book proves that no era is perfect: Susan
Cowsill contributes a poignant essay in Griffith's book on how her
mother was snubbed by the folk music community when her family
became a successful pop singing act.
	   Although she's performing this summer with the Newport Folk
Festival tour, Griffith soon will be spending more time at home.
Tired from a battle with breast cancer and being too long on the
road, she's disbanding the Blue Moon Orchestra and promising to
take five years off from recording.
	   She's working with the Nashville Symphony and Nashville Ballet
on a project centered around her songs. And she enjoys touring as a
member of the Crickets, Buddy Holly's former band, which allows her
to blend into the background.
	   ``I developed a new respect for being a rhythm guitar player and
backup singer, which is how I started out, and how much freer I
felt not to have all this responsibility,'' she said.

Under new management, Spin aims for a broader youth culture

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The most widely read alternative music magazine
in the United States has a new Spin.
	   Since the mid-1980s, Spin magazine has grown from a brash
upstart nipping at Rolling Stone's heels into the bible for
alternative music. But since founder Bob Guccione Jr. sold the
magazine last year, its new editor, Michael Hirschorn, has revamped
Spin with an eye to expanding its musical range and adding more
fashion, film, technology and literary coverage.
	   The aim is to ``preserve its core but broaden the magazine
rather dramatically to include more kinds of music and more kinds
of cutting-edge culture,'' said Hirschorn, a young veteran of the
magazine business.
	   ``Nobody is doing a magazine of high editorial standards and
sophistication and wit for the under-30 crowd,'' he said.
	   At 34, Hirschorn is at the far end of Spin's 18-to-34-year-old
readership. A former editor at New York and Esquire magazines, he
came to Spin in June 1997 after it was bought for dlrs 43 million
by Miller Publishing Group, the parent company of Quincy Jones'
hip-hop and R and B magazine Vibe.
	   Hirschorn's quest to revamp Spin is seen in the September issue,
touted as the most radical redesign in its 13-year history. The
overhauled issue, which hit newsstands Aug. 10, includes a larger
logo and expanded music-news section called ``Noise.''
	   The 200-page issue is Spin's fattest ever and features three
separate covers _ one for each of the Beastie Boys, the white rap
pioneers whose career is celebrated with a 13-page retrospective.
	   Under Guccione, Spin built a strong following by covering bands
that the mainstream media and other music magazines, such as
Rolling Stone, largely ignored. Spin now has circulation of about
535,000.
	   Hirschorn wants to keep Spin's alternative music focus, but also
feature more hip-hop and mainstream artists generating buzz among
its readers in the post-grunge era.
	   ``Among the youngest part of our readership, pop music is
dominant in a way that it hasn't been dominant since the early
'70s,'' he said. ``We're writing about that music now on a regular
basis because it is part of the landscape that our younger readers
inhabit.''
	   Longtime readers might be put off by more articles about
mainstream artists, but Hirschorn said Spin can cover Top 40 acts
and retain its credibility.
	   ``You can be funny about it,'' he said. ``We had a piece about
the Backstreet Boys that listed hundreds of aggrieved letters from
10-year-old girls who felt that we weren't respectful enough of the
band.''
	   Advertisers have been responding to the changes at Spin,
particularly to its greater emphasis on fashion. Ad pages are up
2.5 percent from the January through September issues compared to
last year.
	   Spin is also moving to expand its brand name. Spin Television, a
monthly half-hour video show, premiered last month on a new cable
channel called Access Entertainment Network, seen in 6 million
homes. The magazine will also launch its own Web site early next
year. It's now available on the Internet only through America
Online.
	   Spin already delivers news and hour-long specials to radio
stations through a venture with Westwood One, a leading provider of
radio programming, and produces weekly syndicated programming for
college radio stations.
	   Another magazine could be in the works as Spin tries to keep on
top of ever-changing youth culture, Hirschorn said.
	   ``It's a tricky and elusive audience. They love things and hate
things very quickly, and change their minds very quickly,'' he
said. ``Anytime you get a whiff that something's about to be
exciting and happening, you have to leap on it immediately.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Linda Russak's weekly appointments at Broadway's
Imperial Theater, home to the production of ``Les Miserables,''
have made her a fixture at the show.
	   Ushers greet her by her first name as they show her to her seat,
the same seat she's had for the past 441 weeks, a seat where the
actors can easily see her in her traditional garb _ sweatshirts
emblazoned with the musical's logo.
	   Every musical on Broadway has them: fans who can recite lyrics
and lines, cast changes and show lore. They go again and again and
again, sometimes becoming as much a part of the performance as the
actors on stage.
	   Unlike repeat moviegoers, these fans may spend thousands of
dollars to see their favorite show over a spell of years. They
become recognizable to actors, ushers and ticket sellers.
	   ``We rely on the repeat patron. They can help keep a show
going,'' says Jim Randolph, a spokesman for the musical ``Cats,''
the longest-running show in Broadway history, which indeed has its
share of Broadway groupies.
	   Almost every Sunday since the mid-1980s, Hector Montalvo has
purchased a dlrs 20 standing-room ticket to see ``Cats.'' He has
spent almost dlrs 10,000 to date.
	   About 10 years ago, Montalvo, a 43-year-old Manhattan computer
salesman, began sketching cartoons of the actors in their various
characters. Now every time someone is added to the cast, Montalvo
presents the actor with a cartoon portrait.
	   Many of the more than 230 sketches he has done hang in the
dressing rooms at the Winter Garden Theater.
	   ``Of course, there's more to life than just theater,'' he says.
``But I think there is something in everybody's life that they do
that becomes a part of them. For some, it may be a television show,
a book or a movie. For me, it's `Cats.'''
	   For Mrs. Russak, it's more personal. The 59-year-old retired
schoolteacher started going as a way to feel closer to her late
husband, who had also been a fan of ``Les Miserables''.
	   ``I lost a lot in that one death _ my best friend, my lover,
everything. I didn't know how to do anything without him ... and I
didn't want to go anywhere,'' she says. ``The first time I went to
see `Les Miz,' it was hard. ... And the next week I thought, `That
made me feel good. I have to do that again.'''
	   Mrs. Russak estimated her ``weekly appointments'' have cost her
about dlrs 30,000, including donations _ the price of a ticket _ to
Broadway Cares, an AIDS charity.
	   ``Yes, it's the same every week. But it's different, too,'' she
said. ``You begin to focus on different aspects of it ... or look
for subtle changes in the characters, ... in the music.''
	   The cast considers Mrs. Russak a fringe member, says actor Craig
Schulman, who portrays Valjean, the lead in the musical based on
Victor Hugo's book, ``Les Miserables.''
	   ``I always know when she's in the audience. She sends baked
goods to the cast ... and cards,'' Schulman says.
	   But Mrs. Russak says she never interferes with the show or
pushes unwanted attention on the actors.
	   ``You don't break the fourth wall. You don't get too close to
them when they're on stage,'' she says. ``That's their job. I don't
want to interfere with that.''
	   The recent arrest of Michael Falkner, 29, during a performance
of ``Beauty and the Beast'' for allegedly harassing and sending
threatening mail to star Debbie Gibson shows that fans sometimes
cross the line. Falkner has pleaded innocent to the charges.
	   But for the most part the fans are respectful, actors say.
	   ``Many of them just want you to know how much the show means to
them or how much they relate to a particular character,'' says Gwen
Stewart, one of the stars of ``Rent'' and a vocalist on the hit
Broadway cast recording. ``You don't get that when you go to a
movie.''
	   Walking into the Nederlander Theater on this night, much like
every night, Ms. Stewart was stopped by fans, many of whom she has
come to recognize.
	   ``I thought you were leaving'' on vacation, she says to
17-year-old Rachel Altman as she gives the young fan a hug and
signs autographs for others.
	   ``Tomorrow,'' Miss Altman says, grinning ear-to-ear from the
personal attention. ``I just had to see it one more time.''
	   Typically, Miss Altman waits with several hundred others for a
chance to win a pair of dlrs 20 front-row tickets in a nightly
lottery. To increase her chances of winning, she makes deals or
encourages passers-by to enter the drawing on her behalf. She has
only lost once in the 31 drawings she has tried for in successive
weeks and she bought standing-room tickets three other times.
	   ``I'll stop when it stops,'' she says.
	   Ms. Stewart sings a few lines of ``Happy Birthday'' into a
cassette recorder for a young woman who wants to make the tape a
present for a friend, another fan of the musical.
	   ``It's like this all the time,'' Ms. Stewart says, breaking away
from the group with polite apologies. ``But they are the heart of
the show. They are what keeps you going when you're doing your
eighth performance of the week and you're tired. You know they are
going to ... appreciate it.''
	   Sharon Taylor of Dallas lives too far away to meet the stars of
her favorite musical, ``Les Miserables.''
	   In fact, she has only seen the show on Broadway twice. But she
has seen nearly every traveling production of the show in Texas
during the past six years.
	   Six years ago, sure that there were others like herself, she
started Barricade, the musical's unofficial newsletter. Today, the
quarterly is handed out in the musical's press kit.
	   ``People enjoy finding out there are other people out there who
also like the show,'' Ms. Taylor says, adding she has about 400
subscribers from as far away as Australia.

Making sense of snubs in Country Music Association awards

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ For all their fame and riches,
country music singers Alan Jackson and LeAnn Rimes have lost a
little luster after failing to be nominated for an award by the
Country Music Association this year.
	   The CMA Awards, to be handed out Sept. 23 at the Grand Ole Opry
House, are considered country music's most prestigious. Just being
nominated can indicate a career is on the upswing.
	   For Jackson, who has garnered 40 CMA nominations and six awards
since 1990, being snubbed is an abrupt change. The blond singer of
``Chattahoochee'' and ``Gone Country'' had been nominated for the
top award of Entertainer of the Year each year since 1992 _ he won
in 1995 _ and for male vocalist every year since 1991.
	   Rimes, 16, who rose to fame in 1996 with her Patsy Cline
soundalike hit ``Blue,'' was nominated for a total of five CMA
awards in 1996 and 1997, including best female vocalist last year.
But she has never won.
	   How could two of the industry's top-selling artists fail to get
a single nomination this year? The answers are with the 6,100
country music industry workers who are CMA members and pick the
nominees and winners.
	   For best entertainer, voters are supposed to choose ``the act
displaying the greatest competence in all aspects of the
entertainment field,'' including quality of records and ``in-person
performance, staging, public acceptance, attitude, leadership, and
overall contribution to the Country Music image.''
	   The criteria on the CMA ballot for best male and female vocalist
are a little simpler: ``individual musical performance on records
or in person.''
	   In reality, the nominees are selected on the basis of a
hard-to-define mix of talent, commercial success, popularity and
CMA voters' loyalty to artists in whom they have a stake.
	   Rimes' career was built on the worship of pre-teen and teen-age
girls. Unfortunately for her, they don't nominate or vote for the
CMA Awards.
	   On the other hand, there are plenty of women in the music
industry in their 30s and 40s who have lots in common with singers
like Lee Ann Womack, Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, Faith Hill
and Patty Loveless, who are nominated for best female vocalist. And
these industry workers have a voice in who gets recognized by the
CMA.
	   The unusual handling of Rimes' hit ``How do I live'' may give an
insight into what sways a CMA vote.
	   Rimes recorded ``How do I Live'' for the movie ``Con Air,'' but
it was rejected and Yearwood was brought in to record it. All the
same, Curb Records decided to release Rimes' rendition.
	   Yearwood got the country hit, while Rimes got a pop smash. But
taking a competing record of the same song to pop radio may have
caused resentment against Rimes among some CMA voters.
	   Alan Jackson's streak of CMA nominations ends as he enjoys great
success with ``I'll Go On Loving You,'' the first single from a new
album.
	   ``Believe me, I don't see this as any kind of a career
problem,'' said Fletcher Foster of Arista Records, Jackson's record
label. ``A lot of it is the result of things like the timing of his
album releases and his deciding to take a break from touring.''
	   Other country bigshots have had gaps in nominations with little
harm to their careers. George Strait wasn't nominated for best
entertainer from 1992-95 and Reba McEntire suddenly stopped getting
nominations for best entertainer and female vocalist in 1996.
	   ``With Alan, last year was just a slow time,'' said Michael
McCall, who writes about country music for the Los Angeles Times
and The Nashville Scene.
	   ``He almost completely stopped touring. He was between albums
and didn't have any singles on the radio for a time. Everybody else
in the entertainer and male singer categories was active, except
for Vince Gill.''
	   Jackson also separated from his wife for a time, though they
have since reconciled and there is no indication the split
influenced voters. Gill, who also sat out much of the year and got
divorced, still got nominated for best entertainer and male
vocalist.
	   The difference is probably that Gill is much more visible around
Nashville. During his layoff, he performed at the Grand Ole Opry
nearly every weekend, and he's active in charities. He has always
been generous about supporting other performers by appearing on
their records, something that sits well with CMA voters with a
stake in those careers.
	   And the popular Gill is the longtime host of the CMA Awards _
1998 will make his seventh consecutive year.
	   ``Alan tends not to be as active and visible when he's taking
breaks,'' Foster said.

<TEXT>
	   MARINA DEL REY, California (AP) _ Barefoot and wearing a black
summer dress, Anne Heche resembles a pixie with her big blue eyes
and wispy blonde hair.
	   Speaking with an easy frankness, the actress reflects on a life
that seems much longer than her 29 years.
	   ``I'm proud of every single movie that has gotten me here, but I
am also proud of the journey that I have taken personally in order
to be who I am now,'' Heche says.
	   Her Hollywood career has blossomed with recent roles opposite
Robert De Niro in the political satire ``Wag the Dog'' and in the
adventure-romance ``Six Days Seven Nights'' with Harrison Ford. Her
latest movie is the drama ``Return to Paradise,'' with Vince
Vaughn.
	   Heche's success on the big screen seems idyllic, but getting
there has been tough.
	   She describes her childhood as ``evil'' and only recently
discovered solace _ something she attributes to finding joy in her
work, being honest and falling in love.
	   ``When I was 12, I was like an old woman. Now I'm getting
younger,'' says Heche, who left home at 17 and began therapy a year
later to cope with ``a lot of death, and a lot of abuse and
homelessness. ...
	   ``I went through eight years of trying to be at peace with who I
was and what had happened to me as a child.''
	   The actress jolted the entertainment industry last year when she
began a much-publicized relationship with actress-comedian Ellen
DeGeneres, whom she met at an Oscar party.
	   The relationship has been ``fodder for the last year, but at the
same time it seems to be getting back to being focused on what our
careers are and who we are as creative people,'' Heche says.
	   In the movie ``Return to Paradise,'' Heche plays a lawyer who
tries to save an American man imprisoned on drug charges in
Malaysia after a reckless vacation with two friends. She has to
persuade the men to return and admit that they are guilty, too, in
order to save her client's life through a plea bargain.
	   Heche says she chose the role because of its message of
responsibility and love.
	   ``My brother was killed when he was 18 and I was 13. I never got
to fight for his life,'' she says, recalling the fatal car
accident. ``This was a movie where I got to fight the fight that I
never got to.''
	   The film is a departure for Heche, who played a quirky scientist
opposite Tommy Lee Jones in ``Volcano,'' Johnny Depp's unhappy wife
in ``Donnie Brasco'' and the cynical press aide in ``Wag the Dog.''
She won National Board of Review awards for the latter two roles.
	   ``I fall in love with all my characters,'' Heche says. ``I never
want to forget that what I am playing is dress-up.''
	   She props her legs on a cushioned chair, her translucent skin
contrasting starkly with her maroon nail polish.
	   ``I am a very committed person, and I'm committed to the truth
of who I am,'' she says.
	   ``I've worked a long time in order to get there and have gone
through a lot of struggles of looking at my nightmares in order to
get to a place where I'm comfortable with myself _ enough to be
able to receive love for everything that I am.''
	   Unfortunately, she says, that love has not come from her family.
	   Heche was born in Aurora, Ohio, and moved around a lot.
	   Her family has barely spoken to her since she acknowledged being
gay. DeGeneres' mother has taken the place of Heche's mother and
two sisters.
	   ``They are very religious. Gay is a sin to them,'' she says.
	   Perhaps, Heche says, the resentment comes from learning that
their father, who had worked as a Baptist church choir director,
led a secret gay life. He died of AIDS when Heche was 13, the same
year her brother died.
	   To escape her dreary home life and to make some money, Heche
began acting in dinner theater in southern New Jersey. ``My home
became the theater when I was 12 and I couldn't wait to get there.
I loved it,'' she says. The job carried over into high school drama
in Chicago.
	   At 15, she declined an offer to go to New York to work on the
soap opera ``As the World Turns'' so she could stay in high school.
She graduated in 1987 and left the next day for the soap ``Another
World.'' The job earned her a Daytime Emmy in 1991.
	   ``That kind of started my life as an actress. It was just the
most comfortable I felt. It was the freedom of expression for me
that I needed,'' says Heche.
	   She came to Hollywood, and television work led to small
supporting roles in feature films.
	   In 1995, Heche was noticed in ``Pie in the Sky,'' a hit at film
festivals. Her stardom climbed with ``The Juror'' in 1996 and the
next year with ``Volcano.''
	   Heche dated comedian Steve Martin for two years before she met
DeGeneres, and not all her friends were comfortable with the
transition, she says.
	   ``It has been a weeding out ... since I fell in love with
Ellen,'' Heche says, her other friendships have been tested. ``A
lot of people stepped back if not an inch, a mile. It was a very
quick litmus test for everybody.
	   ``It makes the fearful ones run, and I kind of like that.''
	   She recently got a coveted role in director Gus Van Sant's
upcoming remake of ``Psycho.'' She has the part Janet Leigh played
in Alfred Hitchcock's original. She is also pursuing her own
directing and production projects.
	   ``I've been really blessed,'' she says. ``I may not be getting
the 20 scripts a week that somebody else gets, but I'm getting the
ones I want.''
	   Heche says her openness about being gay has created an
interesting persona.
	   ``Some people have the perspective that I'm so public, but I'm
public with my love because that was a need that I personally felt
I wanted to fill,'' Heche says. ``How funny that people think that
just because we hold hands, they know who we are.''

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Andres Galarraga hit a three-run homer for
the second straight game and John Smoltz won his sixth straight
decision as the Atlanta Braves beat the slumping Los Angeles
Dodgers 5-3 Saturday.
	   Galarraga connected off Chan Ho Park (10-7) in the first,
helping Atlanta improve to 5-0 this year against Los Angeles, which
lost for the eighth time in 11 games overall. Galarraga hit a
three-run homer in the fourth inning of the Braves' 5-2 win Friday
night.
	   Smoltz (11-2) won for the seventh time in eight decisions since
coming off the disabled list June 20, striking out eight in seven
innings. Kerry Ligtenberg pitched the ninth for his 20th save.
 &UR; Giants 4, Marlins 3
	   In San Francisco, J.T. Snow hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th
after the Giants rallied from a 3-1 deficit in the sixth against
Livan Hernandez.
	   Jose Mesa (4-2) pitched one inning as the Giants won their fifth
straight over the Marlins, who swept them in the first round of the
playoffs last year. Matt Mantei (3-3) walked Bill Mueller and Ellis
Burks opening the 10th.
 &UR; Reds 6, Expos 4
	   In Cincinnati, Jeffrey Hammonds had three hits and lined a ball
off the side of Mike Thurman's head, knocking the Montreal starter
out of the game.
	   Steve Parris (2-3) got his first victory since June 28, pitching
seven shutout innings before allowing Vladimir Guerrero's 29th
homer, a three-run drive in the eighth.
	   Montreal has lost its first five games on a nine-game road trip.
The Expos have only 16 road victories, the fewest in the major
leagues.
	   Thurman (2-1) went to a hospital for precautionary medical tests
after Hammonds lined a ball off his right temple to start the Reds'
second inning. A radar gun behind home plate clocked the liner at
108 mph.
	   The right-hander stood up, was examined by trainers and walked
off the mound without assistance. He had a welt on the right side
of his head as he was taken for a CAT scan, which came back normal.

Ravens 33, Jets 0

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Jermaine Lewis touched the
ball five times Saturday night. That was enough to produce 14
points and spark the Baltimore Ravens to a 33-0 rout of the New
York Jets in an exhibition game.
	   Lewis had a 97-yard runback of a punt and caught a 31-yard
touchdown pass for the Ravens (2-0). The Jets (1-1) lost for the
first time in six preseason games under coach Bill Parcells. It was
New York's worst exhibition loss since Sept. 4, 1976, a 41-6 romp
by Pittsburgh.
	   The Jets did get a good look at new running back Curtis Martin,
the high-priced free agent who missed the exhibition opener because
of a sore hamstring. He carried 12 times for 40 yards, all in the
first half.
 &UR; Redskins 27, Oilers 24 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Stephen Davis scored on a 1-yard run
with 2:38 left Washington beat Tennessee in the Oilers' first game
in Nashville.
	   Redskins quarterback was 13-for-22 for 145 yards, including five
straight competitions to set up Stephen Davis' 6-yard touchdown run
that tied it at 10 with 8:49 left in the second quarter.
	   Washington backup Trent Green was 9-for-12 for 95 yards.
	   The game drew a crowd of 31,429 at Vanderbilt Stadium, more than
the Oilers drew at seven regular-season games last year in Memphis.
	   Both teams are 1-1.
 &UR; Vikings 34, Chiefs 0 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Brad Johnson threw his first touchdown pass
since a neck injury ended his season last December and Minnesota
recorded consecutive exhibition shutouts for the first time ever.
	   After playing just three series in last weekend's 28-0 victory
over New England, Johnson threw 11 yards to Cris Carter for a 7-0
lead.
	   Randall Cunningham added two more TD passes in the quarter, a
49-yarder to Matthew Hatchette and a 5-yarder to first-round pick
Randy Moss, as the Vikings (2-0) built a 24-0 halftime lead.
	   The Vikings had six sacks and didn't allow Kansas City (2-1) to
cross midfield until less than 10 minutes remained in the game.
 &UR; 49ers 24, Seahawks 21 &QC; 
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia, John Becksvoort hit a 31-yard
field goal with two seconds left to push San Francisco past
Seattle.
	   Jim Druckenmiller, San Francisco's third quarterback of the
game, directed a six-play, 42-yard drive to set up the field goal
after Zack Bronson's intercepted John Friesz's pass.
	   The 49ers (2-1) took a 21-0 lead midway through the second
quarter, with Marquez Pope scoring on a 70-yard interception
return, and Steve Young and Ty Detmer throwing short touchdown
passes on consecutive possessions.
	   Seattle (2-1) tied it on Wade Richey's 33-yard field goal with
7:56 left.
