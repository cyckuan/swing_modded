<HEADLINE> UN Hails De Beers' Embargo on Angolan Diamonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Friday hailed
a decision made by South Africa's leading diamond company De Beers
of suspending purchase of diamonds from Angola, official source
said in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
But diamonds with government certificates which are to be
accepted in markets in London, Tel Aviv and New York are not
included in the embargo list issued by De Beers, the world's
largest diamond producer and merchant.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is of enormous symbolic importance," said Robert
Fowler, Chairman of the Commission of Sanctions against the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by
Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"The UN is seeking to reduce sources of UNITA's revenues,"
Fowler said, adding that the rebel organization has gained three
to four billion U.S. dollars from diamond business in the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council imposed an embargo on diamonds sold by
the UNITA last June, in a bid to prevent the rebel group from
buying more weapons for the long-term civil war.
</P>
<P>
De Beers announced Tuesday that it will suspend all purchasing
operations in Angola. including buying diamonds.
</P>
<P>
It expressed its conscience of responsibility and the will to
improve relations with the Angolan government, saying that it had
"never" bought diamonds from the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Accusing De Beers of buying diamonds from rebels, the Angolan
government threatened last December to forbid the South African
company to operate in the province of Lunda-norte in northeast
Angola, where De Beers has invested dozens of millions of dollars.

HARARE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Some members of the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) Central
Committee Friday said that they wanted stringent clauses
empowering the government to accelerate the land redistribution
process to be included in the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Information and publicity officer Nathan Shamuyarira told
reporters that the members attending the 38th session of the
ruling party's central committee had expressed concern over the
slow pace of the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
"The people felt that the legislation does not empower the
government to move fast in resettling people," the official said.
"They were also concerned with the farming season that is
approaching, fearing that people might not have time to prepare."
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira, who is also the minister of Industry and Commerce,
said that other issues discussed include the preparations for the
ruling party's national congress scheduled for December 15-17 in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, First Secretary of the ZANU-PF and President
Robert Mugabe encouraged all the people to participate in the
constitutional making process so that there would be no apathy
when the referendum would be carried out.

Mugabe said once the document was approved by Parliament, the
parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for next year
and the year 2002 respectively would proceed on the basis of the
new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president appointed the Constitutional Commission early
this year with the view of gathering views from the people to make
a new constitution to replace the British-authored Lancaster House
constitution said not to represent the views of the majority.

<HEADLINE> U.S., DPRK Agree to Resume Search for U.S. War Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have agreed to resume
search for remains of missing American servicemen involved in the
1950-53 Korea War, U.S. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United States also has acceded to the DPRK in ceremonies in
which the DPRK turns over remains of U.S. servicemen from the
Korea War.
</P>
<P>
As a result, remains of what are believed to be four U.S.
servicemen will be received in Pyongyang, the DPRK capital, by a
civilian Pentagon official in late October, instead of the
previous location in the Demilitarized Zone, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from both countries will meet in mid-October to
work out the details, and U.S. defense officials will go to
Pyongyang in late October to accept the remains of the four U.S.
servicemen, a Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Operations to recover U.S. remains from the DPRK began in 1996,
but were halted in June of this year in a dispute over the method
of repatriating the remains, which has now been solved as a result
of the U.S. accepting the DPRK's demand.
</P>
<P>
Beside the dispute over the location of repatriation ceremonies
for the U.S. remains, The United States had also insisted that the
United Nations Command be represented at the ceremonies
</P>
<P>
But Pyongyang had insisted that the deal should be handled
exclusively between the DPRK and the United States. And Washington
later had to back away from its demand on U.N. Command involvement
in repatriation.

The president, who is also the chancellor of Makerere
University, made the appeal Friday at the graduation ceremony of
the best university in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 students have graduated from Makerere University,
which has now tens of thousands of students, with some 10,000
students enrolled each year.
</P>
<P>
Museveni urged the students not to rely on getting jobs from
the public service which he said cannot be expanded easily to
accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
He advised the young students to find jobs in rural schools
which are experiencing manpower shortages.
</P>
<P>
The government will also try to create jobs for the university
graduates by sensitizing the rural population to abandon
subsistence agriculture for commercial agriculture and promote the
country's industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
Students were also encouraged to join the services sector.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that all efforts should be made to see that the
population benefits from agriculture and tourism in which the
country enjoys a natural advantage over other countries.
</P>
<P>
It is reportedly becoming more and more difficult for people
including university students to find suitable jobs.
</P>
<P>
With government ministries having been downsized and many
public enterprises privatized, university students have fewer
employment opportunities to grab.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soybean, Cotton Crops Seen to Drop Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The one-two punch of drought
and then Hurricane Floyd has taken its toll on the nation's
soybean and cotton crops, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department lowered its forecast of this year's cotton crop
by 6 percent from last month to 16.4 million bales, and reduced
its estimate for soybeans by 3 percent to 2.7 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina, which experienced severe flooding in Floyd's
wake, lost significant amounts of both soybeans and cotton in
addition to 30,000 acres of corn.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee also lost soybean production
because of the drought, and cotton crops are down in Missouri,
Tennessee and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
The drought started in the East and spread across portions of
the Midwest and down across much of the South. It actually turned
out to be a boon for some growers in the East.
</P>
<P>
The department said it expects soybean prices to be 20 cents a
bushel higher than previously thought this year, reaching an
average of five U.S. dollars a bushel, because of the decline in
production. The government is not allowed to estimate cotton
prices.
</P>
<P>
However, supplies of corn and wheat continue to grow, meaning
there is little hope for farmers that prices for those commodities
will rebound anytime soon. The Agriculture Department lowered its
price estimate for corn by 10 cents a bushel and 5 cents for
wheat.
</P>
<P>
Congress is expected to finish work next week on a
8.7-billion-dollar bailout of the farm economy, the second such
package in as many years, and additional aid is likely to be
necessary in 2000, said Byron Dorgan, a Democratic senator from
North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department increased its forecast of this
year's corn crop by 1 percent although the acreage that is being
harvested has been reduced because of the flooding in North
Carolina. Nationally, corn yields are slightly better than
previously expected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department said this year's orange crop will hit
12.1 million tons, up 22 percent from last year when a freeze
badly damaged California's production.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
reached an agreement in principle on defense technology exchange
and control here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement was announced by Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy after a meeting between Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S. will revise its defense trade
control regulations to permit the export to Canada of most defense
technology without a license.
</P>
<P>
On its part, Canada will strengthen its defense export controls
in light of the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR), according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also pledge to continue working on key details in
order to reach full agreement.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the two countries over the retransfers of
defense technology from North America has affected Canada's
5 billion dollar (about 3.4 billion U.S. dollar) defense industry
ever since the U.S. introduced the ITAR amendment on April 12.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tightened control on exports of defense technology and
equipment to Canada for fear of leaky security.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived here overnight for a day-long visit, is
now in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, attending a three-day forum of the
federations international conference, which has drawn in about 500
politicians and academics from 25 countries.
</P>

Earlier in the day, he dedicated the new 54 million dollar
(about 36.7 million U.S. dollar) U.S. embassy in Ottawa.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's police in
collaboration with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and
South African police have arrested a suspect responsible for the
bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam on August 7 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, a 25-year-old Tanzanian, was arrested
in South Africa Tuesday, according to a statement issued by
Director of Tanzanian Criminal Investigation Department Adadi
Rajabu in Dar es Salaam Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu said the South African government has issued a permit
whereby Mohamed will be sent to the United States for further
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigations conducted, he said, it was
established that Mohamed was one of the key figures who planned
the bombings of the twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenyan
capital Nairobi and in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam last year.
</P>
<P>
The director said Mohamed escaped to South Africa after the
incident by using a forged passport with number A.0207515, which
was issued in Dar es Salaam on May 4 last year in the name of
Zahran Nassoro Maulidi.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed obtained the passport after he presented forged
documents including a birth certificate which showed that it was
issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths in Zanzibar, Rajabu
said.
</P>
<P>
The senior police officer further said that four suspects for
the bombing case are still at large. They are Mustafa Mohammed
Fadhil, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam and
Sheikh Ahmed Swedan.
</P>
<P>
The bombing incident in Dar es Salaam killed 11 and injured 86
others. In Nairobi, more than 240 were killed and 5,000 others
were injured.
</P>
<P>
In Dar es Salaam, two suspects have been brought before the
Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court to answer charges. They are
Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Salehe

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not to Discuss Conditional Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government Friday
reiterated its rejection to conditional peace talks with Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides will not discuss with U.S.
Presidential Emissary Alfred Moses anything that directly or
indirectly satisfies the preconditions set by Turkish Cypriots'
leader Rauf Denktash, Cypriot government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said there was no agenda of the meeting between
President Clerides and Moses, who will visit Cyprus on October
19-21, after visiting Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
reunite the island through a bicommunal federation formula. But
the peace talks between the two sides have been stalled since
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Group-8, which comprises the U.S., France, German, Italy,
Britain, Canada, Japan and Russia, proposed in their June summit
the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan invite leaders of the two
communities to unconditional negotiations in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the prospect to bring the two sides back to negotiating
table remains gloomy as Denktash insists that he would not return
to talks unless his breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" is internationally recognized and the talks are on
state-to-state basis.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway republic was established in 1983 and recognized
only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
September 28, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit for the first
time accepted the proposal for Moses to visit the region to
further assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou pointed out that "the Greek Cypriot side has
already replied positively to the G-8 and international community
call for negotiations without preconditions" to achieve a
settlement to the Cyprus problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 8 (XInhua) -- At least three people were
killed and more than 18 others wounded when an unidentified man
threw a hand grenade into a crowded mosque in the northeastern
region of Puntland in Somalia Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses contacted on the VHF radio, the
attacker threw the hand grenade right to the front raw in the main
mosque in the town of Burtinleh.
</P>
<P>
One of the eyewitnesses said the killer, who wore a T-shirt
with a scarf round his face to conceal his identity, timed his
attack when all the worshippers were deeply engrossed into the
prayer and kneeling down.
</P>
<P>
"The blast shook even the walls of the mosque, and some of the
people even fainted in shock," said one of the survivors of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims died instantly inside the mosque while the
death of the third was announced in the hospital of Galkaio town,
the regional capital, where all the wounded were rushed for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Many of the wounded have suffered shrapnel injuries from the
attack, but according to the health workers in Galkaio town, most
of the wounds are not life threatening.
</P>
<P>
Senior members from the Puntland administration including
Interior Secretary Hassan Abshir Farah have rushed to Burtinleh
town.
</P>
<P>
There have been no clues as yet why the attack happened, but
people from the town believe that it has something to do with an
increasing religious sectarian within the community in the town.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the accident, the police forces of Puntland
announced a curfew. All movements including the business
activities have been ordered to shut down during the curfew
period.
</P>
<P>
However, no one has been arrested in connection with the attack
so far.

BEIRUT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Seven Wise Men, a Roman
mosaic that is flanked by four richly decorated Greek and Roman
tombs are greeting visitors. On either side of the entrance is a
cedar tree trunk and a huge Roman torso.
</P>
<P>
After a five-year restoration both of its exhibition space
and its archeological treasures, Lebanon's National Museum on
two floors reopens Friday, another step to heal the wounds of the
1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Here are more than 1,000 items ranging from the lavishly carved
Greek and Roman sarcophagi on the ground floor to the glittering
Phoenician jewelry on the new first floor.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, the ground floor of the museum was
temporarily opened to display only tombs and statues, but its
doors were closed again in July 1998 for more restoration work.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the objects on display were before the country's
1975-1990 civil war," said the museum director, archeologist Suzy
Hakimian. She added that new objects include, among others, a small
Roman female figure found in the excavations in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Pointing at a headless male torso found in the country's
southern coastal city of Sidon, she said it was stolen during the
war, but fortunately recovered at an auction in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The museum has come a long way since it first opened its doors
in the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Situated next to Beirut's former demarcation line, the museum
closed its doors shortly after the outbreak of the civil war in
1975.
</P>
<P>
Its treasures were saved from looting by Emir Maurice Chehab,
former director-general of antiquities, and his wife Olga Chaiban,
who bravely decided to move into the museum despite constant
shelling when the civil war started.
</P>
<P>
Whenever militia fighters attempted to enter the museum, the
well-connected Chehabs always managed to keep them out.
</P>
<P>
With the help of some loyal employees, the couple hid the most
valuable smaller objects, like coins, pottery and jewelry, behind
a double wall in the basement.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Israeli army occupied the museum, but they could
not find anything of value.
</P>
<P>
However, the building was heavily damaged in the civil war. The
re-excavation of objects, the refurbishment of the ceiling, the
cleaning and restoration of the museum's outer facade started in
1995 and was completed at the end of 1997 at a cost of 1.2 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The re-designing of the interior costs about 3 million
dollars. International experts were called in for the design of
showcases and lighting system.
</P>
<P>
Today, the gold and silver jewelry, the bronze weapons and
ivory figurines are back on display for the first time in 25
years, said Hakimian.
</P>
<P>
Starting with arrowheads and other items dating from the
prehistoric period, visitors can go on to view Phoenician pottery
found in the country's southern province of Bekaa, a gold dagger
from Byblos, the central coastal city, Greek bowls, and small
Roman statues.
</P>
<P>
The trip ends up with a collection of beautiful gold coins and
jewelry from the Islamic period.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome more people to visit the museum and can learn
something about Lebanon's long and splendid history," said
Hakimian.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Sues Eritrea for Illegally Seizing Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced Friday
that it has brought the first formal legal charges against Eritrea
for illegally detaining its goods at the ports of Assab and
Massawa.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Ministry of Transport and Communications said in
a statement that Ethiopia formally opened court file No.1, 1999,
and submitted it on September 25, 1999 to the newly established
court of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA).
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate comment from the Eritrean side on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that Eritrea has seized consignments of
139,500 tons of Ethiopian export and import items since the two
countries engaged in a border war in May of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The seized goods are valued at about 133 million U.S. dollars,
which is in addition to financial losses and other expenses
incurred by concerned exporting or importing organizations, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA earlier formed a high-level committee for the
verification of the legality of the appeal submitted by Ethiopia
and the objections raised by Eritrea concerning the matter.
</P>
<P>
The committee has visited both Addis Ababa and Asmara for
examination of the case early this year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's case is the first to be opened in COMESA's court
file since the court was established. The court began official
functions on September 20 this year.

<HEADLINE> Syria Condemns Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Syria has condemned Israel's
repeated air and land attacks on Lebanese civilian facilities.
</P>
<P>
The attacks raised questions over the intentions and
credibility of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who claimed to
be willing to achieve peace with Arab neighbors and withdraw its
troops from south Lebanon, Damascus Radio said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The practices dampened hopes for peace and raised suspicions in
the region and the world as well about Israel's credibility, it
added.
</P>
<P>
"The path chosen by Israel so far does not lead to peace
because Syria can never yield any inch of its land," the radio
said, pointing out that "peace must first of all be based on the
return to the border lines of June 4, 1967."
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying Syria's strategic plateau Golan Heights,
which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War. Peace
talks between the two sides have been stalled since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon also can not compromise on its sovereignty on its
southern territories, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
It highlighted the fact that peace with Lebanon and its power
broker Syria depended on full Israeli withdrawal to the
pre-occupation border lines.

<HEADLINE> Talks Held on U.S. Food Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian and U.S. officials held
talks here Friday on the provision of U.S. food aid to Russia, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side was represented by Deputy Prime Minister
Vladimir Shcherbak, who is in charge of agriculture, and the U.S.
side by Richard Fritz, director general of sales of the Department
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Russia has officially asked the United States for 5 million
tons of donated food in 1999-2000, including 1 million tons of
wheat for human consumption, 1.5 million tons of fodder grain, 1.5
million tons of corn, 500,000 tons of soybeans, 500,000 tons of
soy meal, 15,000 tons of seed corn and vegetable seeds, and
100,000 tons of soybean oil, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual amounts of various foodstuffs will have to
be worked out in the bilateral talks, Fritz said, noting that the
harvest in the United States was very good, especially for rice,
soybeans and corn.
</P>
<P>
Leonid Cheshinsky, a member of a mixed government group
monitoring foreign food deliveries, said late last month that
Russia's grain harvest would not be much bigger than last year's
47.8 million tons, the lowest in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Some estimated this year's harvest at 55 million tons, a far
cry from the country's annual demand of 75-77 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The shipment of the previous U.S. food aid package to Russia is
expected to be completed this month, Interfax said, quoting an
official with the committee for control over shipments and
distribution of foreign food aid.
</P>
<P>
Under agreements reached late last year, the United States will
provide 1.5 million tons of wheat, 30,000 tons of powdered milk,
100,000 tons of pork, all free of charge, and 500,000 tons of corn,
500,000 tons of soybean and cake, 200,000 tons of wheat, 100,000
tons of rice, 120,000 tons of beef, and 50,000 tons of poultry
under a 600 million U.S. dollar credit.
</P>
<P>
The total aid package is worth more than 1 billion dollars,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Cabinet Okays Draft State Budgets for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot cabinet has approved
draft state budgets on Ordinary, Development and the Relief Fund
for Displaced and Afflicted Persons for the year 2000, the Cyprus
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three budgets, unified for the first time, provide for
expenditure at 2.24 billion Cyprus pounds (4.48 billion U.S.
dollars) and revenues at 1.37 billion pounds (2.74 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is expected to reach 870 million pounds
(1.74 billion million dollars) in 2000, which represents 6.9
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), compared with 5.6 percent
of GDP in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The public debt will reach 67 percent of GDP in the year 2000
compared to 62 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Takis Clerides, the predicted
economic growth rate of 4.0-4.5 percent in real terms in 2000 is
"very satisfactory." The average growth rate of the European
Union member states is estimated at 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot economic growth in 1999 once more depended on tourism
and other service sub-sectors, an official statement said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism's contribution to the island's GDP reached 870 million
pounds (1,740 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' inflation in 2000 is expected to reach 1.7 percent from
the 1.5 percent this year and 2.2 percent in 1998, while the
unemployment rate will fall slightly to 3.4 percent in 2000 from
the 3.6 percent in the first seven months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot cabinet is expected to submit the draft state
budgets to the House of Representatives within the 10 days.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- There is an important
lesson to be learned in the Asian financial crisis, namely,
different remedies must be prescribed to different situations,
China said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate at the Economic and Financial
Committee of the 54th session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Shen Guofang said that, and that only, can prevent the
world from repeating mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the Asian financial crisis has also shed light on the
following three points:
</P>
<P>
-- The speed and level of opening up the capital account must
not go beyond the point where the financial system of a country
can no longer bear;
</P>
<P>
-- When policy measures on preventing and defusing
international financial crisis are being worked out, the burden of
responsibility should not be put on the shoulders of developing
countries alone. Developed countries and heavyweight private
investors should also be held accountable;
</P>
<P>
-- While domestic financial management is being strengthened
and improved, international financial management should likewise
be ameliorated to allow developing countries the right to full
participation.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the United Nations Conference on Financing for
Development will be held in 2001 and it will be a good opportunity
for countries to get together and discuss many important issues
such as financing resources, especially those for developing
countries and the international financial system.

<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua)-- A new helicopter developed
jointly by China, France and Singapore gave its first flight show
here today.
</P>
<P>
The five-seat "EC-120" is equipped with a single engine, with a
maximum flying range of 750 km and a service ceiling of 5180
meters, according to China National Aero-technical Import &AMP; Export
Corp (CATIC).
</P>
<P>
The EC-120 project is funded by CATIC, Harbin Aircraft Industry
Group Corp, Eurocopter and Singapore Technologies Aerospace.
Chinese investors own 24 percent shares.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese producer has now taken up 38 percent of the
workload in EC-120's manufacture and will be able to produce the
whole fuselage next year, said Yang Xueling, deputy director of
Helicopter Department under CATIC.
</P>
<P>
The EC-120, named "Colibri," features small size, flexibility,
high speed and low noise, and can fulfill various missions such as
transporting, traffic control, emergency dealing and law
enforcement, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The EC-120 has received more than 300 orders from 19 countries,
and about 30 helicopters have been delivered, Yang said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries
should act in accordance with the principle of free trade, open
their market and eliminate trade barriers against products from
developing countries, China said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate at the Economic and Financial
Committee of the 54th session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Shen Guofang said it is only after years of arduous
efforts that developing countries have developed some products
that are quite competitive.
</P>
<P>
And yet they have consistently suffered from all kinds of trade
protectionism in the developed countries, and the preferential
trade terms that they have been able to enjoy are also being
eroded, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
While protecting their own market, developed countries are,
under the pretext of trade liberalization, forcing developing
countries to open up market, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
When new trade rules are formulated, due consideration should
be given to the unique difficulties of developing countries and
trade liberalization should be realized in a gradual and orderly
manner in light of the specific national conditions of different
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that at present, quite a number of developing
countries are still being excluded from the World Trade
Organization and this fact has aroused wide concern in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Joining the organization is a major step for these countries to
be integrated into the world economy, and relevant negotiations
should be conducted on the basis of a balance between rights and
obligations, he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Reduce Bus Speed Limit to End Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will reduce
bus speed limit from 120 to 100 kilometers per hour and enforce
safety belt wearing on buses after several traffic tragedies in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Mike Mabasa, spokesman for Transport Minister Dullah Omar,
said that the minister had met with representatives from the bus
industry in Cape Town before the announcement of these new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said that more pressure will also be placed on companies to
keep vehicles road worthy by making more frequent testing
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
But the road safety organization Drive Alive criticized the
government for acting only when tourists died on roads.
</P>
<P>
Drive Alive spokesman Richard Benson said 75 people were
seriously injured or crippled on South African roads every day --
equivalent to a plane crash a day.
</P>
<P>
The South African Road Federation (SARF), representing a wide
range from engineers to road authorities, also criticized the
government for singling out one sector of road users for blame and
missing the wider picture.
</P>
<P>
Responding to these accusations, Mabasa said, "as government,
we remain confident that those measures will go a long way in
giving solutions to the carnage that we are currently seeing."
</P>
<P>
Nine bus accidents in the past 15 days have claimed 88 lives
and injured 268 people. In the latest bus accident on Thursday
night outside Bloemfontein city in the middle of the country, nine
people were killed and 20 injured when a long-haul truck smashed
into the back of a stationary passenger bus.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Omar called an emergency summit to improve safety in
the passenger service industry after a tour bus plunged down Long
Tom pass in Mpumalanga, killing 26 tourists and a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
Mabasa said the the Transport Ministry is in the process of
hosting workshops in all the provinces on the implementation plan
of the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC).
</P>
<P>
According to Mabasa, RTMC is an agency that is going to look at
how road traffic is managed in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the state of the nation's roads, Mabasa said the South
African roads network is generally in good condition, emphasizing
that the National Roads Agency is looking at the rehabilitation of
the roads and there are projects already under way.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Denies Knowledge of Firing Missile at Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday it has no
evidence that a missile said to have exploded in Azerbaijan a week
ago was fired from Russia, but offered to cooperate with Baku in
investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "possesses no information to confirm that the armed
forces of the Russian Federation are responsible" for the alleged
explosion, the Foreign Ministry said in a release.
</P>
<P>
But Russia is ready for a combined investigation, the Interfax
news agency quoted the release as saying.
</P>
<P>
The document said that Azerbaijan notified Russia that an 8K14
tactical surface-to-surface missile exploded near the village of
Gymyr in Azerbaijan's Zagataly district on October 1 and that it
had been fired from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry protested to Russia Wednesday,
saying "considerable damage was caused to buildings as a result of
this incident," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that "Russia's refusal to
acknowledge this incident gives rise to a negative attitude from
the Azerbaijani public."
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side must acknowledge the launch of a combat
missile, violation of Azerbaijan's air space and material damage,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"An appropriate Russian reaction to the incident, which was
caused by the actions of the Russian army, would show respect for
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan," the
statement said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) Friday appointed Mary Banotti, member of
the European Parliament, as its goodwill ambassador and Face to
Face Campaign spokesperson in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Banotti has been a member of the European Parliament for 15
years. She is one of the most respected politicians in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"I am supporting UNFPA and the Face to Face Campaign because I
believe that Ireland, along with all developed nations, carries a
significant responsibility to help improve the lives of future
generations. I will work to raise awareness of the urgent need for
increased funding for overseas development in reproductive and
sexual health care, education and awareness, and the immense
benefits investment in this area can bring," said Ms. Banotti.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Banotti will work closely with the Irish Family Planning
Association, the UNFPA's partner in Ireland for the Face to Face
Campaign.
</P>
<P>
Face to Face is an international campaign to publicize the
plight of millions of women and youths denied basic human rights
taken for granted in developed countries, especially access to
reproductive health care and family planning services.
</P>
<P>
The goal of Face to Face is to increase global awareness that
women's rights are human rights. It also aims to build support for
increased funding for services that will allow everyone everywhere
to exercise their reproductive rights.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, ANC Discuss Situation in Great Lake Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Rwanda's
ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) began talks with officials of
the African National Congress (ANC) on Friday to discuss ways of
bringing peace and stability to the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, attended by Foreign Minister Nkosazana
Zuma and ANC president Smuts Ngonyama, is one of many talks
planned by the ANC's executive subcommittee on international
affairs to further the development of the African continent and
the African Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing in Albert Luthuli house in central
 Johannesburg, RPF secretary general Charles Murigande said the
parties had found they had a lot in common and could draw on each
other's experiences.
</P>
<P>
Both parties had a history characterized by discrimination,
segregation and oppression, a strong commitment to national unity
and reconciliation, and a commitment to conflict prevention and
resolution in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the ANC's subcommittee on international affairs,
Mavivi Mayakayaka-Manzini, said South Africa shared its
experiences with Rwanda on the processes involved in drawing up a
new constitution.
</P>
<P>
A commission was recently put into place to start the
consultation process with the Rwandan people -- the first step in
drawing up a constitution, she said.
</P>
<P>
Murigande said Rwanda had already set up structures, with
functions similar to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in
villages to help people to talk about their experiences and to
identify culprits.
</P>
<P>
The small African state has been wracked by decades of ethnic
strife culminating in the 1994 genocide. The April-July genocide
claimed up to more than half million lives, mostly of ethnic
minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
"We debated establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
but so far we have not yet agreed to take the exact path taken in
South Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the process was aimed at stabilizing the country.
</P>
<P>
With regard to peace in the region, Muriganda said Rwanda was
committed to the Lusaka cease-fire agreement signed on July 10 by
DRC president Laurent Kabila and five other countries which
pledged to halt fighting that has continued since August, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully satisfied with the Lusaka agreement and the
agreement by the parties involved in the DRC to disarm and
repatriate forces. If that is done there is no reason to have
troops in the Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important for the new political dispensation to
respect the interests of the Congolese people and its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have backed different rebel factions seeking
to topple Kabila, which has also led to tension between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Murigande said he would be willing to attend any meeting
organized by DRC rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba if it helped
to end conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba in a surprise visit to the Southern African
Development Dialogue (SAID) in Zimbabwe earlier this week said the
peace process in the DRC was moving too slowly.
</P>
<P>
He blamed a lack of United Nations peacekeepers, leading to
pockets of ceasefire violations, and the sluggish pace of the
Joint Military Commission in charge of implementing the Lusaka
accord.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expresses Concern over Nyerere Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Zuma on Friday said she was saddened to hear
Tanzania's former president Julius Nyerere had suffered a set back
in his health.
</P>
<P>
"He and his country gave all they had to the liberation
struggle," Zuma told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was of special significance to South Africa and his
efforts in fighting apartheid "made him part and parcel of our own
liberation struggle" , she said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, suffering from leukaemia, was admitted to London's St
Thomas Hospital last month.
</P>
<P>
Until his illness, Nyerere was mediating talks over peace in
Burundi which was being held in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The last round of talks, which ended without progress one week
ago, had been postponed when Nyerere fell ill, but were
rescheduled without him after an upsurge in violence in Burundi
threatened to derail the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who was president from 1961 to 1985 when he retired,
has been credited with spearheading Tanzania's emergence into a
democratic state.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was also instrumental in helping struggling
independence movements in neighboring Mozambique, Angola and
Namibia as well as efforts to end minority rule in Zimbabwe.

ISLAMABAD -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia Friday dismissed
Pakistan's charge of the presence of terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan and reiterated that they would not allow terrorism in
its territory.
</P>
<P>
"No one has been given training in Afghanistan to carry out
terrorism activities in Pakistan," Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed
was quoted as saying by reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Thursday said there were
solid evidences of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and
people trained there were involved in the recent sectarian
terrorism in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he had sent a delegation led by a senior
intelligence official to Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters, to
urge the Islamic militia to eradicate the camps. (Pakistan-

LONDON -- The first official report on Britain's worst train
crash in recent 40 years has blamed the rail disaster on one of
the trains passing a red light signal.
</P>
<P>
The signaling equipment was unlikely at fault when the two
crowded commuter trains collided outside London's Paddington
Station Tuesday morning, the government-run Health and Safety
Executive's (HSE) said in its interim report on the accident
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the immediate cause of the accident,
thought to have claimed more than 100 lives, appears to be that
one of the trains passed a signal on red some 700 meters before
the collision point.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons why the train passed the red light are likely to
be complex," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Inspector of Railways Vic Coleman, who headed the report
team, said evidence suggests that the accident "would have been
prevented by the installation and correct operation of a Train
Protection Warning System." (UK-Train Crash-Cause)

UNITED NATIONS -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called
on the government and rebel forces involved in the conflict in

</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman, Annan said that he
"calls on all parties involved in the conflict, both government
and rebel forces, to end all attacks on the civilian population
and to abide by international humanitarian law and principles."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was "extremely concerned by the massive forced
displacement of the population" around Bujumbura, the capital of
the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. system in Burundi and its humanitarian partners are
making every effort to provide urgent life-saving assistance to
the most vulnerable among the displaced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in the statement, also "calls upon the government and
all other parties whose actions have given rise to this situation
to end the armed conflict and take all measure that those affected
can return to their homes as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The Burundi army has forcibly resettled nearly 260,000

negotiations would suffer."
</P>
<P>
"Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the
pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to
ratify it," the article said.

The leaders also said that rejection of the treaty would also

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sanctions Committee Lauds Policy Shift on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of a U.N.
Security Council Committee Friday hailed the recent announcement
by De Beer, the world's largest diamond marketer, of its decision
to refrain from buying diamond from Angola in a bid to join the
U.N. efforts to cut off UNITA's funding resources to wage war.
</P>
<P>
The committee overseeing sanctions against the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is chaired by
Robert Fowler, the Canadian permanent representative to the
United Nations, who told reporters that the news from the world's
dominant diamond company was an "enormously symbolic" message in
the U.N. efforts to enforce sanctions against the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The decision by De Beers would put a "major crimp" in the
purchase of diamonds from UNITA, which has been selling them to
finance its war-waging operations.
</P>
<P>
Fowler said that he was certain that the message sent by De
Beers, which controls an estimated 65 to 75 percent of the world
diamond trade, would be heard by other companies and the world
diamond market.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I hope UNITA gets the message too," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the U.N. applied sanctions prohibiting the sale or
supply of arms, petroleum or funds to UNITA. The embargo also
makes it illegal to purchase diamonds from the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the United Nations has had difficulties enforcing
the embargo. In August this year, the Security Council named two
expert panels to help it investigate how the sanctions are being
violated.
</P>
<P>
Fowler has paid visits to Central and Southern Africa and
Europe to increase awareness of, and compliance with, the
sanctions regime.
</P>
<P>
Under Canada's leadership, the Sanctions Committee has also
established two expert panels at the U.N. to collect information
on the sources and methods of violations of sanctions regimes, and
to recommend measures both to end those violations and to improve
the implementation of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
De Beers said Tuesday that it will stop buying diamonds
originating from Angola, except for those it has already
contracted to purchase.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian former president
Julius Nyerere's condition deteriorated from Thursday with most
vital parts of his body failing to work properly, an official
statement said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors attending the 77-year-old African statesman who is
under round- the-clock medical treatment at the Intensive Care
Unit in the St. Thomas' Hospital in London said his kidney does
not function well with jaundice complications making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who was admitted to the hospital two weeks ago, is
also running a fever, according to a bulletin released by the
State House.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by press secretary to Tanzanian
President, said that medical specialists are trying their best to
save his life.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, physicians attending Nyerere, revered as the founding
father of Tanzania, said there is a heartening improvement of his
health but soon the situation reversed.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks since 1996.

Construction work on the park started today and local analysts
expect the new park to make the canyon area more attractive to

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A peaceful and stable
international environment is the prerequisite for global social
development, China said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th session of the General Assembly on social
development, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Shen Guofang said that in recent years, wars, military
interventions and armed conflicts have plagued some countries and
regions, and the social development achievements accumulated by
the local people over the years have been severely damaged, people
lost their homes and there was a large number of refugees in many
places.
</P>
<P>
This has not only hindered the social development of these
countries and regions, but also produced negative impact on global
social development, and the maintenance of world peace and
stability is the fundamental guarantee of global social
development, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Steady growth of the world economy is the important basis for
global social development, and economic growth is the prerequisite
and basis for social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
All members of the international community must join hands in
promoting a steady growth of world economy in a responsible and
risk-sharing spirit, so as to bring about common prosperity of the
entire world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that poverty eradication should be the central task
for global social development. He called upon developed countries
to honor their duties and obligations and offer technological and
financial assistance to developing countries so as to help them
make substantive progress in poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen international cooperation and promote common
development is the essential condition for global social
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governments of various countries are primarily responsible
for their countries' social development, but globalization is
making the world economy an inter-related and indivisible whole,
and he called for even closer international cooperation.

clear timetable for implementation of this goal;
</P>
<P>

more effective coordinating role in the international cooperation
on social development.
</P>

</P>
<P>
China today expressed strong displeasure with the United States
allowing the defense bill for fiscal year 2000, which contains
many anti-China articles, being made into law.

In response to a question requesting comment on U.S. President
Bill Clinton signing recently the defense bill into law, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said China clearly stated
its position by making solemn representations to the United States
soon after the U.S. Congress passed the bill.
</P>
<P>
Now that the United States has made the bill into law, China is
highly displeased with and is firmly opposed to this, Zhang said.

<P>
DHAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed
and more than 15 others injured seriously Friday afternoon when a
bomb exploded in a mosque in southwestern Bangladesh's Khulna
city, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Police said the powerful bomb, apparently planted near the
podium of the mosque, went off when the iman was delivering
prayers in the Nirala Housing Estate Kadiani Mosque in the city.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
The tin-shed mosque was badly damaged as the blast demolished
one side of the brick wall and damaged its tin roof.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the death toll could go up as several people
were critically injured.
</P>
<P>
The BSS quoted unconfirmed sources as saying one person was
arrested for questioning after the incident, but the police
commissioner of Khulna refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
The motive behind the bombing could not be immediately known,
and a probe has been ordered.

<P>
Army experts have been called in to ascertain the nature of the
explosives and the mosque has been cordoned off by police.

<HEADLINE> Computer Expert on Advancing China's Software Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese computer expert says
China's software industry should be advanced with innovative
concepts and a creative management system.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiren, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and also deputy
president of Northeast University, made the remark at a forum on
information technology of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The forum is part of the week-long China High-Tech Fair in
Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu is believed to be the first person in China to receive a
doctorate in applied computer science. He also heads the software
research center at Northeast University.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Liu has kept up with the latest computer
software technology development trends and has done extensive
research on subjects such as computer network technology and input
software technology.
</P>
<P>
"China has not developed a penetrating software industry,
though it boasts a vast software market and the universally-
recognized fine software development resources," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, China's software industry is still in the
early stage of development, although the country now has 5,000
software companies.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the success of the software industry will
play an important strategic role in future competition with
foreign forms, and will help step up comprehensive national power
and national security.
</P>
<P>
He said a system should be in place in which knowledge is
distributed throughout enterprises just as capital, and in which
compatible financial and legal mechanisms are operating which are
conducive to development of software companies. In addition, he
said, facilities and work environments should be provided.
</P>
<P>
The China High-Tech Fair is jointly sponsored by the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Ministry of Science and
Technology, Ministry of Information Industry, Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the Shenzhen municipal government. It will close on
October 10.

<HEADLINE> China Calls For Establishing New World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Globalization should
bring prosperity to all and to achieve this goal requires global
cooperation and global responsibility as well as the establishment
of a new world order, China stressed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate at the Economic and Financial
Committee of the 54th session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative Shen Guofang
said globalization has created enormous economic wealth, but has
also widened the gap between the rich and the poor and exacerbated
world inequality.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think that the kind of globalization that makes only
a small number of people rich while impoverishing the others will
last for long, and globalization should bring prosperity to all,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only the hope for the new century cherished by the
majority of mankind but also the key to healthy global economic
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though an important component of the world economy, developing
countries have been constrained by their level of development and
face unfair terms of international competition, and they find
themselves in a disadvantageous position in the global economy and
are unable to fully participate in and benefit from the
globalization process, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there will be no global prosperity without
growth and development of developing countries that are home to 90
percent of the world population," he said.
</P>
<P>
A new international economic order that is fair and reasonable
is the guarantee for world prosperity in the coming century, and
developing countries should be involved on an equal footing in the
establishment of the new order, Shen added.

<P>
ABUJA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria instructed its 90 missions
abroad on Friday to issue visas to applicants of foreign investors
within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the Nigerian capital with heads of diplomatic
missions on Friday, Foreign minister, Alhaji Sule Lamido said the
new policy is a part of the new government to generate increased
foreign exchange inflows and revive the battered economy.
</P>
<P>
Philip Asiodu, the Chief Presidential Economic Adviser recently
said the country needed an infusion of some 10 billion dollars
annually for the next five years to revive the country economy
after 15 years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the first by the minister since his
appointment in June this year, the minister lashed out at some
missions which subject Nigerians requiring visas to "indignities"
after collecting "huge non- refundable" fees.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also pledged that Nigeria would not
abandon its peacekeeping role in Africa and the sub-region, where
its forces had provided the bulk of two peacekeeping efforts in
neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Public Health Activities Likely to Stop Because </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Operations of the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Timor will come to a standstill if no new
money is found, the United Nations agency warned here Friday.
</P>
<P>
That would mean an effective end to public health coordination
in East Timor, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the money already mobilized by WHO and donated by
the Italian government, we have field personnel in both East and
West Timor supporting the health authorities in East Timor,
offering technical guidance to other U.N. agencies and
non-governmental organizations in the field, and setting up a
communicable disease surveillance system," said Dr Xavier Leus,
director of emergency and humanitarian action and WHO headquarters
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"But the Italian donation has run out and if we do not get
additional funds we will have to scale down and eventually cease
our operations there," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On September 22, WHO put forward its estimated funding needs of
9 million U.S. dollars to continue its operations. So far it has
not received any donation, or even pledge.
</P>
<P>
While the U.N. consolidated appeal, of which WHO's request for
the 9 million dollars is a part, is due to be launched later in
October, WHO is in needs fo funds now, Leus said.
</P>
<P>
"We at WHO have limited flexibility to take money away from
other priority health areas so we have to raise the money we need
for an emergency such as this one from extraordinary sources," he
said.
</P>
<P>
WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland affirmed that
humanitarian aid and reconstruction without the public health
component will be partial and will fail to address the needs of
people and communities.
</P>
<P>
"WHO is ready to play its role in Timor," she said. "The
challenge now is to get support from donors."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Form Anti-AIDS Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) --The South African government
will set up an anti-aids council to coordinate all AIDS-related
activities in the country, Minister of Health, Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference in Johannesburg that the council
would help co-ordinate AIDS- related activities at national,
provincial and community levels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Deputy President Jacob Zuma said in a
televised state of the nation address that the country will
intensify its fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"That co-ordination will ensure that no corner is left without
activity against aids...and to ensure that the resources reach
down to community level," Manto said.
</P>
<P>
The government would convene a meeting with pharmaceutical
companies to persuade them to bring down the cost of aids
treatment, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that in the near future they will commit themselves
(to cheapening the cost of medicine) because they can see the
burden Africa has to bear over the AIDS issue. Government would
also meet insurance companies and financial institutions to
convince them to consider adopting policies to benefit AIDS
victims, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, members of various sectors of the community pledged to
make AIDS a priority issue within trade unions and in the sports,
entertainment and business industries.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urges Palestinians to Understand Prisoner's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side should
have a clear understanding about the issue on Palestinian
prisoners' release and cooperate with Israel to seek their
freedom, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks after meeting with visiting French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, who arrived here Wednesday evening
for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He said Chairman Yasser Arafat knows in detail about the
Palestinian prisoners kept in Israeli jails and he can understand
why Israel has selected a list of Palestinian prisoners who
committed terror acts since the signing of the first Oslo Accord
in 1993, which kicked off the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced Thursday to postpone the second release of 151
Palestinian prisoners as scheduled for Friday due to the "refusal"
of the Palestinian side to accept the list presented to them by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement signed one month
ago, Israel is obligated to release 150 Palestinian prisoners
Friday in the second batch of a total of 350 prisoners to be
freed. Israel released the first group of 199 prisoners on
September 9.
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute centered on Israel's inclusion of some
prisoners whose sentence terms would be finished in a few
months. The Palestinians demand that those to be release should
have at least five years of sentence term left.
</P>
<P>
The dispute emerged though the Israeli security cabinet agreed
Wednesday to relax the criteria for the release, approving the
inclusion of 12 prisoners who are members of the Islamic militant
groups Hamas and Jihad but did not kill Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said earlier that it would not set free those who
had killed Israelis or belong to Hamas and Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams from both sides met Thursday evening in a
last-ditch effort to resolve the dispute, but failed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said the Israelis "disrespect" the
categories agreed upon in the lastest peace deal, and it can not
accept the criteria that denied freedom to over 40 Palestinian
longer-serving prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that it is very difficult for his government to
release the Palestinians who "have Israeli blood on their hands,"
so it has to change the criteria.
</P>
<P>
All the 151 selected prisoners were not "terrorists with blood
on their hands." In other words, they had not killed or badly
wounded Jews.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli High Court of Justice rejected Friday a petition
filed by a group of Israelis whose family members were killed
during the terrorist attacks. The petition requested the Court to
oppose the government's decision to release the second group of
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Release of Palestinian prisoners is a political issue and it is
not proper for the Court to intervene, the High Court said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the talks, Barak said he discussed with Vedrine the
peace process with Syria, urging again the Syrian side to restart
talks with Israel to solve the Golan Heights problem and Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Barak, Vedrine went to a French hospital
in East Jerusalem and met with Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian
minister of Jerusalem Affairs whose office is in the Orient House
in East Jerusalem, and other Palestinian officials there.

<HEADLINE> Chile Divided in Happyness And Anger over Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chile is divided by happyness
and anger on Friday after receiving the information that the
former leader Angusto Pinochet should be extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
There is an atmosphere of happiness and satisfaction Friday at
the headquarters of the Association of Relatives of Detained and
Disappeared People after the announcement of the decision of
British justice that authorized the extradition of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
There were at the place some 60 persons, among them Communist
presidential candidate Gladys Marin, and the president of the
association, Viviana Diaz, who announced that she will organize a
march from the association office to the center of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Association members, most of them the mothers of those
disappeared, held an impromptu meeting in the main yard of the
building, where they read poetry and narrated some personal
anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
Viviana Diaz said that British Judge Ronald Bartle's decision
"sets a precedent for humanity, and the fact that Pinochet will be
extradited to Spain gives us hope that we will find our loved
ones."
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidate Gladys Marin called the British judge
decision a victory for the country and for international law.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great victory for the great majority of Chileans who
have hoped for years to find the truth and justice, as well as for
all the political forces in the world who wanted to take General
Pinochet to justice," she said.
</P>
<P>
But Pinochet's backers said the London court's decision to
extradite the 83-year-old general was a result of foreign
pressure. Lofting pictures of Pinochet and burning British and
Spanish flags, they called on Chile to push for his swift release
on medical grounds.
</P>
<P>
Retired general and executive director of the Pinochet
Foundation Luis Cortes described the ruling as "the worst scenario
we could have expected", saying that people will not see the
general on his knees.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Publishes Revised "Terrorist Organizations" List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Friday made public a revised list of "foreign terrorist
organizations", which added an organization allegedly headed by
Osama bin Laden and dropped several other groups including a
Palestinian organization.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright formally added Al-Qaida
group of Saudi-born millionaire Osama bin Laden, which the State
Department said is responsible for several major terrorist
attacks, including the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in
kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) was
dropped from the list because the State Department apparently
recognized the group's willingness to take part in peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The group's leader Nayef Hawatmeh has shifted his attitude
towards Palestinian president Yasser Arafat and the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. And he startled many Palestinians
by shaking hands with Israeli President Ezer Weiaman at the
funeral of the late King Hussein of Jordan in February and he
indicated this month that he would do so again if the two met in
the future.
</P>
<P>
The Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front Dissidents of Chile and
the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia were also removed from the list.
</P>
<P>
The list, compiled by the State Department, now has 28
organizations, including seven Islamist groups, six Palestinian
groups, four Latin American groups, and two Jewish, two Greek,
two Japanese and two Turkish-based groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Chamber of Commerce
vice president Mario Agliati said Friday that Chilean businessmen
hope that the decision to extradite Augusto Pinochet would not
affect Chile's relations with Spain and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He said that big efforts should be made to keep apart trade
with those countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the future development of Chile depends on the
growth of its commerce abroad and foreign firms that do not have
any responsibility for what is happening in England should not be
blamed.

Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said here Friday that
his government has granted the consortium a cut in corporation
tax, but Mocumbi did not give the percentage of this reduction.
</P>
<P>
Explaining this decision, Mocumbi said that it would normally
be the government's responsibility to rehouse or otherwise
compensate people whose homes and property are expropriated to
make way for the road.
</P>
<P>
In this case, it had been agreed that the consortium would
handle compensation and resettlement in exchange for enhanced

The consortium is building the toll road from Mozambican
capital Maputo to the South African town of Witbank.

<HEADLINE> Chile Criticizes Spanish Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government rejected
Friday the notion that Spanish justice should judge former
military ruler Augusto Pinochet, saying it will take the case to
the International Court of The Hague.
</P>
<P>
"The Chilean government has said many times that this case puts
on the table the defense of principles and not of persons, said
Chilean Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Valdes said that the government of his country rejects "the
unilateral pretension of the Spanish courts to judge facts
occurred in Chile, whose victims are Chilean and in which the
alleged responsible is also a Chilean."
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government is convinced that its interpretation of
international law is correct and that "this will be confirmed by
the International Court of Justice of The Hague in answer to the
demand that Chile will present in a brief time against Spain," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Chilean society acknowledges that the serious violations to
human rights occurred in our past must not go unpunished. The
Chilean courts are examining numerous cases for those violations
that have resulted in many instances in condemning sentences,"
said Valdes in a communique.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody must ignore the right that belongs to our courts to
judge those who are accused of crimes committed in the national
territory, being this a country where the rule of law reigns and
in which there is no negation of justice," added the communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique says that "the government will continue
defending the jurisdiction of the Chilean courts with all the
political and juridical means within its reach."
</P>
<P>
The communique says that "the government will persevere in its
effort before the British government to hear the humanitarian
reasons and permit Pinochet to return to Chile."

<HEADLINE> Germany Loans Ghana $21.9 Million for Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany has agreed to offer
Ghana a loan of 40 million German marks (21.9 million U.S.
dollars) for road construction, the Ghana News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by the two governments here
Friday, the money will be used in the rehabilitation of
Tema-Sogakope-Aflao road, west of Ghanaian capital Accra, and the
improvement of district capitals.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Accra, Christian Nakonz, said Friday that
the agreement is in line with the German development loan
cooperation with Ghana to facilitate its socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The agreement includes a non-repayable grant of 15 million
German marks to finance rural water supply and the rehabilitation
of water supply systems in the Eastern and Volta regions.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Minister of Finance Richard Kwame Peprah said that the
166- kilometer Tema-Sogakope-Aflao road forms an integral part of
the trans-west African highway network and its rehabilitation
would enhance the economic integration of Ghana with neighboring
countries.

<HEADLINE> No Crisis Between Palestinians and Israel: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- There was no standoff between the
Palestinians and Israel over the implementation of the signed
deals, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks in Ramallah during a meeting with
visiting French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, who also toured
Palestinian refugee camp and Christian sites in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian and Israeli sides ran into their latest dispute
Thursday when they failed to reach a consensus over the list of
the second batch of Palestinian political prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
The dispute led to the cancellation of the release of the 150
Palestinian prisoners on Friday as stipulated in the latest peace
deal, or the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, signed early September.
The first 200 Palestinian prisoners were freed on schedule on
September 9.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Palestinians always call for French help in
seeking release of the Palestinians "from the Israeli jails."
</P>
<P>
Asked why the final status talks have not started, Arafat said
"the Israeli side is supposed to be forming its team; but that
team has not been established while we are ready for the talks."
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched a ceremonial start of the final status
talks on September 13, which will deal with the thorny issues such
as fate of Jerusalem, final borders, refugees and the future of
the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum, a permanent peace deal between the
two sides should be concluded by September 20, 2000.
</P>
<P>
A joint Palestinian negotiation team has been formed with
Minister of Culture and Information Yasser Abed Rabbo as its head,
but the Israeli team has not come into being.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Registers As Candidate for Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 8 (Xinhua) - Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano on Friday registered with the Supreme Court as the
candidate of the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party
(Frelimo) for the presidential election scheduled for December
3-4.
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidates must be registered voters aged over 35,
who have never been sentenced to jail terms for any serious
offense.
</P>
<P>
Each candidate must also be proposed by at least 10,000 other
voters: the signatures of each one of these proposers must be
recognized by a notary.
</P>
<P>
Having presented 30,000 signatures nominating him, President
Joaquim Chissano is the first candidate to submit his nomination
papers.
</P>
<P>
His main rival, Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the former rebel
movement Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo), has also
submitted his papers to the court on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Dhlakama, Chissano said he had no fear of any other
 candidate, saying that he respected Dhlakama, just as he would
respect anyone else who might enter the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
As most of the minor opposition parties have already announced
their intention to support Dhlakama, it is quite possible that
Chissano and Dhlakama will be the only names on the presidential
ballot paper.
</P>
<P>
Saturday is the deadline for candidates submitting their
nominations.
</P>
<P>
Chissano became president of Mozambique in 1986, following the
death of the country's first president, Samora Machel, in a plane
crash at Mbuzini, just inside South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the first multi-party election in October 1994, Chissano had
little difficulty defeating 11 other candidates, and took 53.3
percent of the valid votes cast.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Refutes U.S. Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Othman Ismail condemned the U.S. accusations against his
country as "sheer lies" and part of "the U.S. arrogance," the
Sudanese News Agency (SNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses Sudan of violating the freedom of
religion.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. ambassador who issued the accusation in a recent
report after being nominated coordinator of religious affairs in
the U.S. State Department had not been in Sudan or seen any
Sudanese official so far," Ismail told the SNA.
</P>
<P>
"All the information in the report were gathered from the
anti-Sudan activists," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move targets Islam and the will of Muslims worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Though Islam is the religion number two in the United States
itself after Christianity, there is no Muslim person neither in
the U.S. administration nor the executive departments nor the two
chambers of the Congress," he said, citing U.S. official figures.
</P>
<P>
"Although the United States accuses Sudan of violating the
freedom of religion, both Sudanese Vice-President and Deputy
Speaker of Parliament are Christians. In addition, there is a
number of Christian ministers including the first female minister
in the Sudanese federal government," Ismail noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that there are scores of Christian parliamentarians
and ambassadors such as Sudan's ambassadors to Germany, Italy,
Norway, Greece and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. accusation of religious right violation against Sudan
is groundless as the United States is the greatest violator of
religious freedom," Ismail pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States had respected the views of many countries
and world organizations, it would have accepted to form a
fact-finding committee after its air attacks on the Shefaa
Pharmaceutical Plant in Khartoum," the Sudanese minister
concluded.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Debt Situation of Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Total external debt of
developing countries and countries in transition at the end of
1998 was estimated at nearly 2.5 trillion U.S. dollars, an
increase of 6 percent over the 1997 level of 2.3 trillion, a U.N.
report said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Recent Developments in the Debt Situation
of Developing countries" by the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
said short-term debt was reduced, and represented less than 17
percent of the total as compared with 20 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a reduction in exports and a slowing down of
gross domestic product(GDP) growth, there has been an important
increase in the ratios of debt to exports and debt to GDP,
although overall, with debt to exports equivalent to 146 percent
and debt to GDP to 37 percent, these indicators did not signal
major problems, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Measures taken in the wake of the Asian crisis have
contributed to reduce the reliance on short-term debt, which in
1998 took about 59 percent of the stock of foreign exchange
reserves compared with 71 percent in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the amount of total paid debt service
remained almost unchanged, while arrears on interest and
principal payments increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
Paid debt service in proportion of total scheduled debt
service stood at about 71 percent, and the distribution of debt
among the different developing and transition country regions
has not changed in a significant way, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the general trends do not reveal the situation of
particular groups of countries, which remains a source of
serious concern for the international community.

LUANDA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A well-organized knowledge
contest "Meet in China in 2000" ended in Angola Friday, with
Matundu Vita as the final winner from more than one thousand
competitors.
</P>
<P>
"I have a dream of having a look at China, for I am studying

ceremony attended by Angolan Minister of Social Communication
Pedro Hendrik Neto and Chinese Ambassador to Luanda Jiang Yuande.

"I fell in love with the Chinese culture when I first contacted
it 15 years ago when I met a Chinese journalist and learned a lot
from him," Vita said, adding that at this moment the great success
in economic construction made by China is also an attraction for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Among the winners are Carvalho brothers, who have been
listening to the program on the National Radio of Angola and both
of them got the second prizes for the contest of the Chinese
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
According to a Chinese official responsible for the contest,
the Chinese Embassy in Angola began preparations for the contest
in early June and the National Radio of Angola on July 15 started
broadcasting the program about the Chinese knowledge.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Decides to Ratify Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of
Bangladesh has decided to support ratification of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Azad told a news conference with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright that the decision was made by Bangladesh
Prime Minister Sheikhh Hasina because "she firmly believes in a
world free from hunger, nuclear weapons and threats."
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as the U.S. Senate began debate on the
treaty, which President Bill Clinton signed in 1996 along with
representatives of 153 other nations. But the treaty's fate in
the U.S. Congress was not at all certain and Clinton asked the
Senate on Friday to delay a vote rather than have it go down to
defeat.
</P>
<P>
Azad said Bangladesh was worried rejection of the treaty by
the U.S. Senate would have "a negative impact in the world."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Sheikhh Hasina's decision might be a
small boost for the U.S. administration, fighting to muster a
two-third majority for ratification of the treaty in the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
The administration argued that failure to ratify would
undermine its efforts to persuade Pakistan and India, which
neighbor Bangladesh, to renounce nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
Albright welcomed the Bangladesh announcement, which could
soon bring to 27 the number of "nuclear-capable" countries that
have ratified the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"I want to congratulate Bangladesh for its vision and
leadership, on becoming the first country in South Asia to
decide to ratify this landmark agreement," Albright said. "This
action by Bangladesh reflects the depth of support for the test
ban treaty that exists around the world."

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Nosedive amid Doubt over OPEC Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil's downturn accelerated
on Friday as speculators rushed to sell amid doubts about OPEC's
resolve to maintain strict adherence to its supply limits.
</P>
<P>
In a fifth straight day of losses, benchmark Brent crude for
November last traded 1.38 U.S. dollars a barrel lower at 20.70
U.S.dollars, a six percent loss, after touching a low of $20.20.
Thus far, crude oil has slumped 3.60 U.S.dollars a barrel, or 15
percent, since hitting a 33-month high last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Losses quickened this week after a survey indicated that the
oil cartel OPEC's compliance with output curbs, which have more
than doubled prices in eight months, had slackened in September.
</P>
<P>
The survey sparked a surge of profit-taking from the
speculative investment funds which fuelled oil's rise from less
than 10 U.S.dollars in February.
</P>
<P>
"The funds are baling out fast and I don't see an immediate end
yet," Reuters quoted Nauman Barakat at brokers ABN Amro in New
York as saying. "If OPEC has shown a small amount of leakage then
the speculators are going to worry that it's going to get even
worse in October and November," added a London trader.
</P>
<P>
Some argue that the sell-off was inevitable and will have taken
some of the speculative steam out of the market, taking prices to
a more realistic level, but a bout of cold weather in the looming
northern hemisphere winter could still spike oil back above 25
U.S.dollars, a Reuters analysis said.
</P>
<P>
"Today the oil market bulls are treading on egg shells but
they'll live to fight another day," Peter Gignoux, head of the
energy desk at Salomon Smith Barney in London, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"It's natural long liquidation, not a big change in
fundamentals. There have been some massive long positions sitting
in there for months and if they are selling out at these numbers
then they're making pots of money," another analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The market shake-out would reduce pressure on OPEC to ease
supply limits before the planned deadline next March, analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> Decision against Pinochet Annoys Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Argentina criticized Friday
British Judge Ronald Bartle's decision to have former Chilean
president Augusto Pinochet extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Interior Minister Carlos Corach said that "it is
absurd that Spain should judge Pinochet when that European country
had one million dead in its Civil War (1936-1939), saw shooting
executions and has not tried anybody."
</P>
<P>
Spain pretends to act as "an international gendarme because
nobody has the right to disturb the democratic system Spaniards
have chosen," Corach told the press.
</P>
<P>
The former Chilean ruler is eight days short of being detained
in London for one year at the request of Garzon, who accuses him
of committing crimes against Chilean and Spanish citizens during
and after his regime.
</P>
<P>
Argentine scrapes with Spain and England have increased,
although in a moderate way, because of the support given by the
Carlos Menem government to the Chilean government.
</P>
<P>
Argentine human rights organizations welcomed Judge Bartle's
verdict, while the Peace and Justice Service, presided by 1980
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Adolfo Perez Esquivel, received the
decision with satisfaction.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Main Markets Weak on US Job Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) - Europe's main stocks dipped Friday
as a mixed batch of US employment data left open the chances of a
Federal Reserve rate rise in November and sent Wall Street shares
on an early loss.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 closed virtually unchanged on the session as
markets on both sides on the Atlantic gave a guarded response to
closely watched US employment figures for September.
</P>
<P>
Gains in mobile phone group Vodafone Airtouch and drugs group
Glaxo Wellcome were neutralised by declines in heavyweight oil
stocks. The FTSE index ended down just 1 point at 6199.4.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE Eurotop 300 was narrowly higher as telecommunications
stocks again provided a buying focus, rising 2 percent while drug
stocks rose 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
German shares remained in negative ground after the release of
September US jobs data but pared some of its earlier losses.
</P>
<P>
Oil shares were the biggest losers as crude prices dived more
than seven percent on doubts that OPEC members would stick to
output curbs. The Dax closed 0.05 points lower at 5419.26.
</P>
<P>
French share prices closed lower, though off the day's lows,
after the mixed US September labor report. The CAC 40 index closed
down 20.33 points at 4721.93, having earlier fallen as low as
4691.18.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Launch Polio Vaccination Campaign in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) will join
national authorities in Sierra Leone to launch a nationwide polio
vaccination campaign on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign represents a major step forward in the global
fight to eradicate polio and will be one of the first national
civilian undertakings in Sierra Leone since the ceasefire was
signed 12 weeks ago, said WHO in a press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, involving thousands of health workers and
volunteers, will vaccinate 800,000 children under the age of five
over a period of five days.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone is the last country to begin the nationwide
campaigns necessary for polio eradication, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
"With the headlines so full of the tragedies of conflict, it is
truly worth celebrating when parties can set aside their
differences in the interests of the health of their children and
the world," said WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said that in this 10th
anniversary year of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it
is gratifying to see every youngster's right to immunization
becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
WHO launched its global polio eradication initiative in 1988
with a goal to eradicate polio by the end of year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Decides to Ratify CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT), Foreign Secretary Shafi Sami said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision followed the deliberations at the
just-concluded CTBT conference in Vienna, the official BSS news
agency quoted Sami as saying.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina signed the CTBT on October 24, 1996
out of commitment to peace and development and to freeing the
world of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction,
the foreign minister recalled.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Bangladesh's ratification of the CTBT will
contribute towards expediting the process of bringing the treaty
into force and strengthen the international community's efforts to
bring about a complete ban on testing nuclear weapons and
conducting nuclear explosions," he said.

<HEADLINE>   Confident Chinese Boys Aim Fouth Team Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The confident Chinese men's
gymnasts, aiming to win their fourth consecutive team title, had
to take a day off and relax as the 1999 Gymnastics World
Championships started here on Saturday with only women's
qualification rounds held in the first day's competitions.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaopeng, winner of the 1997 world team title, is regarded
the backbone of the defending champions the Chinese men's team at
the Tianjin championships.
</P>
<P>
"I feel good." Li said, "I am prepared well for tomorrow's
competition. But the only problem annoying me is nowhere to find
my favorite fruit jelly," complained the 18-year-old Li.
</P>
<P>
"That will be great if I could have my fruit jelly. We have
been practicing within the training hall and staying in the hotel
nearby. That's our daily routine since we arrived in Tianjin,"
said Li, who is also expected to win the parallel bars and floor
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yufu, also a 1997 world champion member and is renowned for
his difficult vault routine, said: "I am calm. What filling my
mind is the technical details of my routine."
</P>
<P>
"I will challenge the all-around medal," said the shy Lu, who
was dispatched home due to knee injury at the Bangkok Asian Games
last December.
</P>
<P>
Lu is tipped the possible surprise winner at the current
championships, according to Chinese head coach Huang Yubin. "The
only thing he need to win is to perform his normal standard and
forget pressure." Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The averaging 16-year-old Chinese women's gymnasts, however,
are not that relaxing as their men's team before the championships,
also serves as the qualifying event for next year's Sydney Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"I could not sleep for these days. I thought about the
competition all the time," said Dong Fangxiao, a vault and beam
favorite.
</P>
<P>
Dong is not the only debutantes who felt pressure, Asian Games
champion Ling Jie, and national champions Huang Mandan and Xu Jing
all admitted that they were excited to compete with those world-
class gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
With a height of 1.31-meter and a weight of 31kg, Bai Chunyue
is believed the most promising star after she won the all-around
silver medal at the national championships this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good chance for me to compete in Tianjin world
championships. I repeatedly told myself to calm down and have a
best shot," the diminutive Bai said.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone pats at my head as I'm a little kid. I am yet a
famous gymnast. I have to say it is a good thing that I arose
people's attention," she said.

<HEADLINE> Nemov Gears up for Team Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian star Alexei Nemov has
put his attention not only on the Individual all-around title but
on the men's team gold.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, who appeared sluggish now and then for injuries,
has put first the title of the men's team competition as "the most
important gold medal of the event".
</P>
<P>
"We had very serious training at home and all we are thinking
about now is the team competition. It is the most important stage
of the event. Everything else depends on the first day," said
Nemov on Friday, who is rated as leader of the Russian team.
</P>
<P>
"As usual, I come here just for gold," the world champion did
not conceal his ambition. "My biggest wish for the championships
is to help Russia win a team gold. In any major event, the men's
team gold is what Russia wants most."
</P>
<P>
Nemov was so preoccupied with the team gold on offer that he
had barely time for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen nothing of Tianjin so far. Training sessions, bus,
hotel, this is our usual routine here and I am sure it is the same
for everyone else who will compete in the Championships," Nemov
said.
</P>
<P>
But he turned circumspect when talking about the chances for
Russia and listed China, France and Belarus as the most dangerous
opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Russia can win the team competition, but now besides
Russia, many other countries are also very strong."
</P>
<P>
He was more uncertain about the chances for himself to win
medals in the championships as he still not fully recovered from
back and shoulder injuries.
</P>
<P>
"During the training sessions, the success and failure in doing
routines with high difficulty degree is half and half, and I think
it will be the same after competition begins. Plagued by the
injury, I began serious training only within a month of the
championships."
</P>
<P>
Nemov, the 1996 Olympic champion on vault and 1997 world
champion on floor, will make a debut in the rings.
</P>
<P>
"My speciality is still vault and floor, but I will make the
first-time bid for the rings gold."
</P>
<P>
Nemov, who is the runner-up in the all-around event in 1996
Atlanta Olympics, will take part in the would-be competition in
the all-around.
</P>
<P>
"Ivan Ivankov of Belarus, my compatriot Alexei Bondarenko and
Chinese Li Xiaopeng are the biggest rivals for me,"said Nemov." It
will be very hard for me to win the event, and I think Ivankov
will be the most likely winner."

<HEADLINE> Former Singapore NMP Charged with Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chuang was accused of corruption Saturday when a district court
was told Chuang and his contractor Koh Piak Chong paid a man a
total of 90,000 Singapore dollars to take the rap for Koh who had
employed illegal workers to work at a project of the Housing
Development Board.
</P>
<P>
The bribes were allegedly given in three equal installments
between September and October 1996 through intermediaries and the
money went to an unemployed man, Pan Say Yew, as a reward for
arranging for another man, Prem Chandiram, to take the blame.
</P>
<P>
The judge bailed Chuang at 30,000 Singapore dollars and his
case has been fixed for pre-trial on October 22 of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chuang, 47, a managing director of Chuang Uming, a construction
company, became an NMP on September 25, 1997 and had served a
two-year term. He had sought to continue but was not re-nominated
this year.
</P>
<P>
Chuang's case came about four months after the case of former
MP Choo Wee Khiang who resigned in June this year after pleading
guilty to a cheating charge and a week later was sentenced to two
weeks in jail and fined 10,000 Singapore dollars for fraud.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Pledges to Promote Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Pledged on Saturday to promote export to curb inflation
and the stumbling shilling.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big gathering marking the 37th National
Independence Day, the president said the10 percent inflation rate
is the highest one in many years. He also warned that the market
is short of dollars and the shilling is depreciating against
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Our beef is ready for export. We kill 615,000 cattle each
year and much of the beef was exported to Europe. Now European
countries exercise a ban on our fish exports. This time, I am on
the side of the Europeans completely. We should ensure our
exports are of good quality," he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured the European ambassadors attending the function
that the government would try its best to improve the quality of
the fish products. " We would do our best to make sure that there
are ice blocks in the boxes, the landing sites are hygienic," he
pledged.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans were urged to make use of all the opportunities to
promote their exports. Fish-farming is one of sectors the
president encouraged on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
As on tourism, the president said, government officials should
create better environment to attract foreign tourists because
tourism is one of key foreign exchange earners.
</P>
<P>
Uganda exports goods worth roughly 400 million dollars each
year with coffee, fish and tourism as the pillars of the sector.

<HEADLINE> Belu: Romanian Success is not Miracle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Romanian women team is great,
but it is not a miracle, the country's head coach Octavian Belu
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As what is expected, Romanian women team impressed the
gymnasium with their elegant and clean routines and led the
qualifier after Saturday afternoon's competitions at the world
gymnastics championships which opened Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Belu, Romanian gymnastics legend, lavished his praise on his
team's charge, but he argued that Romanian consistent dominance on
the international arena is not a miracle. That resulted from a
hard work and the country's training system.
</P>
<P>
"It is a hard work. We work several hours a day, and we work
every day whether Saturday or Sunday," said Belu, the women's team
head coach who produced such greats like Lavinia Milosovici and
Gina Gogean.
</P>
<P>
"We have camps so that the girls work together and live
together. We have full-time teachers and special programs, so that
the girls need not go to the normal school.
</P>
<P>
"We have medical staff, and we have government support, all
this led to our success." said Belu
</P>
<P>
"We also have non-stop selection, we select the best for each
age group, from six-year-olds to those who can compete for the
world championships and Olympics. That is one reason we can be
successful," Belu continued.
</P>
<P>
His idea was also echoed by Bitang Maria of Romanian women's
team coach. "We are working hard and we have good children. It is
not a miracle," said Maria following team's wonderful competition.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Romania could ride on such good shape to defend the
gold medal, both coaches became circumspect.
</P>
<P>
"You know, Russian team is very good, and though China seems
not to be good in training sessions it can become better in the
competition. It's hard to say," Maria said.
</P>
<P>
Belu also thought this is just the beginning of a "big fight",
and it is no time to make any speculation.
</P>
<P>
"Some teams are very strong like Russia and China. We do what
we are able to do, we managed such nice things as the scoring in
the uneven bars and the judging is right," Belu said.
</P>
<P>
"But we will try to do our best in team final, because we need
to do that. The difference is so sensible and they (Russia and
China) are so strong. We must think about what we have to do, to
be perfect and clean," said Belu.

<HEADLINE> ASEM Ministers Meet in Berlin on Trade Rules, Business Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Amid the upswing of Asian economy
following the two-year-long turbulence, economics and trade
ministers from 25 European Union (EU) and Asian countries Saturday
began a two-day meeting in Berlin to discuss trade rules and
business promotion between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Main issue of the meeting was to boost trade and investment
between the two regions, said German Economics Minister Werner
Mueller, who is hosting the currency, or the second, Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) conference of economics and trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
"More signs show that the Asian economic crisis has passed, and
the trends are good," said Mueller at a press conference prior to
the meeting. "Asia has returned to the road toward prosperity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Thailand, two countries that had suffered
heaviest losses in Asian crisis, seemed to regain healthy growth,
while the Japanese economy also has given signs of turnaround,
Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rebound of Asian economy to two factors, with
the first being Asian countries' determination to put forward
structural reforms, and the second, the help of international
institutions such as the International Monetary Foundation (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the 15 EU members and 10 Asian countries also
expected to achieve a common stand before the Seattle round talks
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in November, according to
Mueller.
</P>
<P>
With this goal ahead, Mueller expected further talks later this
autumn. The Seattle round will be a comprehensive one and focused
on "further opening and liberalization of the world market," he
said, "that is the stable framework to ensure healthy economic
growth."
</P>
<P>
ASEM includes all the 15 members of the EU and 10 Asian nations-
- Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 delegates are attending the second ASEM
conference of economics and trade ministers. The first was held
in Japan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Heads of government launched ASEM in Thailand in 1996 to deepen
economic ties between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The ministers attending the currency meeting will also review
progress on two action plans launched by ASEM heads of government
last year; one aimed at facilitating trade by cutting red tape and
the second aimed at making it easier for European companies to
invest in Asia.

<HEADLINE> China Fields Same Line-up against Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China will field the same team
beaten by arch rivals South Korea seven days ago to tackle Bahrain
in their second Asian Group B qualifying match for the Sydney
Olympic Games here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Englishman Bobby Houghton, also in charge of the national squad,
decided not to ring any changes to the Chinese Olympic side who
lost their opening campaign and "the most difficult" one to South
Korea 1-0 in Seoul on Oct. 3. The most noteable factor in this
unchanged line-up was center back Sun Jihai, who had been rumored
to receive suspension due to his vigorous protests against the
Malaysian referees after the Seoul match.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't got any clue," Houghton said when asked whether he
could confirm Sun has gotten away with the punishment. "I have not
been informed by FIFA on the matter."
</P>
<P>
The Group B opener, of which the visiting Chinese side
apparently had the better game, was decided by a controversial
63rd minute drive from South Korean star player Sin Byung-Ho which
hit the goal line and then bounced off.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who last season played for the English first division side
Crystal Palace, was among the several unruly Chinese players
chasing the Malaysian referee Abdullah Mohamed Nazri after the
whistle and allegedly verbally abused him.
</P>
<P>
Houghton also defended his attacking line-up choice which
suffered a barrage of criticism after the two marksmen Zhang
Yuning and Li Jinyu managed an abject two shots at goal between
themselves in the entire match. "Both of them had muscle problems
before the game." Houghton said, "But they're looking very sharp
in preparations for the Bahrain game. I'm sure they'll do well
tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Li Jinyu, a bench player on the French first division side
Nancy last season, seemed to have something more for the pointing
fingers.
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself playing well enough. I'm a professional
player and you cannot expect a pro to be in-form at every minute,"
said a defiant Li.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Conform to Historical Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A celebrated Macao businessman
said here Saturday that the Taiwan authorities should conform to
the historical trend of the times and return to the path of one-
China principle as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan authorities should attach the most importance to
the overall interests of the Chinese nation and shoulder
responsibility in the great cause of reunification," said Ma Man
Kei, chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a gathering marking the 88th anniversary
of the Revolution of 1911 which overthrew thousands of years of
feudal monarchy and put forth the slogan of "revitalizing China."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, leader of the revolution and founder of the
Kuomintang Party, joined hands with the Communist Party in the
1920s to fight against reactionary warlords.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of hundreds of local people from all
walks of life, the gathering was held in front of a bronze statue
of Dr. Sun Yat-sen at the Kiang Wu Hospital where Dr. Sun had
worked before he was engaged in revolutionary activities.
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party of China carried forward the unfulfilled
wish of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, overthrew the three big mountains of
imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism, and completed
the task of democratic revolution in China," Ma Man Kei said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over the 50 years since the founding of the
People's Republic of China, particularly in the past two decades,
the country has seen earth-shaking changes and the Chinese people
have succeeded in finding a novel socialist road.
</P>
<P>
"Our success and progress today are able to console the souls
of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionary forerunners," he said.
</P>
<P>
While Hong Kong has returned to the motherland and Macao's
return is coming soon, exchanges across the Taiwan Straits have
developed well under the principle of peaceful reunification and "
one country, two systems," Ma Man Kei said, citing the fact that
after the strong earthquake in Taiwan, all Chinese people
throughout the country have offered helping hands.
</P>
<P>
"The revitalization of the nation and reunification of the
country have become an irresistible historical trend. The recent
separatist remarks of Lee Teng-hui will surely be denounced by all
Chinese people," Ma Man Kei said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Aims to Pave Way for Olympics Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The 34th world gymnastics
championships will be the first big campaign to test if Australian
women's American head coach Liddick Peggy can live up to the
expectation of hitting success in the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Liddick came into the rein when the Australian team was reeling
from a slump on the international arena which saw the Olympics
hosts only coming in 11th at the world championships women's
competition in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Liddick made up his mind to rejuvenate the team whose best
record is the sixth place in the 1991 worlds in the United States,
which earned them a ticket for the Olympics for the first time.
</P>
<P>
At its Olympics debut Australian female side placed seventh in
the Barcelona competition but the smiles did not last long as some
veterans retired to sap the energy of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Liddick, who has been the assistant coach to the 1996 Olympics
women's team champions the United States, refreshed the team with
measures including new clothes, new setting music and new
choreograph.
</P>
<P>
"I love new graceful routines and now I am confident that our
choreograph can match the best team in the world," said Liddick.
</P>
<P>
The coach also swims with the tide as he encourages coaches to
work out the routines with a start value of 10 points for those
excellent gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
At the world championships which opens here on Friday, Liddick
has put a gold in vault in his sight after his charge Trudy
Mclntosh has a well-done routine whose value is started at 10.
</P>
<P>
The measures have boosted the confidence of Liddick who
characteristically made clear his aim for the championships.
</P>
<P>
"Our first aim is to make the last eight. Recently I saw the
training of some teams and I think this target is not a long shot,
"said Liddick.
</P>
<P>
On the men's side which see a more intense competition from
traditional powerhouses like China and Russia, Australia is still
very confident of their performance.
</P>
<P>
Warwick Forbes, head coach of the Australian men's team held
rosy picture about their prospect for qualifying for the Olympic
games to be held at their home ground next year.
</P>
<P>
"We have three very experienced 28 year-old gymnasts and three
who are 17-18 years old. Our best gymnasts, Andrei Kravtsov is
still having problems with his shoulder, but he knows very well
how to concentrate and resist any difficulties throughout the
competition," said Warwick.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Bronzeware To Be Displayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palace Museum in Beijing
will begin an exhibit of ancient bronzeware, much of which will be
seen by the public for the first time, on October 12, including
221 bronze relics dating back to the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Exhibition organizers are also providing visitors with complete
explanations of the development of bronzeware through Chinese
history, with the focus on musical instruments and weapons.
</P>
<P>
Bronzeware specialists say that this exhibit will combine
academic and artistic values.
</P>
<P>
Bronzeware articles were regarded as token of monarchic
authority in ancient times, and many of the pieces are inscribed
with mysterious epigraphs which will not be understood by most
visitors.
</P>
<P>
In all of China's museums there are more than 4,000 epigraph-
inscribed bronzeware relics, and 1,600 of these are in the Palace
Museum.
</P>
<P>
The museum has some 15,000 ancient bronze articles, more than
any other museum in the world.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Vietnamese Communist Party Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC), met here today with Pham The Duyet, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Vietnamese Communist
Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li first conveyed the regards of General-Secretary of the CPC
Central Committee Jiang Zemin to Pham and his delegation, and said
China and Vietnam are close neighbors, and in recent years the
leaders of the two countries have had frequent contact and
exchanged views on bilateral ties and issues of common concern,
which has greatly stimulated the development of overall relations.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, stressed that
in the present situation, it is of special importance for China
and Vietnam to further consolidate their friendship.
</P>
<P>
On the ideological building of the Party, Li said Marxism is
the Party's guiding ideology and theoretical basis, and the great
achievements of China's reform and opening up are a great triumph
for Marxism.
</P>
<P>
"The Marxism we refer to is scientific and a general truth
which is a complete system providing a sharp weapon by which
mankind can learn and rebuild the world;
</P>
<P>
"The Marxism we refer to is practical, for Marxism originates
from practice and is examined by practice, and practice
constitutes one of its basic characteristics;
</P>
<P>
"The Marxism we refer to is also developing, for development is
its basic viewpoint," Li said. Marxism pioneers the way towards
truth, but it has not, and cannot, encompass all truth in the
world." Therefore, it continuously absorbs and draws on all the
achievements of human civilization, rather than rejecting and
refusing them, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China Technology Fair Features Hi-Tech Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 3,000 hi-tech companies
and investors have been drawn to China's first technology fair,
which will close tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Buyers and sellers all were excited by what they have learned
at the five-day fair, and China's hi-tech research-results
transfer is expected to be accelerated by the event.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 venture investors from home and abroad attended
the fair and showed great interests in many projects.
</P>
<P>
Steven Chu, a Chinese-American Nobel Prize laureate, told
Xinhua that China is on the right track toward prosperity, and the
priority that the Chinese Government has given to mobilizing the
marriage of scientific research and corporate development has been
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Xu Liang, vice-governor of Qinghai Province in northwest China
who led a delegation to the fair, said China has abundant
resources waiting for commercial exploitation. Taking Qinghai as
an example, he said the province has yak and snow lotus that can
be made into tonics.
</P>
<P>
"But what we need badly is technology and money to turn the
plateau specialties into high value-added products," he said, "and
the fair has provided us with just such a golden opportunity."
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Agriculture said China's
agricultural sector has great potential for foreign investment. "
Fifteen new and high-tech projects found interested investors at
the fair, and gained contracted investment of 129 million yuan,"
he said.

It is dangerous to doubt the scientific features of Marxism; it
is detrimental to separate Marxism from practice; and it is
harmful to be limited within an individual judgment and simply
stick to conventions, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Pham agreed with Li's views and said that without the correct
guidance of the CPC, China, so vast and populous, could not have
made such achievements during the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and China enjoy good friendly relations, and the
friendship fostered by leaders of the former generation are now
being reinforced and advanced, Pham said. He also expressed the
hope that the CPPCC and the Vietnam Fatherland Front will continue
their communication so as to realize common development for the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Medical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday accused the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the approval of its medical
contracts signed under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak held
the U.S. and British representatives at the U.N. committee
responsible for the delay in approving Iraq's contracts for
purchasing medicines and medical appliances, said the Iraqi News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Three medical contracts worth some 4 million U.S. dollars
signed in the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program are still
put on hold by U.S. and British representatives, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that 48 contracts valued at 58 million dollars signed
in the fifth phase and three contracts worth 2.7 million dollars
concluded in the sixth phase are still blocked by the U.S. and
British envoys under flimsy pretexts.
</P>
<P>
"These virulent aggressive practices against the people of
Iraq reflect the bulk of the crime pursued by America and Britain
against the Iraqi people with the aim of annihilating them and
denying them of the simplest requirements of life," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report by the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), mortality rates among Iraqi children have more than
doubled since the imposition of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Anglo-Boer War Commemorated in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki and British Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent, laid
wreaths at a Commonwealth grave site in Brandfort in the Free
State on Saturday to launch the centenary of the Anglo-Boer War.
</P>
<P>
A government commemorative program started on Friday with a
photographic and art exhibition at the Bloemfontein war museum.
</P>
<P>
The commemorations plan to highlight and honor for the first
time the role all South Africans, including black people, played
in the war.
</P>
<P>
The war began on October 11, 1899, with Britain seeking to
control South Africa's gold reserves, and President Paul Kruger
resisting.
</P>
<P>
After three years of mainly guerrilla warfare, the British wore
down Boer resistance.
</P>
<P>
While the sites of white concentration camps had been well
documented, black camps and grave sites were only being discovered
now.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Deputy President Jacob Zuma will attend a ceremony
to remember the role of the Barolong community in defending
Mafikeng during the seven-month siege of that town from October
1899 to May 1900.
</P>
<P>
Other events over the commemoration period will include the
unveiling of grave sites at Spioenkop on November 13. Mbeki
arrived and waved to the crowd before shaking hands with the Duke
of Kent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the crowd gathering at the site, Mbeki said:
</P>
<P>
"We pay homage to the courageous Boer men and women who stood
with Paul Kruger, President of the Transvaal Boer Republic who, on
this day a hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We pay homage to them because they had the courage to take on
a Goliath in defense of their freedom. We pay homage to them
because, in struggle, they asserted the right of all colonized
people to independence."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also lauded the black allies as well, who stood side by
side with the Boers, saying that "many among these bore arms and
contributed to the war effort in other ways, themselves ready to
lay down their lives for their own freedom and their land".
</P>
<P>
"A century after the outbreak of the South African War, we are
entitled to assert from this place where so many died, that
through our actions, we have, in this country at least, silenced
the guns of war for ever," the president said.
</P>
<P>
One of these lessons must surely be that never again should we
allow that anybody, whether from inside or from outside our
country, should impose the curse of war on the people, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"That reflection should also lead all those who shall be our
heroes and heroines to understand that we will not permit it that
our differences in terms of race, color and culture serve as cause
for us to treat one another as other than South Africans who share
a common patriotism and a common destiny," he noted.

SHENZHEN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Learning to survive and take
life easy under pressure is the key to success, Zhang Chaoyang,
founder of Internet Technologies China (ITC), told the audience
attending the forum on founding and investing in high-technology.
</P>
<P>
The forum is part of the on-going China High-Tech Fair in
Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
When founding a high-tech company, Zhang warned that it is
necessary to have one's own ideas and stick with those ideas, and
not to be swayed by other people's thoughts. He said that a down-
to-earth manner and concentration and energy every step of the way
also spells success.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, you will end up nowhere," he said.

ITC, a leading firm offering online information in the Chinese
language, successfully introduced venture capital from companies
including Intel, and created Sohu.Com, a tool for online
information searches in Chinese opened in 1998. Up to now, well
over 100,000 people have accessed this site.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Zhang felt the happiness of success after
traveling for half a year and securing the capital to start his
own company.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, I find that was just a beginning, the road ahead
is still a long journey," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also told potential high-tech business founders to be
prepared for the pressures of being short of funds, as it is not
easy for high-tech businesses to obtain venture capital.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China only recently introduced a market
economy, and this has posed a great number of difficulties for the
growth of high-tech companies, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
"But being accepted by investors does not mean being accepted
by the market, so high-tech companies can only struggle to the top
through fierce market competitions," said the Sohu CEO.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the competitiveness of an enterprise comes
from innovations and the pursuit of changes. It is necessary for
entrepreneurs to learn to put forward countermeasures against
market changes, and to initiate them rapidly.
</P>
<P>
"Only by grasping internationalization and localization in a
balanced way can a high-tech enterprise survive," said Zhang,
adding that credibility is the most important factor for an
enterprise's success.
</P>
<P>
The Sohu CEO also said it is important for high-tech founders
to have a sound mental attitude, because glory and destruction may
come together, and right decisions and errors can be committed
every day.

China High-Tech Fair is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Ministry of Science

Academy of Sciences and the Shenzhen municipal government. The
fair will close tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Russia Acknowledges Civilian Casualties in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said on Saturday that civilian casualties were incurred
during the federal operation against separatist rebels in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Federal agencies" also suffered losses, Ivanov told a press
conference after talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris
Tarasyuk in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov denied as "groundless speculations" the allegation that
Chechen population are pursued for national or religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
"We are combating bandit formations which hurt thousands of
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said more than 300,000 people had to flee Chechnya in
the past few years because of the chaos in the North Caucasus
republic with rampant violence and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"How many people were taken prisoner and killed? Our
servicemen were subject to utmost savagery in Chechnya," he said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected Chechen rebel leaders' reference to human rights.
"What human rights did Chechen bandit leaders suddenly remember?
What right do they have to turn to different organizations and ask
them to ensure human rights in Chechnya?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov was apparently referring to a recent appeal reportedly
made by Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov for NATO intervention.
NATO said it has not received any such appeals.
</P>
<P>
He said the federal forces were "taking whatever strengthened
measures necessary to ensure there are no casualties, or as few as
possible, among the civilian population."
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that at least seven
soldiers were killed and 37 wounded in the previous 24 hours in
Chechnya.

The United States and Britain have expressed their reserve

"We don't have any reason to be against such a voyage," Agence

<HEADLINE> China Devoted to Environmental Protection: Vice-Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-premier Li Lanqing
said here today that the government has devoted itself to
environmental protection in the face of increasing pressures from
the rising of population and rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at the opening ceremony of the 99' Asia-
Kyushu Regional Exchanges Summit in Jiangsu Province focusing on "
economic development vs. environmental protection."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are willing to make
endeavors to create a new era of sustainable development together
with other countries in Asia and the world at large," Li told 170
regional leaders from 11 countries.
</P>
<P>
China remains the largest developing country in the world, with
tens of millions of people still living in poverty; and its
population increases by 13 million annually despite the national
birth control policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These factors constitute enormous difficulties facing economic
development, protection of the environment and the exploitation of
natural resources in the country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a long-term plan, China will still
maintain an economic growth rate of 7 percent until the year 2010,
he said.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal of sustained economic growth, Li said that
China has been adhering to the following guiding principles and
policies:
</P>
<P>
-- Pollution prevention and control shall be further
intensified, the policy of birth control must be upheld as always,
and economic structure should be readjusted to be environmental
friendly;
</P>
<P>
-- Prevention of pollution should top all priorities to
eliminate new source of pollutants;

WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton came to Canada Friday and waded into the
country's most divisive political issue, declaring that French-
speaking Quebec would be better off within Canada rather than
pressing for independence.
</P>
<P>
-- Vice President Al Gore and Democratic rival Bill Bradley
have already made campaign promises that would spend every penny
of the available federal budget surplus for the next 10 years, and
possibly more, calculations show.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton, acknowledging that he lacks the votes to
ratify a treaty banning nuclear testing, pleaded with Senate
leaders to delay action. But he refused to give in to a
Republican demand that he withdraw the treaty and thus concede
that it will not be enacted while he is in the White House.
</P>
<P>
-- A Government panel, moving with unusual speed after Britain'
s worst train crash in decades, confirmed that a commuter train
had caused the crash in London by running a red signal light
straight into the path of a speeding inter-city express. The
police said 30 fatalities had been confirmed and that 64 people
remained unaccounted for.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sri Lankan Army to Celebrate Golden Jubilee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Army, which
celebrates the 50th anniversary of its founding on Sunday (October
10), has been transformed into a relatively huge professional
force by the long-running ethnic civil war in this tiny island
country.
</P>
<P>
A three-day grand exhibition marking the anniversary concluded
Saturday at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference
Hall here.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people thronged to the exhibition to see
for themselves the sea change of the army which has risen from a
humble beginning to a dominating position in this war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Army, battling a 16-year-old war against the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who demand a
Tamil homeland in the country's north and east, is a huge
improvement on what it was 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
When the army was first established on October 10, 1949, a year
after the country's independence from Britain, "there were only
2,500 soldiers," said 91-year-old Major General Anton Muthukumaru,
the first Sri Lankan Army commander.
</P>
<P>
The turning point for the army came in July 1983 when LTTE
rebels killed 13 soldiers from the ethnic Sinhalese majority.
Since then the LTTE, which initially received training and arms
from the neighboring India, gave the army a baptism of fire.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the 1983 ethnic riots the army was 9,000-strong.
</P>
<P>
Currently it has 118,000 men and women in its ranks and is
looking for about 20,000 recruits to launch its offensive against
the estimated 10,000 LTTE guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"The high point (of the army) is the professionalism that we
have gained mainly due to the war during the past 16 years," said
Army Commander Lt. Gen. Sirilal Weerasuriya. "In terms of
equipment, expertise and experience, we are a professional army
today."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's military expenditure has also skyrocketed, from the
humble 5.3 million rupees (75,000 U.S. dollars) in 1949 to an
allocated 47 billion rupees (671 million dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In terms of percentage, the military expending in 1949 was 0.2
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), but it went up to 6.6
percent in 1998, said Muthukumaru.
</P>
<P>
With superiority in strength, weaponry and funding, the
military has made certain progress in their war against the
rebels, driving them out of their long-time stronghold Jaffna
peninsula in 1996 and reducing the amount of rebel territory from
9,100 square kilometers in 1994 to 3,200 square kilometers at
present.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who are usually branded by the government as
terrorists, are regarded as the world's most effective guerrilla
fighters, known for their suicide bomb attacks and hit-and-run
tactics.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's first suicide bombing was against an army camp in
the northern peninsula of Jaffna where a guerrilla drove an
explosive-laden truck that killed nearly 40 soldiers on July 5,
1987.
</P>
<P>
Since then the suicide bombing has been widely used against
government officials, security forces and civilian targets and the
LTTE was thus designated again on Friday as a terrorist
organization by the U.S. State Department and has been banned in
the United States, India as well as at home.
</P>
<P>
Though Tamil Tiger rebels have been beset with troubles, the
Sri Lankan Army has its own problems.
</P>
<P>
The army's image has been tarnished by allegations of
large-scale human rights violations. Human rights groups charged
that the army was responsible for the disappearance of some 600
Tamil civilians who were taken into custody in Jaffna in 1996 when
the army captured the peninsula from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The army in recent years has also found it difficult to recruit
soldiers and has been hit by large-scale desertions that typically
rise following military setbacks.
</P>
<P>
The government has repeatedly offered amnesties and launched
operations to round up the deserters. But it is estimated that
some 15,000 deserters remain at large, who are partly blamed for
the rise in Sri Lanka's crime rate.
</P>
<P>
After 16 years of bloody war, the Sri Lankan Army is still far
from defeating the rebels or forcing them to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
Even as the army is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its
birth, it cannot feel relieved even for a moment.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened as dozens of checkpoints were set
up in the capital and more than 50 people were held on Friday
during a search for suspected Tamil Tiger rebels to ensure that
the LTTE guerrillas would not spoil a massive parade here on
Sunday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the army.

<HEADLINE> Somali War Lords Exchange Fire with Bandits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Forces of Somali warlord Muse
Sudi Yalahow, together with local businessmen, launched raid and
exchanged fire with outlawed gunmen on Friday around the second
largest market in Somali capital of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
One of Yalahow 's commanders,Omar Mohamed Jumale (Jalltoh),
said that 15 gunmen were arrested and all their weapons were
confiscated in the crackdown on the rampant banditry activities.
</P>
<P>
Two bandits and one militiaman were injured during the exchange
of fire near the market at Jiro Wa'budhan junction, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the fighting intensified, the outlawed militiamen have fled
for their lives deserting the illegal roadblocks they had erected
at the junction and at the entrances of the market.
</P>
<P>
Jumale said all 15 gunmen were taken to the Islamic court in
Medina district controlled by Yalahow where they will face charges
of robbery, killing, abduction and instigating inter-clan feuds in
and around the capital.
</P>
<P>
After the outlawed gunmen had been defeated, those of Yalahow
erected another roadblock, which they called a station post
safeguarding the area from what they called illegal infiltrators.
The militiamen manning this new roadblock have started taxing the
public and commercial traffic to and from the market.
</P>
<P>
The market area has been calm, commercial activities and
pedestrians are moving around much easier than before. Islamic
courts are trying to curb down crime in the country which has no
government for almost 10 years.

exploitation by developed countries in this century, the
deterioration of the environment now threatens the existence of
the human race.
</P>
<P>
"We should cross ethical, cultural, religious and ideological
differences to make joint efforts today to curb pollution and
protect the environment for sustained economic development, which
is in the interest of all countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also promised that the implementation of China's policy of
sustained economic development will provide a vast field of
opportunities for overseas cooperation in the industries of
electric power, oil, gas and petroleum, the prevention of soil
erosion, and many other environment-related industries.

<HEADLINE> "We've Still got everything to play for," Says Houghton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Olympic side, who
are still smarting from their 1-0 opening match loss to arch
rivals South Korea, will have to brace themselves up for an all-
important battle against Bahrain in an Asian Group B qualifier for
the Sydney Olympics here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to be negative," head coach Englishman Bobby
Houghton said here today. "We can't afford to think too much about
the October 3 game against South Korea or the October 29 home game
against them."
</P>
<P>
Despite having a better possession of the game, China still
failed to etch out a historic win over their east Asian neighbours
-- something almost a national obsession after an amazing losing
streak running over a decade in the game of any kind.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed. No one is happy about the result,"
Houghton said, "But you've got to take the whole picture. We were
away from home, losing just 1-0, and to a team ranked number one
in Asia, and fortunately, it's the most difficult game."
</P>
<P>
"For us now, the most important thing is to focus on the
Bahrain game." Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
In a group where the only ticket for Sydney is considered as a
two-horse race between China and South Korea, outsiders Bahrain
may turn out to be the deciding factor on the group configuration,
Houghton assumed.
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous to think this tournament is just two games
against South Korea. To lose against Bahrain would just be like
to lose against South Korea," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reminding a packed room of reporters who're still preoccupied
with the Seoul game seven days ago that this is a pre-game press
conference rather than a post-game one, Houghton pointed out:"
Preparation for this game started the day we came back from South
Korea, and now the concentration is on the Bahrain."
</P>
<P>
Having lost the initiative of the four-game qualification
campaign after the Seoul defeat, China now bets on securing all
six points -- home and away -- at the expense of Bahrain and
posting a famous victory over South Korea on home turf on October
29.
</P>
<P>
Not only does China face a must-win situation tomorrow night,
they will also have to notch up as many goals as possible because
goal difference, very possibly, would have the last say over the
fate of the Chinese and South Korean teams.
</P>
<P>
An ever cautious Houghton, though, warned against dwelling on
goal difference when the result is still in the air.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to take it for granted that South Korea would
get everything they want on the last day of the Group B qualifiers
from a Bahrainian side which was assumed by many to have been out
of contention by then.
</P>
<P>
In a schedule believed to be an advantage, South Korea takes on
Bahrain on November 3 in their final game which may be closely
followed by the Chinese Olympic side, who will have already
finished all their group matches.
</P>
<P>
"It won't be as quite easy as that. Bahrain is not Bangladesh
or Cambodia, and would not be laid down (by South Korea) and
beaten by five or six goals."
</P>
<P>
"So, we've still got everything to play for," Houghton said.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Blast in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed and a dozen others injured in an explosion in the proximity
of the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Saturday, sources
from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
The explosives went off when some Taliban fighters were loading
them in a vehicle, which caught fire after the blast. Taliban
fighters managed to control the fire after two hours.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at Qila Zeena, six kilometers west of
Mazar-i-Sharif, the strategic city which the Taliban militia
captured in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The blast was so powerful that it was heard in the city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban authorities have ruled out the possibility of
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Leader Defends Position on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main
Protestant leader David Trimble said on Saturday that his party's
position on the peace process has not changed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ulster Unionist Party's annual conference held
in the Northern Ireland city of Enniskillen, he said the position
"is and will remain -- No guns, no government."
</P>
<P>
"We want devolution, we want decommissioning (disarming
guerrillas on both sides of the sectarian divide)," the Reuters
quoted Trimble as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Trimble's deputy John Taylor boycotted former U.S.
Senator George Mitchell's review of the peace talks, aimed at
getting last year's Good Friday agreement back on track.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said devolution -- setting up Northern Ireland's own
local government -- had to be accompanied by guerrillas laying
down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Kelly of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, accused Trimble "of playing games with the hopes
and desires of the vast majority of people who want to make the
Good Friday agreement work."

<HEADLINE> Rios Advances, Chang Eliminated at Shanghai Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Marcelo Rios of Chile
beat the fifth seed Jonas Bjorkman 6-4, 6-1 to meet the second
seed Magnus Norman in a dream final of the Heineken Open here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Norman of Sweden rallied from one set down in another semifinal
to hold off defending champion Michael Chang 0-6, 6-4, 6-2 and
ended his nine-game winning streak in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
This was the last tournament Chang won and he is likely to find
it very tough to maintain his streak of winning at least one title
every year since 1988.
</P>
<P>
By contrast Norman could take the outright lead for the number
of titles won this year, and that he said was extra motivation.
Right now he is level with Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi with four
titles -- Sampras has not played and Agassi lost at the Swiss
Indoor.
</P>
<P>
Rios played as well as he had to. It was not great tennis from
him but then Bjorkman was unfortunately not quite on the court
with his game. The Swede found it difficult to raise his level of
play and said "my body was on the court but my mind was not".
</P>
<P>
The start of play was delayed by about two hours because of
rain. Shanghai was feeling the effects in part of Typhoon Dan
which had worked its way through the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
When Rios broke serve in the first game he felt he was getting
the better of the Swede straight away. Bjorkman tried to serve and
volley but when he found that was getting him nowhere he decided
to change things and play from the back court which had worse
consequences because Rios is so solid from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
"I have been winning easy and that's the important thing, I
felt good," said Rios. "It's important to win and the way I have
been winning my matches is more than enough."
</P>
<P>
The match was stopped by a misty drizzle after the first game
of the second set when Rios was up a break. Bjorkman was not
necessarily affected by the weather delays, he was however
convinced that he gave Rios the match and Rios just had to get the
ball back into play.
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly day at the office," said Bjorkman. "I was not
as prepared as I wanted to be and I didn't feel focused when I
walked on court. I was hoping the rain delay would have helped,
but I didn't have the concentration I had in the other matches. It
was an average match for him because he didn't have to do too much.
"
</P>
<P>
For Chang this was an opportunity that slipped through his
racquet strings because he was certainly in control of the match,
but even being in a strong position he needed to keep on
capitalising on situations that came his way. He just did not do
enough of it and Norman grew stronger with each opening given to
him.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in the match mentally, early on, but then I started
to make him work and I got an early break in the second set and
from there played a great match," said Norman.
</P>
<P>
Chang has been saying all week that winning the key points is
what matters and he had been doing that up to now.
</P>
<P>
"Those key points make a difference and he continued to play
good tennis when it mattered. I got a bit tired in the third set
so it is tough because I had chances, but I am pleased with things
and this is a step in the right direction," said Chang.
</P>
<P>
The final will be the first ever meeting between Rios and
Norman and it is a match expected to be highlighted by long
rallies as both players prefer to play their tennis from the
baseline.

<HEADLINE> Romania Top Qualification Round at Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Romania
boosted their hopes of retaining the women's team title after
their outstanding gymnasts overshadowed other qualifiers on the
first day of the Gymnastics World Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Top favorite Romania put up a flawless performance to collect
an aggregate score of 154.394 points, taking the lead in the first
six groups in the qualification round.
</P>
<P>
Russia was in second place with 153.575 and Ukraine stayed in
third with 151.970 with two more groups including hosts China to
compete on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad that we had well-balanced performances today and no
one made big mistake," said Romanian women's head coach Octavian
Belu after their fourth group competition in Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Russia, China or Ukraine will threat us to
retain the team title," Belu added.
</P>
<P>
Russian veteran Svetlana Khorkina claimed the day-high 9.837
points for her uneven bars routine after she made a clean dismount
from the bars.
</P>
<P>
However, the 20-year-old Olympic and world champion on the
uneven bars had a poor beam scores of 9.475 which dragging her to
the third place in the all-around overall, almost 0.1 points
behind the mighty Romanian Olaru Maria in 38.792 and Raducan
Andreea at 38.755.
</P>
<P>
"The competition is very tense for all of us. This is quite
understandable, though, as Olympic qualifications are priority
task for everybody who has come to Tianjin to compete," said
Leonid Arkaev, head coach for the Russian team.
</P>
<P>
Arkaev also believed that the first day's performance marked
that the women's gymnastics has reached a new level in its
development.
</P>
<P>
"This is a competition of huge scale due not only to the number
of participating teams and individuals, but also to the increased
standard of performances. We have never seen such a high technical
level of executions." Arkaev said.
</P>
<P>
The cautious Romanian coach Belu also described their
domination just the beginning of a "big fight".
</P>
<P>
"We will try to do our best in team final, to be perfect and
clean. Because the difference is so sensible and our arch rivals
Russia and China are so strong," Belu said.
</P>
<P>
The one-and-a-half day women's qualification competition will
finish tomorrow with host team China and the United States
performing in the last two groups.
</P>
<P>
"The Romanians showed their team depth. Their invincible
domination today is not a surprise," said Chinese national team
leader Qian Kui.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's coach Xie Zhimin admitted:" The elegant
Romanians are far better than us."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Turns to Djibouti Port Amid Ethio-Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia, an inland country,
has turned to its neighbor Djibouti for a sea outlet and most of
its import and export were through the Djibouti Port since the
Ethio-Eritrea war started in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Africa-Horn country has imported and planned to import
some 1.5 million tons of fertilizers and salt and 1.1 billion
litres of fuel from the port this year, Operation Coordinator
Mohammed Berihu was quoted by the Herald Newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 128,000 tons of dry cargo and 97.4
million litres of liquid cargo entered Ethiopia through the port
last year, rising 64 percent and 38 percent respectively over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said that 15,736 tons of cargo per month were exported
through the port last year,14 percent higher than that through the
Port of Assab which recorded an average 13,788 tons per month.
</P>
<P>
The Port of Assab, now belonging to Eritrea, used to be
Ethiopia's major outlet before Eritrea declared independence in
May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia had been using the port until 1998 when the border
conflict erupted.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman On Confucius </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official today
spoke highly of Confucius, a great thinker and educator in ancient
China, when meeting with experts attending a seminar here marking
the 2,550th anniversary of the birth of Confucius.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference and member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, said that Confucianism is the
basis of traditional Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
"Confucianism, including thoughts on political, economic,
philosophic, moral, educational, artistic and other aspects of
life, has played a unique role in the shaping, development and
unification of the Chinese nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The doctrine also has made remarkable contributions to the
civilization of mankind, and many parts of it remain meaningful
for contemporary society."
</P>
<P>
"In attempting to solve the many problems of today's world," he
said, "we can still learn from the wisdom of our ancestors."
</P>
<P>
He urged experts attending the seminar to adopt a scientific
attitude toward Confucianism, saying that the study of Confucius
can serve current political, economic, cultural and social needs.
</P>
<P>
"China, the home of Confucius, has both the honor and
responsibility to do more to deepen the understanding of
Confucianism," he said.

<HEADLINE> DFLP Welcomes Deletion from U.S. Terrorist List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Front for Liberation
of Palestine (DFLP) welcomed the U.S. decision earlier Saturday to
drop the front from its list of terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Taiyseer Khalid, member of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) Executive Committee and the DFLP Political
Bureau, said the U.S. move constitutes a revision of its previous
prejudiced attitudes.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after DFLP expressed willingness to join
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
DFLP had rejected the Oslo Agreement signed between PLO and
Israel and set up a Damascus-based opposition group with some
Palestinian factions.
</P>
<P>
The group held dialog in Cairo early last August with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat-led Fatah Movement, paving the
way for mutually beneficial joint cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israel is currently considering the Palestinian National
Authority request of allowing DFLP secretary general, Na'if
Hwatma, to join the peace camp.

<HEADLINE> Macao Hosts 13th International Music Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The half-month 13th Macao
International Music Festival was unveiled Saturday night with the
performance of Aida, a grand opera by Giuseppe Verdi.
</P>
<P>
The four-act opera will also be presented on October 12 and 16
at the same site of Macao Cultural Center which was completed in
March this year.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1992, operas have been presented each time at music
festivals and opera performances in Macao have managed to
establish their fame," said Wang Zeng Yang, director of the
official Macao Cultural Institute which sponsored the music
festival.
</P>
<P>
Aida is known as an opera with very beautiful music and it has
been performed numerous times around the world. Aida is also an
opera of the largest scale ever staged in Macao.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people from China, Italy, Portugal and Russia
take part in the performance. They include a host of world-class
stars.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to restore the original flavor of the opera when it was
first staged in Egypt in 1871, such as its grandeur, costume and
ancient Egyptian weapons," said Paolo Trevisi, technical director
of the music festival.
</P>
<P>
Trevisi has directed music festivals in Macao for eight years
and seen the festival thrive year by year. "The festival this time
is the last one held in the region under Portuguese rule, but I
hope future festivals will go on and become more successful."
</P>
<P>
He said he used to travel around the world talking artists into
participating in the music festivals in Macao. This year, a number
of artists gave up their scheduled performances in other places
and chose Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past several years, music festivals have drawn the
attention of people around the world and won more favorable
comments from foreign critics and more reports in foreign
newspapers and magazines," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that Macao has witnessed gradual progress in the
music festivals with regard to organization, artistic design,
publicity and musical production.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we have more classical music pieces, more large-
scale performances and more world-class singers, pianists and
conductors," Wang said, adding that as many as 1,130 people will
participate in the performances which will last till October 23.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Cabinet Approves 2000 Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese cabinet Saturday
approved the 2000 draft budget bill in its continuous efforts to
bring down the huge public debt and budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The draft fiscal bill sets total expenditure for 2000 at about
5.68 billion U.S. dollars, compared with the current budget's 5.6
billion spending forecast.
</P>
<P>
Projected government revenue for 2000 is set at 3.62 billion
dollars, slightly more than this year's revenue forecast of 3.4
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 fiscal deficit would stand at 36 percent, around 9
percent less than this year's maximum forecast of 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has reiterated that the new
budget aims at mainly at streamlining government expenditures,
exempting social and post-civil war reconstruction affairs from
austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is struggling to reduce the spiraling public debt,
which stands currently at 19.5 billion dollars, more than its
gross domestic products.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's economy has been fallen into the
worst cycle since the end of the 15-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
After the cabinet session, Information Minister Anwar Khalil
told reporters that despite short of funds, the government will
continue its investment and social projects to which 45 percent of
the expenditure in the new budget have been allocated.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bill will be submitted to parliament next
week for a debate and final endorsement.

The Times:
</P>
<P>

improvements to 22 signals around the country which train drivers
have repeatedly passed at red. The signal in the Paddington crash

</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's National Westminster Bank Friday jettisoned its

Bank of Scotland's hostile 21.3 billion pound (about 35.2 billion

</P>
<P>
Daily Telegraph:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over Fresh Turkish Incursion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested to the
U.N. over the fresh Turkish troops incursion into northern Iraq,
and demanded the U.N. to intervene with the Turkish government to
pull out its troops from Iraq immediately.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said some 5,000 Turkish troops,
supported by tanks, armored vehicles, helicopters and warplanes,
invaded northern Iraq on September 28, which caused heavy losses
and property damage in the area, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The letter utterly dismissed the pretexts with which Turkey
justified its military operations.
</P>
<P>
"The allegation of cracking down on elements threatening the
Turkish national security did not give Turkey permission to
continue its policy which completely contradicts what Turkey
declares that it is keen on Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has lost its control over the Kurdish autonomous region in
the north of the country since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Turkish troops often launched cross-border attacks
against the Turkish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels who have been
fighting for an independent country since 1984.
</P>
<P>
The letter said the sufferings of Turkey are caused by the
continuation of the abnormal status imposed by the U.S. and
Britain in the region in collaboration with Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed two no-fly zones in Iraq
following the Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds
in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from possible attacks
by the Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called upon the U.N. to live up to its responsibilities
and prevent the continuation of threats and aggression Iraq has
been exposed to.

BELGRADE -- The United Nations human rights envoy to Yugoslavia
on Friday night criticized the international peacekeepers in
Kosovo for failing to ensure safety for all residents there in
line with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The international peacekeepers have failed to make Kosovo a
safe and stabilized place, nor to prevent fresh ethnic cleansing
there, Jiri Dienstbier, U.N. special envoy on the human rights
situation in Yugoslavia, commented when winding up a one-week
working visit. Dienstbier was quoted by the Yugoslav press agency
Tanjug as saying that the security situation in Kosovo was "very
grave." Over 200,000 non-Albanian inhabitants have fled Kosovo
after the entry of international peacekeeping forces, he added. (

Iglesias, who is here to attend the IDB 40th anniversary

1999. Signs of recovery have been seen in Argentina and Brazil, he
said, expecting Brazil's economy to grow by 4 percent next year,
and over 3 percent for Argentina. (Argentina-IDB-Prospect)

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka Concerned by Indian Nationalists' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The victory of India's
nationalist alliance in the just-ended general election has raised
fears here over the giant neighbor's possible interference in the
Sri Lankan long-running war against the separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
India's ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the
Bharatiya Janatha Party (BJP) has won nearly 300 seats in the
545-member Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, and BJP
leader Atal Behari Vajpayee is likely to be sworn in as prime
minister early next week for the third time in three years.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the same leaders being back in seats of power in New
Delhi, Sri Lanka has to develop a strategy that would prevent
assistance being extended to the LTTE," said the independent
English daily The Island in its editorial on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In south India's Tamil Nadu with its more than 55 million Tamil
population, the Dravida Munnetra Kazahagam (DMK) of Karunanidhi,
who once considered LTTE supreme leader Velupillai Prabhakaran as
"his son," has won the parliamentary poll and is a member of the
NDA.
</P>
<P>
"Anti-LTTE forces have been defeated in India in general and in
Tamil Nadu in particular," said a top leader of the Tamil United
Liberation Front (TULF), a Sri Lankan Tamil party opposing the
LTTE.
</P>
<P>
"The crucial difference between the present and the past is
that the BJP combine is now in power both in Tamil Nadu and the
center," said the leader, who feared that Tamil Nadu might not be
safe for anti-LTTE Tamil politicians now.
</P>
<P>
The Island's editorial said that the Indian central government
as well as Tamil Nadu leaders like Karunanidhi are the
"godfathers" of Sri Lankan terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Despite some statements by the last Vajpayee government that
the Indian policy towards Sri Lanka had not changed, it was
possible for those who wanted to extend a helping hand to Sri
Lankan Tamil rebels to do so, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka has got to impress upon the Indian leadership that
there are legal and moral obligations of India to help this
country in its fight to eradicate terrorism," it said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war fought between
the Sinhalese majority-dominated government and the LTTE
guerrillas who demand a homeland for minority Tamils in the
country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, usually branded by the Sri Lankan government as a
terrorist organization, has been banned in India and the United
States as well as at home due to its suicide bombings against
high-ranking officials, security forces and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ban in India, the LTTE rebels still get massive
support from India, especially from Tamil Nadu to enable it to
survive the government's military offensives, economic sanction
and diplomatic isolation, The Island claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, there are about 1,500 LTTE cadres in Tamil Nadu
indulging in various activities, including smuggling," said Suresh
Premachandran, leader of the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front (EPRLF), another Sri Lankan Tamil party opposing
the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
Given the BJP government's past record, Sri Lankan Tamils, most
of whom are tacit LTTE supporters, believe that the new Vajpayee
regime will not do anything against the Sri Lankan Tamil cause as
espoused by the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the anti-LTTE Tamils and the Sinhalese
majority fear that the new Indian government may be forced by its
pro-Lankan Tamil or pro-LTTE allies to continue to turn a blind
eye to the LTTE's activities in Tamil Nadu and in the sea between
the two countries, which inevitably will prolong the disastrous
civil war in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
George Fernandes, former Indian defense minister, had openly
declared his support for the LTTE when the last BJP-led government
of Vajpayee took office.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that he as defense minister had instructed the
chief of the Indian Navy not to intercept a ship carrying
armaments for the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
"What role he will play in the new government will have to be
watched very carefully," the paper's editorial warned, hinting
that Fernandes is likely to play a dominant role concerning Sri
Lanka's internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
There is also widespread apprehension here that a BJP-led
government in India could pressure Colombo to enter into talks
with the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has proposed unconditional talks with the Sri Lankan
government mediated by an active third party.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has ruled out any third party mediation
and insisted that the LTTE has to give up its demand for a
separate state and talks must be within a stipulated time-frame
and irrespective of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka should certainly try its best to have the best of
relations with New Delhi and now with Karunanidhi in Tamil Nadu,"
said editorial.
</P>
<P>
"But it should also remind India of the obligation of a big
power towards its smaller neighbors," it said, urging India to
follow its former Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's doctrine
that "India should do more for its neighbors than what they could
do for India."

<HEADLINE> Sight First China Action Benefits Cataract Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 cataract sufferers
in eight counties and cities in Yunnan Province in southwest China
will have their eyesight restored within 20 days, thanks to the
Sight First China Action.
</P>
<P>
Since the project was jointly launched by the China Disabled
Persons' Federation (CDPF) and the Lions Clubs International in
1997, over 920,000 patients throughout China have regained their
eyesight.
</P>
<P>
The project aims at conducting 1.75 million operations in the
1997-2001 period in China.
</P>
<P>
The Lions Clubs International provided 14 million U.S. dollars
for the project.
</P>
<P>
Cataract-related blindness has been preying upon some four
million Chinese in total, and 400,000 more people become new
cataract patients each year. However, only 200,000 operations
could be carried out annually, due to a lack of ophthalmic service
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Hardy Fink: China to Beat Russia for Men's Team Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The host country China will beat
Russia to capture their fourth consecutive men's team title at the
World Gymnastics Championships, a top official of the
International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) predicted here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hardy Fink, president of the men's technical committee in FIG,
believed that the men's team title will be decided between China
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, I would put apart the host team as the best,"
Fink said.
</P>
<P>
Warwick Fobes, head coach of the Australia men's team, greatly
supported Fink's impression, as saying "the Chinese are strong and
solid team. Everyone else stopped and watched hypnotized as soon
as the Chinese team have started performing on the apparatuses two
days ago."
</P>
<P>
As a former gymnast, Fink considered Lu Yufu of China, Alexei
Bondarenko of Russia and Ivan Ivankov of Belarus are the hot
favorites in the all-around competition.
</P>
<P>
"Lu has a superb physical condition as well as his difficult
routines," the FIG official said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to rehabilitate Street Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has launched a campaign
to take the street children under the age of 13 to free
rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
Children are often seen scurrying in and out of traffic and
selling Chiclets and lottery tickets, a painful scene in a country
that "believes in freedom and respect for the human being," the
Daily Star newspaper Saturday quoted Minister of Labour and Social
Affairs Michel Moussa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry started working on the project on Monday and has
been sending these street children to a shelter and rehabilitation
center.
</P>
<P>
The project will cover Greater Beirut first and then a broader
target area in the future.
</P>
<P>
The parents of the "street children" would be punished
accordingly for keeping their children out of school, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon signed an international treaty to protect children in
1991.
</P>
<P>
A 1998 decree made education in Lebanon mandatory and free for
all children up to the age of 12. In 1996, the minimum working
age was raised from eight to 13.
</P>
<P>
A study on children between 1993 and 1998 released by the
ministry noted that more than 25,000 children between the ages of
six and 18 have never attended school and over 443,000 children
between the ages of 10 and 17 are working.

<HEADLINE> US Playing Religious Card: UAE Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A United Arab Emirates
newspaper Saturday lashed out at the United States for playing the
religious card to repress some governments as a way to impose
its hegemony on the world.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has recently drawn up a new list of
countries, blaming them of exercising religious persecution. Its
purpose is to use religion as an excuse to impose sanctions on
countries that it dislikes," said the Dubai-based Al Bayan daily.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has already listed a number of countries which
Washington accuses of encouraging terrorism, and now it produced a
new list of countries which it blames for practicing religious
persecution, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
"Washington's classification of countries, especially from
the third world, is expected to increase as long as some
countries oppose the policies of the U.S. and do not serve its
interests," the paper commented.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intends to impose sanctions on some regimes, to
isolate them politically and economically, so as to realize the
principle of the so-called new world order and allow it to impose
its hegemony on the world, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Religious, mental and ethnic persecutions are rejected by all
religions and laws as they contradict the basic human norms which
call for co-existence between people.
</P>
<P>
However, playing this card to repress some governments is
suspicious behavior directed at some countries and not others,
the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
"Washington pursues its policy of imposing sanctions against
countries and now and then it creates new laws to follow this
path. It normally starts through diplomatic measures and economic
sanctions and ends with military action," the paper concluded.

SHIJIAZHUANG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The four-day 99' China
Foreign Trade and Economic Fair opened in this capital of north
China's Hebei Province today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chunfeng, chairman of the Hebei branch of the China
Chamber of International Commerce, one of the two organizers, said
that this event is the first one sponsored by non-governmental
economic organizations, which will help lessen the government's
financial burden, and at the same time conform to the demands of
market economic development.
</P>
<P>
The other organizer, the provincial branch of the China Council
for the Promotion of International Trade, chose over 300
competitive projects in the province for foreign investment prior
to the fair.
</P>
<P>
And its great efforts in informing foreign chambers of commerce
and getting feedback from them by means of fax and launching
websites on the Internet have inspired the enthusiasm of overseas
firms.
</P>
<P>
Organizers say that over 300 foreign businessmen from over 40
countries have attended the fair, involving agriculture, gardening,
water conservancy, environmental protection, light industry,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, building materials, and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Governmental departments used to be the main organizers of
trade fairs and enterprises in a passive position in such
activities. The reform in the government institutions and their
functions in the past few years has enabled the enterprises to
play a bigger role in conducting economic cooperation with
overseas firms.

Lhasa, October 9 (Xinhua)-- Construction of the first
ophthalmic center has been completed recently in Lhasa, capital of
China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Under the sponsorship of the Seva Foundation of the United
States and the Nepal Eye Program, the Aid-Tibet Fund and the Lhasa
Health Bureau began to construct the ophthalmic center early this
year, at a cost of 3.3 million yuan (about 380,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Because of the strong ultraviolet radiation on the Tibet
Plateau, 2.8 percent of Tibetans have caught cataract or other eye
diseases. In China's plain areas, the ratio falls to only half of
that figure, statistics of a latest general survey shows.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Reports Good Autumn Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
in northwest China expects to harvest 2.1 billion kg of grain
during autumn harvesting period this year, despite of a long-term
dry spell.
</P>
<P>
Plus summer grain output, the region is to get in 2.94 billion
kg of grain this year, similar to the record output of 1998, said
a regional agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers opened up 1,300 ha of wasteland this year,
bringing the region's total sowing acreage to 800,000 ha. Nearly
90 percent of the land was sown with high grade wheat and rice
strains.
</P>
<P>
Another major reason for the good grain harvest was
popularization of 11 major modern agro-technology schemes under
the guidance of over 1,000 agro-technicians, the official said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the acreage interplanted wheat with maize expanded
to 66,000 ha this year, 8,000 ha more than last year's figure.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Volleyballer to be Fined for Breaking Arm in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A key player of the Chinese
women's national volleyball team is to be fined for breaking her
right arm in a motorcycle accident, the Chinese volleyball
authorities said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gao Shenyang, General Secretary of the Chinese Volleyball
Association, told Xinhua that Li Yan's injury has greatly dampened
the chance for China to qualify for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.
But Gao declined to say how much Li would be fined.
</P>
<P>
Li, who plays libero in the squad, was hurled from the back
seat of the motorcycle when her rider made a turn for the accident
on September 30 in her hometown Fuzhou, capital city of Fujian
Province in the southeastern China.
</P>
<P>
Gao said Li, who broke her lower arm near the wrist, was surely
out of the World Cup competition to begin on November 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Only the top three finishers at the World Cup will be
guaranteed automatic berths in the next year's Sydney Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
To battle for the remaining places for the Olympics, other
teams have to go through the later continental qualification
tournaments, and only the winner of each continent is eligible for
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it was an accident. But it could have been avoided from
happening if Li Yan had paid more attention to her safety. She
should know that the Chinese women's national volleyball team had
been famous for its tradition of emphasizing grouplism", said Gao.
</P>
<P>
China finished third at the last World Cup under former coach
Lang Ping, a household known name in China, who quitted for health
reason earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Li Yan who made her international debut in 1994 as a powerful
wing spiker, has been playing the libero position after Hu Jin
succeeded Lang Ping in April as the new coach.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Charring Wood Area Found in Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Largest area of
charring wood has recently been discovered at the western slope of
the Changbai Mountains Natural Reserve, in northeast China's Jilin
Province.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that it has been the first time to find the
trace of a volcano eruption about 1,000 years ago in the Changbai
Mountains area.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiang, a professor from the Geological Department of the
Changchun Scientific and Technological University, said that
charring wood used to be found at the site, but such a large area
is rare.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the Changbai Mountains is the largest volcanism
area in east Asia, and scientific research shows that there was an
eruption around 1,000 years ago, with 3 billion tons of ejecta.
And, the charring wood was then formed from the ancient forest in
the area, and it was buried under the five-meter deep pozzolana
after being burned by the lava.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that the charring wood above the ground is
some four meters high, and about 60 meters wide, with a meter of
soil covering and some plants on it.
</P>
<P>
They added that the discovery will benefit the comprehensive
study of meteorology, geology, and geognosy, and the area will be
an ideal site for the research of energy, environment, natural
disaster and global evolution.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Women Victims Marginalized in Justice: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The gender insensitivity of
legal authorities during legal proceedings have marginalized women
victims from resorting to judicial institutions for justice in
Nepal, the Kathmandu Post quoted a report as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said this was a finding of a study on impact of
corruption in criminal justice system on women conducted by the
Institute of Legal Research and Resources (ILRR).
</P>
<P>
The research focused on cases of trafficking and rapes were
carried out in three districts of Nepal -- Kathmandu, Nuwakot and
Sindhupalchok.
</P>
<P>
Research coordinator Yubaraj Sangroula said at a program on
discussion of the research finding Friday that the delivery of
unfair justice depended mainly on the insufficient evidence,
insensitivity of the concerned officers to victims, difficulties
faced by women during the interrogation, deep-seated fears in
victims of consequent social humiliation and gender insensitive
procedures of criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, three percent of the respondents said
the prejudiced judgment was delivered due to weaker investigation
which resulted from corruption.

<HEADLINE> PAL, Lufthansa to Start Joint Cargo Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Airlines and
Lufthansa German Airlines hope to start a joint freighter service
between Manila and Frankfurt next month, with three flights a week
using the German airline's MD-11 aircraft, an official report said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, PAL and Lufthansa discussed the joint
freighter service between the two points, the official Philippine
News Agency said in a report.
</P>
<P>
It said that the joint service will give PAL a presence in the
lucrative European cargo market for the first time in over a year.
</P>
<P>
PAL last carried cargo to Europe in June 1998, when it was
forced to suspend regular services to Frankfurt, Paris and London
in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed bloc spa!.!/ce agreement, the report said, PAL
will buy a space allocation on Lufthansa's cargo flights between
Manila and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The Lufthansa bloc space deal allows PAL to gain a toehold in
the rapidly growing cargo market to Europe, it said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Philippines has become a favored
manufacturing and assembly base for European high-technology
firms, such as Siemens of Germany, Alcatel of France, ABB of
Sweden and Cable &AMP; Wireless of the United Kingdom, fueling a brisk
cargo trade to the continent.
</P>
<P>
The planned joint freighter service between PAL and Lufthansa
is a direct result of the new bilateral air services pact signed
in August by the Philippines and Germany, the agency said.

BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenichi Suzuki of Japan made a
solo run in the final 10 kilometers as he clinched the men's event
of the Beijing International Marathon here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Suzuki broke away from the leading pack at the 30 km mark,
breasting the tape in two hours 11 minutes and 33 seconds, well
outside his personal best of 2:10:47.
</P>
<P>
"I was confident that I could win the race before I came here,"
he said. "I've trained very hard. Today's chilly weather is
wonderful to me and the time is my third personal best."
</P>

Mogaka Rolade Boraya of Kenya finished second in 2:12:58 while
Ethiopia's Turbo Tumo won the third place in 2:13:42.
</P>
<P>
Boraya's second-place finish was really a big surprise since
this was just his first time to compete in a marathon.
</P>
<P>
"I had expected that it would be not bad to finish the race, "
he said. "It's just unbelievable to take the second place."
</P>
<P>
Boraya, who has trained under a South Korean coach since April,
said he can run much better next year.
</P>
<P>
"I think I can run two hours seven minutes next year," said the
Kenyan.
</P>
<P>
Tumo led the field for nearly 30 kilometers and appeared a sure
winner, but he faltered after that and dropped behind.
</P>
<P>
"I suffered a cramp in the left leg because the head wind was
too cold," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese runners swept the top three places in the women's race,

<HEADLINE> LG's Investment in China Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua)-- LG Electronics Inc. of the
Republic of Korea is to increase its investment in China from 670
million U.S. dollars to two billion U.S. dollars by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The decision was prompted by LG's success in the Chinese market
over the past years, according to a source with the company.
</P>
<P>
LG has established 10 factories in China since it entered the
country at the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
These plants, based in Shanghai, Shenyang, Nanjing and some
other major Chinese cities, manufacture a wide range of electric
appliances, including TV sets, refrigerators, washing machines,
and air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
One of them, the LG Electronics (Tianjin) Appliance Co., Ltd.,
has become a major producer of air-conditioners and micro-wave
ovens in China.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, co-funded by LG and a local industrial
company with 240 million U.S. dollars, turns out 800,000 air-
conditioners, 1.6 million micro-wave ovens and millions of other
electric appliances annually.
</P>
<P>
Last year, LG Electronics (China) saw its sales revenue rise by
more than 30 percent over 1997. It sold 440 million U.S. dollars
of products in China and 250 million U.S. dollars of products
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Calls for Return of Stolen Icons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepali archaeologists called
for a concerted campaign to recover thousands of statues stolen
from the country over the past decades, the Kathmandu Post
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an interaction program called "Our Liability
Towards Stolen Heritage" on Friday, they urged the authorities
concerned and the general public to start an awareness campaign to
put "moral pressure on the Westerners who posses our idols."
</P>
<P>
According to the archaeologists, thousands of images were
stolen from different temples in and around the Kathmandu Valley
during the second half of this century. This trend is believed to
have picked up during the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"The images could be recovered and restored, if all of us join
hands for a united campaign to put pressure on the owners of the
stolen idols," said Kanak Mani Dicit, editor of the Himal Magazine
who recently made an investigation into the cases of the lost
statues.
</P>
<P>
His investigation brought about the first-ever voluntary
returning of three stolen statues by an American antique
collector.
</P>
<P>
Senior archaeologist Satya Joshi said most of the icons were
taken away by diplomats who were not subject to customs check-ups
while leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that lack of heritage and cultural protection awareness
among the authorities concerned and the common people are to be
blamed for the losses.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists believed that international treaties which
lay out the principles for the restitution of stolen art pieces
will help them in the recovery campaign.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Informal Trade With India Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's annual informal trade
volume with India have been on the increase in the last 12 years,
the Dhaka-based English newspaper The Financial Express reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources in the customs as saying that a
responsive consumers' markets among a population of over 120
million and the porous border are the major factors encouraging
informal trade with India.
</P>
<P>
Although there are no statistics or records of informal trade,
evidences suggest that Bangladesh's informal trade volume with
India is more than double their formal trade. The annual formal
import from India is about 20 billion to 25 billion Taka (424.63
million to 530.79 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Goods coming into Bangladesh from India are mostly essential
commodities and drugs. These goods are quickly absorbed in the
local market. Thus it is almost difficult to trace even if raids
are conducted one or two days after the arrival of goods.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh rifles are manning about 500 border posts along the
5,000-kilometer Bangladesh-India border.
</P>
<P>
But to maintain an effective surveillance watch on the long
border, a minimum of 1,200 border posts need to be set up and the
strength at every post should be raised to counter moves on the
Indian side to push goods into the Bangladeshi territory.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Home Ministry source as saying that taking
the fullest advantage of the pores, joint syndicates of traders on
either side of the border have been operating in a very systematic
manner.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Fair to Open in South China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province is
expected to hold a real estate fair in Haikou, the provincial
capital, from November 29 to December 2.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 booths will be available and businessmen will be
informed on various of relevant state and local policies regarding
real estate, as well as on financial, banking, legal and
notarization services there, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that new building and decorative materials
from overseas will also be displayed at the fair and multiple
trading patterns including on-line transactions will be offered.
</P>
<P>
China has long accumulated stockpiles of open-market apartments,
and the problem is particularly serious in the island province of
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
In Hainan alone, some 50.6 billion yuan (6.1 billion US dollars)
has bogged down in the real estate sector because of unsold open-
market apartments, and postponed construction and land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the State Council approved a plan, under
which individual and institutional investors in good economic
standing were encouraged to buy real estate properties in Hainan,
China's newest special economic zone, with the support of a
mortgage loan policy introduced by the People's Bank of China (
PBOC), in an effort to slash the excessive supply of open-market
apartments in the island province.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants Myanmar Student Exiles Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kachadpai Burusapatana, secretary-general of the NSC, was
quoted as saying on Friday that all exiled Myanmar students in
Thailand were actually illegal immigrants but were granted
temporary stay on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
"But since some of them have caused trouble here, they should
all be sent to a third country," Kachadpai said, apparently
referring to last week's armed takeover of the Myanmar Embassy in
Bangkok by five Myanmar students.
</P>
<P>
Because of its proximity to Myanmar, he said, Thailand could
not afford to allow the exiled students to engage in political
activities against the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, there are about 2,700 exiled Myanmar
students under its care, with some 1,000 being housed at the
Meneeloy camp in Ratchaburi province and the rest scattered around
in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
But the NSC said about 1,700 Myanmar students are now under the
UNHCR care, and 900 students were still unaccounted for and
believed to be living illegally in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Kachadpai said the 900 Myanmar students must report to the
UNHCR for registration or face tough legal action as illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The NSC chief met UNHCR representative in Thailand Jahanshah
Assadi on Friday and discussed the future of the exiled Myanmar
students in Thailand.

<P>
GUIYANG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 200,000 people
from elsewhere in China have visited southwestern Guizhou Province
between September 30 and October 4, the National Day holidays, the
provincial tourism bureau has reported.
</P>

According to the bureau, most tourists came from Beijing,
Shanghai, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Guizhou now has set up a total of 1,200 scenic spots, including
the beautiful world-famous Huangguoshu waterfall.

The province has more than 40 star hotels, 82 travel services
and a large number of recreational centers, which have employed a
total of 50,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Ivankov: Just Do It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Weathering the ups and downs in
gymnastic career, Ivan Ivankov of Belarus has habitually fallen
silent with just one thing in mind: just do it.
</P>
<P>
What he will do?
</P>
<P>
Ivankov will attempt to make history at the Tianjin World
Championships which open here on Friday by becoming the first man
to ever win three world all-round titles.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from nowhere to win the title at the 1994 worlds,
Ivankov repeated his feat in 1997 but not without plenty of
struggle in between.
</P>
<P>
He stumbled falling victim to injuries due to over-competition
before he came back to win the European title in 1996, making him
an Olympic favorite.
</P>
<P>
But disaster struck just days before the Olympics when Ivankov'
s already-injured Achilles tendon snapped.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the often career-threatening injury did not dump his
fantasy for gymnastics as he struggled to repeat his second world
crown in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the formula for his success following so many
twists and turns, Ivankov said in a calm tone that people who are
successful will never think about the question because "They just
do their jobs".
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it was his love for gymnastics that pushed
him up through fat and thin, but gymnastics is not the whole part
of his life.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the whole part of my life, but it is a very
important part. The other part is education, family, my girlfriend,
my hobbies and my future plan," said Ivankov.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the future plan, the gymnast restored his just-do-
it attitude.
</P>
<P>
"I have future plan, but I will never talk about it, I just
think about it. If you talk too much, you could be destroyed,"
added Ivankov.
</P>
<P>
Though keeping to the pragmatic principle, the past injury was
still a nightmare to him.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to keep yourself at the top of the world. In our
life there are ups and downs and it is the same case with the
sport. So just try to be in best shape, that is what you need to
do."
</P>
<P>
After he missed the Atlanta Olympics, he has gasped after the
upcoming Olympics which is slated in Sydney next year.
</P>
<P>
"Because I had problems in the last Olympics, so I am eager for
the next Games. It is always my dream to compete in the Olympics,"
said Ivankov.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Peacekeepers Criticized for Failing to Keep Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations human rights
envoy to Yugoslavia on Friday night criticized the international
peacekeepers in Kosovo for failing to ensure safety for all
residents there in line with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The international peacekeepers have failed to make Kosovo a
safe and stabilized place, nor to prevent fresh ethnic cleansing
there, Jiri Dienstbier, U.N. special envoy on the human rights
situation in Yugoslavia, commented when winding up a one-week
working visit.
</P>
<P>
Dienstbier was quoted by the Yugoslav press agency Tanjug as
saying that the security situation in Kosovo was "very grave."
Over 200,000 non-Albanian inhabitants have fled Kosovo after the
entry of international peacekeeping forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
The international peacekeeping mission would fail should things
there remain unchanged, he told the press.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special envoy also condemned the "Kosovo Liberation
Army," an illegal Albanian armed group, for undermining peace and
sowing ethnic discord, which, according to him, has made the
living of ethnic Serbs in some areas in Kosovo like that of the
Jewish people under the Nazi rule during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy meanwhile called for an early end to the
sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, noting
that with 750,000 to one million refugees on its territory,
Yugoslavia is the country hosting most refugees in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Integrate Smart Card Technology Into Windows Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft said Friday that
it will integrate smart card technology into its Windows products
in a move to drive business and consumer adoption of the devices.
</P>
<P>
A smart card looks like a credit card and contains a crypto-
capable microprocessor, which enables the card to save data, such
as money, files or loyalty points. The cards can also make it
possible to use a digital signature to authenticate the user and
encrypt data.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of corporations will deploy smart cards for log-in
authentication within a year, according to Microsoft. "We see
smart cards exploding and becoming a key element in many scenarios,
" Microsoft chairman Bill Gates told a group of smart card
manufacturers, chip makers and developers in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Now Microsoft is working with companies to create a set of
familiar tools in Windows for smart cards to enable solutions that
can be easily integrated into existing computer environment.
</P>
<P>
A Microsoft smart card tool kit will begin shipping in the
first quarter of next year. Most Microsoft employees will use
smart cards at work by 2000, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts say the smart cards will face
competition from other technologies used for electronic payment.
USB (universal serial bus) tokens, for example, do the exact same
thing. USB is a hardware interface for low-speed peripherals such
as the keyboard, mouse, scanner, printer and telephone devices.

CARACAS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's international
reserves increased by 201 million U.S. dollars in a month until
October 7, to 14.143 billion U.S. dollars, the Venezuelan Central

</P>
<P>
So far this year, the international reserves have shrunk 835
million U.S. dollars. It was forecast that the reserves will
decline in the coming months of this year, due to the impending
repayment of about 1 billion U.S. dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela should pay some 4.7 billion U.S. dollars of interests
for foreign debt this year, according to the Finance Ministry.
</P>

Verona on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Giordani covered the 178.75 kilometers in 4 hours 22 minutes

Italy has dominated the under-23 category since it was
instituted in 1996, sweeping the road race medals that year and in
1998.
</P>
<P>
After Giordani made his key breakaway, three Italians moved to
the front of the main pack of cyclists who were close within six
seconds.

"I have very strong teammates. They helped me a lot. I really
have to thank every last one," Giordani said. "At the end, they
controlled the group to prevent attacks by others."

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo described on Friday the recent floods which left 240 dead
and 200,000 homeless in the country, as a "tragedy of the decade."
</P>
<P>
The floods caused by more than a week of relentless rain
inundated houses and crops, destroyed roads and cut telephone
communication and drinking water supply in several regions of the
central, eastern and southern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Puebla State, in the center of the country, was the most
affected by the rains and floods with 166 dead, followed by
Veracruz in the east, with 56 dead, according to the most recent
official data.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said during a visit to the city of Teziutlan in Puebla,
one of the most affected city by the natural disaster, that no
effort will be spared to assist the victims.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the injured have been taken care of,
shelters for the homeless have been set up, the bodies of the dead
are being dug out from mud, and a census is being taken to support
people to rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
The floods made it difficult to deliver assistance goods to
thousands of victims of the earthquake occurring in Oaxaca on
September 30 measuring 7.4 degrees on the Richter scale.

<HEADLINE> Asian, European Ministers To Meet On Trade, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Asian and European trade
ministers will discuss how to get rid of barriers to trade and
investment when they meet in German capital Berlin for two-day
talks over the weekend, EU officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
European Commission trade spokesman Anthony Gooch said Berlin
will be the last major conference of the trade ministers before
they meet in Seattle, where a new round of global trade talks set
to be launched at a ministerial meeting between November 30 and
December 3.
</P>
<P>
New European Union (EU) trade commissioner Pascal Lamy will
take the opportunity to meet Asian trade ministers and brief them
on Europe's position ahead of the so-called "Millennium Round" of
World Trade Organization (WTO) talks.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin gathering of Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) economic
ministers will "offer an important opportunity for alliance
building with ASEM partners in order to achieve a commitment to a
comprehensive round," Gooch told a daily news briefing in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
German Economic Minister Werner Mueler will host over 500
delegates from 15 EU member states and 10 Asian countries. The
economic and trade ministers will review progress on two action
plans launched by ASEM heads of government last year: one aimed to
facilitate trade by cutting red tape and the other to make it
easier for European companies to invest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will try to work towards making ASEM "a lot more
relevant to the business community both in Europe and Asia by
addressing this type of trade and investment obstacle", Gooch
said.
</P>
<P>
European and Asian leaders launched ASEM in 1996 to deepen
economic ties after realizing that Asian-American links had moved
ahead since the formation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) grouping in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
So far, ASEM comprises the 15 EU members and 10 Asian
countries: China, Japan, South Korea, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Has Swede Smell of Sucess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Keegan predicted that
England would reach the Euro 2000 play-offs on Saturday as he
declared: "Our fate is in the hands of a team worthy of living up
to our expectations."
</P>
<P>
That team is Sweden, with Keegan being forced to sit and watch
on television as Poland attempt to secure the point they need from
their final qualifying game in Stockholm to make it through at
England's expense.
</P>
<P>
Having stumbled ponderously through their qualifying group, the
England coach and his team are now powerless to decide their own
futures.
</P>
<P>
The country's immediate destiny now lies in the hands not of
Alan Shearer, Tony Adams and David Beckham but of the Premiership'
s supposed lesser-lights such as Magnus Hedman, Niclas
Alexandersson and Stefan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
Keegan was similarly unable to influence events on the infamous
day in 1973 when Poland qualified at England's expense for the
World Cup as he sat as an unused substitute on the Wembley bench
while the Poles secured a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
However, he remains inherently confident that even though the
national side have under-performed for far too long, they will
still be thrown a Euro 2000 lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Sweden may have nothing left to play for except pride - having
already won the group by the proverbial mile - and may also have
had problems in scoring along the way, with just eight goals in
their seven qualifying games so far.
</P>
<P>
However, Keegan argued: "If Sweden carry on doing what they
have done before in the group, then it will probably be enough.
</P>
<P>
"I see them finishing off the group in the right way. They have
been outstanding and, at Wembley, we saw a side with a lot of
resilience.
</P>
<P>
"They have proved they are a very, very good side. It's there in
the results they've had, both at home and away, as well as in the
way they've played," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- English soccer premiership
chairman Dave Richards has called for the top flight to be cut to
just 18 clubs.
</P>
<P>
The Sheffield Wednesday chief told The Express: "The Premier
League has to do what's right by football and we can't go on
playing the number of games we do
</P>
<P>
"I think we will go down to 18 clubs although I don't know how
long it will take for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
"I realise my own club could be one of those affected but I'm
taking an overall view of football."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday are currently bottom of the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United and Chelsea have already called for a change
to the present structure.
</P>
<P>
Richards also wants Uefa to review its two European club
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"There are too many clubs involved in the Champions League and
too many games. Even the clubs who are playing in it feel that's
the case. A compromise has to be found," he told the paper.
</P>
<P>
"The Uefa Cup does nothing for the fans. Our teams need to be
playing matches of a higher standard."
</P>
<P>
The chairman also revealed that the Premier League was
examining ways of tightening players' contracts to prevent them
walking out on clubs, and that a panel was set to watch videos of
games to try to solve current disciplinary problems.

<HEADLINE> Top Three Seeds Defeated in Quarters of Swiss Indoors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 8 (Xinhua)-- Top-ranked Andre Agassi, second-
seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov and third-seed Greg Rusedski all failed to
survive the quarterfinals as they crashed out of the one million
US dollars Swiss Indoors tennis tournament in Basel, Switzerland
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi lost the battle to 20th-ranked Karol Kucera 6-4, 7-5,
Kafelnikov suffered a similar defeat 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to long-time
nemesis Goran Ivanisevic, and Rusedski, the winner of last week's
Grand Slam Cup, squandered a one set lead to lose 2-6, 7-6 (7-4),
6-3 to fifth-seed Nikolas Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
"You can't win every week," said Agassi, the French and U.S.
Open champion. "Just because you lose doesn't mean you've lost
your intensity. You have some good days and some bad days."
</P>
<P>
However, defending champion Tim Henman sailed through to the
semifinal with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over home favorite Roger Federer.
</P>
<P>
It was evident from the start Kucera would be a tough challenge,
the Slovakian breaking to jump ahead 3-2 in the opening set, and
Agassi failed to hold his 4-1 advantage in the second set as
Kucera broke to get back on serve at 4-2 and again to take the
lead at 6-5.
</P>
<P>
"He played really well and had good speed," said Agassi, the
winner of four titles this year.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov was the second seeded player felled by Ivanisevic in
Basel, the Croat defeating eighth-seed Thomas Enquist in the
opening round.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski appeared poised to win his quarterfinal, easily taking
the first set, and storming to a 3-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
But Kiefer, the winner of three tournaments this season,
battled back to force the tiebreak. The 22-year-old German then
broke a visibly discouraged Rusedski to go up 4-2.
</P>
<P>
Kiefer will meet Kucera in the semifinals, while Ivanisevic
will play Henman.

<HEADLINE> Feature: New Yorkers to Enjoy Oriental Ballet Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- As the world is poised to greet
the upcoming new millennium, New Yorkers will have the rare
opportunities to have a taste of oriental flavor -- ballet
performance to illustrate the world in the eye of the Orientals.
</P>
<P>
Famous dancers from Japan, New Zealand and the United States
will perform "Songs of the Himalays," "Beyond the Mountains" and
"Yellow River" in November near the Time Square in New York, which
is near the Broadway Street, the showcase for the world-class
performing art, organizers announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Audience are expected to enjoy the songs of life, faith and
love from the Himalayas, whose peak is the highest in the world,
the ode of the Yellow River, which has long been regarded as the
Mother River of China.
</P>
<P>
The performance, part of activities in New York to greet the
next century, will show its unique character: the high-nose
bridged and blue-eyed Westerners will be performing what is typic
in the Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
Artistic director Rika Yu, who graduated from the prestigious
Beijing Academy of Dance, told Xinhua that the dancers really have
some difficulties in understanding the Chinese and Oriental
culture. However, that is the appealing to her because she wants
to have a try in this field.
</P>
<P>
"She is the first Chinese who introduces Oriental ballet dance
into the Broadway Street, and she is also the first Chinese artist
to employ famous Western dancers to perform what she creates,"
Kevin Yang, general manager of the performance, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Rika Yu is from the Oriental Ballet in Osaka, Japan. Combining
exquisite dance and magical songs, she created the ballet "Songs
of the Himalaya," and had it performed on May 18, 1997, with
overwhelming success in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Another ballet, "Beyond the Mountains," was awarded a prize in
the 1999 World Creative Dance Competition in Saitama, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Yu's artistic strength lies in her interpretation of Oriental
philosophy through dance," Yang said. "She intricately blends folk
dances to create a new vocabulary of dance, and her works give the
Western audience an enhanced understanding of the Asian way of
thinking."
</P>
<P>
The rehearsal is in full swing at the moment.

<TEXT>

<P>

higher Friday in hope for the positive corporate earnings in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 112.71 at
10,649.76. The blue chip index rose 376.76 points in the week.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The market turned higher this afternoon as investors shifted
their focus toward the third quarter earnings from concerns
about inflation and rushed into the market for bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, traders tried to determine whether the
unchanged unemployment rate at 4.2 percent in September signaled
the rising in inflation, leading to the fluctuating. While
leaving the interest rates alone on October 5, the Federal
Reserve warned that it will raise the rates if inflation is
picking up momentum.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 6.90 at 613.51. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 2.87 at 781.49 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 0.40 at 427.71.
</P>
<P>

the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,549 down, 1,442 up and 520
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 898.35 million shares from 801.84
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Africa Bomb Blast Suspect Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, a
suspect in last year's bombings of the United States Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania pleaded innocent in Manhattan federal court
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed, one of the six defendants now being held in the U.S.
on charges of planning attacks on Americans overseas, was earlier
flown to New York from South Africa, where he was arrested,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts in U.S. embassies on August 7, 1998, killed over
220 people and injured more than 4000, most of them in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi. At least three other suspects have been arraigned
in the U.S. court with nobody sentenced yet.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed, 26, believed to be a Tanzanian, was arrested early
this week in Cape Town. He fled to South Africa a few days after
the bombings, using a false name, according to reports from South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> EU Says Support China's WTO Entry With Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Friday that it supports China's effort for entering into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), the 134-member global trade watchdog,
but will keep certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
European Commission's trade spokesman Anthony Gooch said the
EU's attitude towards China's WTO entry is unchanged but should be
with terms. "We've said on many occasions that we welcome early
accession of China to the WTO but clearly that has to be on the
right terms. We won't be sacrificing content for time," he told a
daily news briefing in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng is expected to
meet EU commissioner Pascal Lamy when attending the annual
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Berlin, the German capital, over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Berlin will be the last major conference of European and Asian
trade ministers before they meet in Seattle, where a new round of
world trade talks is set to be launched between November 30 and
December 3, Gooch said. "It will offer an important opportunity
for alliance building with ASEM partners in order to achieve a
commitment to a comprehensive (trade) round," he added.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the ASEM's host, also supports China's WTO entry, but
German economic ministry said its minister Werner Mueller would be
looking for Beijing to loosen import restrictions to help reduce
Germany's 6-billion-U.S.-dollar bilateral trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> NZ's Annual Trade Deficit Reaches 1b U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders spent 1.9
billion NZ dollars (about one billion U.S. dollars) more on
imports than exporters earned in the year from September 1998 to
August 1999, the biggest annual trade deficit on New Zealand's
record.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand Saturday said in a media release that
the shortfall between exports and imports in August was 433
million NZ dollars (225 million U.S. dollars), more than double
the average for the month in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The trend in New Zealand's merchandise trade balance has
declined in the past 11 months, as imports have been growing
faster than exports.
</P>
<P>
But within the grim figures there are signs of life in exports,
which rose 7.6 percent in August, compared with the same month of
the previous year. New Zealand's exports in August were worth 1.8
billion NZ dollars (936 million U.S. dollars). Its exports in July
were over 8 percent up on the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Many of the primary commodity areas such as meat, forestry and
fish are displaying renewed growth after weakness in the second
quarter of this year. And New Zealand's manufactured exports also
seem to be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand exports for the year from September 1998 to August
1999 were up 3.5 percent, while its imports rocketed by 11
percent.
