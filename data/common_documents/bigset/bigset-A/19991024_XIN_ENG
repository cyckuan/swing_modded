<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa met on Saturday with visiting Italian Minister of Foreign
Trade Piero Fassino and discussed with him issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Moussa said the talks
covered means of boosting bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, the scope of Egypt's economic reform and the coming
World Trade Organization conference to be held in the United
States next month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also reviewed the general situation in countries in
the Mediterranean basin and their partnership with the European
Union (EU) member states.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU members and 12 countries on the eastern and southern
Mediterranean coast, including Egypt, joined in a process kicked
off in 1995 to boost cooperation in the political, economic,
social and security fields.
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as "good and positive", Fassino, who
arrived here Friday leading an 80-member business delegation, said
it reflected the distinguished relations between Italy and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Italian official said his visit was aimed at further
promoting the bilateral relations, especially in the economic
domain.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and Italy stood at 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, with Egyptian exports at 877.5 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Italy is the largest importer of Egyptian products among the EU
states. Its imports from Egypt accounted for 27 percent of the
total annual EU's imports from the country in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
"We also discussed the question of the EU-Egyptian partnership
agreement," he said, adding that Rome supports the deal as it
would be beneficial to the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU reached the partnership agreement recently,
under which both sides will enhance their political and economic
relations, and Egyptian products will have freer access to the EU
market.

PANAMA CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. armed forces are
willing to act unilaterally or with Panama to defend the canal,
local press on Saturday quoted U.S. top Latin American officer as
saying.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made Friday by United States Army Southern
Command chief Charles Wilhelm during a hearing with a Senate

Wilhelm, whose headquarters were in Panama, recommended to
reinforce the military and intelligence cooperation with Panama to
update its capacity.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Welcomes U.N. Resolution on Sending Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government
Saturday welcomed a resolution by the United Nations Security
Council to send a peace keeping force of 6,000 to aid its peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Septimus Kai, spokesman for President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, said
the deployment was "an appropriate response to the needs of people
traumatized by years of war" and would "bring stability to our
country", according to reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted Friday unanimously for a move to
send a multinational force, which is to be called the Unamsil, to
the West African country with a mandate to disarm and demobilize
an estimated 45,000 ex- combatants from the eight-year long civil
war.
</P>
<P>
It will be the largest U.N. peacekeeping mission to Africa in
more than two years. The 6000-strong Unamsil force will initially
be deployed for six months and will work alongside the existing
Nigerian-led West Africa Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG), according to
the resolution by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerian government had earlier announced that it would
withdraw its troops form Sierra Leone by the end of this year,
despite U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's repeated calls for the
Nigerians to stay on.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 Nigerian soldiers now constitute the backbone of
the ECOMOG force, which had been fighting the rebels and keeping
Kabbah's government in power until the signing of the Lome peace
accord this July.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoting U.N. sources said that India and Kenya have
already offered to supply soldiers to the force. Britain, former
suzerain of Sierra Leone, and the United States are expected to
pay for much of the deployment.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of the peacekeeping operations, the
multinational force should be deployed in "30 to 60 days."

LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson on Saturday called on the province's
divided communities to raise a clamor for the stalled "Good
Friday" peace accord to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson made the remarks in Northern Ireland capital Belfast
after U.S. mediator George Mitchell adjourned talks on the future
of the accord until next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said he believed the pact would be implemented, but
the question was when.
</P>
<P>
He added it was up to the politicians to listen to those in
their communities and in their parties and heed their call for
implementation, that is what the people of Northern Ireland want.
</P>
<P>
Parties left the negotiations venue in Belfast without any sign
of a breakthrough in a dispute that has paralyzed the accord for
some 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson, took office two weeks ago, warned that the province
risked a resumption of violence if the peace accord signed in
April 1998 were not fully implemented.

<P>
ABU DHABI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and India will sign a long-awaited extradition treaty,
along with two other agreements, in New Delhi next week.
</P>
<P>
UAE Minister of Justice, Islamic Affairs and Awqaf Mohammed
Nakhira Al Dhahiri will go to the Indian capital next Monday on a
three-day visit to sign the agreements, the official WAM news
agency said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Besides the extradition treaty, the two countries will sign
the agreements on "Mutual Legal Assistance in Civil Matters" and
the "Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters."
</P>
<P>
The UAE and India have been trying to conclude an agreement on
extradition for several years, according to Indian ambassador to
the UAE, K. C. Singh.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has a large Indian expatriate population, and New
Delhi believes that a number of Indians involved in different
criminal activities are hiding in the emirates. To date, they
have been free from prosecution because of the lack of an
extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a number of Indian expatriates working in the UAE
fled to their native towns in India, leaving huge debts behind,
over the last many years, the ambassador said. These were the
reasons that prompted the two sides to ink the agreements, better
earlier than later.

The spokesman said the contracts were signed under the fifth
and sixth phases of the oil-for-food deal, with companies of
Spain, Russia, Italy, France, Egypt, China, Jordan, Turkey,
Vietnam, Belgium, India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The contracts were for the purchases of electricity spare
parts, medical and laboratory appliances, sprinklers, diesel
generators, irrigation pumps, cold storage equipment and havesters.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, in its sixth phase which expires
in November, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of oil every
six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies
for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
It argued that the oil-for-food deal has failed to alleviate
the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti has ordered a team of
French television channel France 2 to leave the country because
the latter tried to tarnish the image of Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
France 2 said on Saturday that its journalists have been
"firmly invited to quit the territory" by the Djibouti
authorities, and their films and cameras were seized.
</P>
<P>
The Djibouti authorities accused the French television channel
of "orchestrating a campaign of disinformation aimed at tarnishing
the image of Djibouti and harming the relations between the
governments of France and Djibouti."
</P>
<P>
France 2 said that the aim of its team's tour was to
investigate the whereabouts of a French aid for constructing port
facilities in Djibouti, raising suspicion that the aid has been
embezzled.
</P>
<P>
The Djibouti ministry of communications said that the report

<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. negotiator George Mitchell
announced on Saturday that the Northern Ireland peace talks had
been adjourned until next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The parties have agreed to continue the review with meetings
among themselves on Monday and Tuesday and I will return to meet
with them on Wednesday," he said in a statement in the Northern
Ireland capital of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said significant differences remained between
pro-British Unionists and Irish Republicans. But he said they were
making "a sincere and serious effort to bridge those differences.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the gravity of what is at stake, I believe it
justified to provide this brief additional time for further
discussion," the Reuters quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has struggled for seven weeks to broker a deal between
the parties deadlocked over guerrilla disarmament and creating new
governing structures.
</P>

While the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Sinn Fein accuse each
other of reneging on the accord, UUP leader David Trimble and Sinn

<HEADLINE> Arab Summit Likely in 2000: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has said the Arab countries may hold a summit in the year
2000, the country's Middle East News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's October weekly, Moussa said the
summit is unlikely to be convened in the remaining months of 1999
allowing for better preparation.
</P>
<P>
After the election of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in May,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called for an Arab summit to
forge united stance on the hoped-for revival of the Middle East
peace process, and seek ways of restoring Arab solidarity. But the
idea failed to materialize due to Arabs' differences over the
peace process and the issue of Iraq
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who is consulting the issue with some Arab leaders,
hopes that Arab leaders will gather together when the time is
suitable to discuss ways of facing up their challenges, Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process tops Egypt's agenda of foreign
affairs, he said, insisting that the Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations be based on the land-for-peace principle and
international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Jewish settlements represent a great source of trouble for the
peace process, and bad intentions (by Israel)," he said.
Settlement activities will poison the general environment of the
peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, plays a key role in mediating the Mideast peace
talks.

LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Irish President Mary McAleese
and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern Sunday attended a state funeral
for Ireland's former Premier Jack Lynch, who was in power when the
Northern Ireland troubles broke out in 1969.
</P>
<P>
Lynch was a leader of the Taoiseach, the party governing the
Republic of Ireland during the early years of the Northern Ireland
conflict.
</P>
<P>
He is credited by some historians with avoiding the possibility
of a new Irish civil war by rejecting pleas to send the Republic's
Army to defend Catholics in Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
He is the 13th person in the 77 years since the Republic of
Ireland's formation to be given a state funeral, a BBC report
reaching here in London said.
</P>
<P>
Jack Lynch's widow Mairin was joined at the funeral by
politicians from across the political divide and religious leaders
who came to pay their respect to the famous Irish statesman.
</P>
<P>
People lined many streets in Cork, his home city, as his body
arrived back Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Lynch, who died in a Dublin hospital Wednesday, aged 82, was
flown to Cork from the Irish capital, where his death was marked
by an inter-denominational service.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Parties See Glimmer of Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Northern Ireland's
rival parties said Sunday there was still some hope for the review
of the stalled peace process that will resume this week.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to put it any stronger than possibly a glimmer
of hope," Dermot Nesbitt, senior negotiator for the pro-British
Ulster Unionist Party, told BBC Television. "But you could say the
mood has changed. The overall ambience is better."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same program, Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of
the Irish Republican Army's political arm Sinn Fein, agreed the
atmosphere had lightened over the last few days of talks, chaired
by U.S. mediator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
He said Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams had talked directly to
UUP chief David Trimble, in stark contrast to negotiations that
led to last year's landmark Good Friday Agreement, when there were
no face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
"There is work in hand by the political parties, but it must be
completed. There is still time to meet the timetables of the Good
Friday Agreement," McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, a former top U.S. senator, agreed Saturday to return
for a final stab at reaching agreement, despite seven weeks of
review talks that did not break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, drafted in by Britain and Ireland to try to rescue
the stalled accord, signaled that he would put on the table fresh
ideas aimed at ending 19 months of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
Unionists refuse to share power in a cabinet with Sinn Fein
unless the IRA disarms. Sinn Fein says it cannot make deals on
behalf of the IRA. Each side accuses the other of reneging on the
accord.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he had decided to continue his talks drive "for a
brief period" but he warned against false optimism. "Significant
differences remain" between the parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nesbitt said the underlying problem remained to be resolved.
McLaughlin offered nothing new.
</P>
<P>
The politicians will continue their discussions Monday and
Tuesday before reconvening with Mitchell Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> LaRouche Vows to Change U.S. Politics if Elected President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic presidential
candidate Lyndon LaRouche has recently released a statement vowing
he would make a revolution in politics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was made at an internet press conference
on Oct. 13, was published in the latest edition of Executive
Intelligence Review magazine, released Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, LaRouche warned, "We're on the verge
of the collapse of the world financial system. There's nothing
like it in this century.... it is systematic, and therefore,
inevitable."
</P>
<P>
LaRouche said the United States and some other nations in the
world have built up "the biggest financial bubble in all history"
and the financial system is on the bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
He put forward a remedy to salvage the current financial
system: to have a number of nations gather together in an
emergency session "to declare the existing financial and monetary
system to be bankrupt" and "to use the model of Bretton Woods,
organized by late U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, to create a
new monetary system, with matching financial, trade, and related
agreement."
</P>
<P>
He envisaged that nations of Asia, such as China and India,
will have to play a much greater role in his proposed system than
was played under the old Bretton Woods system.
</P>
<P>
LaRouche also touched other issues at the press conference,
including U.S. relations with China and Russia, and nuclear
weapons policy.
</P>
<P>
LaRouche said he is opposed to any kind of interference in
China's internal affairs and to imposition of sanctions because of
U.S.-alleged "religious" suppression such as the actions on the
outlawed cult group "Falundafa."
</P>
<P>
"The idea that the United States should apply sanction to China
because the United States wishes to interfere in defense of some
cult group in China. This is not the basis for foreign policy," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Rare Bronze Relic Unearthed In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
found a piece of rare bronzeware which was made more than 3,000
thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
The relic was discovered in Yin Ruins of the late Shang Dynasty
(16th BC - 11th BC) in Anyang, central China's Henan Province,
where oracle bone inscriptions were first unearthed.
</P>
<P>
Experts said this is the first bronzeware of the kind ever
found. They theorized that it might have been used as a
sacrificial vessel, and said it would be helpful for studies of
the Shang Dynasty's sacrificial ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
The piece was unearthed in a residential area in southern Yin
Ruins, where the tomb of a nobleman from the Shang Dynasty is
located, said Meng Xianwu, head of the Henan Cultural Relics Team.
The item is 56 centimeters long, 26 centimeters in diameter and
weighs 15 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Remains of slaves who were buried alive and some funeral
objects were also found in the four-meter-long and three-meter-
wide ancient tomb, Meng said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The international community is
faced with many challenges ranging from serious humanitarian to
environmental disasters while moving into the next millennium,
Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt warned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There are many things that we should do, but whatever we do we
 should not tamper with the basic principles set forth in the
Charter of (United Nations)," said Khin Nyunt, First Secretary of
the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), in a
speech delivered at a ceremony marking the U.N. Day.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the foremost among numerous challenges is
development, he stressed the urgent need to strengthen the role of
the U.N. in the field of poverty alleviation and in promoting
international economic cooperation to support the member nations
in their efforts for economic progress and social development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the challenges in the area of environment, he said
the world has seen great economic prosperity but the benefits are
not equally shared by all countries.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth came at a price which is environmental
degradation, he added.

RIO DE JANEIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Alex Criville from Spain,
still suffering after breaking his wrist, took a motorcycling's
500cc world title on Sunday for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Riding on Honda, Criville finished sixth in the Brazilian Grand
Prix to take an unassailable lead in the championship. Norick Abe
of Japan won the race itself on a Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
Criville is the first Spaniard to win the title and the first
European since Italian Franco Uncini in 1982.

He benefitted from Michael Doohan's misfortune. The Australian
won the last five championships but rode only two races this
season because of injury.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Tadayuki Okada, the only man capable of catching the
Spaniard before Sunday's race, had needed a top two finish to

<HEADLINE> Maryland Teen Sentenced to 24 Years in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli court Sunday
sentenced Samuel Sheinbein, a U.S. teen, to 24 years in prison for
his role in the slaying and dismemberment of a teen-aged
acquaintance in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Judge Uri Goren of the Tel Aviv Magistrate Court read the
sentence, saying that the 24-year sentence will include the time
span that Sheinbein has already served since being arraigned in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Goren sentenced Sheinbein, who was 17 at the time of the 1997
killing, as an adult.
</P>
<P>
The sentence was not a surprise because lawyers for
Sheinbein and the Israeli prosecution had arrived at the plea
bargain in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The sentence brought to an end a case that caused tensions
between Israel and the United States, which has asked Sheinbein to
be tried in the United States on grounds that he committed the
killing in Maryland, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sheinbein fled to Israel with the help of his father within
days of the discovery of Alfred Tello's burned and dismembered
remains in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sheinbein sought refugee in Israel under a law that
prevented the extradition of Israeli citizens to foreign courts.
Sheinbein had only passing contact with Israel, but his father,
Saul, was born here.
</P>
<P>
Maryland authorities said in the past that they would not
pursue a capital case, but added that Sheinbein's sentence would
be tougher in his home state than in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Goren also ordered Sheinbein to undergo psychiatric treatment
while in prison.

<HEADLINE> Indian Border Force Delegation Arrives in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- An 11-member delegation of
India's Border Security Force (BSF) arrived here Sunday to hold
talks with Bangladesh's border force -- the Bangladesh Rifles
(BDR) on the border situation, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Major General Azizur Rahman, director general of the BDR, and
BSF chief E.N. Ram Mohan are leading their respective delegations
at the four-day talks beginning Monday, which are expected to
focus on the recent violent border incidents that claimed a number
of lives.
</P>
<P>
The border coordination conference takes place twice a year,
once in Dhaka and once in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi side is likely to reiterate its plea for
ratification of the 1974 bilateral border treaty by the Indian
side, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has already ratified the treaty, but India has not
done so on different pleas. Without India's ratification of the
treaty, border incidents were taking place occasionally, BDR
sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh and India, two neighboring countries sharing over
4,000 kilometers of common borders, have recently experienced a
series of border clashes, and the latest tension took place in the
Kurigram district, northwestern Bangladesh, when BSF personnel
kidnapped one Bangladeshi national into India, according to the
BSS.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 persons including three BDR members were killed and
50 others sustained bullet injuries by BSF firing during the past
one and half months, BDR sources said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has made repeated protests to the Indian authorities
about the attacks and intrusion of BSF personnel into the
Bangladeshi territory, the BSS said.

<P>
YANGON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General
Than Shwe Sunday called on the United Nations to endeavor for
maintaining international peace and security based on steadfast
adherence to the principles of the U.N. Charter despite some
dramatic events in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"We should therefore find ways and means to strengthen the role
of the U.N. and should take effective measures to that end," said
Than Shwe, Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, in his message on the occasion of the 54th anniversary of
the United Nations Day.
</P>
<P>
He called for recognizing the principles of sovereign equality
of all its members, peaceful settlement of disputes, refraining
from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity
or political independence of states and non-interference in
internal affairs of states, as the norms governing international
relations.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for the U.N. in the new millennium to
take the lead in economic and social development, which remains
the sound pillars for peace, stability and security of nations.
</P>
<P>
For international cooperation, he also stressed the need for it
be based on respect for nationally determined goals and priorities
laid down for the economic and social development of each nation,
saying that the right of each state to develop itself and to
cooperate with one another on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit as envisaged in the Charter should also be promoted.
</P>
<P>
He added that Myanmar firmly believes that development should
be recognized as the foremost and far-reaching task, since
sustained development is the most secure basis for enduring world
peace.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Knocks down Norris after Bell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson Saturday knocked
down Orlin Norris after the bell ended the first round and Norris
refused to come out for the second due to his knee twisted, said
reports in Las Vegas, the United States.
</P>
<P>
After being Knocked down in the first round, Norris said that
he had twisted his knee, which forced officials to rule the
scheduled 10-round bout a no contest, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson had been warned by referee Richard Steele in the first
round for hitting on the break.
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Steele ordered a break of a clinch and told
Tyson to stop punching. The bell rang and Tyson hit Norris with a
left hook clearly after the bell to send him down on his back.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the round, Steele deducted two points from
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
Norris got up shortly after the blow and returned to his corner.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was out for the beginning of the second round, but Norris
remained on his stool. Tyson stood in a neutral corner trying to
stay loose as Steele discussed with Marc Ratner, the executive
director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Norris's trainer Abel Sanchez rushed out into the ring and told
Steele, "my man needs time." Then Sanchez said Norris had twisted
his right knee and could not continue.
</P>
<P>
Steele conferred with Ratner again and the bout was declared a
no contest.
</P>
<P>
Ratner said the commission was withholding Tyson's 10 million U.
S. dollars, pending a review of a tape of the fight on Monday to
determine whether the late blow was intentional.
</P>
<P>
Tyson refused to accept any responsibility for the obviously
late punch and said Norris should "feel bad about himself. A real
fighter gets up. I could've quit after Buster Douglas, but I took
my beating like a man."
</P>
<P>
Norris said: "He just hit me after the bell. I just went down
the wrong way on my right knee."
</P>
<P>
Once again Tyson brought a controversial end to a fight. He was
disqualified for biting both ears of Evander Holyfield in the
third round of their 1997 fight and received a 3 million U.S.
dollars fine and had his license revoked for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
In his first fight back, he lost the first four rounds last
January against South African Frans Botha before knocking him out
with a perfect counter right hand to the head. But Tyson admitted
that in the first round of that fight he had tried to break Botha'
s arm by snapping it in a clinch.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's fight was Tyson's first since he got out of a
Maryland jail last May after serving 3-1/2 months for assault.
</P>
<P>
Dr Flip Homansky examined Norris, after the fight and was
quoted as saying that his right knee was swollen and "he was
definitely hurt."

<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua)-- During Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Japan in November, 1998, Chinese and Japanese
governments signed the outline for a plan to further develop
exchanges between young people in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, the first delegation of 100 Japanese youth arrived
in Beijing on a goodwill visit to China.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang and Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi Keizo each
have released letters of congratulation in honor of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of President Jiang's letter:
</P>
<P>
To the Chinese and Japanese young people participating in
exchange activities,
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Japanese governments signed the framework for a
cooperation plan on further developing exchange of young people
between China and Japan during my visit to Japan last year. The
first 100-member Japanese youth delegation has arrived in China
for a visit and exchange activities in this beautiful autumn
season. Please allow me to express my warm welcome to the visiting
Japanese young people.
</P>
<P>
Young people, who bear the historical responsibilities of
inheriting from the past and carrying on in the future, are the
hope of a nation. The hope of the Sino-Japanese friendship cause
rests with the young generations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
I sincerely hope that young people in the two countries will
conform to the historical trend of the times, cherish the hard-won
Sino-Japanese good-neighborly relations, take lessons from history
and face up to the future, enhance mutual exchanges, learn from
each other, deepen mutual understanding, strengthen friendship,
and develop cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This will help to jointly establish the friendly and
cooperative partnership devoted to peace and development between
the two countries, realize the grand goal of friendship between
the two peoples from generation to generation, and promote peace,
prosperity and advancement in Asia and the world at large.
</P>

The full text of Prime Minister Obuchi Keizo's letter reads as
follows:
</P>
<P>
Following President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan last year, I
visited China in July this year. It was acknowledged once again
that Japan and China would act together for the friendly and
cooperative partnership devoted to peace and development and
oriented toward the 21st century, in order to seek peace and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. Only with
support from every citizen, especially the younger generation, can
a relationship of this kind between states become closer.
</P>
<P>
In order to make these things happen, the two sides agreed,
during President Jiang's visit to Japan, to strive to realize the
exchange of visits of 15,000 young people between 1999 and 2003.
The visit to China by the Japanese youth delegation marks the
start of the exchange plan this year.
</P>
<P>
Our predecessors, with untiring effort, have established today'
s Japan-China relations that keep on developing. It is my belief
that you young people will shoulder the responsibilities of
establishing a more stable and further developed Japan-China
relationship in the next century. I sincerely hope that you will
bring into play your youthful strength and establish a Japan-China
relationship in which we act together for the purpose of peace and
development in the world.
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Japanese and Chinese young people will enhance
mutual exchanges in the charming autumn season, to make the China
tour pleasant and fulfilling.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Opposition Alliance Unveils Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's opposition
Barisan Alternatif (Alternative Front) Sunday unveiled its
manifesto entitled "Towards a Just Malaysia" for the next general
election which is yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
The Barisan Alternatif comprises four parties -- Democratic
Action Party (DAP), Islam Party Malaysia (PAS), Parti Keadilan
Nasional (National Justice Party) (Keadilan) and Parti Rakyat
(People's Party) Malaysia (PRM).
</P>
<P>
DAP Secretary-General and Parliament opposition leader Lim Kit
Siang, DAP Chairman Chen Man Hin, PAS President Fadzil Noor, PAS
Vice President Mustaffa Ali, Keadilan President Wan Azizah Wan
Ismail (wife of jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim)
and her Deputy Chandra Muzaffar, PRM President Syed Hussin Ali,
PRM Secretary-General Sanusi Othman and Vice President Rustam Sani
were present at the launching of the manifesto at a ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
In the manifesto, the Alliance side-stepped the PAS proposal to
set up an Islamic State in Malaysia in case that the opposition
won the general election.
</P>
<P>
Chandra, acting as the Alliance's spokesman, said at a news
conference later that "This manifesto represents the consensus of
all four parties. It does not include items not part of the
consensus."
</P>
<P>
Chandra also said the opposition pact would not use a common
symbol like the (ruling) Barisan Nasional (National Front) in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be possible at the moment... We may have a common
symbol in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto covers economic, social and judicial matters as
well as the alliance's stand on corruption, agriculture, the
administrative structure and education.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the opposition alliance was determined to deny the
Barisan Nasional coalition the two-thirds majority in Parliament
in the coming general election.

<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Gulf Air, the official carrier of Abu Dhabi, Bahrain,
Oman and Qatar, has opened an office in Beirut, the Daily Star
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"This office demonstrates our commitment to continue improving
the level of services to Beirut," said Sheikh Ahmed Alnayan,
president of the airline.
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of 80,000 Lebanese expatriates in the
United Arab Emirates and the enduring appeal of Lebanon for UAE
nationals in the summer had prompted Gulf Air to increase the
number of flights to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air is the first to resume flights to Beirut when
Lebanon's civil war ended in 1990. It now flies daily to Beirut
in winter and twice a day in summer.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran earned 268 million U.S. dollars from the exports
of hand-woven carpets in the first six months of the current
Iranian calendar year (started March 21), according to figures
from the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The export of hand-woven carpets in the first half of the year
rose by 27.6 percent in terms of weight and by 35.9 percent in
terms of value compared to the same period last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The occupancy rates of 5-star hotels in the Middle
East dropped to 61 percent in 1998, the lowest level since 1994,
said a survey by the Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) magazine.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covered 119 hotels with a total of 35,000
rooms in 12 countries, said the average cost of a 5-star hotel
room remained unchanged from 1997.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
Michael Moore said that he would submit to the WTO General Council
an application by the Arab League countries for admission to the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The matter will be left to member states to decide at the third
WTO ministerial conference at Seattle on November 29-30.
</P>
<P>
However, the problem isressing hope that member states will promptly
complete the drafting of such standards, the Egyptian daily Alam
Al Yom reported Sunday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. State Secretary Madeleine K. Albright denounced
Saturday recent Russian attacks on Chechnya as "deplorable and
ominous," markedly stepping up the Clinton administration's
criticism of Russia's efforts to eradicate terrorists in its
separatist southern region.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton on Saturday attacked Republicans'
initiatives on Social Security, charging that their approach would
do nothing to extend the life of the retirement program and
promising to submit his own plan to Congress this week to ensure
its solvency for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States Embassy in Moscow has sharply curtailed
the number of visas issued to Russians, particularly students and
scholars, despite Washington's avowed desire to spread Western
values in Russia.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel, isolated at the United Nations for 50 years, is very
close to securing a place in a regional group from which it can
compete for a Security Council seat and other positions, Israeli
and Western diplomats said this week.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Receives Message From Sudanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Sunday received a message from his Sudanese counterpart Omar
Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail during a meeting ealier in the day with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The message, whose contents were not disclosed, is believed to
dwell on bilateral ties and international efforts to help reach
national reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed the latest developments in the
efforts to seek ways of ending Sudan's civil war and setting a
stage for a dialog between the Sudanese government and the
opposition, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and another North African Arab country, Libya, proposed
in August a five-point peace plan calling for permanent cease-fire
in Sudan and holding a preparatory meeting on a comprehensive
peace conference for Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties have
accepted the initiative. But the Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), the major rebel force in the south, rejected the plan,
saying that it favored the role played by IGAD, an Eastern African
inter-governmental organization in mediating a solution to its war
with the government.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim parties and SPLA have formed an umbrella group, the
National Democratic Alliance. The political parties want to share
power with al-Bashir's Islamic government while SPLA has been
fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian
south.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Moussa and Ismail also dealt with ways of
promoting bilateral ties in various fields, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the neighbors soured in 1995 after Egypt
accused Sudan of masterminding an assassination attempt on Mubarak
in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia. Egypt also blamed Sudan for
harboring Islamic militants attempting to topple its secular
government and install a strict Islamic rule. Sudan has denied
both charges.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, exchanges of visits by senior officials
and the goodwill showed by both sides have substantially improved
the ties between the two Arab nations.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger On Sino-U.S. Relations And Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said here today that the strategic dialogue and
cooperation between the United States and China is in the
interests of all parties, especially the Asian countries, and that
any confrontation between the U.S. and China would be disastrous
for both nations.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at Qinghua University this afternoon, Kissinger
recalled Sino-U.S. relations over the past decades. He said that
though the Cold War has ended, the U.S. and China still share
enormous common interests despite the vast differences in their
histories, cultures and political systems. It is "important" for
the two nations to co-exist peacefully and cooperate with each
other, Kissinger noted.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the Taiwan issue in the U.S.-China relations,
Kissinger explained that many Americans do not really know the
background of the issue nor the fact that all the U.S. presidents
since Richard Nixon have recognized the "one China" policy and
that Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the United States use foreign policy for
domestic purposes, and try to put China into the position occupied
by the former Soviet Union, Kissinger said, citing the skillful
spin doctoring in Taiwan and the U.S. which he said has led to the
complication of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger attributed the current tensions between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits to the "excessive behavior of the Taiwan
leadership."

<P>
CHONGQING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's
preferential policies for midwest China's introduction of foreign
investment, added to the rich natural resources in the region, the
booming infrastructure development and environmental protection,
offer sound opportunities for the economic cooperation between
Chongqing and Canada.
</P>
<P>
This was the consensus reached by Chinese and Canadian
officials and scholars at a recent seminar on asset management and
economic development in China's midwest. The meeting was sponsored
by the Sun Life Insurance Company of Canada.
</P>
<P>
As the only directly-administered municipality in midwestern
China, Chongqing will bring in foreign funding for infrastructure,
hi-tech industry, agricultural resource development and
agricultural industrialization, upgrading of existing industrial
projects and the tertiary industry, said Zhao Gongqing, director
of the Planning Commission of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, Chongqing had established economic
cooperation ties with 140 countries and regions in the world, and
more than 20 top Fortune 500 companies have invested in the city.
</P>
<P>
Xue Wenqi, director of the Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Commission of Chongqing, said at the seminar that
foreign investors will enjoy special policies granted to the
midwest region and to the Chongqing by the central government, and
preferential policies offered by the city relating to investment
and other forms of cooperation. Overseas investors also will be
eligible for tax exemption, reduction and rebate.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Consulate in Chongqing Mary Boyd said that there is a
bright future for the cooperation between Canada and Chongqing,
and the Canadian government will encourage Canadian businesses to
invest in the city.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, senior executives from Sun Life also exchanged
views with Chinese insurance professionals on asset management.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1871, Sun Life is one of the largest life
insurance companies in the world with assets under management
reaching 160 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company has set up two representative offices in Beijing
and Chongqing, and has been approved by China to form a joint
venture life insurance company in the country.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rejects Marcoses' Claim to Surrendered Lots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Sunday that his government has rejected a bid by
heirs of the late President Ferdinand Marcos to reclaim some lots
surrendered to the government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, President Estrada said that
Chairman Magdangal Elma relayed the objection to the Marcoses'
representatives during a meeting last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Elma told them that once it's surrendered, it's
assured to be the government's property. And it cannot be given
back to them because it's already appropriated for the agrarian
reform program of the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Estrada and other government
officials have been meeting with representatives of the Marcos
family, supposedly to negotiate the recovery of the Marcos wealth.
</P>
<P>
Estrada denied that he is meeting with them, saying businessman
Gregorio Araneta, the designated spokesman of the Marcoses, sought
an audience with him last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They went to my office with their lawyers and I told them they
have to undergo the procedures," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Marcoses and their lawyers were claiming some
lots that have been surrendered, including one along Ortigas
Avenue, Manila.
</P>
<P>
But Elma rejected their claims, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations for the recovery of other Marcos assets
and properties are still going on.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Censures High Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo recently solicited measures to bring down the country's
high interest rate, saying that government can not succeed in
economic turnaround with an interest rate as high as 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express, a major Nigerian newspaper Sunday quoted the
president as saying at the closing ceremony of the 6th Nigerian
Economic Summit in Abuja on Friday that it was not easily
understandable how banks could be charging such a high interest
rate while still advocating a fully deregulated financial market.
</P>
<P>
It is only when credit becomes affordable that it could be
soured by farmers and small and medium scale enterprises, which
provide the basis for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his government's commitment, at the meeting,
to the provision of conducive environment for both local and
foreign investors. The president promised to ensure that
appropriate investment laws are in place, while fighting
corruption and crimes.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
Pervaiz Musharraf Sunday said his country places its firm belief
in the indispensable role of the United Nations in achieving an
environment of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"We place our firm belief in the indispensable role of the
United Nations for the achievement of an environment of peace and
security which would benefit the socio-economic development of the
human race," he said in a message to mark the 54th anniversary of
the founding of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the government and the people of Pakistan, General
Musharraf, who resumed the post of Chief Executive after a coup
earlier this month, said: "I extend warm congratulations to the
United Nations on its fifty fourth Anniversary and on the
commendable role it has been playing for global peace and
progress."
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's First Private Freight Train Runs On State-Owned Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's first private freight
train, which went into operation on September 28, has been running
smoothly on state-owned railways in Shandong Province, east China.
</P>
<P>
So far, the 35-carriage train has transported three loads of
limestone on the 98-km railway route from the city of Qingzhou to
Shouguang city in the province.
</P>
<P>
It is the first private train to travel the country's state-
owned railways since China's railway administrations lifted
restrictions on individual ownership of freighters, said Li
Bangqiu, director general of the Shandong Provincial
Administration for Local Railways.
</P>
<P>
And it's a welcome sight, he said, since the country's
inadequate supply of freight trains traveling the 60,000-plus
kilometers of railway lines has caused cargo to pile up at some
stations.
</P>
<P>
The train was purchased by Shandong residents Xi Chuanwu, who
owns 25 of the freight cars, and Shang Jiliang, who has the other
10.
</P>
<P>
Both Xi and Shang have been engaged in the trade of limestone
and alkali between Qingzhou, a major producer of limestone, and
Shouguang, which is home to the Haihua Group, a leading chemicals
producer.
</P>
<P>
Last year, when their business expanded, their goods began to
accumulate because of the freight car shortage.
</P>
<P>
"The railway is the main means of transport between Qingzhou
and Shouguang, but the state-owned carriage on this line couldn't
handle our transport plans," Xi said.
</P>
<P>
So this July, Xi and Shang bought themselves the freight cars
with 1.07 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The local railway administration has given enthusiastic support
to Xi and Shang by helping them with the overhauling of the
freight cars they bought in addition to other services needed. It
has also drafted special regulations to standardize the management
of the train in order to protect the owners' rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Xi said that their freight train has greatly increased their
business and sharpened their competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
The state railway sector has also benefited from the operation
of the private train, according to Li Bangqiu,the provincial top
railway official. For instance, he said, the Caomiao Railway
Station, the train's terminal in Qingzhou, is expected to gain 1.5
million yuan in revenue a year, or 50 percent more than last year,
by providing overhauling, loading, unloading and other services to
the privately-owned train.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Summit Not Likely to be Postponed: Nepali FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The 11th SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) summit will not be likely to
be postponed so far, Nepali Foreign Minister Ram Mahat said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"As of now, there is no likelihood that the summit will be
postponed, as there are no such indications from member states,"
Mahat told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The 11th SAARC summit is slated for November 26-28 in
Kathmandu. All the seven member states had agreed in September to
attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
But there were reports that the SAARC summit would be postponed
due to the political situation in Pakistan, where the civilian
government was dismissed by General Pervez Musharraf in a
bloodless military coup on October 12.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said the preparatory work is going on as usual and there
will be no changes to the schedule of the summit.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the Pakistani situation will cast shadows over
the forthcoming summit as predicted by some analysts, Mahat said
there are no indications so far that the summit will be affected.
</P>
<P>
This is because SAARC is a grouping for economic and social
development, not for political issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The present SAARC charter does not allow discussions of
bilateral and contentious issues at its summits.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said the predictions may come from a psychological
effect.
</P>
<P>
SAARC's Standing Committee comprising the foreign secretaries
of the member states is to be held on November 21-22, while the
Council of Ministers comprising the foreign ministers is to be
held on November 24-25, according to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in 1985 to promote economic and social
development among its member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is planning
to hold more anti-hunger telethons in the Philippines as part of
the activities lined up for World Food Day, the Philippine News
Agency quoted a U.N. official as reporting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the United Nations' efforts to halve world
hunger by 2015, said Sang Mu Lee, U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) representative to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"In the Philippines, we have three ongoing telethon projects
and we hope to implement more with the funds we could generate
this year," Sang said.
</P>
<P>
World Food Day celebrations kicked off on October 15 with a
ceremony at FAO headquarters and numerous telethon events
organized around the world.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, Sang said, the telethon global telecast
attracted some 500 million viewers from all continents.
</P>
<P>
Many of them, he said, have contributed to the fund, which goes
to support simple projects for farmers to produce food, improve
nutrition and generate incomes.
</P>
<P>
"By drawing attention to the problems and possibilities of the
youth, we sensitize policy and decision makers to renew priorities
and potential contribution of young people in food security
endeavors," Sang said.
</P>
<P>
Sang expressed the hope that with the telethons and other
related activities, World Food Day would serve as a benchmark in
the United Nations' goal to halve world hunger by 2015.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan, Palestine to Discuss Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Jordan are planning
to hold a meeting Wednesday in the West Bank city of Ramallah
with Palestinian officials to discuss the Palestinian refugee
issue and coordinate positions ahead of the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side will not attend the meeting, saying the
Israeli-Palestinian committees will discuss the refugee issue,
local daily The Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli Foreign Ministry
Spokeswoman Amira Dotan as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But other sources told the daily that Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is working on the Palestinian refugee issue and he is especially
interested in the ideas drawn up by Justice Minister Yossi Beilin
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
The two are apparently suggesting that Palestinian refugees,
who were expelled from their homes in the 1967 Middle East war, be
allowed to return to the Palestinian areas without Israel's
approval.
</P>
<P>
Israel refuses to allow Palestinian refugees to return to
their homes in Israel and wants a say in how many refugees will be
allowed to return to the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insists that Palestinians should be
allowed to return to their homes whether in Israel or the
Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side also wants Israel to compensate
Palestinian refugees who were forced to leave their homes in the
1948 Israeli-Arab war and do not want to return home in Israel,
and demands that Israel pay compensation to all refugees for their
sufferings and economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Figures issued by the Palestinian side indicated that the
number of Palestinian refugees totaled over 3 million, and most
of them are now staying in neighboring Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian refugee problem is one of the thorny issues to be
settled during the final-status talks. Other issues include the
status of Jerusalem, borders, Jewish settlements and water
resources.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Is as Dangerous as Mines: Cambodian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen said AIDS, like land mines, is one of the two dire problems
plaguing his country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made remarks in his address to the fifth
International Conference on AIDS in the Asia-Pacific held in Kuala
Lumpur from October 23 to 27. Cambodia sent more than 100
delegates from government ministries and NGOs to Kuala Lumpur to
participate the conference.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is as dangerous as mines. If it can expand its endless
growth, it means the end of the world," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
More than two decades of civil war and lingering unrest have
turned Cambodia into the one of the most heavily mined countries
in the world. There are estimated four to six million land mines
littered in Cambodian soil, which are now still killing and
maiming some 50 people every month.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Cambodia has one of the highest AIDS
infection rates in Asia. "It is estimated there are about 200,000
people infected by AIDS among Cambodia's population of 11.4
million," Hun Sen said in his statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mulls Intensifying Presence in Gulf: Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Washington is pondering how
to intensify its military presence in the Gulf, instead of
scaling back its forces in the region, said U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, speaking at a news conference before concluding his
one-day visit here, said he discussed with Kuwaiti officials ways
of bolstering bilateral ties, in military and security fields in
particular.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of sending more U.S. warplanes to Kuwait,
Cohen said "if necessary the U.S. will not hesitate on sending
more planes and supportive equipment as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior U.S. officials accompanying Cohen on his trip
were quoted as saying on Saturday that Washington is planning a
major expansion of its air bases in Kuwait to accommodate more
U.S. combat aircraft in the event of a crisis.
</P>
<P>
The project of 193 million U.S. dollars also calls for
upgrading an army base outside Kuwait City to house a permanent
headquarters for a heavy infantry brigade, they said.
</P>
<P>
"It's another way of demonstrating we'll be here on a
continuous basis," the U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, some 8,000 of around 26,000
U.S. military personnel in the region are based in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, Cohen described as "very appropriate" the
British-Dutch draft resolution that calls for a conditional
suspension of the international sanctions against Iraq to ease the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated that the U.S. policy on Iraq remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense secretary is currently on a eight-nation tour
in the Gulf and the Middle East. Besides Kuwait, he had already
visited Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He left here early Sunday to Jordan and will later visit
Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Sunday said he wishes to visit China as well as
nine ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries,
Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to meet with Japanese Emperor Akihito. From
Japan, the head of state will continue his working visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said his schedule will cover visits to Singapore,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines,
Vietnam and Brunei Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
He however has not yet made any plan to visit the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said Indonesia might carry out economic
contacts with Israel, without establishing diplomatic relations
(with the country) first.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia has not yet established diplomatic relations with
Israel. But, maybe, Indonesia will start opening economic contacts
or establishing an economic relationship with Israel," he told
participants of an international seminar entitled "Indonesia Next"
in Denpasar, capital of Bali province.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his working agenda, Wahid said the target of his
government is to increase the income of the majority Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
In the past the state's income was enjoyed more by big
companies and the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible to increase the state's income if the
people's income per capita is not raised in stages. To realize it,
the government intends to maximize the benefits of marine
resources, which are not being explored maximumly," he was quoted
by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
To explore and maintain marine resources, the government will
strengthen the Indonesian Navy's capability, he added.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Escalates Environmental Degradation In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) (C The Environmental Resource
Center for Southern Africa said environmental degradation and
resource depletion have escalated over the past three decades
mainly due to poverty in the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
The center said in a statement released here on Sunday poverty
was both a cause and consequence of environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative impacts of the rapid population growth coupled with
intensive agriculture and industrialization had contributed to
environmental degradation, the center said.
</P>
<P>
It said declining agricultural yields in the SADC region could
be attributed to water erosion which was responsible for about 15
percent of the land degradation.
</P>
<P>
It said air pollution had emerged as an environmental issue of
concern in most major cities of Africa as the continent had the
highest urbanization rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is to adopt city planning, development and
management approaches that conform to the principles of
sustainable urban growth," it said.

prosecution by the State.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are endangering the lives of the public by selling
expired drugs will be arrested," Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The campaign of "Medicines and Your Health" is aimed at
providing people with sufficient information to enable them to
make informed decisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been documented as the largest consumer of drugs and
yet there are press reports almost everyday on the shortage of
drugs in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Health Minister Nkandu Luo, the hospitals are
sharing drugs with unauthorized dealers who purchase them
illegally. Most of the illegal dealers sell expired medicines and
don't give proper guidance.
</P>
<P>
The government has ordered all illegal pharmacies operators in
the country to immediately close their business. It would be
criminal for health practitioners to allow unauthorized and
unqualified vendors to continue selling drugs, Mudondo said.

<HEADLINE> Belgian, Canadian Win Ironman Triathlon Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Luc Van Lierde of Belgium
and Lori Bowden of Canada triumphed respectively in the men's and
women's events in the 23rd Ironman Triathlon World Championships
in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, the United States on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Van Lierde, runner-up last year, clocked in 8 hours 17 minutes
and 17 seconds in the 4-kilometer swim, 180-kilometer bike race
and 42-kilometer marathon for the top men's honour by more than
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Finished 19th in the swim, the 30-year-old Belgian leapt
forward steadily under the often cloudy skies and was sixth after
the bike segment, beating defending champion Peter Reid of Canada
to second in 8:22:54 and Tim DeBoom of the United States finished
third.
</P>
<P>
Lori Bowden who gained the lead 16 kilometers into the run, won
the women's division in 9:13:02. Karen Smyers of the United
States, the 1995 women's winner, was second in 9:20:40, with
Fernanda Keller of Brazil, completing the event for the 12th time,
placed third for the fifth time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I feel about the same as last time," said Van Lierde, who set
the course record of 8:04:08 in his first Ironman three years ago.
"But the difference is that a few years ago, no one expected and I
didn't expect. But this year I worked very hard for it."
</P>
<P>
Bowden, who was sixth in 1996, was also never challenged after
assuming the lead, saying that "there is just so much difference
between first and second, with all the support we're getting out
there from the crowds, it's just really great."
</P>
<P>
A field of 1,470 professional and amateur athletes, 17 entrants
shy of last year's record, participated in the race at Kailua Pier.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Develop Six large Oil, Gas Fields in Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China is set to develop six oil
and gas fields at home and overseas with a production capacity of
50 million tons each by 2010, which expect to pump oil and gas
equivalent to 300 million tons of oil in total.
</P>
<P>
According to a source with the China National Petroleum Corp. (
CNPC), the six large oil and gas fields include four domestic ones
and two in other countries which will be cooperative projects with
foreign oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The domestic oil and gas fields are located in the basin
between the Songhua and Liaohe rivers in the northeast, the Bohai
Bay Basin and the western part of China, as well as gas fields in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, northwestern Shaanxi-Gansu-
Ningxia region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, whose
combined gas production capacity will reach 50 billion cubic
meters (equivalent to 50 million tons of oil).
</P>
<P>
From cooperative oil and gas fields overseas, China will on the
one hand obtain 50 million tons of oil in shares through joint
development and production, and on the other introduce some 50
billion cubic meters of natural gas from neighboring countries (
equivalent to 50 million tons of oil).

<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- "It thrills me to run a
business of my own and to realize my potential," said Tao Xiaoying
proudly. "I fulfilled my life by helping others."
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily Business Weekly, Tao is the
general manager of Santi Home Service (SHS), a name brand home
service company in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
province.
</P>
<P>
Tao gave up her tenured position at Jiangcheng Cultural Palace,
Hangzhou, in 1992 to set up a home service company with eight
classmates and friends.
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision after much struggle," said Tao.
</P>
<P>
"Providing home service then was much looked down upon. It was
thought unfit for pretty girls like me."
</P>
<P>
"But I knew, instinctively, that it was a promising trade
because people are becoming more affluent and busier," she said.
</P>
<P>
These include chores, moving houses, taking care of the aged,
baby-sitting and so on.
</P>
<P>
SHS is just one of China's more than 2,000 privately owned home
service companies.
</P>
<P>
Firms such as Beijing-based China Youth Home Service (CYHS) are
helping families with medical care, legal consulting and other
demanding activities.
</P>
<P>
Home services have a large market potential in the country.
Seventy percent of families contacted are willing to pay for home
services, according to a survey conducted by the National Bureau
of Statistics in seven cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The number of families wishing to use home services increased
by 20 percent in 1998, according to statistics from CYHS.
</P>
<P>
Home service companies have drawn the enthusiastic support of
the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Richard Bussiere general
manager of Beijing International Club Hotel, said he will never
forget September 29, 1999, as was reported by today's China Daily
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
After the conclusion of the Fortune Global Forum in Shanghai,
several multinational CEOs chose his hotel to reside in during the
celebration of New China's 50th founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"I stood in the lobby at the front door for a long time waiting
to welcome them. There were several times when three or four VIPs
arrived at the same time; I did not know who I should go to first.
It was difficult," Bussiere said. "But everything went well, and
everyone said they were extremely pleased with the hotel and with
their experience."
</P>
<P>
All of them came to Beijing to participate in the celebration
of the People's Republic of China and chose to stay at the same
hotel-- the Beijing International Club Hotel, although there is
only one Presidential Suite and all of them were deserved of such
a suite.
</P>
<P>
The VIPs who chose to reside at the hotel included the General
Motors CEO Richard Wagoner, Time Warner Inc CEO Gerald Levin, the
founder of CNN, Ted Turner, Dell Corp CEO Michael Dell, Boeing CEO
Philip Condit, Kodak CEO George Fisher, Nokia CEO Jorma Ollila and
Ford CEO Jac Nasser.
</P>
<P>
"It was a most wonderful opportunity for the hotel, for us to
gain tremendous exposure to very important business people around
the world," Bussiere said.
</P>
<P>
The corporate executives got to see Beijing at its best, the
city has never looked better -- beautiful and clean, with perfect
weather, he said. Everybody left here with a very positive
impression of China and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Because the hotel is relatively small, we are able to attend
to each person's individual needs, and react to whatever they
require very quickly. I think it was the level of services we
provided that made their stay very comfortable," Bussiere said.
</P>
<P>
This year, the hotel will finish with a 68 percent occupancy
rate and hope to achieve 71 percent next year, he said.

<HEADLINE> 9-Year Compulsory Education to Be Popularized in Tibet over Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
plans to make nine-year compulsory education universal and to
eliminate illiteracy basically among the young and middle-aged
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The goal has two phases, according to a report at a recent
regional conference on education. First, Tibet will increase its
six-year compulsory education and 90 percent of the school-age
children will be in school by 2003. By then, more than 35 percent
of the teenagers will have access to middle schools and the rate
of illiteracy among the young and middle-aged will be down to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
There will also be an effort to improve the quality of teachers.
</P>
<P>
Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, Tibet had
practically no modern schools and its illiteracy rate was as high
as 97 percent. It now has over 4,000 schools of various types, and
17 counties have popularized the six-year compulsory education,
involving 680,000 people, or 28 percent of the autonomous region's
population. And, 83.4 percent of the school-age children are now
in school. The illiteracy rate has been dropping every year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Presidential poll to Cost 5.6 Mln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Elections
Commissioner's Department (SLECD) has estimated that the
presidential election would cost them approximately 400 rupees
(5.6 million U.S. dollars), according to media sources here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga last Wednesday (
October 20) declared that the presidential polls will be held in
two to three months, at least 10 months ahead of the schedule -
November 2000.
</P>
<P>
The SLECD has estimated that the presidential election and the
parliamentary election next year would cost 5.6 million U.S.
dollars each, officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, they cannot guarantee that expenses will not go beyond
the estimates, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled presidential and parliamentary elections would
cost at least 110 million rupees (2.2 million U.S. dollars) over
the elections in 1994. But The SLECD had spent 691 million rupees
(14.1 million U.S. dollars for the parliamentary and presidential
elections.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Up by 0.56 Percentage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate shot
up by 0.56 percentage points to 2.51 percent for the week ended
October 9, due to steep 40 percent increase in diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, the annual rate of
inflation, based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI), rose to 2.51
percent compared to 1.95 percent in the previous week and 8.07
percent in the corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise is mainly on account of a 6.2 percent rise in
the index for fuel, power, light and lubricants following the 40
percent increase in diesel oil prices announced on October five.
</P>
<P>
The upward movement witnessed in inflation is likely to
continue in the coming weeks with the increased diesel prices
pushing up prices of vegetables and other essential commodities.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the inflation will rise by two to three
percentage points due to the diesel price in the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi National Airlines to Raise Fare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's national airlines,
Biman, has decided to raise the fare on its domestic routes
effective from October 28, The New Nation daily newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Initially, there will be a rise of 300 taka (six U.S. dollars)
in the fare on three routes on the average, a Biman source was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Passengers traveling from Dhaka to Cox's Bazar, the
southeastern tourist resort, will be required to pay 2,290 taka
(45.8 dollars) for one way instead of the present 1,950 taka (39
dollars), and the fare for Dhaka-Sylhet will be 1,490 taka (29.8
dollars) against the current 1,250 taka (25 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fare for Dhaka-Chittagong will increase to 1,790 taka (35.8
dollars) from 1,490 taka (29.8 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken against the backdrop of the
privatization process of the national airlines. The government
will privatize Biman by June next year by off-loading 49 percent
of its shares through a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Privatization would help the national carrier offset its
losses, Civil Aviation Minister Mosharraf Hossain said.
</P>
<P>
The airlines source said the national flag carrier does not
make profit from its domestic service, and its major revenue comes
from international flights.
</P>
<P>
Biman operates on 25 international destinations in 21 countries
and seven domestic destinations, carrying 367,000 passengers on
domestic routes and 866,600 on international routes in 1998,
according to the airlines' statistics.

<HEADLINE> Stage Set for Hitech Election Campaign in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main parties have
set the stage for an unprecedented high tech election campaign,
using state-of-the-art methods for the upcoming presidential
polls, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They said the ruling People's Alliance (PA) and the main
opposition United National Party (UNP) are preparing for a mammoth
election campaign, using all available modern information
technology for the polls which will take place by mid-January next
year.
</P>
<P>
PA media unit spokesman S. Sripathi said equipments such as
satellite gadgets which had never been used in Sri Lanka before
was brought down a few months ago and the staff were trained to
handle them.
</P>
<P>
He said they had equipment through which they could communicate
with some 300,000 people within three hours.
</P>
<P>
As a new concept in campaigning, President Chandrika
Kumaratunga had unofficially started her reelection campaign last
month when she held satellite interview from her residence in
Colombo with people in least developed remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNP is also flying high on hitech, setting up
wide screens at all elections rally and bring in other dimensions
of modern information technology.
</P>
<P>
UNP communications chief Irwin Weerakkody, an advertising
magnate, said they had adopted an electoral research system with
an regularly updated date base, the technology also never being
used before.
</P>
<P>
Though major parties are using hitech campaign methods, Sri
Lanka still does not have electronic press-button balloting
similar to what certain states in India used during the recent
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The electronic method provides for a quick count and also
prevents anything like vote rigging which is often alleged in Sri
Lankan elections.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Condemns International Tribunal's High Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Justice Minister
Zvonimir Separovic Saturday accused the International Criminal
Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague of exerting
pressure on his country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Croatian News Agency and television, Separovic
said he was very surprised and disappointed by what ICTY President
Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald said that the Croatian government did not
meet the tribunal's certain demands.
</P>
<P>
He said he was worried that the Hague tribunal would continue
being a tool to exert political pressure on Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In a Friday's annual report to the U.N. Assembly and the U.N.
Security Council, Mcdonald complained that Croatia did not
cooperate with the tribunal to extradite two war crimes suspects
during the period of July 1998-July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mladen Natetilic and Vinko Martinovic were wanted for alleged
crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva
Convention for atrocities against Bostonian Moslems during the
Moslem-Croat conflict in 1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his country was very dissatisfied with the
report, because it did not have enough evidence to prove Croatia's
non-cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Have "Lost Generation" Caused by Poverty: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- If the government fails to
bring about immediate improvements in the economy and raise the
quality of infants' nutrition and people's education, Indonesia
may have a "lost generation".
</P>
<P>
This was stated Saturday by Stephen J. Woodhouse, the UNICEF
(United Nations Children's Fund) representative for Indonesia and
Malaysia, in a discussion on political parties' visions on women
and children's development in Kupang, capital of East Nusa
Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
A lost generation is a real prospect for Indonesia as some 24
percent of its population or 50 million Indonesians are now living
under the poverty line, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most Indonesian children are suffering from
malnutrition. Hundreds of them have died because of severe
malnutrition (marasmus kwashiorkor) while 60 percent of pregnant
women and school children are suffering from anaemia.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has also recorded that 15 percent of babies were
born underweight and that 6.5 million children could possibly not
continue their studies for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
They may eventually become child workers or street children.
They may also get entrapped in prostitution or other types of
high-risk work.
</P>
<P>
"Considering these facts, Indonesia is facing the possibility
of having a lost generation," Woodhouse was quoted by the Antara
News Agency Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
A lost generation generally occurs because of poverty,
malnutrition, lack of education and lack of parental love which is
needed for children's psycho-social and mental development.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia can avert the prospect of having a lost generation if
it can improve the quality of its human resources starting from
the pre-natal stage, he added.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government to Resume Peace Talks With Top Guerrilla Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government will resume peace talks Sunday with the biggest
insurgent group in the country that has been locked in an armed
conflict for almost 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (
FARC) are scheduled to start the talks at 11:00 local time (16:00
GMT) in Uribe, Meta Department in central Colombia. The talks
will be the first with a defined agenda.
</P>
<P>
The government and the FARC will discuss the 12 points of the
so-called "Common Agenda of Negotiation for the Change Toward a
New Colombia."
</P>
<P>
Many organizations, such as the Citizens Movement for the Peace
and the Free Country Foundation, called for marches and rallies in
cities and towns across the country to demand an end to political
violence when the government and the FARC guerrillas meet.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's armed conflict, the oldest in Latin America, has
left some 400,000 dead. Authorities say that 200 kidnappings, 500
assassinations and five rebel occupations are registered every
month.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the talks had previously been scheduled for
October 7, but then postponed because of the FARC's rejection of
an international verification.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana, who took office in August
1998, has said that the search for peace in the country would be
one of the central goals of his government.
</P>
<P>
There are other rebel groups in the country besides the FARC,
including the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Popular
Liberation Army (EPL).
</P>
<P>
The government confirmed that it has contacts with the ELN.

MEXICO CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy in Mexico
is now 75 years, more than double that of 60 years ago, a report
of the National Population Council said Saturday.

<P>
Currently, one in every 20 Mexicans is 65 years of age or above,

The number of people over 65 will increase from 4 million in
1999 to 6.9 million in 2010, 17 million in 2030 and 32.4 million
in 2050. These figures mean that Mexico's population over 65 will
increase 7.4 times between 1999 and 2050, an absolute increase of
some 28 million people. Mexico's current population is 98.1
million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proportion of Mexicans under 15 is to drop from
the present one in every three to one in every seven by 2050.

<HEADLINE> Firms, Educators Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities and
enterprises should further cooperation to achieve common
prosperity, said representatives attending an international forum
on cooperation between firms and educators that was held recently
in north China's Tianjin municipality.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of the knowledge-based economy will inevitably
affect the joint development of both, so it is time for China to
look for ways to combine production, learning and research
effectively, Long Yongtu, Chinese vice-minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, was cited by today's Business Weekly as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Motivated by profits, enterprises will pursue technical
innovation, and cooperating with universities will be the best
shortcut to it," Long said.
</P>
<P>
Without cooperation with enterprises, on the other hand,
students, as the products of universities, will have no market,
which would reflect a failure on the part of their schools, Long
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 representatives from universities and enterprises,
including Bill Veggenhorn, vice-president of Motorola, and
Hiromitsu Ishi, president of Hitotsubashi University of Tokyo,
attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has already established Motorola University, which has
created a core curriculum concerning human resource development in
cooperation with Beijing University and Nankai University MBA
programs.
</P>
<P>
Each year Motorola University provides various training
programs for all 35,000 Motorola employees in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn experiences from other countries and develop
our own ways in cooperation between universities and enterprises
according to our actual conditions," Long said.

<HEADLINE> Poisoned Food Kills 26 School Children in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Milk tainted with phosphorated
poison killed at least 26 children in a public school of
Taucamarca, southeast of Peru, while 17 others were declared out
of danger in a hospital, the authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Presidency Minister Edgardo Mosqueira said investigations will
soon start to determine the causes and the responsible parties in
the case.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are looking into how the phosphorated poison
was mixed with the food -- milk and bread -- that the children ate
Friday during a breakfast for poor school children in the public
school.
</P>
<P>
The victims, including those who died, were three to 14 years
of age. A woman employee of the school was declared out of danger
by the doctors.
</P>
<P>
The 26 children who died of the poisoning will be buried this
Sunday in Taucamarca, 70 kilometers southeast of Cusco.
</P>
<P>
The fatal breakfast, which intoxicated some 50 minors, was
distributed under a government program called the Fund of
Compensation and Social Development.

<HEADLINE> Reform Set For China's Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to
restructure its power industry by dividing its power generating
plants and transmission grids into two independent systems.
</P>
<P>
China Daily Business Weekly reported today that the decision
aims to help foster power markets and establish a new pricing
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Power production and distribution were formerly established
without regard to market functions under the planned economy, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Competitive mechanisms are expected to be introduced among the
country's provincial subsidiaries next year.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weiguo, an official with the State Power Corporation of
China, was quoted as saying that the new power management system
will first be put into operation in Shanghai municipality, and
Shandong and Zhejiang provinces on January 1, next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the reform's rules, a province should have no less
than five to six independent power generators, each occupying no
more than 20 percent of the electricity market, or within one-
fifth of the province's total installed generating capacity, so
that monopolies can be curbed.
</P>
<P>
The generators will bid with each other for access to power
networks.
</P>
<P>
Transmission companies will purchase low-priced electricity and
sell it to consumers.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid market fluctuations, which could result from
the reform, some provincial subsidiaries will sign five-year
agreements with provincial power generators confirming that 80
percent of their generation will be purchased at last year's
prices so as to ensure the profits of the generators.
</P>
<P>
The rest will be priced completely in line with market
fluctuations. The interconnection of national and regional
networks is being planned.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Prompted with Longer Holidays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- As a result of longer vacations,
more Chinese toured the country during the National Day and
International Labor Day holidays, as was reported by today's
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The central government announced on September 22 that its
decision to extend public holidays for National Day on October 1
and International Labor Day on May 1 to three days each.
</P>
<P>
The two-day weekends before or after the public holidays are
often off to make holidays longer. Chinese citizens got seven days
off during the recent National Day holidays.
</P>
<P>
Longer holidays have brought unprecedented good fortune to the
tourism sector in China.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 visitors from overseas came to Beijing during
the National Day celebration, according to statistics from the
Beijing Bureau of Tourism (BBT).
</P>
<P>
The Beijing headquarters of China International Tourism Service
(CITS) alone received 15,000 overseas tourists from September 29
to October 8, said a spokesman with CITS.
</P>
<P>
They included 3,000 visitors from the United States, 2,500 from
Japan and 7,000 from Europe.
</P>
<P>
The CITS is one of China's three largest travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Most hotels along the Chang'an Avenue, which the National Day
parade passed, reported 100 percent occupancy.
</P>
<P>
Long before National Day, rooms that overlooked Chang'an
Avenue had already been booked at high prices, said a
representative from the Beijing Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Chinese residents' demand for long-distance and short-distance
trips increased sharply soon after the extended holiday was
announced.
</P>
<P>
Services for domestic travelers were in short supply in Beijing
during the week-long holiday, though there are 200 travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies in Guangzhou, Xi'an and Guangxi also failed to
satisfy consumer's large demand for travel across the country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as compared with the increase in tourism at home,
the number of Chinese tourists going abroad was insignificant.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's International Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's international
reserves increased by 414 million U.S. dollars between October 14
and 21 to 14.492 billion dollars, the Central Bank announced
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The oil price raise and the stability of the exchange market
have maintained the Central Bank reserves above 14 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank and the government said the international
reserves will decline continually in the next months as the
country has to service its debts.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has said that the country will pay some 4.
7 billion dollars for the debt servicing this year, or more than
20 percent of the government revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
The debt servicing next year, estimated at 6.8 billion dollars,
will account for 24 percent of the government revenue.

<HEADLINE> Italy Satisfied by FIA's Decision on Ferrari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Ferrari's real boss, Fiat honorary
chairman Gianni Agnelli voiced satisfaction with Saturday's
successful appeal by Ferrari against its disqualification in last
Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy the championship would now be decided on
the track. "I'm happy with this sentence. I'm happy because it is
proper recognition of Ferrari's victory in Malaysia and because
this way victory in the world championship is left up to the
verdict of a sporting challenge," said the former chairman of the
Italian car-maker, which owns Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
"I give my bets wishes to all the drivers. Now they will be
able to show who is the best on the track at Suzuka," he said.
</P>
<P>
At Ferrari's home base at Maranello near Modena, team president
Luca Cordero de Montezemolo voiced "great satisfaction" with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
He said Ferrari "appreciated the seriousness and high
professional level" of the FIA appeals panel.
</P>
<P>
"At this point all our energies are directed towards the
upcoming Grand Prix in Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's external relations chief Antonio Ghini said the
decision vindicated the work of team manager Jean Todt and the
Ferarri technicians, who were subjected to a barrage of criticism
after the race.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, Ferrari won its appeal against last Sunday
's disqualification from the Malaysian Grand Prix, where its one-
two victory appeared to put it back on track for winning the
Formula One drivers' and constructors' title.
</P>
<P>
Max Mosely, president of the International motor racing
association FIA, said the disqualification due to over-long
deflector panels had been quashed.

<HEADLINE> Latin America's Military Spending Doubles in Past Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Latin America's military
spending doubled from 13.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1990 to 26.5
billion in 1998, said a U.N. report released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There has not been a peace dividend during the decade that
followed the cold war," noted the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), a U.N.
branch with headquarters in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Military spending robbed resources from social and productive
development, leading to adverse economic repercussions, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The ECLAC urged the governments in Latin America to give more
transparency to their defense spending and to evaluate the
repercussion on the economic development of their countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization called for a coordinated reduction in military
spending, which, it said, would strengthen regional stability and
peace.
</P>
<P>
It added that whenever military spending increases in one
country, it would mean an arms race with another country.

<HEADLINE> Schett Enters Final of Kremlin Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Barbara Schett of
Austria beat fifth-seeded Dominique Van Roost of Belgium 7-5, 7-6
(8-6) on Saturday to earn her first Kremlin Cup final.
</P>
<P>
She will vie against fourth seed Nathalie Tauziat of France for
the top honour on Sunday as the latter dismissed Lisa Raymond of
the United States 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Schett, who made the semifinals here in 1996, trailed Van Roost
twice in the first and second sets but came back to earn her first
win over the Belgian after losing three previous matches.
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to be positive through the whole match," she said.
"I was losing 5-3 in the first set and 4-1 in the second, but
unlike our previous matches, I was mentally tough and didn't panic.
"
</P>
<P>
Van Roost broke her opponent in the seventh game and was
serving for the opening set at 5-4 before Schett made two breaks
to take the first set in 51 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, the 23-year-old Austrian again reeled off a
string of four consecutive games to lead 5-4 after trailing 1-4.
</P>
<P>
Three games later in the tiebreaker, Schett had the edge again
and was able to seal the match with a cross-court forehand.
</P>
<P>
With a 5-0 record against Raymond, Tauziat continued her
mastery over the 26-year-old American by sweeping her opponent in
just under an hour.
</P>
<P>
"We both play a similar game but I do everything better than
her," said Tauziat, "I serve better, I volley better and I read
her game much better than she does."

<HEADLINE> Taliban Offers to Negotiate with US on Osama Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Saturday said it was ready to talk with the United States
on the issue of the alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militia wants to resolve the thorny issue through
high-level negotiations, said Mulla Amir Khan Muttaqi, the top
Taliban official in charge of information.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is ready to talk with the
United States on the issue of Osama bin Laden," he said, adding
Kabul favored good relations with Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We want the issue of Osama bin Laden to be resolved in a way
in which the Islamic laws and Afghan culture are respected and the
United States' concerns are also completely satisfied," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said his militia would welcome it if Washington proposed a
negotiated settlement instead of "threats and pressure".
</P>
<P>
Accusing the Taliban of protecting Osama, the Saudi dissident
suspected to be involved in the bomb blasts at U.S. embassies in
East Africa last year, the United States imposed economic
sanctions on the militia and kept pressing it to extradite Osama.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Taliban to Take Action on Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Saturday that Afghanistan's Taliban movement should take action,
not just words, to hand over Saudi-born militant Osama bin Laden
who was accused of masterminding bomb attacks on American
embassies in Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
"More important than discussions is the actual delivery or
handing-over of bin Laden," State Department spokesman James
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to an offer from the Taliban to hold talks
with the United States to settle the dispute over bin Laden, who
was alleged to be hidden in Afghanistan by the Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
"We've had discussions before and they've been unwilling thus
far to do what now the international community is demanding they
do."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously last week to
impose aviation and financial sanctions on the Taliban unless
they hand over bin Laden by November 14.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official met Taliban representative Abdul
hakeem Mujahid last week on the issue and Assistant Secretary of
State Karl Inderfurth will do so again in Washington on Monday,
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to talk to them and discuss the bin Laden
case," Foley said. "But it's clear now that this is much more
than a bilateral issue between the United States and the Taliban
following the unanimous vote in the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Taliban Information and Culture Minister
Amir Khan Muttaqi said in a statement that his movement was
ready for talks with the United States "over the solution of
Osama's case."
</P>
<P>
"If the way is paved for substantial solution of the
difficulties instead of intimidation or pressure by the U.S.,
then the Afghans would warmly welcome it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Resume Peace Talks on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Colombian government
and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are
scheduled to resume peace talks on Sunday in the country's
southern town of Uribe.
</P>
<P>
Neither President Andres Pastrana, nor FARC top chief Manuel
Marulanda will be present, so the table will be installed by the
negotiators themselves.
</P>
<P>
These negotiators were appointed by the president of the
republic and the FARC secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The document signed by the two parties in La Machaca on May 6,
states that each party will have an equal number for joining the
peace talks and will not have more than 10 members.
</P>
<P>
They will work with the coordination of Government high
Commissioner for the Peace Victor G. Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
President Andres Pastrana said on June 15 when he installed in
an official way the negotiating team that the purpose is "to work
with a firm hand."
</P>
<P>
The talks had been delayed for months. The FARC, Latin
America's largest surviving rebel army, fiercely opposed the
creation of a so-called international verification commission and
suspended talks indefinitely in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
President Andres Patrana in mid-September backed down on
previous demands that international monitoring team should oversee
the talks aimed at ending the country's long-running war that has
claimed more than 35,000 lives in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Governor Arrives in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the U.S. state
of Illinois, George Ryan, arrived in Cuba Saturday for a five-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Ryan is the first U.S. governor to visit the island since the
triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The Illinois governor and his entourage were received at the
Havana Jose Marti International Airport by Cuban Popular Power
National Assembly president Ricardo Alarcon and Havana City Mayor
Conrado Martinez.
</P>
<P>
Ryan, a Republican, and his delegation of 45 important persons
from Illinois, will remain in Cuba until next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez announced
the visit last Thursday and described it as a growing rejection
within the U.S. society to the Washington blockade of the island.
</P>
<P>
Governor George Ryan received last Tuesday the Washington
permission to realize what he called "a humanitary mission to
Cuba."
</P>
<P>
Ryan'entourage includes officials, political and religious
leaders, businessmen, health and education experts, and 50 U.S.
journalists.
</P>
<P>
The Illinois governor had said in previous statements that "to
isolate Cuba is not among the Illinois interests, nor of the
United States."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this mission will announce the start of a new era
of cooperation and understanding among the people of our two
countries," said Ryan in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will hold meetings with Cuban authorities, and
will visit points of interest in this country.
</P>
<P>
The United States broke diplomatic relations with Cuba and
imposed in 1962 an economic embargo against the island. Both
nations maintain some exchanges in cultural and sports fields.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nyerere to Be Remembered Forever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Julius Nyerere, founding
President of Tanzania, was buried Saturday at his home village
Butiama near Lake Victoria, but his brilliant deeds will be
remembered forever by those alive.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, aged 77, died of leukemia in a London hospital on
October 14.
</P>
<P>
As one of the greatest leaders in Africa and even in the world,
he had devoted his whole life to the causes of Tanzania, Africa
and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In early 1960s, Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to win
independence from Britain, ending the misery of this East African
state under Western colonialists for more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate independence and to build a prosperous country,
Nyerere issued his well-known Arusha Declaration, calling on
Tanzanians in a bold way to practice the Ujaama socialism.
</P>
<P>
He advocated self-reliance and hard working in building a new
society characterized by equality and common rich to provide food,
water, house, education and medicine to every member of the
community.
</P>
<P>
Such a practice did not fully reach its initial targets due to
environments both at home and abroad. However, common Tanzanians
have from it enjoyed a sense of pride of being the master of their
own fate with dignity.
</P>
<P>
And this system has constructed a necessary economic structure
to lay the foundation for future development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who was universally praised for being upright, just
and simple in life, had never abused power for personal gains
during his 23-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
He stepped down in 1985 voluntarily, a rare case in the African
 continent, which has been plagued by bloody struggles for power.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere held that the reason behind the Western oppression of
Africa is that an individual African state is not strong enough,
thus it is necessary to form an African unity.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, he managed to unite Tanganyika and Zanzibar
to establish the United Republic of Tanzania in 1964.
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, he pushed for the establishment of the East
African Community in 1967, which consists of Tanzania and its
neighboring Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts by Nyerere and other African leaders, the
newly independent countries in the continent formed the
Organization of African Unity, a political body for the Africans
to determine their own affairs, in 1984 with Nyerere as Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Holding that it was meaningless for Tanzania's independence
without a total independence and liberation of her African
partners, Nyerere did all he could to support the Southern African
countries in their struggles for independence.
</P>
<P>
As a prominent statesman and activist, Nyerere, with a
worldwide vision, initiated the South Commission to promote a new
international political and economic order to eliminate the
prejudice by developed countries against the developing ones.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was a peace lover and maker. He not only maintained in
Tanzania a long peace enjoyed by everybody regardless of his
tribe, religion and sex, but also tried his best to end the
conflicts in other African states.
</P>
<P>
In his last two years, Nyerere, as an international facilitator,
managed to call together all the factions of Burundi to Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha to start the tortuous peace process.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, with a special affection for China, had visited the
ancient oriental nation for 14 times in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Under the co-efforts of Nyerere and veteran Chinese leaders
like late Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, Tanzania and
China established diplomatic relations in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The well-known 1860-kilometer long Tanzania-Zambia railway,
which was built with the help of the Chinese people, has been
regarded as a symbol of the solid friendship of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nyerere also helped other African countries
establish friendly relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was born to the family of a small tribe chief on April
13, 1922 and was revered in Tanzania as the Father of the Nation.
However, he himself preferred to be called as Mwalimu, or teacher
in Kiswahili, his first profession at his early thirties.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he was a well-read and learned teacher of the nation
who tried hard to enhance Tanzania's national unity to stand
abreast among the nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
Devoting all his life to emancipation and progress of the
mankind, Nyerere had won a worldwide respect and love. His funeral
was attended by more than 400 presidents, ministers and other VIPs
from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, a shinning star in the sky of the mankind history,
will inspire all the alive to realize his dream for a world of
democracy, equality, peace and freedom.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Buried in Home Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian founding
president Julius Nyerere was buried Saturday in his home village
Butiama where he was born 77 years ago.
</P>
<P>
As eight soldiers lowered his coffin into grave, a military
band played national anthem and artillery fired 21-gun salute. The
village, which is located some 40 kilometers from the Lake
Victoria town of Musoma, was packed with tens of thousands of
people.
</P>
<P>
The grave is located on an open space on a hillside, yards away
from Nyerere's residence, where he had lived in the years
following his retirement in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was laid to rest next to the graves of his parents,
which are surrounded by round mountain rocks and trees.
</P>
<P>
After the grave was sealed, Nyerere's widow Maria, dressed in
black, placed a floral wreath on the concrete slab, knelt and put
her head on it for a while.
</P>
<P>
Villagers wailed and called "Baba wa Taifa" or father of the
nation, while soldiers armed with guns lowered their heads in
mourning of Nyerere, who died on October 14 in a London hospital
after a long battle with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Zambian former President Kenneth Kaunda said he wished Nyerere
to "sleep in peace and rest in peace".
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who used to be a student of
Nyerere, said that the late leader had made very important
contributions to Tanzania as he brought independence to the nation
without bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Without Nyerere, Uganda would still be under the dictatorship
of Iddi Amin, who fled the country after losing a war with
Tanzania in late 1970s, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
stressed the importance of national unity and warned that the
government will take actions against those who attempt to split
the union that was established by Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa joined Nyerere's family and close friends in tossing
fistfuls of soil onto the coffin and laid a red wreath at the
grave.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim
Ahamed Salim, who is a Tanzanian national, also attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from the
British colonial rule in 1961 and masterminded its union with the
Indian Ocean isles of Zanzibar in 1964 to form the United Republic
of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He was the prime minister of his nation in 1961 and acted as
president in the following year and stepped down voluntarily in
1985.
</P>
<P>
The son of a Zanaki tribe chief, Nyerere was one of Africa's
most charismatic leaders and a champion of African liberation
movement during the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He united Tanzania's 120 tribes by encouraging Kiswahili as a
national language and was addressed as "Mwalimu" or "teacher"
throughout Africa for his intellect and integrity.
</P>
<P>
Masato Peter, a retired worker from the Ministry of Water, told
Xinhua that Nyerere's death has caused great pains among
Tanzanians because "he helped us in many fields, such as
education, political stability and peace."
</P>
<P>
"He did a lot in eliminating tribalism and in bringing all
Tanzanians to be one. Nowadays if you ask a Tanzanian what tribe
he belongs to, he might laugh at you, because he will say I'm a
Tanzanian," Masato said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's body was flown back from London to Tanzania on
Monday and laid in state until Thursday when a state funeral
service was held and attended by dozens of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
After the service, Nyerere's body was flown to Musoma and
driven to Butiama.
</P>
<P>
As his coffin approached Butiama Thursday evening, it started
to rain, soaking and almost freezing journalists who were among
the cortege.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, priests practiced a funeral mass for Nyerere
in a church in Butiama before his burial. Arch Bishop Anthony
Mayala praised Nyerere as a person who practised what he preached.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Plan to Use Social Security on Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday proposed to use Social Security surpluses to pay down the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said he will submit
legislation this week that would enact part of a Social Security
rescue plan he outlined early this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would earmark for baby boomers' retirement
benefits any government savings from using Social Security
surpluses to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first big step toward truly saving Social
Security. It will take the trust fund out beyond the life span of
the baby boom generation," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
According to this proposal, the U.S. is to pay down more than
3.1 trillion dollars in public debt over the next 15 years as
part of a plan that would make the country debt-free for the
first time since 1835.
</P>
<P>
The billions saved in interest payments to service the debt
would then be diverted to the Social Security Trust Fund to
ensure its solvency to 2050.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposal, which was first mentioned in his State of
the Union Address early this year, has failed to find support in
the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Republicans will not allow the president's desire for a
legacy to supersede the needs of the American people," said
Oklahoma Republican Representative J.C. Watts, chairman of the
House Republican Conference. "We will not let him raid the
Social Security Trust Fund."
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to next year's elections, each party is eager to
cast itself as a defender of the massive pension program for the
elderly and disabled.
