<HEADLINE> Abitibi Strike Expected to End This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The five-month strike at
Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., the world's largest newsprint producer,
could end this week after a tentative agreement was reached
between the company and its workers.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was struck at the weekend, is expected to
be voted on by the workers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The approval is likely to put an end to the strike that has
stopped production at 10 Abitibi mills in eastern Canada,
according to Monday's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have predicted that the end of the strike
will also depress newsprint prices.
</P>
<P>
More than half of newsprint production at Abitibi has been shut
down by the strike, offsetting downward pressure on prices caused
by weak demand in Asia, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Company and union officials refused to release details of the
tentative agreement. But sources told the paper that the deal
calls for a six-year contract and an annual wage increase of two
percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be less than what the union had been
seeking. The strike, which began on June 15, was over demands for
six percent pay increases this year as well as in 1999 and 2000.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia will continue giving
priority to the development of its relations with Germany, Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told visiting German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During their 40-minute meeting, Primakov confirmed that
Russian-German relations would be marked by continuity and were
not dependent on which government was in power.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the importance of Germany in Europe and the
world and closely analyze Germany's path to present prosperity
after the Second World War. We would like to study your experience
closer," said Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, in turn, expressed his agreement with the host,
saying, "The quality of German-Russian relations is high and
the new government of Germany is interested in continuity.
</P>
<P>
"But new additional concerns may appear too," he added.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder arrived here on Monday for a two-day official visit.
He is expected to meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday, as well as the chairmen of both chambers of parliament,
Gennady Seleznyov and Yegor Stroyev.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- "It is about time" to lift the
U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq, visiting Russian Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the latest Iraq-U.N. standoff, Sergeyev also
urged progress by the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in its
mission of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Seeing no hope to have the sanctions lifted, Iraq halted the
dealings with UNSCOM last month, prompting U.S. threats of
military strikes against it.
</P>
<P>
In an about-face, Iraq decided Saturday to resume cooperation
with UNSCOM and narrowly averted U.S. military strikes.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed on Iraq by the U.N. Security Council
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted until UNSCOM
certifies Iraq has destroyed its nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons as well as the long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said Russia is opposed to military solution to the
Iraqi issue, but it also criticizes Baghdad's halt of cooperation
with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit
after a trip to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said he conveyed a message during the meeting to
Mubarak from Russian President Boris Yeltsin on bilateral ties and
other issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The meeting touched on cooperation in the military and economic
fields, he said, adding his visit is in part aimed at preparations
for Yeltsin's visit to Egypt planned for early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Monday that France would refuse to support any
action to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"France does not support the tradition of doing what the United
States, in the name of the law which it gives itself, estimates
what it is possible to say and do," said Vedrine in an interview
with the Europe One television channel.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was not the tradition of French diplomacy to
interfere in the internal affairs of another nation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he pointed out that the level of patience of the
international community towards Iraq -- including those
sympathetic to the suffering of the Iraqi people -- diminished
each time Iraq stopped cooperation with the U.N. inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Suspends West Bank Troop Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Monday the suspension of troops
withdrawal from the West Bank unless the Palestinians cancel their
plans to announce a statehood next May.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in the Knesset (parliament) at the start of the
debate on the approval of the Wye River agreement signed with the
Palestinians under which Israel will withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after a continuous war of rhetoric in
which Israel and the Palestinians accuse each other of hindering
the implementation of the agreement signed in Washington last
month.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel should have begun to
withdraw its troops Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat renewed a vow on Sunday to declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, when the five-year interim
period under the Oslo accords expires, and warned Israel that "our
rifle is ready."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he does not intend to implement any withdrawal
"unless things are corrected in public."
</P>
<P>
He said his cabinet will convene on Wednesday to review the
suspension of the troops pullback.

<HEADLINE> UK Official Discloses Previous Strike Warning Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of the
United Kingdom confirmed Monday that Britain had sent a private
warning to Iraq last Thursday that it would carry out air strikes
unless Baghdad complied with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We did issue a warning to the Iraqis privately on Thursday
that this was going to happen, a very considerable strike," Prime
Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said Blair also planned to tell parliament on Monday
afternoon that if President Saddam Hussein obstructed the work of
U.N. weapons inspectors again "there will be a strike without
warning".
</P>
<P>
Before Baghdad promised to cooperate unconditionally with the
U.N. arms inspectors, Blair had given orders to Royal Air Force
Tornado jets stationed in Kuwait to prepar to strike Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Tornados would have joined U.S. bombers in a strike, but
President Clinton canceled the attack when he received word that
Saddam was backing down.
</P>
<P>
Blair is scheduled to speak with President Clinton again on
Monday afternoon to discuss the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Blair said Britain would maintain the force of
jet-bombers now stationed in Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Step Up Administrative Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Stepping up administrative
reform was considered as one of the major measures taken by the
government to achieve the targets of socio-economic development
set for 1999, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
VNA said "administrative reform is an issue of primary concern
of most national assembly deputies. They have said that this
reform is both slow and not yet efficient."
</P>
<P>
In his report at the current session of the National Assembly,
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said that public agencies have still
shown bureaucratic expressions in conducting public affairs and
that they should be responsible for their weaknesses and quickly
improve their conduct of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to Pham Si Danh, chief of the Office of the Ministry
of Finance, the ministry is focusing on reforming administrative
policies, the administrative apparatus, and administrative
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Do Que Luong, deputy governor of the state bank, said that the
aim of the administrative reform in the banking sector is to
ensure rapidity and convenience in dealing with customers and safe
protection of public funds.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city's authorities
are stepping up the administrative reform in many fields,
according to VNA.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Asia-Pacific regional
conference of red cross and red crescent societies opened here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 165 representatives in 44 delegations from
Asian-Pacific and Middle East countries, donor countries and
international organizations are attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference focuses discussions on ways, solutions and
resources to provide assistance in health care and education to
victims of natural calamities and the regional monetary-financial
crisis, particularly old people, disadvantaged children and
families having high numbers of jobless members.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, Vietnam's Vice State President
Nguyen Thi Binh said the international federation of red cross and
red crescent societies with its noble humanitarian target of all
for natural calamity victims, poor people and orphans, has made
great contributions to helping people in many countries including
Vietnam over the past years.

The economic crisis in the region has negatively affected
Vietnam's economy. Vietnam together with other regional countries
will still face many challenges and difficulties in 1999, Mrs.
Binh said.

She said Vietnam has to continue overcoming serious aftermath
left over by the wars, hence the country is striving to mobilize
internal strength, continue with the renovation process, and

<HEADLINE> Iran, Finland Agree on Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Finland have agreed on
stepping up their cooperation on regional and international
issues, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen and her
Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharazi discussed the ways to enhance
the Tehran-Helsinki relations in political, economic, trade,
scientific, telecommunications and environment fields.
</P>
<P>
They also called for furthering cooperation between the
European Union (EU) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) on various fields, including campaigns against terrorism and
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Finland will assume the rotating EU presidency for the second
half of 1998 and will become a member of the EU Troika in
1999. Iran is the current chairman of the OIC.
</P>
<P>
Halonen called for avoiding double taxation between the two
countries and encouraging joint investment projects to boost trade
exchanges with Iran.
</P>
<P>
She proposed exchanges of data and holding seminars on
scientific, technical and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Halonen expressed satisfaction over the positive trend in the
EU-Iran relations and the hope that EU-Iran comprehensive dialog
will continue under Finland's presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish minister, who arrived here on Sunday for a two-day
official visit, said that Helsinki welcomes the proposal put
forward by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on dialogs among
different civilizations and cultures.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi, on his part, noted the potentials of their bilateral
economic cooperation, saying the current trade exchanges between
the two countries falls short of the economic capacity of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister urged central banks, chambers of commerce
of the two countries and Iran-Finland joint economic commission to
explore ways to facilitate bilateral trade and transactions.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the OIC and the EU will lead to
understanding and cooperation, he said, adding that Iran is ready
to cooperate with the EU in different grounds.

<HEADLINE> China's Aviation Administration Predicts Market Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The '98 China International Air
Show, which opened on Sunday, has brought Boeing, Airbus,
BMW-Rolls Royce, Daimler-Benz, and many other big companies to the
southern city of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) says this is a proof that they are optimistic about China's
aviation market. CAAC estimates that air transport will grow at an
annual rate of 10 percent over the next two decades and will need
another 600 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The two largest aircraft producers in the world, Boeing and
Airbus, have also shown confidence in China's market. In a market
report published earlier this year, Boeing said it expects to see
the world's fastest annual air transportation growth in China, at
9.5 percent, and the market expansion will mean the purchase of
1,800 planes, valued at 125 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A similar forecast was made by Airbus, Boeing's major
competitor. Annual growth in the Chinese market will be 6.8
percent in the next 20 years, compared with 5.1 percent in the
rest of the world, and 1,300 passenger planes will be needed.
</P>
<P>
Airbus had 11 aircraft on display at the show, which it is
either manufacturing or developing, with the A340-600 being
showcased.
</P>
<P>
Boeing had a new image at the show after the merger with
McDonnnell Douglas. Its focus was on the Boeing 717-200.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Better Protection of Threatened Bluefin Tuna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) has called on Atlantic tuna fishing nations to honor their
commitment to adopt a bona fide recovery plan for severely
depleted bluefin tuna stocks.
</P>
<P>
The statement of the WWF, the conservation organization, came
at a time when the members of the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) began their annual meeting
Monday in Santiago de Compostela of Spain.
</P>
<P>
WWF said in a press release that the fishing nations had
finally acknowledged that current regulations have failed to
protect the endangered species, which has declined by more than 80
percent since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing is the main cause of the bluefin tuna's decline,
WWF said, but rampant violations of ICCAT regulations (catching
fish below legal size and exceeding established quotas) has
further compounded the problem.
</P>
<P>
"For years, ICCAT has neglected its responsibility to develop a
bluefin tuna recovery plan," said Michael Sutton, Director of
WWF's Endangered Seas Campaign. "This year represents the best
opportunity for fishing nations to take real action and adopt a
plan that will restore bluefin tuna to its mid-1970 levels."
</P>
<P>
WWF said that the nations responsible for most of the bluefin
catch in the Atlantic are Japan, the United States, Canada and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
"WWF expects these nations in particular to support an
effective recovery plan," said Sutton. "If ICCAT fails to act,
other international bodies such as the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) may have to step in to save
these fisheries."

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support for Lebanese Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Monday reiterated Tehran's support for the Lebanese
resistance against Israel's aggression.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remark in a meeting with visiting Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who arrived here Monday morning, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance has been fighting to dislodge
Israeli occupying forces and its proxy South Lebanon Army out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Middle East peace process, Khatami said Iran
believes that the real peace can only be formed in the region when
the rights and dignity of the Palestinians are fully observed.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also expressed the hope that relations between Iran and
Lebanon will further broaden on the basis of good will and
determination of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Lebanon can play a significant role in influencing
regional and global issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Terming detente policy as the most pivotal principle of Iran's
foreign diplomacy, the Iranian president said "we never welcome
any move that might spark a crisis."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hariri briefed Khatami on the post-civil
war (1975-1990) reconstruction projects under way in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from the
University of Hawaii have discovered large amounts of nitrous
oxide -- also known as laughing gas -- in tropical waters of the
Pacific, the Washington Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It has been known that marine bacteria manufacture nitrous
oxide in the deepest parts of the ocean. But two researchers from
the university found the gas in shallower waters, and at much
higher levels than previously known.
</P>
<P>
Based on the finding, the researchers estimate that the world's
oceans release six million tons of the gas into atmosphere each
year, three times more than projected.
</P>
<P>
Nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, contributes to the global
warming as well as the destruction of the ozone, thus scientists
worry it may exacerbate environmental problems.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Suspends West Bank Troop Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Monday that he is suspending
troops withdrawal from the West Bank unless the Palestinians
retract the statements declaring independence next May.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in the Knesset (parliament) at the start of the
two-day debate on the approval of the Wye River agreement signed
with the Palestinians under which Israel will withdraw troops from
13 percent of the West Bank within 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstance, under the threats that Arafat made yesterday, until
these things are corrected publicly and unequivocably," Netanyahu
said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the statements made by Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, who renewed his
vow Sunday to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4
and warned Israel that the Palestinians would take their guns if
prevented by Israel from praying in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that Jerusalem "has been, is and always be
the capital of Israel and only the capital of Israel."
</P>
<P>
He said he would convene his cabinet Wednesday to review the
suspension of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Palestinian news agency Wafa said that Arafat's
statements were "misunderstood," noting that the PNA is committed
to the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
Before Netanyahu made the announcement, Palestinian Negotiator
Hassan Asfour accused the Israeli prime minister of trying to
evade his obligations, urging Netanyahu to stop using excuses.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Netanyahu had called on Arafat to seek
clarifications before the start of the parliament debate to seek
clarification.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have indicated that Arafat's renewal of
his pledge to declare an independent state came as a response to
Netanyahu's earlier annexation threats and as an expression of
frustration over Israel's delay in carrying out the redeployment
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The first substantial act for Israel to implement the
agreement had been slated for Monday, when Israel should pull
back its troops from 2 percent of the West Bank in the first phase
of a three-stage redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has said it would be delayed for several days.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
voiced a proposal Monday that its Council of Ministers authorize
exceptional balance-of-payments aid to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive body, said the assistance,
which could amount to a maximum of 60 million ECU (57 million US
dollars), will take the form of a combination of grants and loans.
</P>
<P>
The aid will serve as part of the EU strategy to promote the
peace process there and the transition of Bosnia to a market
economy, it added.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silgy said the time had come "to
go beyond the objective of reconstruction and focus increased
attention on the structural reforms which will make it possible to
foster growth and creation".
</P>
<P>
"Promoting the development of the private sector and
job-creation is necessary to find a medium-term solution to the
problem of refugees and displaced persons," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also noted that significant progress had been
made in recent months in setting up the central institutions and
introducing the legislation that were essential to the functioning
of a unified economy in the two entities of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The EU aid will, in particular, facilitate the implementation
of a consistent macro-economic program and speed up the structural
reforms, including development of the private sector.

<HEADLINE> More Rural Homes in Zimbabwe Get Solar Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The global environmental
facility (GEF) Monday said a total of 12,000 solar systems had
been installed in rural areas in Zimbabwe by October this year.
</P>
<P>
The project funded by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) was officially terminated in June, but work went on due to
increased demand.
</P>
<P>
Project manager Gibson Mandishona said they managed to beat
the targeted figure of 9,000 installations in rural homes,
clinics, schools and business centers.
</P>
<P>
The GEF project started in 1993 as a pilot project to reduce
the problem of global pollution by substituting solar energy for
fuels such as candles and paraffin.
</P>
<P>
He told the Zimbabwe News Agency (Ziana) that consultants were
now working on a successor project expected to start early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Mandishona said the project which emphasize the importance of
environmental protection and poverty alleviation would also
address other forms of renewable energy programs which included
wind and biogas.
</P>
<P>
''My hope is that if a new project takes place it should
drastically improve the coverage of solar home systems,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
''The successor project, if accomplished, will solidly put
Zimbabwe on a worldwide renewable energy map,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was envisaged that renewable energies were the hope
for the future because they abated global warming and
environmental stress.
</P>
<P>
''Zimbabwe could lead the Southern African Development
Community region into the era of modern renewable energy,'' he
said.

AMMAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 United Nations
humanitarian workers left here Monday for Baghdad to resume their

</P>
<P>
The return came two days after Iraq agreed to unconditionally
resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors and the United States
temporally withdrew its military menace.
</P>
<P>
About 120 of the U.N. workers departured on four Iraqi buses
and will travel about 12 hours and some 500 kilometers through the
desert before arriving in Baghdad.

Hours later, another 30 U.N. staff, mainly senior workers, left
on a U.N. plane sent from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
They were evacuated from Baghdad to Amman on November 12 for
fear of possible U.S. air strikes to compel Iraq to reverse its

JOHANNESBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The tornado that swept
through Harrismith, a city 300 km southeast of Johannesburg, on
Sunday, destroyed about 190 houses and left 750 people homeless,
South African Press Association reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The homeless, most of them from the Intabazwe township, would
be sheltered at the Harrismith show-grounds, said Corlea Harold,
speaking on behalf of the Harrismith Town Council.
</P>
<P>
Police and rescue workers are helping people move their
belongings to the show-grounds Monday afternoon, Harold said,
adding that a special committee had been established to provide
food for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 people admitted to Harrismith Hospital on Sunday,
only three were still receiving treatment. One patient was in a
serious condition, Harold said.
</P>
<P>
According to Harrismith officials, it would take about one
week and millions of Rand to repair the damage and restore
electricty. Currently one U.S. Dollar equals 5.8 Rand.
</P>
<P>
Eskom, the national electricity utility of South Africa, said
it would be deploying extra man-power to restore electricity in

LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony

hesitate in ordering the use of force without warning if Iraq
defied again United Nations weapons inspectors.

"If there is a next time, I will have no hesitation in ordering

"The U.S. and UK, with far greater international support than

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Slips in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial
production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities slipped
in October, the fourth decline in five months, the Federal Reserve
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Federal Reserve's industrial production index fell
a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent. Utility output dropped 3.4
percent. Demand for electricity had been at elevated levels over
the Summer but then dipped again as temperatures returned to more
normal levels. Production at mines and oil wells fell 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, output at factories rose 0.3 percent, showing partly
rebound from a 0.6 percent drop in September, according to the
Fed report.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production dropped despite the fact that
manufacturing in October was buoyed by a 2.9 percent increase in
automotive products and gains for appliances, computers, furniture
and construction supplies. That helped offset drops for farm and
industrial equipment.
</P>
<P>
The slight drop in overall industrial output helped lower the
industrial operating rate to 80.6 percent of capacity, from 81
percent in September. Factories operated at 79.4 percent of their
capacity.

NICOSIA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus expects that Abdullah
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), will not be
extradited to Turkey, government spokesman Christos Stylianides
said here Monday.

Speaking at his press briefing, the spokesman said European

The EU has urged Turkey to improve its human rights record, to

Greece and contribute to peace efforts in Cyprus before it
joins the list of candidate countries for EU accession
negotiations.

<P>
"Given this and the fact that Turkey violates human rights
repeatedly, we expect that the Kurdish leader will not be
extradited," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained by Italian police Thursday night upon his
arrival in Rome aboard a Russian Airlines passenger plane from
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the Cypriot government "backs a
political solution to the Kurdish problem."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cypriot House Speaker Spyros Kyprianou Sunday sent
a letter to his Italian counterpart Luciano Violante, saying that
he had been informed with great concern of Ocalan's detention by
the Italian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou urged Violante to use all his influence on the
Italian government to set free Ocalan and satisfy his request for
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
The PKK led by Ocalan has been fighting a separatist war for
independence in southeast Turkey since 1984.

<HEADLINE> UK Companies Committed To Asia over Long-Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Over three-quarters of UK
companies believe that Asia will be more important to them over
the next five years despite the current economic turmoil,
according to a Confederation of British Industry (CBI)/Telstra
survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on the future prospects in Asia for UK
companies, CBI President Clive Thompson said that the results
showed UK companies' long-term commitment to the region.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and political instability in Asia Pacific has
caused short-term insecurity among UK investors. But companies
with long-term experience in Asia continue to have confidence in
operating there," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that even in the short-term nearly 60 percent
of companies expect to invest the same or more over the next 12
months despite the economic turmoil in the region.
</P>
<P>
In fact, while 34 percent of companies have cut back their
investment plans in the Asian Pacific countries, 30 percent
believed that there were now more opportunities for their company
in the region, CBI/Telstra survey said.
</P>
<P>
Telstra Europe's Chief Executive Steve Demetriou said at the
conference: "Over the next five years UK firms expect to invest
more in the Asia Pacific than in Western Europe or the United
States. "
</P>
<P>
This is the first in a series of CBI/Telstra surveys to track
business confidence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Telstra is Australia's largest company by market
capitalization. It has an annual turnover of 15.9 billion
Australian dollars, with 60,000 staff world-wide and a presence in
over 30 countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accused of Lacking Desire for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on Monday accused Israel
of lacking "sincere desire" to establish peace with its Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
head of PLO Political Department Farouq Qaddoumi said that Israel
has escaped the commitments to the land-for-peace principle
determined in the 1991 Mideast peace conference in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Qaddoumi termed the Palestinian-Israeli Wye deal as "a security
agreement," other than a peace agreement, which he said will lead
the Middle East peace process to "a dangerous crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis signed last month in Washington
the deal on Israeli phased withdrawal from another 13 percent of
the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian tough measures against
anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Qaddoumi said that he was, for the time being, opposed to
revising the Palestinian National Charter calling for destruction
of Israel, as demanded by the Wye deal.
</P>
<P>
He said the charter will be null and void when a new charter or
a constitution is formulated for a future independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official denied reports about proposals that a new PLO
be set up, saying there is only one PLO and no request has been
tendered by any of its 10 member-groups to form a new Palestinian
organization.
</P>
<P>
Qaddoumi, a former close comrade of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, disagrees with Arafat on the strategy for resolving the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Rearming forces: Ex-officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) has got "many weapons" in the past
four years and its chairman Jonas Savimbi has now had a "well
armed" force, two UNITA ex-officers said in Huambo Monday.
</P>
<P>
Major Mateus Chingaluco "Chinga" and Gervasio Lesawala "Pety"
said when some UNITA troops were disbanding at assembly points
according to the 1994 Lusaka Accord, some others were being
trained in secret bases, such as Jamba in central Huambo
province.
</P>
<P>
The two just escaped from Bailundo, a city controlled by
UNITA, last week. Chinga served as an instructor in a task force
of UNITA, while Pety was an officer commanding the bodyguards of
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"Renewed civil war tops the most popular topic in the leading
circle within the UNITA region recently," they said, adding,
"Many oppose Savimbi's war policy."
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners who advocate war the most are general Abilio
Camalata, UNITA's secretary general and Altino Sapalalo "Bock",
one of the main generals of the UNITA military forces.
</P>
<P>
They have summoned the demobilized UNITA fighters back,
attempting to grab power for Savimbi through armed force, the two
former UNITA officers said.
</P>
<P>
Many are against a renewed war in Angola, but with
ever-intensifying control, people find it hard to speak out what
they think in their minds in UNITA areas, they said.
</P>
<P>
UNITA is now trying to recruit men for their army throughout
the country on the one hand, and to plunder food and animals for
their logistic supply on the other, they said.

HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister Monday
urged African journalists to giver more coverage to environmental
and developmental issues in their areas.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day environment and development workshop here,
Environment and Tourism Deputy Minister Edward Chindori-Chininga
said if African journalists did not take interest in writing
about issues in their countries, there would be no balance in the
north-south information flow.
</P>
<P>
"The constant coverage of environment and development issues
in the media will eventually cultivate a culture that will
promote civic action against all forms of environmental
malpractice," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some foreign journalists' reports on environmental
management in Africa were "misleading and incorrect."
</P>
<P>
The workshop would focus on the importance of press coverage
of environmental and developmental issues and on how
international environmental conventions impact on trade, resource
use and management.
</P>
<P>
The workshop organized by African resources trust and the
United States information service is being attended by 30
journalists from the southern African region.

security, human rights and refugees, visiting Finnish Foreign
Minister Tajra Halonen announced here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of reporters, Halonen said that a group of

</P>
<P>
Problems will not be solved if there is no talk, she said,

Undoubtedly, the Finnish minister said, the talks will begin
with general and simple issues and gradually proceeds to cover
more complex issues.
</P>
<P>
She termed Iran as an important country in a complex,
difficult and at the same time interesting region, saying that
Helsinki maintains Tehran can forge regional cooperation and boost
regional relations with the EU.

<HEADLINE> Economic Performance Improves in Sub-Saharan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing industries in
sub-Saharan Africa showed encouraging performance in 1997
although manufacturing value added (MVA) growth fell marginally
from 4.5 percent in 1996 to 4.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. newsletter, Industrial Africa, released to the Zimbabwe
News Agency Monday said adverse weather conditions like droughts
and floods in some parts of the region affected agricultural
output and indirectly the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, political and economic uncertainties continued to
dampen growth," said the newsletter which is published by the
U.N. Industrial Development Organization (Unido).
</P>
<P>
"As in past years, the major economies in the region such as
Cameroun, Nigeria and Zimbabwe all recorded higher MVA growth:
8.4, 2.5 and 5.6 respectively from 7.8, 1.0 and 3.7 percent in
1996," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said increased capital inflows accelerated growth in the
cfa Franc (French-speaking African states) zone at a time
performance in the least developed countries (LDCS) was
discouraging.
</P>
<P>
But during the year more than half of the 33 LDCS in the
sub-Saharan region registered lower MVA growth compared with the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past three years, the total growth of the region has
been above the average annual rate of population growth which is
about three percent.
</P>
<P>
"This has resulted in a corresponding increase in the per
capita income," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, overall economic growth in the long run had been
hampered by economic and political instability, pervasive
poverty, low savings and investment rates, low human capital
endowment and poor infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It said the region needed to reduce political and economic
uncertainties and improve its infrastructure and human
development in order to attract foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Make Tanzanian Orphans Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of children
orphaned by deadly disease AIDS is rising quickly in Tanzania,
United Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in Dar es Salaam Monday.
</P>
<P>
A consultant with UNICEF office in Dar es Salaam told Xinhua
that the number of children who lost mother or father or both
parents was 200,000 in 1996, but may rise to 800,000 by the end
of this century.
</P>
<P>
The consultant, who declined to be named, said the UNICEF has
collected the information from the National AIDS Control Program.
</P>
<P>
She said UNICEF has been trying to assist the orphans by
keeping them at schools, making them live with extended family
members such as their parent's relatives, and providing health
care and other services.
</P>
<P>
The consultant said it is improper to describe the group of
children as "AIDS orphans," a term which seems to be discriminate
against them.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency has been assisting Tanzania in caring for AIDS
orphans since early 1990s and has promised to provide special
assistance to Bagamoyo, Karagwe and Makete areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a recent workshop held in the Kibaha town, some 40
kilometers northwest of Dar es Salaam, government officials
stressed the importance of fighting AIDS to help children.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 million children in the world have one parent or
both parents dead due to the deadly disease AIDS since 1983,
health officials here said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is a country leading in Africa with HIV/AIDS cases.
At least one million people in the country have been infected
with HIV, virus that causes AIDS, statistics indicate.

LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- British Steel has warned that
the company would make losses this year as a result of the global
economic crisis, and called for further interest rate cuts to
shore up British business.
</P>
<P>
The company has already cut 1400 jobs over the last six months,
mainly across plants in northern England. BBC quoted BS chairman
Brian Moffatt Monday as saying that there would be more to come as
BC accelerates its job shedding program.
</P>
<P>
The firm announced plans to axe around 1600 staff in the next
six months in the face of the strong pound and falling steel
prices. The cut will be made mostly in the UK.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced here Monday the pre-tax profits in the
six months to October 3 were 108 million pounds - down on 143
million last time.
</P>
<P>
However, the firm said that recent falls in interest rates and
the value of the pound should help it restore competitiveness in
its domestic and export markets over the next year.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Ocalan Has Not been Invited to Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Monday that Abdulah
Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) currently
under arrest in Italy, had not been invited to Greece and the
Greek government had not received any message from him.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Athens had no contact with Ocalan or his
representative.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was unaware of reports of a supposed message
from Ocalan to the Greek government being brought by the
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) parliamentarian Costas
Mandouvas, who arrived in Rome last Saturday to issue Ocalan with
an invitation to visit Athens.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, 109 Greek parliamentarians, including
Mandouvas, signed an invitation for the PKK leader to visit
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that Athens had fought for a political resolution
to the Kurds' long-running separatist cause and against the use of
force by Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the issue of whether or not Ocalan
received political asylum was "a matter of Italy's leaders and
laws."
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the Coalition of the
Left and Progress supported Ocalan to receive political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Democratic Social Movement leader Dimitris Tsovolas is
expected to meet with Italy's ambassador in Athens to discuss the
asylum issue for Ocalan.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Monday that the U.S. military will strike
Iraq without warning if President Saddam Hussein breaks his
promise to cooperate fully with U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
"No more hiding and seeking. No more playing games," Cohen told
reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"I think that he has had more than sufficient warning. I don't
believe any additional warning is required," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, President Bill Clinton accepted the promise of Iraq
to resume full cooperation with the U.N. inspectors and an
imminent military strike against Iraq was avoided.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone understands that this is the last go-round as
far as Saddam is concerned. He has had every opportunity to fully
comply. We will see whether the deeds are going to match his
words," Cohen said in response to questions at a swearing-in
ceremony for new Navy Secretary Richard Danzig.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 U.S. warplanes, including 12 F-117A stealth
fighters, that had been en route to the Gulf in a major military
buildup would likely be returned to the United States from
intermediate stops in Europe in the coming days, said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
But he made clear that more than 180 U.S. attack and support
planes will remain in the Gulf region with nearly 20 American
warships.
</P>
<P>
"If we find that Saddam is breaching this agreement, then no
one, anyone, anywhere could fault the United States and our allies
for considering action at that time," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Govt Subsidizes Farmers with 120m Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government on
Monday unveiled details of a 120 million pound (200 million U.S.
dollars) emergency aid package for farmers who are hit hard by
strong pounds and mad cow disease crisis.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown told the House of Commons the
aid was being made available because all farming sectors had been
"adversely affected by a marked deterioration in market
conditions".
</P>
<P>
Brown said the package came as recognition of the "extremely
difficult circumstances" facing the agriculture industry.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture minister confirmed the government intended to
draw 48 million pounds (80 million dollars) in compensation for
cattle farmers from the European Commission for the current year.
</P>
<P>
Brown said, subject to approval from Brussels, Hill Livestock
Compensatory Allowances for 1999 would be increased by 60 million
pounds (100 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Brown also announced a long-term government review of farming,
which he promised would produce "policies which offer a secure
future" for rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The rescue package is intended to counteract the effect of
tumbling farm incomes over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Farm earnings have fallen 80 percent since 1996, raising the
prospect of thousands of farms going bankrupt with the loss of
many thousands more jobs.

eliminating weapons of mass destruction in Iraq on October 31, has
been haunting the Iraqis in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
The value of U.S. dollar dropped drastically over the past
24 hours vis-a-vis a rise of the Iraqi dinar's value. One
dollar, which could change for 1,800 dinars on Sunday, dropped
to 1,600 dinars on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At an old neighborhood market in Alawy Street, the price of
tomato was 350 dinars one kilogram, 150 dinars lower than that on
Sunday. The grain price also dropped by 25 percent in the past 24
hours after Iraq decided to allow the U.N. inspectors to resume
their work.
</P>
<P>
An old housewife said she was praying for peace in the past
days. "I am not afraid of death, I was only worried about the
safety of my children and grandchildren." She burst into tears
when hearing the news that Washington had cancelled its military
attacks on Iraq in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
However, some intellectuals hesitated at getting
optimistic as the lifting of the U.N. embargo which was imposed
on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 is not in
sight.
</P>
<P>
"Although Iraq averted a military attack right now, the
sanctions cannot be lifted before the next century," an Iraqi
reporter said pessimistically.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials and state-controlled news media expressed
anger over U.S. President Bill Clinton's Sunday night speech in
which he encouraged the Iraqi opposition to topple the present
regime in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz Sunday called
Clinton's speech as a "flagrant interference in Iraq's internal
affairs."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N.
Humanitarian Program in Iraq, announced Monday all U.N.
staff, including the weapons inspectors, are expected to return
to Baghdad as of Monday. The first batch, 151 U.N. relief
workers will return to Baghdad later Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had been stepping up its military buildup in the Gulf
for air strikes against Iraqi targets before Baghdad announced to
rescind its decision of non-cooperation with UNSCOM on October
31.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Farmers Steps to Stop Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Ten more commercial farms in
Mashonaland East have been invaded by land hungry villagers,
forcing the owners to seek court orders to curb their illegally
resettling themselves, the Daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two such orders have been granted for the protection of farms
in the enterprise area in Mashonaland East province. Among other
instructions in the provisional order, police were ordered to
ensure that the farms would not be invaded and to take any action
necessary to prevent illegal settlements.
</P>
<P>
With police battling to cope with problems at already invaded
farms owing to a shortage of resources and man power, enforcing
the orders has proved a mammoth task for the force.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 families have so far moved onto five farms around the
Juru area in Chikwaka communal area of eastern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Mashonaland East David Karimanzira Sunday said the
government was committed to resettling its people and the
national program had already started.
</P>
<P>
"But it is important for people to realize that this is a
five-year program. Everyone cannot be resettled at the same
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite concerted efforts by both the government and ruling
ZANU (PF) provincial leadership to allow for orderly
resettlement, the invaders have steadfastly refused to vacate the
farms.

<HEADLINE> Germany, France Coordinate Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, November 16 (Xinhua) -- German and French financial
leaders agreed Monday that their two countries should coordinate
economic and fiscal policies and take a leading role in guiding
the fortunes of the future single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
But the regular semi-annual meeting of the German-French
economic council today did not produce any agreement on ideas
advocated by German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine for
establishing exchange rates between the euro, the dollar and
japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Both Lafontaine and his French counterpart Strauss-Kahn, after
the German-French economic council meeting today, said to the
press that with the introduction of the euro next January 1, the
situation on financial markets would change and therefore a common
economic and fiscal policy would become necessary.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn called it a "good sign for the euro", that France
and Germany had "very similar opinions on almost all the issues".
While saying there was no agreement yet on Lafontaine's idea of
narrow exchange rate corridors for the euro, dollar and yen, he
added that the two sides would continue to study the idea to find
a common stance.
</P>
<P>
About the exchange rate of Euro, Lafontaine explained that
nobody was striving for a static exchange rates between euro,
dollar and japanese yen. And his idea for narrow fluctuation
corridors was not meant to be carried out in the short-term, but
rather was aimed at finding a "narrowing in real economic terms"
of exchange rates. He said also that the Group of Seven leading
nations should cooperate to achieve more stable exchange rates.
But methods of achieving it could be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Other topics covered in today's German-French meeting included
harmonization of taxes in the E.U. by mid-1999 and the question of
a more balanced distribution of the costs of the E.U.
</P>
<P>
The German-French economic council meeting today was the first
regular council meeting since the new German government took power
in Bonn and the talks were devoted to mapping out policy positions
ahead of next week's European Union finance ministers meeting and
the Franco-German summit at the end of the month in Potsdam.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Arms Inspectors to Resume Work in Iraq on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of 86 U.N. arms
inspectors will return to Baghdad Tuesday on a U.N. flight, and
the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM in charge of
disarming Iraq, is expected to resume its duty on Wednesday, a
U.N. spokesman announced here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that the
weapons inspectors, working with UNSCOM and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are scheduled to leave for Baghdad
from Bahrain, where they have been on standby since they left Iraq
last week.
</P>
<P>
"On Wednesday, another six UNSCOM staff will make the same
journey," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sergey, Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to
the United Nations, told reporters here on Monday that UNSCOM
should carry out its duty "properly and exactly according to the
U.N. resolution" and "show respect for Iraqi sovereignty and
dignity of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Iraq averted air strikes at the last minute on Saturday by
saying it would let the inspectors resume work.
</P>
<P>
Russia, together with China and France, has lashed out at
Richard Butler, who heads UNSCOM, for his withdrawal decision last
week without consultations with Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that he made the decision on "strong
recommendation" from Washington.

<HEADLINE> IMF not to Change Position on Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The position taken by the
International Monetary Fund to Russia will be unchanged, the IMF
office in Moscow said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the IMF office in Moscow Martin Gilman said that though
the situation in Russia is too uncertain, the IMF mission is also
to continue talks on the same terms set by the previous mission.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to comment on the possible results of the talks
by the IMF mission which is to arrive here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF told the government earlier this month that the fourth
quarter federal budget deficit must not exceed 50 billion rubles,
and the government should do away with the practice of offsetting
debt.
</P>
<P>
Under agreements reached by IMF and Russia prior to the
government's August 17 decisions, the IMF was to provide 4.3
billion U.S. dollars for Russia in September.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the office of the World Bank in Moscow also
stated that its experts who will come to Moscow at the end of
November or the beginning of December will not offer any new loans
to Russia.
</P>
<P>
A source in the bank's office said the Russian administration
and the World Bank team will consider stepping up the work on the
budget-substituting loans for structural economic reforms approved
earlier by the bank's board.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank would like to see how Russia is implementing the
conditions for the release of the next payments out of these
loans.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the two sides will also to discuss the
economic situation in the country in general.
</P>
<P>
This year the World Bank has given Russia the second and the
third tranches of a loan for the coal industry, 200 million U.S.
dollars each tranche; second tranche of the third loan on
structural economic reforms, 500 million U.S. dollars, and the
third tranche of the loan for the structural reform of the social
care system, 250 million U.S. dollars, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul
Ilah Al Khatib issued a statement here Monday to welcome the end
of the Iraqi-U.N. crisis over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the crisis, Jordan hoped that Iraq will soon
resume cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,
Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
To resume cooperation with the UNSCOM and comply with
relevant U.N. resolutions are the sole way for Iraq to tackle the
current situation and get lifted the U.N. sanctions imposed on
Iraq eight years ago for its invasion of Kuwait, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced its decision to halt all cooperation with the
UNSCOM on October 31, triggering the standoff with the U.N.. The
United States then threatened to take military actions to force
Iraq into compliance.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last Saturday decided to unconditionally resume
cooperation with the UNSCOM. And the U.S. later temporarily
withdrew its military threats.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions cannot be lifted until UNSCOM verifies that
Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> France Promotes Idea of "Defense Agency" within EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- France Monday again promoted the
idea of establishing a "defense agency" within the European Union
(EU) to better coordinate multinational military units that have
been functioning in Europe.
</P>
<P>
French Delegate Minister in charge of European affairs, Piere
Moscovici, said at a meeting of EU defense and foreign ministers
in Rome that such an agency would lead "political and strategic"
operations, have its own intelligence system, and better cordinate
multinational forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that Moscovici was quoted by an
anonymous source of the Western European Union, but no further
information can be obtained from the French delegation attending
the meeting in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Moscovici also suggested that EU create a list of institutions
to be established for defense issues, and promoted the idea of
European defense in the charter of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) which is undergoing revisions, and reform, if
need be, the multinational military units in Europe, according to
the same source.
</P>
<P>
The term "agency" was first used by French President Jacques
Chirac in August to propose a future body within the EU in charge
of defense.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard Monday also suggested
that EU create a permanent international peace envoy based on the
U.S. model for participating in negotiating the crises such as
those in Kosovo and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Telecom Firm in Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned
Tanzania Telecommunication Company Limited (TTCL) has incurred a
loss of three billion Shillings (about 4.5 million U.S. Dollars)
caused by fraudulent practices over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
A senior TTCL official, who declined to be named, said in Dar
es Salaam that a lot of loopholes are existing in the
telecommunication industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
He named telephone tapping, illegal attended call offices,
operator calls and cutting lines as some of the areas where
fraudulent practices have taken place.
</P>
<P>
The official said the practices have also denied the
government a substantial amount of revenue.
</P>
<P>
To deal with defaulters, he said TTCL has set up a task force
composed of police officers and the company's investigators.
</P>
<P>
By June this year, he said, TTCL had carried out 20 operations
in cooperation with the police against defaulters in Dar es
Salaam and the central city of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
He said 21 suspects have been sent to court, 13 cases are
still under investigation and the police are still looking for
another 25 suspects.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is discouraging to note that some of the netted
culprits have been released in the court on bail, hence having
chances to continue with their malpractices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, disciplinary measures have been taken
against 467 employees between 1993 and this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jonathan Pollard, a
convicted Israeli, on Monday petitioned Israel's High Court
against release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Pollard, serving a life sentence in the
United States, asked the court to hold up the release of 250
Palestinian prisoners until his release by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Under the land-for-peace deal signed by Israeli and Palestinian
leaders in Washington last month, Israel will release 750
Palestinian prisoners in three stages. The first one-third are
scheduled to be released later this week.
</P>
<P>
Pollard, an American Jew working as a U.S. naval intelligence
analyst, was arrested in 1985 and later convicted of spying for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The issue over his release almost foiled the recent
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
Just hours before a signing ceremony at the White House, the
Israeli negotiation team said it would not attend the ceremony
unless U.S. President Bill Clinton secured Pollard's release.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was defused when Clinton promised to "review" the
case. But the ceremony was postponed by several hours.
</P>
<P>
Since Pollard's arrest, Clinton has rejected Israel's demands
on several occasions that he pardon Pollard, but Israel has vowed
time and again that it would take every measure to get Pollard
out of prison.

MAPUTO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- President Joaquim Chissano
Monday asked the international community to offer help to the

At a ceremony marking the re-opening of a highway in southern

<P>
BUCHAREST, November 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,500 kgs of drugs
and narcotics were confiscated by the Customs' officers in the
first ten months of the year, the Customs' General Directorate
informed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drug quantities varied from three grams to 2,200 kgs. The
quantity of heroin confiscated by the Customs' officers was the
largest one, namely, 312.6 kgs. More than three quarters of the
quantity was confiscated from persons who left Romania.
</P>
<P>
The ways the drugs were hidden were various, from commonplace
ways - pockets, backpacks - to very clever ones - pillows, a
doll's head and a book's cover. The drugs traffickers were from
Nigeria, Turkey, Fyrom, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Republic
of Moldova, Ireland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Romania has become, since early 90's, an important transfer
point of drugs from the Central Asia to the Western Europa, due to
its geographical position. Statistics show that the drug smuggle
cases cracked by the authorities in the recent 9 years are of 40
times more than in the previous 20 years. 7,300 kgs of drugs were
captured in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Opposition Suspends Talks With Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's 12 opposition
parties have suspended talks with the government and Southern
African Development Community (SADC) mediators on the political
future of the country, South African television reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition announcement came just hours before the
official launch of an interim political authority which is
supposed to pave the way for new elections in 18 months' time.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance said all participation on their part
will be halted until important security issues were discussed
with all stake holders.
</P>
<P>
The security issues included the release of rebel soldiers
charged with treason arising from the mutiny in the Lesotho
Defense Force on September 11.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties said the government of Lesotho Congress for
Democracy (LCD) was harassing them. They accused the LCD of
expelling their supporters from work place and arresting their
members.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also accused the SADC mediators of siding with
the Lesotho government, saying they were doing nothing to stop
the harassment.
</P>
<P>
"We note that the undignified haste of the South African
authorities to lure us away from the palace refuge was a mere
ploy to unleash the hounds of dictatorship on us," said Mamello
Morrison, spokesperson for the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to South Africa's efforts to remove
opposition supporters from the royal palace.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has called for the withdrawal of SADC
peace-keeping troops from Lesotho, the release of their members
from detention and an end to further arrests. If the demands were
not met, they said, they would not go back to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the opposition alliance Vincent Malebo said: "The
LCD government and leader of the opposition alliance should
commit themselves to the spirit of normalization, by creating an
atmosphere of mutual trust, avoiding or desisting from utterances
and postures that seek to undermine the normalization and
reconciliation effort."
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Foreign Minister Tom Thabane said the opposition move
made no sense.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the opposition walkout, South African safety and
security minister Sydney Mufamadi said so far as he is concerned,
the process that would ultimately lead to fresh elections in 15
to 18 months' time is still on track.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi is the chief SADC mediator on the Lesotho political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Following the military intervention of South African and
Botswana troops as SADC peace-keepers in Lesotho, the Lesotho
government and opposition parties agreed on the establishment of
an interim political structure in mid-October.

<HEADLINE> Marriages Down, Divorces Up in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of marriages in Iran
is on decline while that of divorces is increasing, according to a
latest statistic report by the country's registration office.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 500,034 young couples got married in the
first half of the Iranian calendar year to end on March 20, 1999,
some 14,000 less than the number for the similar period last year.
</P>
<P>
"The decline is unprecedented in the last 20 years," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the decline was more significant in Tehran
province, where only 75,186 couples tied the knot during the six
months, registering a drop of 13.11 percent compared to the figure
for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were 40,806 divorces throughout the country
during the first half of the year, a rise of 1.58 percent from the
corresponding 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Due to the economic problems caused by oil price slump, many
Iranian parents cannot afford the houses, wedding expense and
dowries for young couples.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian traditions, the parents of the bride must
prepare all necessary furniture for the new couple and the parents
of the bridegroom must prepare the house and the wedding expenses.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities have taken some measures to encourage
young people to get married, such as allowing temperate marriage
in the country and holding mass weddings.

BUCHAREST, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's long- and
medium-term foreign debt topped 8.339 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of August, about 31 million down from the end of 1997,
according to the latest data released Monday by the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The public debt stood at about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars, or 54
percent of the total debt, the state-guaranteed public debt at
1.97 billion U.S. dollars and the private commercial debt at 1.8
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Romania owed in August to international financial lenders 3.273
billion U.S. dollars, out of which the highest debt, about 1.436
billion, goes to the International Bank for Reconstruction and

<HEADLINE> Record Compensation for Brain Damaged Girl in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A 17-year-old British girl who
was severely brain damaged during routine surgery accepted a
record 3.9 million pounds (6.6 million U.S. dollars) damages from
a doctor on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Helen Edwards, from Suffolk, suffered the damage during an
operation to remove a birthmark on her forehead at the private
Hope Nursing Home in Cambridgeshire in 1986 when she was five
years old.
</P>
<P>
The High Court in London awarded her a record 3.9 million
pounds in damages on Monday -- the highest ever award in the UK
for an act of medical negligence.
</P>
<P>
Helen suffered complications from the anaesthetic and suffered
a cardiac arrest, which led to permanent and severe brain damage.
</P>
<P>
She was left blind and unable to crawl, feed or talk, although
she is now able to see and has recovered some movement.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Ogg, the consultant anaesthetist during the operation,
admitted liability in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, it has taken until now for the family to fight for the
amount of money they say is needed to provide for their daughter's
care regime.
</P>
<P>
The previous highest award was almost 3.3 million pounds (55
million U.S. dollars), which was made to Sam Mansell in October
this year.
</P>
<P>
He was severely disabled at birth, and has athetoid cerebral
palsy after being starved of oxygen during delivery by Caesarean
section in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Algeria to Launch Small Firms to Curtail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Algeria will launch some 8,000
small enterprises over the next year to create new job
opportunities, Minister of Labor, Social Security and Professional
Training Hacene Laskri announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to absorb unemployment that affects almost
all communities due to the current economic transformations
nationwide, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Algerian budget allocates 6.5 billion Algerian dinars
(112 million U.S. dollars) to provide more than 170,000 new jobs,
out of which 86,000 are permanent ones, Laskri said before the
National People Assembly (Algerian Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that all institutions and agencies
concerned with fighting unemployment should contribute to the
elimination of the unemployment phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He urged the institutions including the National Authority for
Social Development, the National Fund for Insurance against
Unemployment and the National Authority for Youth Employment to
give a hand to those who are willing to initiate economic
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Algeria now stands at 28 percent. More
than 2 million people are unemployed, mostly youth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expects Israel to Redeploy Despite Rhetoric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
said it expected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to carry out their obligations
under the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin urged the two sides to
stop making provocative statements.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks that
Israeli troop withdrawal will not begin unless and until Arafat
issues a public retraction, let me say that the Wye memorandum was
signed without conditions and it is our expectation that both
sides will implement the agreement as signed," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman described as "wrong" an Arafat threat to rekindle
the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule but drew a
distinction between statements and actions laid out in the Wye
agreement, signed in Washington on October 23.
</P>
<P>
"There is no place... for statements which call for or suggest
violent actions. These remarks were wrong and we will be raising
them directly with Chairman Arafat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also criticized Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon for
advising Jewish settlers to grab every hillside in the West Bank
to keep the land out of Palestinian hands.
</P>
<P>
"Statements such as the one made by Foreign Minister Sharon
undermine the trust and confidence and necessary for such an
environment. And we will be raising this statement with the
Foreign Ministry directly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect both parties to abide by the agreement they signed,
which did not include conditions about subjects like this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Netanyahu said Israel's pullback in the West
Bank was on hold until Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
publicly retracted warnings of renewed armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
"I don't intend to carry out any redeployment under these
conditions, not even the first, until this is rectified publicly
and unequivocally," Netanyahu told parliament in a speech opening
a debate on the land-for-security deal with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Accuses S. Africa of Harboring Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) Monday accused South Africa of harboring
rebels fighting to overthrow the DRC government led by President
Laurent Kabila, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is the place where the plot has started. South Africa is
really the home of the so-called rebels," Congolese Foreign
Minister Jean-Charles Okoto said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"When you look around, there is not any other African country
where those rebels are receiving everything they need. They are
really welcome in South Africa."
</P>
<P>
Okoto is on a two-day visit to South Africa at the invitation
of his South African counterpart, Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Nzo in the morning, Okoto was in the afternoon
waiting for an opportunity to meet South African President Nelson
Mandela to convey to him a message from Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"I am still waiting," he said. "If I were the rebels, he
(Mandela) would have seen them already."
</P>
<P>
Okoto also expressed anger about South Africa's speedy
intervention in Lesotho while it neglected to condemn Uganda and
Rwanda for backing the rebels against the Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
Okoto said it was time South Africa assumed its responsibility
as the chairing country of the 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Asked if South Africa's alleged leniency toward the rebels was
deliberate, he said: "South Africa must have its own reasons.
This country is like a swimming pool where the rebels can swim
for as long as they want, and make their statements."
</P>
<P>
The Congolese community in South Africa had not been given a
chance to speak out in favor of Kabila, but the rebels, who
treated Kabila's Congo (K) like devils, were free to speak out
their minds.
</P>
<P>
Okoto intimated that Congo (K) had more information about the
support the rebels were receiving.
</P>
<P>
"We also have an intelligence service and have our people
among the rebels. We are informed about weapons and ammunition
they are getting, and even financial assistance they are getting
from foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
Okoto said he had raised his country's concerns with Nzo,
adding that he received a mixed response.
</P>
<P>
Nzo acknowledged that diplomatic ties between the two
countries had improved, but also insisted on the Congolese
government negotiating with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The Congolese are not little children. When the Rwandan
troops failed to take control of Kinshasa they hid behind the
so-called rebels," Okoto said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo earlier in the day said uncertainty about the role the
rebels would play in peace efforts was a serious stumbling block
in attaining a cease-fire in Congo.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the conflict in Congo was not a military
problem but a political one that should be solved by the people
of Congo themselves.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a call by Congo for an African peace-keeping
force to be deployed along its borders, Nzo said such a force
should involve the United Nations and was something for the
future.
</P>
<P>
Conditions for a peace-keeping force first had to be created.
Once that happened, countries would be approached to take part in
such a force.
</P>
<P>
"If South Africa is approached, it will play a role. The
specific role will be decided by our government," Nzo said.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder: Russia Must Answer IMF to Get New Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder warned Tuesday that Russia can get further
financial aid only when its "economic program is made more
concrete", according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Speaker of the Russian State Duma (the lower
house), Gennady Seleznyov, Schroeder said the economic situation
in Russia was "grave", but the Russian government's program of
priority measures was "a good foundation, on which work with the
international financial organizations can be continued".
</P>
<P>
On the aid of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he said
that "motivation of the second tranche of its credit is on the
order of the day, and the Russian government and parliament must
bear particular responsibility in this case".
</P>
<P>
"They must find answers to the IMF questions, and if they
succeed in doing so, we shall be ready to help Russia by words and
deeds," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, on his part, expressed confidence that
Russian-German ties in all the areas would be continued,
especially those between the two nations' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
First Vice-Speaker of the Russian Duma, Vladimir Ryzhkov, who
also attended the meeting, said that Germany still regarded
relations with Russia as one of its main priorities on the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder arrived in Moscow for two-day official visit on
Monday. He has met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, two
speakers of the Russian Parliament, Seleznyov and Yegor Stroyev,
Russian Communist Party Leader Gennady Zyuganov and other Russian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is expected to return home on Tuesday afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and visiting German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder agreed
Tuesday to maintain the rapid development of ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders shared the view that Russian-German relations
had no insurmountable hurdles, Deputy Head of the Russian
Presidential Administration Sergei Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the German Chancellor that "the most important
thing is that relations between Germany and Russia are, and will
be, just the same as they were in recent years".
</P>
<P>
Both Yeltsin and Schroeder confirmed the value of the
large-scale consultations on all matters concerning bilateral
cooperation involving key ministries, Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany would not give new loans to Russia, Schroeder
said in a televised interview in Moscow Monday. Germany's credit
capacity was very limited, and Germany would not be able to help
Russia on a bilateral basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor praised Russian government's anti-crisis
program, calling it a good foundation for further assistance from
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Yeltsin informed Schroeder about the Russian
government's recent efforts to stabilize the country's social and
economic situation, Prikhodko added.
</P>

Schroeder expressed his thanks to Yeltsin for Russia's
constructive role in settling the crises in Kosovo and Iraq.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday
denied allegations by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that
it was harboring rebels trying to overthrow the DRC government
led by President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in a statement that his
country remained neutral in its quest to find a solution to the
DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
DRC Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe, who had
talks Monday with Nzo over the DRC conflict in Pretoria, capital
of South Africa, told reporters that DRC rebels were welcomed and
given support in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This is the place where the plot has started. South Africa
is really the home of the so-called rebels," Lolakombe said.
</P>
<P>
Denying the accusation, Nzo said his country was a
constitutional democracy which attracted many people of differing
political persuasions.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the rebels did not mean the South African
government favored them or provided them with logistical or moral
support, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leaders who met President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria
recently were not resident here, but only on a brief visit after
the October 27 Lusaka meeting on the DRC conflict, said the
foreign minister.

<P>
DHAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad Tuesday hoped that the country's development
partners would continue to help implement its post-flood
rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
"You have been our partners for progress for many, many years,"
Azad said at a brief meeting here with heads of diplomatic
missions and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his thanks for their continued assistance,
particularly their generous response during the unprecedented
flood the country experienced recently.
</P>
<P>
The response of the international community during the floods
"gave us inspiration and encouragement" to sustain the calamity
and the losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Help from friends abroad had "raised our morale to manage the
crisis, and this won us international appreciation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has so far received 756 million U.S. dollars of
donation from 38 countries and 43 donor agencies for relief and
post-flood rehabilitation and reconstruction programs, still short
of its targeted 880 million dollars' assistance.

<HEADLINE>   British Court Sets Deadline in Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) - A British court ruled on Tuesday
that the government must decide by December 2 whether to allow a
court to hold a hearing into Spain's appeal for the extradition of
former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
But Magistrate Graham Parkinson said he would be prepared to
consider legal applications for the December deadline to be
extended if necessary.
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled to be held in England's High Court on
Wednesday on the conditions of Pinochet's bail, which would allow
him to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyer, Alun Jones, said on Tuesday the 82-year-old
general was "fit to be discharged from hospital".
</P>
<P>
Pinochet has been under guard since October 16 in a London
hospital where he was treated as a patient with a diplomatic
passport.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish court had requested his extradition from the United
Kingdom on charges of murder, torture and kidnapping during his
17-year rule in Chile which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The British House of Lords has yet to rule on whether Pinochet
is immune from prosecution. If it decides that Pinochet enjoys
diplomatic immunity, the extradition process would be halted and
the former general would be free to leave Britain immediately and
fly home to Chile.

<HEADLINE> China Pushing Fine Ceramic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's largest
exporter of ceramics, is making every effort to improve the quality
of its household ceramic products, according to Huo Dufang,
president of the China Ceramic Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
Huo told a press conference here today that low added-value
products make up the lion's share of China's ceramic exports, and
the unit price for Chinese products is much lower than the world
average.
</P>
<P>
A china art and design fair will be held in Shanghai in
December, with 200,000 pieces of china to be on display, which
is expected to raise china design and production technology to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
Huo says that China's ceramics industry will put more emphasis
on tableware, which accounts for the bulk of household china on
the world market and that bone china and other fine products will
be the focus of it.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that half of China's ceramics exports are
decorative items or souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
China exported 1.46 billion U.S. dollars worth of ceramic
products in 1997, accounting for 63.5 percent of the world's total
ceramics exports.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian
Consulate-General in Peshawar denied on Tuesday holding of any
political dialogue with the Afghan Taliban militia for re-opening
of its diplomatic mission in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Iranian Consulate-General
clarified that only a group of Iranian technicians had proceeded
to Afghanistan to inspect the properties of the Iranian consulates
in Afghanistan, which are now under the control of the Taliban
militia.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Islamic Press, a Peshawar-based private news
agency, reported Monday that a high level Iranian government
delegation has visited the Taliban headquarters of Kandahar and
held talks with the Taliban leaders to prepare ground for possible
meeting between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharazi.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian Consulate-General denied the report and
said in its press release that Iran did not hold any kind of
political dialogue with the Taliban for re-opening of its
diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
The press release indicated that re-opening of its diplomatic
mission could only be possible after the punishment of the killers
of Iranian diplomats in the northern Afghan town of Mazar-e-S
Harif, an apology by the Taliban over this incident, release of
the remaining Iranian prisoners and restoration of peace and
security in that country.

<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China's banking, finance, tax,
telecommunications, civil aviation, and power sectors have made
progress in dealing with the millenium bug problem by advancing
computer systems 410 days before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Information Industry Minister Wu Jichuan said today that these
sectors have entered the final phase of computer tests and expect
to solve all problems that will be discovered by the end of
September, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Richard Scurfield, with the World Bank's China Program, says
that the World Bank is positive about China's handling of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry, Ministry of Finance, and
The World Bank held a seminar here November 17-18, where Zhang Qi,
chairperson of the MII's Y2K Committee, said that China has been
working on the Y2K problem since 1996. So far, the five major
commercial banks have completed inventories of their computer
systems and improved 70 percent of their software. They are
cooperating closely with local and foreign suppliers and the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, is drafting emergency
plans to move smoothly into the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
The China Securities Regulatory Commission started testing the
country's securities computing network in September and will run
another test November 28.
</P>
<P>
The State Tax Administration will complete its computer
inventory by the end of this year and will focus on upgrading its
software.
</P>
<P>
China Telecoms is on schedule in upgrading its
telecommunications network and says it will solve the Y2K problem
and maintain normal operations.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Faces Aging Population Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will experience an
average drop of 40,000 to 45,000 people in its population from
now to 2050, making the aging problem more and more outstanding.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the Nepszabasag
newspaper on Tuesday, Hungary in 1997 had 10.14 million people.
Experts predicted the number would fall to eight million by 2015
and those above 50 years would account for 50 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that Hungary's population decline is
accelerating. It is predicted that by 2015, the number of babies
born every year will decrease to 90,000 from 148,000 in 1980. By
2050, the number will further drop to 70,000.
</P>
<P>
Due to the fall in both birth and death rates, old people are
making up a larger proportion of the population. The aging
population, which will result in challenges over retirement
policy, pensions and social insurance, will become the major
social problem for the Hungarian government at the end of this
century and the beginning of the next.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking population started in 1981. From 1980 to 1997,
the total number of Hungarian residents dropped by 563,000. Last
year, the natural growth rate hit a new low record.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Administration of China has discovered that
70 percent of its computer systems have Y2K problems and has
classified its branches according to degree of severity and has
helped them find solutions. On July 4, it successfully upgraded
its booking system and modified software. The Boeing Company
confirmed shortly afterward that CAAC's Boeing fleet has no
problems.
</P>
<P>
The China Petrochemical Group has set up four panels to address
the problem and the State Metallurgy Administration and the
Ministry of Communications have started looking into the problem.
</P>
<P>
China has more than ten million computers and the number is
growing at a rate of 50 percent every year.
</P>
<P>
Wu says, since China depends on computers far less than
developed countries do, the amount of work that needs to be done
is much less, but the job is still difficult because China gets
its equipment from a wide range of suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K question is more one of management than of technology,
he says, and believes that if institutions and enterprises pay
enough attention to the problem and use plenty of resources and
technology, China will not have the serious problems that some
foreigners expect at the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Suffering From Chronic Oversupply of Cement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chronic oversupply, dwindling
exports and mounting debt problems are crippling Vietnam's cement
industry, fueling calls for greater government intervention to
save the sector, Vietnam Investment Review reported in its latest
issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language weekly, Vietnam's cement
production capacity is expected to reach 16.8 million tons by the
end of this year, but with yearly domestic consumption of only 9.5
million tons and export levels almost nil, the market is suffering
from chronic oversupply.
</P>
<P>
"Cement supply has dramatically outweighed domestic demand this
year and export markets are steadily shrinking, leaving local
producers in fear of insolvency", said a senior official from
Vietnam Cement Corporation last week.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said current domestic consumption targets of 12
million tons next year and 15 million tons by 2000 are fanciful.
</P>
<P>
Local produced cement now sells for between 56 and 62 U.S.
dollars per ton, while Thai and Chinese equivalents sell for 39
and 35 U.S. dollars respectively, the review said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's cement industry is almost completely dependent on
foreign loan capital, with about 90 percent of investment capital
in cement projects came from international loans, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Recent dong (Vietnamese currency) devaluation have added higher
loan service payments to production costs, increasing prices by 2
to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Debt servicing is definitely contributing to rising production
costs. interest on loans amount to 30 percent of our costs", said
one cement production executive.

TEHRAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday denied reports
that a high-ranking delegation is currently in Afghanistan to
negotiate with the Taliban militia, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official clarified that it was a technical
team that Tehran sent to Afghanistan to inspect the Iranian
embassy, consulates and other bureaus as well as the trucks seized
by the Taliban in August.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reports said an Iranian Foreign Ministry delegation is
in Afghanistan to talk with the Taliban over the presence of
Iranian troops on Afghan-Iranian border and the Taliban prisoners
jailed in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that Iran will not negotiate with
the Taliban before the murderers of Iranian diplomats and a
correspondent in Afghanistan are arrested and punished, a
remaining Iranian captive is freed and the Taliban leaders
officially apologize to Iran.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, the Taliban killed eight Iranian diplomats and an
IRNA reporter after its troops run over Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan. It also held more than scores of Iranian truck
drivers accused of sending arms to the opposition Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban returned the remains of the killed Iranian
diplomats and reporter and released 51 Iranian captives after
Tehran massed over 200,000 troops along the eastern border and
staged massive military exercises.

Business Advisory Council (ABAC) held at the Palace of Golden
Horse Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Econtech and trade and investment liberalization, which are
mutually complimentary and reinforcing, are two main pillars of
the APEC, said Jiang, adding that a balanced development of the
two is an important condition for ensuring the healthy evolvement
of the APEC.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that Econtech is one of the important ways to
realize APEC's objective of bridging the gap of development among
its member economies and achieving common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"it is also a fundamental guarantee for APEC to maintain its
dynamism," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown that without fruitful economic and
technological cooperation, it is very difficult for trade and
investment liberalization to make headway", the Chinese president
said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, under the current circumstances, we should fully
recognize the importance and urgency of strengthening Econtech
cooperation within the APEC", he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, APEC members have been actively engaged in
cooperative initiatives in the field of Econtech, which have
yielded many positive results, President Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the concerted efforts by the APEC members and the
business community, we have completed the work of drafting the
Kuala Lumpur Action Program on Skills Development and the APEC
Agenda for Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the
21st Century," Jiang said, while predicting the Action Program and
the Agenda as blueprints for future APEC cooperation in this field.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the parties concerned will work together
to explore an effective and mutually beneficial way of
cooperation, so that enterprises can better involve themselves in
the APEC Econtech cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC was established in 1995 with the aim to facilitate
involvement of business sector in the APEC cooperation. It has 54
members and reports to the annual APEC leaders' informal meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was attended by 20 leaders of APEC member
economies and representatives from the business community of the
region.

<HEADLINE> Opening Southern China To More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the capital of
China's Guangdong Province will open more to overseas investment
and will use it more efficiently, Vice-mayor Wu Liang said today.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Guangzhou used 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars worth of overseas investment in the January-October
period of this year, 7 percent more than for the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The city has used 14.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas
investment in the past two decades, which contributed much to the
14.3 percent growth in Guangzhou's annual GDP.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the industrial output of overseas-backed enterprises
accounted for 44.6 percent of the city's total and exports of
overseas-backed enterprises accounted for 60.7 percent of its
total.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment is being encouraged for the service
industry, high-tech industry, and state-owned large and
medium-sized enterprises, Wu says.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors will be allowed to set up joint ventures in
tourism and service sectors, such as travel agencies handling
international business, holiday resorts and consultation
firms.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the city also plans to open electronic
information networks which could be paid both in Guangzhou and
neighboring Hong Kong, adding that more foreign banks and
insurance companies are encouraged to open branches or offices in
the city.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in 1999, Guangzhou will work out a list of key
projects for overseas investment and open offices in Hong Kong and
San Francisco to attract investment.

SHANGHAI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Baoshan Steel Complex merged
with the Shanghai Metallurgical Company and the Meishan Steel
Company to form the Shanghai Baogang Group Company in Shanghai
today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo attended the opening ceremony and
called the new complex a "great event" in the iron and steel
industry. He urged it to become a first-class steel company with
first-rate products as requested by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The integration is important in speeding up the country's
restructuring of state enterprises, Wu said, pointing out that
China has become the largest iron and steel products producer in
the world but it is not yet a powerful iron and steel manufacturer
because of a lack of efficiency and technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the State Council has high hopes for the new
merger and asked the company to improve products, technology,
structure, and management and asked the city government to
continue its strong support for the steel giant.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: Supervision Needed to Curb Capital Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin called on Tuesday for greater controls on speculative
activities with large sums of international floating capital which
had severely damaged the economies of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to supervise and control the excessive
speculation of the international floating capital," Jiang said
while meeting Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad here
in the Malaysian capital.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, it will be disastrous for the developed countries
if such things go on rampantly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the economic development of East Asia over the past
30 years was a known fact. The financial crisis prompted people to
re-examine the problems in the process of economic development of
their countries, so they could undertake necessary reforms.
</P>
<P>
"From this point of view, the crisis is also a good thing to
some extent," Jiang said, adding the economic globalization had
not only brought about severe challenges for developing countries,
but opportunities as well.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia,
will eventually conquer the crisis and revitalize their economies
and maintain a healthy development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said he was happy to see that Malaysia
had adopted policies that complied with its national realities,
and its national economy was turning for the better.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir gave Jiang a briefing on the economic situation in
Malaysia and the measures and policies it had taken to overcome
the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The crisis which started in East Asia had spread throughout the
world, and become an world-wide problem. The destructive quality
of the capital speculation was obvious, said Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
Expressing appreciation of China maintaining the value of its
currency, Mahathir stressed that supervision and management of the
speculative activities of the international floating capital
should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he was optimistic about the future development of
the economy of Malaysia as it was now turning for the better.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also expressed satisfaction over the smooth
development of the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Merge Land Fund Into Exchange Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government announced Tuesday that
the assets of the Land Fund will be merged into the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
The reference date for the merger is October 31, 1998, when the
assets of the Land Fund amounted to 211.4 billion HK dollars (27
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the Government's effort to streamline the
investment management of its accumulated fiscal reserves. The
fiscal reserves already placed with the Exchange Fund totaled
203.1 billion HK dollars (26 billion U.S. dollars) as on October
31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said Tuesday: "This exercise
will enable greater administrative efficiency and economies of
scale in the management of our accumulated fiscal reserves,
including the Land Fund, as I promised to achieve in my 1998-99
Budget Speech."
</P>
<P>
The Land Fund will remain a separate government fund after the
merger, but will enjoy the same rate of return as that of the
Exchange Fund, as in the case of the fiscal reserves, in
accordance with the arrangements laid down in the 1998-99
Financial Budget, the government sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong equity portfolio previously held in the Land Fund
will be passed over to the Exchange Fund Investment Limited (EFIL)
for management in the same manner as the those acquired by the
Exchange Fund in the market operation in August.
</P>
<P>
All Hong Kong equity holdings of the HKSAR will therefore be
consolidated for management by EFIL.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's foreign currency assets, held either in the
Exchange Fund or the Land Fund, reached 88.4 billion U.S. dollars
as at the end of September, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Livent Set to Seek Bankruptcy Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The largest live theater
producer in North America, Livent Incorporation, is expected to
file for bankruptcy protection in Canada and United States, the
Canadian National Post newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based company has debts of 230 million Canadian
dollars (149.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources close to the company as saying it
is preparing to file court documents in New York and a similar
action in Canada under the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act.
</P>
<P>
Although Livent's board of directors has yet to make a final
decision, lawyers have been instructed to prepare court materials
to seek relief from creditors in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Livent lost 44 million Canadian dollars in 1997 and has written
off more than 60 million Canadian dollars in costs that can't be
recouped since last December.
</P>
<P>
The company is the producer of such mega-shows as "Phantom of
the Opera", "Ragtime" and "Show Boat".
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy protection will allow Livent to buy some much-needed
time to restructure its financial house.
</P>
<P>
The company is not insolvent, but by seeking bankruptcy
protection it buys time to reorganize without the pressure of
paying its creditors until a plan is approved by the company's
debtors and the court.

<HEADLINE> China Maintaining Housing Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China expects to build more
than 300 million sq.m. of housing in urban areas, and more than
650 million sq.m. in the countryside, according to Vice-Minister
of Construction Song Chunhua.
</P>
<P>
Song told the national housing construction conference here
today that China's housing industry has helped develop the
national economic development and consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The country has reform measures for the housing system this
year and has spent 170 billion yuan building 210 million sq.m. of
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
Song says that the 1.6 billion sq.m. of urban and rural housing
built over the past five years has solved the housing problem for
over six million households, and the average per-capita living
space has grown to 8.8 sq m, in urban areas and to 22.6 sq.m. in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
To improve housing conditions, China has an "affordable housing
project" in more than 200 cities and housing cooperatives have
added more fund-raising channels and have benefited low- to
medium-income households.
</P>
<P>
Construction departments have made an effort to improve water
supplies, sewage, heating, roads, bridges, highways, trees, and
environmental protection systems to improve the standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Urban housing construction is expected to account for about 4
percent of the country's GDP in the coming years, Song says, and
plans for 2000 call for one billion sq.m. of housing, and some 70
percent of the households able to afford well-equipped houses.

ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has expressed
regret at the U.S. decision to publish a list of Pakistani
companies and institutions against which export restrictions will
be applied under the Glenn Amendment.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Foreign Office on Tuesday described the
U.S. decision as "unjustified and an infringement of norms of free
trade."
</P>
<P>
The list, in addition to defense related companies, includes
many firms and institutions which are engaged in legitimate
activities in the industrial, agricultural, research, education,
health, economic and trade sectors to help social, economic and
technological development in Pakistan, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed the hope that the U.S. government will
review its action and avoid steps harmful to the development
activities in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan remains firmly opposed to discriminatory U.S.
sanctions which contribute to the continuation of coercion and
pressure, he said, adding that Pakistan has consistently called
for the removal of these sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. released a list of over 140 Pakistani and 240 Indian
companies last Saturday blacklisted by the Commerce Department for
all trade and business activities with U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior State Department official was quoted by media
reports as saying during a briefing that "it is not a black list
or a hit list but a list published to keep transparency and to
enable U.S. business to carry out other business without
interruption."

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG Discusses Pension, Asset Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief representatives of both
sides of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) discussed
issues concerning the pension for retired Macao civil servants
and the transfer of assets.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the two parties discussed the problem of
so-called official status of Portuguese in the future, which was
put forward by the Portuguese side.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side, said
after a four-hour meeting with his counterpart Santana Carlos that
the two sides should focus on the affairs directly related to
Macao's power transfer and smooth handover as the transition
period becomes rather short.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides should take the pension problem concerning retired
civil servants and the problem of asset transfer as problems which
are of close connection and great significance with the power
transfer and smooth handover," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Basic Law stipulates that government of the future
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) will pay pensions to
civil servants retired after the SAR is established. But the
Portuguese side claims that the SAR government should also
pay the pensions to those retired before the SAR is set up.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative said that the pension problem should
be settled in accordance with the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration and the Macao Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the transfer of assets, Han Zhaokang expressed
his hope that the Portuguese side should work out a list of
Macao's assets as soon as possible and give it to the Chinese
side, so that the two parties can hold further discussions on the
transfer of Macao's assets.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the use of Portuguese in the future Macao SAR,
Han said that the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Macao
Basic Law stipulate that Portuguese will be an official language
in the SAR. The status of Portuguese does not pose a problem
either at present or in the future.

ULAN BATOR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian exports dropped
sharply with a trade deficit of 128 million U.S. dollars in the
first ten months this year, said the Mongolian National Statistics
Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade in the first ten months totaled 638.6 million
dollars with a downturn of 5.7 percent from last year. Export
volume plunged 23.6 percent to 255.1 million dollars and import
volume was up 11.7 percent to 383.5 million dollars, said the
agency.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the retreat is that the international
prices of brass, gold and cashmere, which serve as Mongolia's
pillar export products, have fallen greatly.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia conducts trade with more than 70 other countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Weapons Inspectors Return to Iraq by Huang Xingwei, Liu Jiawen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of 86 U.N. weapons
inspectors returned to Iraq aboard a chartered plane Tuesday, only
to find themselves being greeted by peace activists calling for
ending sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As the latest Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspections abated,
the U.N. chartered plane carrying the inspectors landed at the
Habbaniya airport, 80 kilometers west of Baghdad, around noon
local time.
</P>
<P>
When the inspectors arrived at the Baghdad Monitoring and
Verification Center at 1:40 p.m. (1040 GMT), six Americans of the
Voices in the Wilderness, a U.S. and British anti-sanctions
campaign, were protesting outside the compound.
</P>
<P>
Holding banners of "Ending sanctions - not lives" and
"Sanctions are starving to death 6,000 Iraqi infants every month,"
they sang peaceful songs when the convoy filed in.
</P>
<P>
Mira Tenaa, a member of the non-governmental organization,
told Xinhua that they rushed to Baghdad from Chicago following
the United States' threat of a military strike to force Iraqi
compliance over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
She said her group members were warned by U.S. government that
they would face penalties back home for travelling to Iraq, a
violation of U.S. laws, of up to 12 years in prison and over 1
million U.S. dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. policy is silent yet deadly warfare. The Iraqi
people, the children in particular, are innocent, but they became
victims of the sanctions," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Although a military attack was averted, the sanctions are
still killing the Iraqi people silently," said Ken Ricardi, a
father of four.
</P>
<P>
One arms inspector told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that
they would hold discussions later Tuesday on how to conduct
inspections beginning from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler last Wednesday
ordered the withdrawal of most of his staff in Baghdad, about 100
in total, on "strong recommendation" from U.S. government, which
said a military strike against Iraq was imminent.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference Monday in
New York that the U.N. Special Commission in charge of disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM) "is expected to resume its duty on Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
Eckhard also said that another six UNSCOM staff will return to
Baghdad on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a group of 30 U.N. humanitarian workers returned to
Baghdad on a U.N. flight to resume relief tasks in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 more U.N. humanitarian staff also arrived here Tuesday
from Jordanian capital of Amman.
</P>
<P>
Iraq averted possible U.S. and British air strikes at the last
minute by agreeing on Saturday to allow the resumption of
U.N. arms inspection unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq decided to ban UNSCOM and the International
Atomic Energy Agency from conducting field inspections of new
sites, but allowed monitoring activities to continue.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership took a step further on October 31 by
halting all cooperation with UNSCOM until the U.N. Security
Council moves toward the lifting of economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM
verify that Iraq has come clean of all weapons of mass
destruction.

<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A wooden ship that has been
embedded on the floor of China's Great canal for a century was
discovered recently by Chinese archaeologists, covered in silt at
the northern end of the Canal in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The wood of the 14.7-meter-long, six-meter-wide ship is still
rather hard even though it has rotted some in the past 100 years,
according to Wang Wuyu, deputy director of the Beijing Relics
Research Institute, and that it is a rare find since it is intact.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his colleagues have discovered shards of Yuan
(1271-1368), Ming (1368-1644), and Qing (1644-1911) dynasty
pottery and copper coins from the Ming and Qing near the ship and
say they believe these scattered relics have some connection with
the ship. They are trying to fix the exact age of the ship.
</P>
<P>
Things are not going very smoothly because of the thick silt
and groundwater, Wang says, but they expect to solve the mystery
of the ship in a week or so.

Workers discovered the ship during dredging work for a road

</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, ships carrying tribute to
the emperors did sink from time to time during different
dynasties, but were often not salvaged.
</P>
<P>
The 1,747-kilometer canal ran from Beijing to the city of
Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province. Digging started under orders from
an emperor of the Sui Dynasty (581-618). It runs almost parallel
to China's eastern coastline, and once was 2,700 kilometers long.
</P>
<P>
It was an important waterway for transporting rice from south
China to north China, but many parts of it were abandoned when the
part in today's Shandong Province silted up 170 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Many people are said to have tried to salvage sunken ships
before but none succeeded. There were attempts in the 1960s and
1970s by cultural relics and water conservation bureaus.
</P>
<P>
Wang says he believes they'll succeed if water conservation and
cultural relics departments cooperate.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Retracts Threats over Disputes with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to cool a war
of words with Israel, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat pledged on
Tuesday that he would only use peaceful means to resolve disputes,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Israeli prime minister reportedly said Benjamin
Netanyahu has accepted what he called Arafat's retraction of
threats to declare a Palestinian state in May 4 next year and
revive armed struggle for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a strategic choice for the Palestinian people" and
therefore any problems concerning final-status issues will be
resolved through "amicable and peaceful" negotiations rather than
any other ways, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks at a joint news conference with
visiting German President Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of
Jericho.
</P>
<P>
This came a day after Netanyahu announced to hold up the
handover of the next chunk of the West Bank to the Palestinians
because of Arafat's threat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat renewed his vow on the weekend to declare a Palestinian
state when the Oslo peace deal expires next year and warned of
another armed uprising to defend Jerusalem, which the Palestinians
want as capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu demanded a public retraction of the statements
before he moved on to carry out the first stage of the already
delayed further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, as called
for by their October 23 Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
With his senior aides claiming the statements were
"misunderstood," Arafat went on Israeli television Monday night to
explain that the Palestinians are committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's remarks Tuesday laid emphasis on that the Palestinians
would be seeking peaceful solutions to any problems, including the
status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli parliament, which resumed debate Tuesday over the
land-for-security deal signed last month, is expected to approve
its later in the day by a significant majority due to the support
of the left-wing lawmakers.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
Tuesday closed marginally higher, but off its session highs, as
the debut of Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus captured most interest and
investors waited for U.S. news on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Optus, which has 16-percent weighting in the All Ordinaries
Index, debuted at 2.61 Australian dollars, peaked at 2.74 and
closed at 2.65 on a record turnover of 316.9 million.
</P>
<P>

higher at 2,676.6, and traded between 2,696.7 and 2,668.1.

caution ahead of a possible rate cut.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we've had a great amount of information from the
U.S. on what the Fed's going to do," Grant Williams of Reynolds &AMP;
Co. said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also said there were some concerns among investors at
the recent sharp gains on Wall Street, but they were "a little bit
more relaxed" than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Lower base metal prices at the London Metal Exchange and a drop
in the December crude oil contract in New York led the All
Resources Index down 6.9 points to 1,049.4.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank, which closed up 36.5 cents, or 1.6
percent, at 23.15 Australian dollars, led the All Industrials
Index 11.2 points higher to 4,695, but off a high of 4728.6.
</P>
<P>
A fall in the price of gold bullion pushed the gold index 20.1
points or 1.71 percent lower to 1,162.1.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion closed 1.15 U.S. dollars lower at 293.7 dollars an

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Agrees to Be PEG Founder Patron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has agreed to become the founder patron of the
Partnership for Equitable Growth (PEG) proposed by the APEC
Business Advisory Council (ABAC), which is expected to start
operation by early 1999.
</P>
<P>
PEG, targeted to be set up by year-end with its incorporation
completed by January 31, 1999, will act as a catalyst for private
sector involvement in Economic and Technical Cooperation (ECOTECH)
initiatives such as the APEC IT (information technology) Education
Initiative, the Clean Technology in China and the Kuala Lumpur
Plan for APEC Scholars, an ABAC official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ECOTECH is one of the two pillars of APEC. The other one is
Trade and Investment Liberalization and Facilitation.
</P>
<P>
Based in Kuala Lumpur, PEG will operate as a non-profit
distributing organization with its own legal and independent
personnel, and aims at reducing economic disparities among APEC
economies and deepening the spirit of community in the
Asia-Pacific region, PEG Task Force Chair Francis Yeoh said.
</P>
<P>
The official said PEG's operating budget for the first three
years is estimated at three million U.S. dollars and the Malaysian
government will provide the seed money of one-third of the initial
budget.
</P>
<P>
He said PEG members will consist of individual corporations or
consortium of corporations from the 21 APEC member economies, with
at least three companies from each economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Hong
Kong of China and Chinese Taipei have already confirmed their
membership in PEG.
</P>
<P>
ABAC is in a dialogue Tuesday with APEC leaders who are here
for their two-day 6th informal meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Consultative Group (CG)
meeting on aid to Malawi will be held next month in Malawian
capital Lilongwe instead of the traditional venue of Paris,
Zambian newspaper Financial Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will have a wider involvement of the government
ministries and stakeholders, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent statement from the World Bank country
director for Angola, Malawi and Zimbabwe, Barbara Kafka, this
year's meeting is expected to have a special session on poverty
to include discussions on government's poverty alleviation, AIDS,
population and safety net strategies.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, the World Bank is going to hold a
briefing on the CG while donors participating in the meeting will
have a field trip to a number of different project sites in
Malawi.
</P>
<P>
A CG meeting is usually a gathering of developing countrys'
donors for the purpose of reviewing recent developments and
challenges ahead.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slid
backward Tuesday, suffering a sell-off of almost half a U.S. cent
as the support that pushed it through 64 U.S. cents overnight
failed.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trade, the local unit was buying 63.33 U.S.
cents from 63.79 late Monday.
</P>
<P>
In offshore trade overnight it managed to achieve 64.05 U.S.
cents as the Japanese yen also gained ground, pushing the U.S.
dollar through 120 yen.
</P>
<P>
Yet both currencies found the going tougher, particularly after
an announcement that international rating agency Moody's Investors
Service had downgraded Japan's sovereign debt.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier in the day we drifted off from the highs, really it
was just disappointment that the Aussie couldn't go on with it
through 64 U.S. cents," Colonial State Bank treasury manager
Andrew Willett said.
</P>
<P>
Despite its earlier strength the Japanese yen weakened Tuesday
afternoon following Moody's announcement.
</P>
<P>
By the close of trade in Sydney, the U.S. dollar had recovered
a little ground but was still lower at 121.23 Japanese yen from
122.49 here previously.
</P>
<P>
The rating agency blamed the downgrade on Japan's weak
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Willett said this provided a catalyst for a further fall in the
Australian dollar, which dipped to a low of 63.1 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The key event for both foreign exchange and debt markets
Tuesday night is a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open
Markets Committee.
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts seem evenly split over the likelihood of a cut in
interest rates following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the foreign exchange cross-rates the Australian
dollar was buying 76.83 Japanese yen from 78.12 and 1.0559 German
marks from 1.0699.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, New Zealand Value Emerging Markets Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) and New Zealand agreed on Tuesday
that the experience of the emerging markets is most valuable
because they have been at the receiving end of the financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa made the remarks while
meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley here.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on how to push forward G-7 and G-22
initiatives on the international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
Both Tung and Shipley are here to attend the 6th APEC informal
leaders meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Tung said APEC leaders should focus on
four key issues -- the financial chaos, economic and technical
cooperation, electronic commerce and the strengthening of the
multilateral trading system, according to a press release by the
Hong Kong delegation.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an important dialogue on the financial crisis
and I would particularly like to share with other leaders Hong
Kong's experience in dealing with the financial turmoil," Tung was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he would like to see APEC firmly support commitments
by G-7 and G-22 to address weaknesses in the international
financial architecture, especially in regards to enhancing the
transparency and accountability of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
APEC leaders held a dialogue Tuesday with APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) on the financial chaos which covered
several topics, including the strengthening of financial and legal
systems, recapitalizing banks affected by bad debts and ways to
guard against contagion during regional economic turmoil.

HONG KONG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China and South Korea signed an

</P>
<P>
The document was penned by Hong Kong Secretary for Security

Doo-Byong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ip said, "The signing of the
agreement today signifies the joint commitment of both (South)
Korea and the HKSAR to fighting international crime and to
continued close cooperation in matters of criminal justice and
international law enforcement."
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, it also demonstrates the continuity of the

</P>
<P>
The agreement is the seventh of its kind Hong Kong has signed
on international cooperation against crime. It contains all the
essential features and safeguards for international agreements of

seizure; providing documentary evidence relevant to criminal
matters; transferring persons between the jurisdictions of the
HKSAR and South Korea to give evidence or assist investigation;
and tracing, restraining and confiscating property used in or

</P>
<P>
The Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance,
which provides the necessary legislative backing for the

<HEADLINE> U.N. Weapons Inspectors Return to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of 86 U.N. weapons
inspectors returned to Iraq on board a chartered plane Tuesday as
the latest Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspection was settled
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chartered plane carrying the inspectors landed at the
Habbaniya airport, 80 kilometers west of Baghdad, around noon
local time.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler last Wednesday
ordered the withdrawal of most of his staff in Baghdad, about 100
in total, on "strong recommendation" from U.S. government, which
said a military strike against Iraq was imminent.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference Monday in
New York that the U.N. Special Commission in charge of disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM) "is expected to resume its duty on Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
Eckhard also said that another six UNSCOM staff will return to
Baghdad on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a group of 30 U.N. humanitarian workers returned to
Baghdad on a U.N. flight to resume relief tasks in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 more U.N. humanitarian staff are expected to arrive
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq averted the U.S. and British air strikes at the last
minute by agreeing on Saturday to allow the resumption of
U.N. arms inspection unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq decided to ban UNSCOM and the International
Atomic Energy Agency from conducting field inspections of new
sites, but allowed monitoring activities to continue.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership took a step further on October 31 by
halting all cooperation with UNSCOM until the U.N. Security
Council moves toward the lifting of economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM
verifies that Iraq has come clean of all weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Play Important Part in Economic Activities: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here on Tuesday that enterprises are the basic units
for economic activities and the carriers of capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
"Without the participation of enterprises, it would be
impossible for the economic and technical cooperation in the
Asia-Pacific region to develop dynamically," Jiang said at a
dialogue between the leaders of APEC member economies and the
representatives from the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC).
</P>
<P>
During the 80-minute dialogue which was convened by Malaysian

by financial chaos and are striving to recover their vitality.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most urgent task for now is to "restore the
investors' confidence" and to urge member economies to contribute
to rebuilding the world and regional economy.
</P>
<P>
During the first session of the two-session dialogue, the
business representatives focused their questions or remarks mainly
on ways to help the member economies and international
corporations walk out of the shadow of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Probes Alleged Links With Sri Lankan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has pledged
to investigate into allegations that Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) may have links with government
officials and other people in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Intensive investigations into the allegations have been
launched, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo told reporters after
meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart Lakshman Kadirgamar in
Pretoria Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We will investigate very intensively any contact between our
people and the LTTE," the Citizen newspapers Tuesday quoted Nzo
as saying.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was looking at introducing legislation in line
with international law preventing terrorist organizations from
setting up base in the country, Nzo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
LTTE fighting for a separate state had reportedly embarked on
a practice of ethnic cleansing by forcing all Muslims out of
their territory.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar pleaded with the South African government not to
encourage the "ruthless terrorist group" to operate from its
soil.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan foreign minister said he was at pains to spell
out to Nzo the terrible violence the LTTE had been involved in,
describing their actions as possiblely the worst atrocities
committed during the century.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar said Nzo told him that South African President
Nelson Mandela had earlier made it clear that the LTTE would
never be allowed to set up base in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nzo and Kadirgamar also discussed the expansion of relations
between the two countries, particularly the development of
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade of the two countries in 1997 totaled 253
million Rand (50 million U.S. Dollars).

SINGAPORE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed lower on

ahead of a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-making

</P>
<P>
Traders said the overnight strength on Wall Street contributed
to a jump in the morning session.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's ASEAN Seat to Be Decided at Hanoi Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's entry into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) will be decided at
the ASEAN summit to be held in Hanoi next month, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia's admission into the nine-member regional
grouping would depend on the developments in the country between
now and the formation of a legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
"After the government has been formed, ASEAN member nations
will make an objective assessment of the situation and a report
will be submitted to the heads of government," he told reporters
after an ASEAN Consultation Council meeting here chaired by
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN leaders agreed unanimously at the meeting
that they should "wait and see" whether a government could be
formed in Cambodia before deciding on its entry.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial that a legitimate government is formed first,"
he said, adding that ASEAN had not set a deadline for Cambodia to
join the grouping.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the leaders also expressed their appreciation to
Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk for his mediation efforts between
Prime Minister Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh to form a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was not admitted to the ASEAN along with Myanmar and
Laos last year due to political uncertainties in that country.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Ecological Protection of Wadden Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) on Tuesday called on countries bordering the North Sea to
declare the Wadden Sea "a particularly sensitive sea area" in
order to avoid an ecological disaster caused by oil leak.
</P>
<P>
The oil spill, occurred last month, is threatening the highly
vulnerable mud flats in the Wadden Sea National Parks where about
20,000 oiled seabirds and waders have been recorded, said the
Switzerland-based conservation organization in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The fuel leak is also putting a proposed harbor porpoise
sanctuary and a grey seal colony at stake, the release added.
</P>
<P>
"The oil spill is an ecological disaster for Europe's largest
coastal wetland," said Stephan Lutter, head of WWF's North-East
Atlantic Program.
</P>
<P>
"There are too many loopholes in international ship safety
regulations and salvage procedures," Lutter said.
</P>
<P>
"It clearly runs against common sense that protective and
salvage measures cannot be imposed on a vessel in the vicinity of
a highly sensitive and vulnerable eco-region like the Wadden Sea,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
WWF proposes a number of precautionary measures to be applied
to adjacent waters in order to safeguard the Wadden Sea eco-region
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In particular, shipping regulations such as the salvage
mechanisms and transboundary cooperation in case of emergencies
need to be tightened up.

<HEADLINE> Pak Customs Revenue Declines Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's revenue
collection from customs duties registered a shortfall of 20
percent during the first quarter (July to September) of the
1998-99 fiscal year when compared with the corresponding period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides customs duties, revenue collection from the sales tax
and the excise duty also witnessed a declining trend during the
quarter, according to sources from the Central Board of Revenue
(CBR) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The only improvement was recorded in the collection of direct
taxes, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The CBR collected 14.7 billion rupees from customs duties
during the quarter, a drop of 20 percent as compared with the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the decline was partially due to
excessive rebates/refunds and chiefly due to the erosion of the
tax base in terms of decline in imports to the extent of 6.67
percent.
</P>
<P>
The revenue collection of 11.2 billion rupees from sales tax
during the first quarter of the current fiscal year fell short of
the quarterly target of 11.4 billion rupees, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The CBR made a final tax collection of 58.7 billion rupees (46
rupees equals one U.S. dollar) during the first quarter, 16.6
percent of the budget target of 354 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
The gross collection during the first quarter, at 72.4 billion
rupees, was up by 2.3 percent as compared to the same period of
the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The net collection during the first three months of the current
fiscal year, however, dropped by 4.7 percent as compared with last
year, due to excessive refunds/rebates to help exporters improve
their cash flows together with the extension of the date for
filing income tax return.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Suffers From Chronic Oversupply of Cement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chronic oversupply, dwindling
exports and mounting debt problems are crippling Vietnam's cement
industry, fueling calls for greater government intervention to
save the sector, Vietnam Investment Review reported in its latest
issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language weekly, Vietnam's cement
production capacity is expected to reach 16.8 million tons by the
end of this year, but with yearly domestic consumption of only 9.5
million tons and export levels almost nil, the market is suffering
from chronic oversupply.
</P>
<P>
"Cement supply has dramatically outweighed domestic demand this
year and export markets are steadily shrinking, leaving local
producers in fear of insolvency," said a senior official from
Vietnam Cement Corporation last week.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said the current domestic consumption targets of 12
million tons next year and 15 million tons by 2000 are fanciful.
</P>
<P>
Locally produced cement now sells for between 56-62 U.S.
dollars per ton while Thai and Chinese equivalents sell for 39 and
35 dollars respectively, thus adding to the cement industry's
woes, the review said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's cement industry is almost completely dependent on
foreign loan capital, with about 90 percent of investment capital
in cement projects sourced from international loans, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The recent devaluation of the dong, the country's currency, has
added higher loan service payments to production costs, increasing
prices by between 2 and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Debt servicing is definitely contributing to rising production
costs. Interest on loans amounts to 30 percent of our costs," one
cement production executive was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were
killed and four others wounded Monday by a powerful roadside bomb
in southern Lebanon, Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off some 30 meters from an Israeli military
outpost in the Israeli-occupied security zone when the soldiers
were on their way to a military drill, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack came hours after Israeli warplanes raided
Hezbollah bases in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that the deadly bombing attack
was in response to the continuing Israeli air raids, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest fatalities have brought the number to 18 of Israeli
soliders killed this year in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The self-declared security zone was set up by Israel in 1985
with the claimed aim of shielding its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to try to drive
the Israeli occupation troops out of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-square-kilometer zone is a flashpoint of frequent
roadside bomb attacks, rocket raids and fierce ground clashes.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israeli inner cabinet approved the U.N. resolution
425 and offered to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon
provided Lebanese government agrees to guarantee the security of
northern Israel by curbing cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, Syria which has great influence on Lebanon, have
rejected the offer and demanded an unconditional Israeli pullout
in light with the resolution.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Businessmen Call for Ocalan's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish business leaders have
called on their Italian counterparts to make efforts for the
extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), the Daily News said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a letter to Italy's Trade Chamber Union
Chairman Danilo Longhi by the Union of Turkish Trade Chambers and
Commodity Exchanges, the Economic Development Foundation and the
Council of Foreign Economic Relations.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Italian government has no reason "to
prevent the PKK leader, who has killed many innocent people, from
being extradited to Turkey."
</P>
<P>
"If Abdullah Ocalan is not extradited by Italy to Turkey, we
convey to our Italian counterparts that we, as the top official
representatives of the Turkish private sector, are determined to
review our economic and commercial relations with Italy and
boycott Italian goods," it said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested last Thursday in Rome by Italian police
after stepping off a plane from Moscow, where he sought refuge
after being forced to leave his longtime Syrian hideout last month
because of Turkey's pressure on Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Russia denied him asylum; Italy has still not decided whether
to grant him refuge.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist and the country's
most-wanted criminal, bluntly demanding his extradition to Turkey
for trial for those crimes he committed.
</P>
<P>
But Italy has vowed not to bow to pressure from Turkey, saying
it is up to the courts to decide on Ocalan's extradition.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Italy, which is the second largest
trading partner of Turkey in Europe, will suffer heavy economic
losses if Turkey really imposes economic sanctions on it.

items in leading Turkish newspapers Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israel Bluffs than Baffles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's decision Monday to
suspend its troops withdrawal from the West Bank should be
regarded more as a bluff than as a real attempt to stall the peace
process, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he freezes the
implementation of the Wye accord until Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat publicly retracts latest vow to declare independence in May
next year and resort to armed struggle against Israel over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He announced the decision to the parliament before it began
debate over the land-for-security deal he signed with Arafat last
month, which calls for a further 13 percent Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank in exchange for tougher Palestinian security
measures.
</P>
<P>
The move came a little unexpectedly, but not as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu faces strong opposition from hard-liners in his
coalition over the agreement. This has been demonstrated last
week when the accord was ratified by only a narrow majority in his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The parliament is expected to approve the accord by a landslide
majority due to the support from the main opposition parties,
especially the Labor, which pledged to support the government for
the 12-week implementation period.
</P>
<P>
However, the Labor is at the same time continuing effort to
advance elections - its safety net for Netanyahu is on the Wye
accord only, and will not last long.
</P>
<P>
This signals problems ahead. Netanyahu would find it a better
choice to grab the approval of his rightist coalition partners,
although some of them have threatened to topple the government in
any no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he had to make efforts to allay their anger over
the Wye accord, in which they said Netanyahu gave too much to the
Palestinians but got too little in return.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's remarks made in the last two days were a ready tool
Netanyahu could use to reach his goal.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader's move was somewhat unusual since he had
refrained from renewing pledges to declare Palestinian statehood
since Wye. But it was understandable, as some of Netanyahu's
maneuvers were.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also faced opposition over the accord back home,
including from his own Fatah movement.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the accord, which calls for crackdown on
anti-Israeli violence, Arafat's government has virtually come into
antagonism with militant Islamic organizations such as Hamas and
the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
Clashes have broken out between Arafat's security guards and
members of the Fatah movement over the search of illegal weapons,
which was also demanded by the accord. One Palestinian youth was
killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's statements, therefore, were seen mostly aimed at
pacifying the Palestinians. They also came as a response to
Netanyahu's repeated threats to annex parts of the West Bank and
to the Israeli delay in carrying out the agreement, which has
deepened frustration among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal suspended, but the Palestinians appeared to have
nothing to lose, at least for now. The first phase of the
withdrawal, slated for Monday, had already been postponed before
the war of rhetoric heated up in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Israel had told the Palestinians that it would begin
redeployment later this week. There seems, therefore, still plenty
of time for accusation, criticism and then, explanation and
clarification.

MANILA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has

of the task force.
</P>
<P>

last month alone had caused 2.5 billion pesos (62.5 million
dollars) of loss in crops, fisheries and livestock.

<HEADLINE> Australia Develops First Hi-Tech Fault Finder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- An Australian university team
has developed a new hi-tech software "troubleshooter" which is the
world's first and may bring export sales worth 100 million U.S.
dollars in the next four years, its developers claim.
</P>
<P>
The software, the Astracon Connection Manager, was developed
over the last six years by CiTR Ltd., a software development
company owned by the University of Queensland in East Australia's
Queensland state.
</P>
<P>
CiTR Chairman Ted Edwards said the first software package had
recently been sold by the newly-established U.S.-based marketing
company Astracon Inc. to the giant U.S. telecommunications company
Bell Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said the Astracon Connection Manager simplifies
broadband data and Internet connections by monitoring network
status and enabling any faults it finds to be fixed speedily.
</P>
<P>
Such a product would be a boon to companies with extensive and
complex computer telephone systems, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
Rob Cook, Astracon's president and adjunct professor at
University of Queensland's faculty of computer science and
electrical engineering, said no system or software was available
at present that would simply make an electronic connection between
one point and another anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
"That's what our software aims to do," Cook told the Australian
Associated Press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody will be able to plug a computer into the wall, say 'I
want a connect to my favorite web provider' and the connection
will automatically happen."
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications companies and Internet service providers
would find the product particularly useful, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Connection Manager would also help companies such as U.S.
giant AT&AMP;T avoid the relay problem that "browned out" its whole
network a year ago, affecting millions of customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't quickly find out who those customers were and
how they were impacted," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our software will immediately notify the service provider that
the fault has happened, that it has impacted connections of
various customers and allowed the service provider to correct
those problems almost in real time."
</P>
<P>
Astracon Inc., based in Denver, a city in the state of
Colorado, the United States, was established by the University of
Queensland, which holds a 35-percent stake, as a marketing company
to attract American venture capital.
</P>
<P>
Astracon would market and develop the product in the United
States but the technology base would remain in Queensland.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Ahmed Badawi on Tuesday rejects as most unwarranted the
provocative remarks made by U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Gore said here on Monday night at a dinner party attended by
over 1,000 Malaysian government officials and industrial leaders
that those who were involved in the reform movement launched by
former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim were the
"brave people of Malaysia".
</P>
<P>
Gore is here to deputize President Bill Clinton at the 6th
informal leaders meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) on November 17-18.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia views the remarks as a gross interference in the
internal affairs of the country and a brazen violation of the
basic tenets governing the relations between sovereign states,"
Badawi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia finds the incitement by the U.S. government to
lawlessness by certain elements within the country to use
undemocratic means in order to overthrow a constitutionally
elected government."
</P>
<P>
"The action by the U.S. patently is not to advance the cause of
democracy and the rule of law but to serve its own narrow
political agenda," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some other Malaysian ministers also criticised
Gore's remarks and urged Gore to withdraw his remarks. They said
the remarks had spoiled the mood of the APEC meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Studying Consultations Between Lozis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
studying the consultations between the Caprivian Lozi separatists
in northeastern Namibia and Lozis from the Barotseland Province
of Zambia, the Zambian government spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman Newstead Zimba said here Monday
that the government is studying a statement issued by the leader
of oppositon Agenda for Zambia (AZ) led by Akashambatwa
Mbikusita-Lewanika on the links between the two countries' Lozis,
the Times of Zambia reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lewanika, who has been advocating the secession of the
Barotseland, said Monday that the Caprivian Lozis and those from
the Barotseland were "one people".
</P>
<P>
The opposition party leader, who admitted meeting the Namibian
Lozis, even argued that the Caprivian secessionist movement led
by Mishake Muyongo, president of Namibia's largest opposition
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, had the right to decide whether to
"rejoin" a free Barotseland, enjoy self-rule or remain in
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said that the remarks by the AZ leader regarding links
with the Caprivian Lozis who were considered rebels in their own
country were serious and needed careful scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"We have read the statement issued by Mbikusita-Lewanika, but
I can not give a reaciton just now because we are studying both
the statement and the situation at the moment", Zimba said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a Namibian newspaper, The Namibian, reported that
top figures in the Caprivi movement fighting for secession from
that country were now forging an alliance with Lozi separatists
in the Barotseland.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report from the United Nations Humanitarian
Information Unit (IRIN) said that in the last two weeks, over 400
Caprivian separatists had fled Namibia to neibouring Botswana to
seek refuge.
</P>
<P>
And in a national address at the weekend, Namibian President
Sam Nujoma demanded that Botswana repatriates the separatists to
face charges of treason and murder.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government had since ordered security sweeps in
the northeastern area by the army and para-military Special Field
Force, IRIN said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were
killed and four others wounded Monday by a powerful roadside bomb
in southern Lebanon, Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off some 30 meters from an Israeli military
outpost in the Israeli-occupied security zone when the soldiers
were on their way to a military drill, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack came hours after Israeli warplanes raided
Hezbollah bases in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that the deadly bombing attack
was in response to the continuing Israeli air raids, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest fatalities have brought the number to 18 of Israeli
soliders killed this year in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The self-declared security zone was set up by Israel in 1985
with the claimed aim of shielding its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to try to drive
the Israeli occupation troops out of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-square-meter zone is a flashpoint of frequent
roadside bomb attacks, rocket raids and fierce ground clashes.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israeli inner cabinet approved the U.N. resolution
425 and offered to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon
provided Lebanese government agrees to guarantee the security of
northern Israel by curbing cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, Syria which has great influence on Lebanon, have
rejected the offer and demanded an unconditional Israeli pullout
in light with the resolution.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Food Industry Continues Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Romanian food processing
industry has been shrinking since the beginning of the 1990s, with
the current outputs of main products being less than half of those
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Industries indicated that dairy production this year is expected
to plummet by 61 percent to 220 million liters from 560 million in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Domestic animal slaughtering is likely to drop 60 percent to
380,000 tons from 947,000 tons, while pastry production will fall
75 percent to 77,000 tons from 306,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, wine and beer outputs will go down by 33 percent and 13
percent respectively to 550 million and 910 million liters.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the continuous shrinking to large numbers
of corporate bankruptcies arising from economic
restructuring. Imported foreign goods have also squeezed the
uncompetitive local industries.

Thirteen years ago, Xie, 17, contracted middle ear infections

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday stressed the need for the leaders of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to focus on the
current economic chaos in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The currency trading and other short-term capital flows have
caused social and political instability, said Mahathir while
meeting with his Japanese counterpart Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who shared the view, called for the disclosure of
short-term investment funds. He said it is "important to seek
disclosure of such funds," a Japanese official said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has repeatedly blamed hedge funds and other
speculative investors for causing the prolonged financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The regional chaos is on the top agenda of the 6th APEC
informal leaders meeting which will begin here later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hongkong Bank to Start Services in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Bank plans to start
factoring and forfeiting services in India to help traders hedge
risks and finance the growing business, The Observer of Business
and Politics said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Hongkong Bank will start factoring and forfeiting services
early next year from Mumbai and will shortly extend them to other
parts of the country," the paper quoted Kersi Patel, local head of
the bank trade services as saying.
</P>
<P>
These services would help businesses operate without problems
of delayed payments, adequacy of cash flow, debt collection and
bad debts. Factoring helps in financing and collecting of account
receivable, provides finance for the seller by way of advance
payments and protect against default in payment by buyer.
</P>
<P>
Forfeiting is the discounting of export receivable due at a
future date by a forfeiter, mostly a bank, from an exporter on a
without recourse basis. It is used for specific export-related
transactions of medium to long-term maturity.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Bank is the first to offer export factoring services
in India and has already received Reserve Bank of India permission
for the service, Kersi Patel said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of APEC members
who are here for the annual APEC Leaders Meeting on Tuesday have
been trying to make most of their time through hectic bilateral
talks.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Monday spent eight
hours meeting eight leaders at the Palace of the Golden Horses,
the main venue for Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Mahathir met South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Chiang
Pin-Kuan from Chinese Taipei and Australia Prime Minister John
Howard.
</P>
<P>
He spent the afternoon meeting with Sultan of Brunei Muda
Hassanal Bolkiah, Philippine President Joseph Estrada, Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the leaders of Australia, the
Philippines and South Korea to meet Mahathir since the region was
plunged into a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The leaders discussed a spectrum of issues including APEC
matters, the financial crisis in Asia, political issues and
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his meeting with Kim, Mahathir said the South
Korean president hoped that Malaysia would continue its "Look East
Policy".
</P>
<P>
South Korea viewed the policy as a good mechanism to lift the
region out of the current economic predicament.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he had raised the issue of Anwar's arrest in his
lengthy discussion with Mahathir. He said Mahathir made an
explanation on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was not the only leader who had a very tight
schedule. Chinese President Jiang Zemin spent more than six hours
holding talks with five leaders.

the vice-presidency and Moi succession issues, rekindled by
Nassir's weekend proposal.
</P>
<P>
Nassir proposed that Lands Minister Katana Ngala be
appointed Kenyan Vice-President.
</P>
<P>
"The matter of a rotational vice-presidency, as suggested by
Nassir, had not featured anywhere in KANU's agenda but those
proposing candidates for such office are free to do so," East
African Standard Tuesday quoted Kamotho as saying.
</P>
<P>
"He is not talking on behalf of KANU, He is speaking as
Nassir," added the KANU secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> Experts Predict Birth Peak in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Experts predict that the year
2000 might possibly witness a peak in child births since an
increasing number of young couples hope to have their child
precisely at the turn of the century, according to today's Beijing
Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) recently announced that any
child born at 0:00 on January 1, 2000, will be a "Century Baby"
and as such will enjoy a series of "world-class" preferential
perks.
</P>
<P>
The gestation period to ensure the possibility of having a
"Century Baby" should fall between late March and early
April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Qu Chuanyan, a professor at the Women's and Children's
Healthcare Center at the No.1 Hospital under Beijing Medical
Sciences University, does not agree with the choice of many young
couples.
</P>
<P>
Qu, an expert on healthy births, said that having a "Century
Baby" does not necessarily ensure a healthy baby.
</P>
<P>
Qu pointed out giving birth to a child is a natural thing and
no artificial factors should be used to intervene.

<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- European countries should create
a defense agency of their own within the framework of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dini made the call at the opening ceremony of a two-day Western
European Union (WEU) foreign and defense ministers meeting, at
which the representatives from 18 WEU countries will discuss
defense cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Dini, whose country serves as the current rotating presidency
of WEU, said that while NATO is vitally important in protecting
the security of Europe, the continent itself should play a greater
role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said that European countries should establish a European
defense and security pillar within the NATO framework, which will
enjoy independent decision-making powers.
</P>
<P>
Dini emphasized that in addition to the monetary and economic
factors, political considerations should also constitute a very
important component of European integration.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the opening ceremony, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana welcomed the progress European countries have made
in establishing a European defense and security pillar.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Frontier Guards Jointly Control Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbin, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese frontier guards in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province recently joined hands with
their Russian counterparts in quelling illegal border crossings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese guards discovered clues that the management staff
of a Russian market was forging fake transit visas and immediately
notified their Russian guards, who arrested members of the gang.
</P>
<P>
This particular event was one of the many cases in which Chinese
and Russian frontier guards have engaged in joint efforts to quell
illegal border crossings and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"We most often exchange information by telephone, but on some
occasions we use signal flags," according to Shi Yejian,
director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Border Defence Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation and mutual assistance has enabled us to solve 288
cases of illegal border crossings, 2,800 criminal cases and a
large number of smuggling cases since 1991," said Shi.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang accounts for some 70 percent of the 4,300-km
border between China and Russia, the longest national border in
the world. Relations between the two countries has continued to
improve in recent years, with dozens of trading ports along the
border rapidly increasing trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in trade ports has also been accompanied by a
significant rise in entries and exits, as well as illegal border
activities such as smuggling," said Shi.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Russian governments signed a border management
agreement to cope with related problems, with China's Ministry of
Public Security and Russia's Border Defence Administration
reaching an agreement calling for cooperation in dealing with
border affairs.
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts of frontier guards from the countries have
protected the order and stability in border areas.
</P>
<P>
"The current annual frontier trade volume stands 500 million US
dollars, and a large part of the achievement should be attributed
to sound cooperation between the frontier guards," according to
Guo Xiaohua, an official in Suifenhe, a small border town with a
population of less than 50,000.

<P>
Manila, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The labor authorities and the
Public Attorney's Office (PAO) of the Philippines have forged an
agreement to facilitate legal service to the public, especially
poor workers, the Philippines News Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The joint effort of the National Labor Relations
Commission-Public Assistance Center (NLRC-PAC) and the PAO aims to
carry out the government's agenda of delivering direct and fast
services to the poor, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Records at the NLRC-PAC showed that indigent workers often
asked for the assistance of legal counsel to pursue their cases.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the NLRC may refer or endorse to the PAO
all persons seeking assistance involving legal matters, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The NLRC would provide office space for the representative of
the PAO in its main office to make the PAO accessible to the
public seeking legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the chief public attorney concerned would
assign the case or problem to the proper district public attorney
for immediate action.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Tuesday that his country has adopted "a positive
attitude" toward the entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
WTO will be an incomplete international organization without
such a big developing country like China, Jiang said in a meeting
with New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.
</P>
<P>
They are here to attend the 6th informal leaders meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum between November
17-18.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing country to enter WTO, China's rights and
obligations must be balanced," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
China will take gradual steps to open its market in keeping
with its own practical conditions and what can not be done for the
time being can be accomplished after the entry, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that New Zealand is the first Western country to
have concluded an agreement with China on the latter's WTO entry,
which has helped boost the two countries' economic ties.
</P>
<P>
"China and New Zealand have become important trade and
investment partners," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said she is happy with her country's relations with
China. The exchanges of visits by leaders of the two countries
have promoted mutual understanding and bilateral relations, she
added.
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated that New Zealand will stick firmly to the
one-China policy, which has been deep-rooted in her country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Government Pledges to Help Rural-Based </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
assist local and foreign entrepreneurs to set up plants in rural
areas in an effort to increase Zimbabwe's production bases and
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
A wider export base will enable local companies to import
capital goods and modernize their plants, Zimbabwean Minister of
Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira said at the opening of a
three-day workshop on the promotion of integrated rural-based
projects here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rural areas have to be developed so that they can become
markets for export, not only to remain as retailer outlets at
present, Tuesday's Herald newspaper quoted Shamuyarira as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Zimbabwe's domestic market has only 14
million people, hence it's necessary to find other markets for
export.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhiule, the rural areas can also be expected to create
employment for the thousands of unemployed people around the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government is exploring opportunities which
local companies can take advantage of, including existing markets
with neighboring countries like South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The government recognized the need to ratify the Southern
African Development Community trade protocol, explore the
European market and find ways to include new players into all
industries.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we add as much value as we can to our
products, and the companies who source raw materials from the
rural areas should set up their bases there and take advantage of
the resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
The concept of promoting rural-based projects should increase
the participation of rural areas in creating wealth for the
country, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the export processing zones
authority, reportedly will also look at opportunities in the
European vegetable market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Impose New Taxes for Rebuilding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A bill to obtain 2 billion taka
(about 41.2 million U.S. dollars) by levying new taxes to get
funding for post-flood rehabilitation was passed by the
Bangladeshi Parliament Monday night, The Financial Express daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria piloted the Post-Flood
Rehabilitation (Internal Resource Mobilization) Bill 1998 to
ratify the extra-budgetary fiscal measure.
</P>
<P>
The new taxes are for "symbolic participation" of the people in
the flood-rehabilitation program, alongside external aid, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"This amount will not bring about any big change, but it has a
wide significance in that the donors would be convinced that the
people here are also ready to face this terrible flood, thus
enhancing the country's image abroad," he told the house.
</P>
<P>
The additional tax would not affect common people since the
surcharges are being levied on E-mail, fax, phones and savings, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The bill was based on proposals approved by the cabinet on
October 19.
</P>
<P>
Additional revenue will be made by imposing a 5-percent tax on
telex, fax, telephone and E-mail bills; a 2-percent tax on the
interest or profit from savings certificates; and a 2-ercent tax
on the interest and profit of fixed and periodical deposits in
banks and other financial institutions. Also to be imposed are 100
taka (about 2.06 dollars) on all documents for registry
irrespective of valuation; a 4-percent additional supplementary
tax on those imported items which are already under the purview of
supplementary tax excepting certain items; and a 15-percent tax on
the fees for the issue and renewal of passports.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh this year experienced the worst floods in a century,
which gripped about two-thirds of the country for two and half
months and seriously affected more than 30 million people,
inflicting a preliminary estimated loss of about 4.3 billion
dollars.

<P>
WELLINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny
Shipley has failed to narrow the gap in support rates in polls for
her
National Party, the ruling party, and the Labor party, the major
opposition party in the country, since she became prime minister a
year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The National Party rated 32 percent in the TV3/CM poll taken
from
November 10 to 15, compared with 31 percent in October last year
under
ousted prime minister Jim Bolger, the Dominion reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was down three percentage points from the previous TV3/CM
poll,
taken between September 8 and 13, the Wellington-based newspaper
added.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party was well ahead on 49 percent support in the
latest
poll.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll results, the Labor Party with 49 percent
votes
plus the votes it gets from minor parties with less than five
percent of
the national vote, could have as many as 62 of the Parliament's
120 seats
to the National Party's 40.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that Shipley's personal rating was 15
percent,

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees Fewer Births </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Fewer New Zealanders were
born in
the past year, Statistics New Zealand figures show.
</P>
<P>
In a media release issued Tuesday, Statistics NZ said there
were
56,353 live births in the year to September 30, a decrease of 963
from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was partly because of a decrease in the number of
women of
child-bearing age, and partly because fewer of those women wanted
to be
pregnant, it added.
</P>
<P>
The annual birth rates showed that on average, New Zealand
women were
giving birth to 1.94 children, compared with the average of 1.96
children
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure was below the level of 2.1 children needed
for the
population to replace itself without migration, the release said.
</P>
<P>
During the same period fewer New Zealanders died. Registered
deaths
totaled 26,679, down 670 from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Because the live births fell by a greater margin than deaths,
the gap
between births and deaths, called the natural increase of the
population,
narrowed by one percent, dropping from 29,967 in 1997 to 29,674 in
1998.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Exports More Wool to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's wool fiber
exports to continental Europe increased 42 percent to 37,830 tons
in the year to September from 26,600 tons two years ago, the New
Zealand Wool Group said in its publication Wool Market, which was
released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Continental Europe is defined as the five countries of Germany,
 France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
According to the publication, Britain, a major market for New
Zealand's wool, imported 26,700 tons of wool fiber during the same
 period. This was up 48 percent from 18,050 tons in the year to
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Wool Market said that the increase in exports to
continental Europe in the past two years reverses a long-term
decline in NZ wool fiber direct exports to that part of the world.
From a peak of 76,000 tons in 1984-1985, wool exports to that
region fell to 27,600 tons in 1995-1996, a drop of 64 percent and
nearly 50,000 tons per annum.
</P>
<P>
"However, that trend now appears to have been reversed," it
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that New Zealand's total wool fiber exports in the
year to September were down "only marginally" in volume to
181,660 tons and down one percent in value to 904 million NZ
dollars (485 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Increases Arable Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A revised version of China's
national land-use plan has put the country's total arable land at
128 million hectares, about 26.7 million hectares more than the
previous figure.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Outlook magazine reported that the revised
overall land-use plan, drafted by the Ministry of Land and
Resources, is soon to be submitted to the State Council for
examination and approval.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is designed to curb decreases in arable land,
sets specific requirements for the possession of arable land, the
scale of basic farmland and the land available for construction.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the occupation of high quality arable land, the
ministry has stipulated that the basic farmland should account for
80 percent of related land in most regions, with the portion for
developed coastal areas raised to over 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to transform more than 33,000 hectares of
reclaimed land into lakes and another 2.67 million hectares into
forests and grassland in where desertification has emerged.
</P>
<P>
The arable land planned as such will ensure the country's grain
supply given the big population in China, the report said.

SHIJIAZHUANG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province recorded an import-export volume of 2.88 billion US
dollars for the first three quarters of the year, a 1.2-percent
drop on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the decrease mainly to the financial
crisis sweeping Asia.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell 1.6 percent to 2.26 billion US dollars, while
imports edged up by 0.5 percent to 621 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 58.6 percent of the exports in the period went to Asia,
down 68.4 percent on the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Latin America grew by 59 percent, with exports to
Europe growing by 31.7 percent and to North America by 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slow growth in foreign trade and rapidly changing markets
are expected to help accelerate efforts to optimize the local
export mix.
</P>
<P>
The province exported primary goods valued at 636 million US
dollars during the period, down 26 percent on the 1997
figure. However, exports of manufactured goods, machinery and

in spite of local government efforts to reduce the workload.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 300 primary and secondary school students
revealed an average 6.7 daily class periods lasting 45 minutes
each, with 80 percent of them spending an additional 1.6 morning

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Uses Deodorized Fenugreek in Diabetes Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A fat-free and deodorized
form of fenugreek, a traditional medicinal plant for diabetes
treatment, will dispel patients' worry about it pungent taste, a
U.S. pharmaceutical company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nutricept Inc., based in Dallas, said that its alternative
medicine with fenugreek, named Limitrol-DM, will help diabetes
patients maintain blood glucose control as an adjunct to diet or
prescription medication.
</P>
<P>
Nutricept said that studies in past decades had confirmed
fenugreek's blood glucose lowering effect. Recent studies deemed
the essential to preventing diabetes complications. Fenugreek, an
extremely potent fiber, has also been shown to lower cholesterol
and promote weight loss.
</P>
<P>
Fenugreek is an annual plant indigenous to North Africa and
widely cultivated in India. In the United States, fenugreek is on
the list of foods and spices generally recognized as safe.
</P>
<P>
However, in its raw form, fenugreek's taste and smell are
prohibitively pungent for the average Westerner, which has limited
its popularity, said Nutricept. The company has developed a form
that eliminates the offensive taste and odor.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, the medical food helps diabetes
patients control their blood glucose levels by diminishing the
rise in after-meal blood sugar by 40 percent. In pudding form, it
was clinically shown to reduce serum total cholesterol by 20
percent in just six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new diabetes remedy, the Journal of the
American Medical Association in its latest issue stresses that
emphasis must be placed on the need for convincing data on safety
and therapeutic efficacy. Nutricept said it has been addressing
these key issues through its product research.
</P>
<P>
According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes is a
serious disease affecting more than 16 million people in the
United States alone.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Urges Political Parties to Join "Forward March" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has urged political parties and people irrespective
of shades of opinion to join in the nation's "forward march" for
attaining economic emancipation, an English daily newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is time that all should work for building the nation," she
said in reply to "an ovation" from her cabinet colleagues on
Monday at a closed-door meeting, right after the regular cabinet
meeting was over, The Bangladesh Observer quoted reliable sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The action by the prime minister was taken after she announced
Sunday that the ruling Awmi League would never call hartal
(strike), "even it returned to the opposition."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of political parties have expressed different reaction
over Hasina's announcement. Some hailed it while others refrained
from giving any reaction.
</P>
<P>
Begum Khaleda Zia, leader of the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party and former prime minister, has refrained from
immediate reaction to Hasina's offer.
</P>
<P>
She told the ministers that "people's rights to vote freely has
been established and therefore hartal has become redundant," the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina directed officials to take integrated rural development
program for revitalizing the economy from the grassroots level to
accelerate the country's development.
</P>
<P>
She also asked them to draw up post-flood projects very fast
for getting speedy help from the donors.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has already received 756 million U.S. dollars for
relief and post-flood rehabilitation and reconstruction programs.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientist Being Victimized for Opposing N-tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Several scientists have
joined hands to oppose a move to punish one of them who spoke out
against India's nuclear tests, The Statesman reported here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A senior scientist of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences is
being victimized at the behest of the Department of Atomic Energy
(DAE) for having spoken his mind, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The move to punish Dr T. Jayaraman of the Chennai-based
institute was provoked by two events -- a letter signed by many
theoretical physicists and supposedly organized by him, protesting
weaponisation in the South Asian region and an article written by
him in "Seminar", criticizing the tests conducted in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
In an e-mail sent to the scientific community, two scientists
from the universities of Cologne, Germany and New York asked
scientists around the world to petition the director of the
Institute of Mathematical Sciences in support of Dr Jayaraman.
They pointed out that action against him would be violative of
basic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
In India, scientists from the Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research, Mumbai, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and
Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, have taken the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Last week, scientists at the Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research held an emergency meeting on campus and decided to
"alert" all scientists in the country through e-mail, so that they
could send appeals, either individually or on behalf of their
institutions, to the institute in support of Dr Jayaraman.
</P>
<P>
E-mail being circulated in the scientific community in the
country lists chronologically the events which led to Dr Jayaraman
being "threatened with a job termination."
</P>
<P>
Dr Jayaraman, along with several other scientists of India
numbering over 75, was a signatory to a statement on May 18,
protesting against India's nuclear tests.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Developed Countries Responsible for Handling Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Tuesday that to deal with financial crisis needs
global cooperation, and developed countries have irreplaceable
responsibility for that.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark while meeting with Singapore's Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong. "The financial crisis starting from
Southeast Asian countries last year has so far affected the whole
world. It has brought about severe challenges especially to the
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Consequences of the crisis is far more serious than expected.
Presently, it seems that it will take longer time for Southeast
and East Asian countries to walk out of the shadow of the
financial crisis," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese President, the financial crisis has
also affected China greatly and brought about some difficulties
for the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
But China will take up its duties and responsibilities and
stick to its promise of keeping the value of the Chinese yuan,
Jiang reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
"China will reach this year's goal of economic development
through expanding internal needs, and keep on the reforms
including the reform of the financial system," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Goh Chok Tong praised China's policy of keeping the value of
the Chinese yuan, holding that it's a big help to countries
severely affected by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the APEC Leaders Meeting have in-depth
discussions on taking effective measures and getting rid of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China attaches importance the relationship of
friendly cooperation with Singapore and its positive function in
international and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Expressing gratitude to Goh Chok Tong for the aids the
Singaporean government and people have given to the flood-stricken
areas of China, Jiang said that China is willing to join hands
with Singapore to boost the cooperation of mutual benefit in all
fields.

<HEADLINE> Thai Manufacturing Seen to Grow 4 Percent Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's manufacturing
sector next year is expected to grow by 4 percent because of an
increase in the export sector, particularly in electronics,
agriculture and light industries.
</P>
<P>
The trend in the real sector next year is expected to recover,
with a growth of more than 4 percent compared with a negative
growth this year, Chakramon Pasukvanich, deputy secretary of the
Board of Investment of Thailand (BOI), was quoted Tuesday by The
Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the manufacturing sector will help stimulate the
country's economic situation with positive growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
New investment next year will be seen in the electronics
industry as well as in the export sector of electronics and
agricultural products. There will be an expansion in existing
facilities of the BOI's projects to focus on export.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital will be injected through mergers and
acquisitions of Thai companies to solve the liquidity crunch, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The electronics sector will retain its major portion of the
country's exports. Car exports next year will jump from around
70,000 units to over 100,000 units. Apart from major car exporter
Mitsubishi, other car companies have started to emphasize exports,
including Toyota, Honda and Ford. BMW and Daimler Chrysler also
plan to use Thailand as their production base.
</P>
<P>
Potential agricultural products include canned seafood and
frozen chicken. There will be a slow growth trend for canned
pineapple and canned vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Light industries including footwear and garments will retain
their growth, but toys and jewelry will have negative growth.
</P>
<P>
Chakramon said steel and petrochemical industries next year
need to increase their exports to generate income to solve their
problem of debt burden and high interest repayment. The recovery
in the steel and petrochemical sectors also depends on debt
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Industries that focus on domestic consumption, including
construction and construction materials, will continue to face
negative growth and demand next year unless the government
approves a budget for infrastructure projects.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Chinese Indonesians Should Enjoy Equal Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Tuesday that Chinese Indonesians, after acquiring
the nationality of the Indonesia, have become members of the
country and they should enjoy equal treatment and rights as
ordinary Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
China doesn't have any "private interests" in the matters of
overseas Chinese and people with Chinese origin, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while meeting with President of Indonesia
Jusuf Habibie. Jiang believed that the President and Indonesian
government will understand the feelings and concerns of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that proper solution of the issue of Chinese
Indonesians will not only serve to the long-term stability of
Indonesia, but also to the smooth development of the relationship
of friendly cooperation between us two big neighboring countries,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said that Chinese Indonesians are all Indonesians, and
a member of the big multi-nationality family of the Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian government holds that the event which happened in
May was a kind of crime and that it doesn't tolerate this kind of
things to happen again.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Indonesia will deal with the event according
to law seriously.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Jiang said Indonesia is a friendly and
close neighbor of China. To further develop the bilateral
relationship is a set policy of China.
</P>
<P>
"Although the domestic situation of Indonesia has witnessed
drastic changes this year, the determination of the Chinese
government to consolidate and boost the bilateral relationship of
good neighborly and friendly cooperation doesn't change," Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said there doesn't exist fundamental conflict between
China and Indonesia, and that the economic construction of the
respective countries and the safeguarding of prosperity and
stability of the region are our common goals.

<HEADLINE> More NLD Members Resign in Myanmar: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 232 members of five
township branches of Myanmar's opposition National League for
Democracy (NLD) have resigned and five branches of the party have
dissolved since September, the official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NLD members, who resigned from the five township branches
in Rakhine, Mon, Kachin, Ayeyawady and Mandalay states and
divisions, are said to have made the move out of their own
volition since they had no desire to carry out the political
activities of the party.
</P>
<P>
The five NLD branches, which dissolved after September, include
three in Mrauk-U, Sittwe and Ponnagyun townships in remote western
Rakhine state and two in Thanpyuzayat and Bilin townships in
southern Mon state.
</P>
<P>
The NLD members and branches are said to have presented their
resignation and dissolution requests to their respective township
offices of the Multi-Party Democracy Election Commission formed to
supervise the general election held in May 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, the NLD headquarters based in Yangon, the capital
city, charged in a series of statements that the authorities have
been cracking down on the party, pressuring its detained members
to resign and some township branches to dissolve illegally and
forcibly.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that "it could not accept the
dissolution (of the branches) at all," adding that "as a branch of
the party, it has no right to do so without the knowledge of the
Central Headquarters."
</P>
<P>
It also said that the move goes against the Political Parties
Registration Law designed by the authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said that the authorities were "illegally" using people
from all walks of life who were under "pressure" to express the
"people's desire" and this created further political confusion.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that it reserves the right to organize similar
mass rallies to present facts on the current situation in Myanmar
as a legal political party.
</P>
<P>
The NLD won the 1990 general election, contested by 93
political parties, with 396 parliamentary seats out of 485.

"From what I can determine, it's not legal. It sounds like he

would marry somebody that was intoxicated to the point that they
couldn't speak or stand had ulterior motives of some sort."

<HEADLINE> Czech Tourism Continues to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's tourism
continued to drop during the first nine months of this year, with
78.6 million foreign tourists visiting the country, a figure down
2.9 percent from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released Monday by the State Statistic
Bureau, September saw a decline of 8.5 percent in the number of
the foreign tourists visiting the country, while the number of
Czech citizens travelling abroad dropped 3.7 percent in the nine
months.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Czech tourism revenues fell 10.5 percent to 3.65
billion U.S. dollars from an unprecedented 4 billion dollars in
1996, when the number of foreign tourists hit a record high of
more than 100 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the share of tourism revenues in the gross domestic
product (GDP) sagged from 7.3 to 7 percent. Foreign trade
earnings also fell from 18.8 percent to 16.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Czech tourism, which is one of the country's backbone
industries and main sources of hard currency earnings, developed
rapidly from 1992, but started to fall in 1997 because of the
world economic turmoil and the poor quality of tourism services,
due especially to the financial crises in Southeast Asia and
Russia.

<HEADLINE> APEC Should Stick to Economic Issues, Says Goh </HEADLINE>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said here Tuesday that leaders who want to
bring up political issues should do so at bilateral meetings
rather than using the regional economic forum of APEC
(Asia-pacific economic Cooperation).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here after a bilateral meeting with Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, Goh said that the regional economic
forum should stick to economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Goh was referring to a statement by U.S. Vice President Al Gore
on the "Reformation Movement" against the government launched by
former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim after he was
dismissed in early September.
</P>
<P>
Gore said on Monday night at a dinner participated by over
1,000 government officials and captains of industry that those who
were involved in the "Reformation Movement" were the "brave people
of Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
Gore's remarks have been met with strong rebuke from Malaysian
government officials. Malaysian Works Minister Samy Vellu and the
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz criticized
Gore for the remarks, saying it had spoiled the mood of APEC.
They urged Gore to retract the statement.

Gore is here to represent President Bill Clinton at the Sixth
APEC Economic Leaders' Informal Meeting on November 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Oil, Gold Prices Fall Sharply on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Oil and gold prices fell
sharply Monday on U.S. market after tensions between the United
States and Iraq eased without a military confrontation, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for December
delivery fell by 75 cents to 12.82 U.S. dollars a barrel, the
lowest since August 13. December heating oil fell by 1.71 cents
to 36.15 cents a gallon; December unleaded gasoline fell by 1.48
cents to 39.57 cents a gallon; and December natural gas fell by
15.4 cents to 2.305 dollars for each 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
World oil supplies have been swollen this year by
overproduction as well as weaker demand from once-booming East
Asia. But prices rose above 14 dollars a barrel last week as the
U.S. threatened to strike Iraq if the latter failed to cooperate
with the United Nation's arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices also ended lower after the crisis was defused. At
the New York Mercantile Exchange, December gold ended down 90
cents at 295.6 dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Market participants said as the threat of military action has
been averted, there seems no immediate need to buy the precious
metal against inflation.

<HEADLINE> Italian, NATO Officials Satisfied Over Iraq's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema and Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Javier Solana on Monday expressed their
satisfaction over Iraq's decision to allow the resumption of
United Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after meeting with Solana, who came here
for a West European Union summit scheduled to begin later Monday,
D'Alema said he and Solana hoped Iraq would now behave in
accordance with the decision announced by its leader, Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
During their discussions, the two leaders voiced satisfaction
because President Saddam has yielded to the U.N. requests,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors were ordered back to Iraq on Sunday
after its leader wrote to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
offering unconditional compliance with international demands.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's move averted an United States bombing offensive which
Italy had sought to avoid through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also said he discussed with Solana the issues of
NATO enlargement to the Southeast of Europe and Europe's role
in its own defence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the discussions produced "strong agreement" on the
alliance's objectives.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders are scheduled to meet for a summit next March
which will sanction the entry of Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic into the alliance. Italy wants this intake to be
followed quickly by other East European countries such as Romania
and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, D'Alema noted that Italy was already moving to
develop security ties on the southern fringes of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I told the secretary general about Italy's commitment to
improving security in the Adriatic and the Ionian because
stability in this area is key to the security not only of Italy,
but also of Europe," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Export Value Likely to Increase Slightly Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to
achieve a slight growth in exports next year, from the estimated
57 billion U.S. dollars this year and 58 billion dollars last
year, according to Boontipa Simaskul, inspector-general of the
Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Boontipa declined to reveal the exact growth expected next
year, but said she believed growth was viable as export-related
problems, such as tight liquidity, were being resolved.
</P>
<P>
The government has implemented a range of measures covering
finance, loan assistance from overseas and debt restructuring, to
streamline the financial system and inject funds into the
manufacturing and export sectors, the Bangkok Post Tuesday quoted
Boontipa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Boontipa said government measures already implemented would
begin to bear fruit next year.
</P>
<P>
Government measures to aid exporters include action to reduce
production costs to increase the country's competitiveness,
industrial restructuring, encouraging exporters to find new
markets, and promotion of the export of value-added products.
</P>
<P>
"Those measures could stimulate the country's export activities
next year. If the world's economic and financial situation doesn't
worsen, Thai exports in dollar denominations will increase," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Boontipa said she recognized that exports in dollar terms would
fall by the end of this year but would improve in baht terms.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, Thailand's exports in
dollar terms were 40.624 billion dollars, down 5.6 percent from
the same period last year. In baht terms, exports totaled 1,700
billion baht, up 44.1 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Farming activities such as
growing vegetables and raising pigs have been used to rehabilitate
Chinese mental patients, according to today's Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Chaoyang District is currently constructing a farming
rehabilitation center which stresses psychological counselling
needed to rehabilitate mental patients.
</P>
<P>
Beijing reportedly has a 340,000 mental patients. However, the
city has less than a dozen mental hospitals with merely 8,000
beds. The lack of beds has seriously hampered the rehabilitation
capabilities of mental health centers.
</P>
<P>
The Chaoyang rehabilitation center will not only feature a
clinic, medical facility and physical fitness center, but will
also offer more agricultural activities related to fish ponds,
greenhouses and vegetable gardens.
</P>
<P>
Mental patients will work on voluntary basis with income based
on work contributed.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts note the good environment will promote
rehabilitation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The center's fees are only a third of normal charges at regular
hospitals.

<HEADLINE> News Print Smuggling in China Getting Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The news print smuggling in
China is getting worse, China Light Industry News reports.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Guangzhou Customs seized 1,146
tons of smuggled news print worth 6.67 million yuan, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
Some companies in the United States, Canada, and the Republic
of Korea have sold news print abroad at lower prices, for as much
as 120 to 180 U.S. dollars per ton cheaper than in their own
countries.
</P>
<P>
That brought the average import price for every ton of news
print to 350 U.S. dollars in 1997, compared with 649 dollars in
1995. The standard international price in 1997 was 550 dollars.
</P>
<P>
It also pushed up news print imports in China to 356,000 tons
in 1996 from 49,000 tons in 1995. Imports continued to increase in
1997. And in the first seven months of this year, 7,272 tons of
news print entered China through Guangzhou, more than the total
imports for 1997 through that area.

<HEADLINE> "Time Bank" for Elderly in Northern China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Northern China's Shanxi
Province has set up a "time bank" for the elderly in the capital
city, Taiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Any elderly person can become a member of the "bank" by just
filling in a form, and the "bank" will then ask them to offer free
help to other old people when they have spare time and they
themselves can get help from others at any time.
</P>
<P>
According Miss Xu, who is in charge of the project, the "time
bank" is set up by the Taiyuan Telecommunications Bureau and a
local advertising company to help the elderly make better use of
their spare time.
</P>
<P>
She said that the number of old people is growing, as is the
proportion of the elderly among the population as a whole. This
kind of project can better help the elderly because many young
people are busy with their work and don't have time to take care
of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The project is also developed so that people above the age of
85 who do not have children can get care.
</P>
<P>
This kind of organization first appeared in Japan, which has an
aging society.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of Leonid meteors were
observed early Tuesday morning in the sky above Beijing, Nanjing
and Wuhan cities in eastern China, according to the Beijing
Astronomical Observatory (BAO) and the Nanjing Purple Mountain
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
"Some 100 meteors per hour were observed after midnight in
urban Beijing, with even more spotted by astronomers benefitting from
better conditions at the BAO Xinglong Station in Hebei Province,"
one BAO spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"I witnessed a number of fireballs, or shooting stars, which
were bright enough to illuminate the faces of observers at the
station," according to Zhu Jin, a leading astronomer for the
station's Leonid Meteor Storm (LMS) observations.
</P>
<P>
"I even saw a bright fireball as late as 07:00 this morning,"
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers are more optimistic about conditions for viewing
the LMS early Wednesday morning following Tuesday observations.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 amateur stargazers in Beijing, along with 100
Chinese and foreign researcher, plan to watch the LMS early
tomorrow morning at the BAO's Shahe and Miyun stations in suburban
Beijing and at the BAO Xinglong Station.

<HEADLINE> Italy Maintains Life Sentences for Ex-Nazi Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 16, (Xinhua) -- The Court of Cassation, the high
court of Italy, maintained the life sentence verdict on two former
German Nazi officers Monday for their involvement in Italy's worst
massacre during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Erich Priebke, 84, a former Schutzstaffel captain, and Karl
Hass, a former major, were sentenced to life imprisonment by the
Italian court-martial on March 3.
</P>
<P>
Lawers of the defendants called for the repeal of the sentence,
arguing that the two former officers were merely carrying out
orders of their superiors.
</P>
<P>
The high court announced its decision after four and a half
hours of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
On March 24, 1944, German troops rounded up 335 Italians and
shot them dead in the outskirts of Rome in retaliation for the 33
German soldiers killed the day before in a bomb attack carried out
by Italian guerillas.
</P>
<P>
The execution -- 10 Italians for each German soldier killed --
was ordered by the German commandant in Rome, Major Herbert
Kappler, with the additional five victims shot because of a
clerical error made by Priebke.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was tracked down by a U.S. television network in May
1994 in Argentina and extradited to Italy one and a half years
later. Hass, who initially came to Rome as a witness, was found
guilty and arrested in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The victims' families supported the high court's decision, but
lawers for the two defendants said they would seek presidential
remission.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Works Minister
S. Samy Vellu Tuesday asked U.S. Vice President Al Gore to retract
his statement supporting the anti-government "reformation
movement" in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Gore said at a dinner Monday night for over 1,000 government
officials and captains of industry from the Pacific Rim that the
people who had been involved in the "reformation Movement" were
the "brave people of Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
The "reformation movement" was launched by former Malaysian
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim after he was sacked early September.
</P>
<P>
Describing Gore's remarks as a "blantant interference in
Malaysia's internal affairs, Samy Vellu said that Gore's remarks
had irked many Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Samy Vellu said Gore's statement was "a serious deviation from
the accepted principle of non-interference of one democratic
country into the internal affairs of another.
</P>
<P>
"His statement is uncalled for and unprecedented in the history
of Malaysia and of a vice president of the United States," Samy
Vellu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that a person holding the second highest
office in the U.S. and an experienced politician has fallen prey
to wrong advise," the Malaysian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Gore is here for the sixth informal meeting of Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders on November 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Increases Timber Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has imported 17,000
cu.m. of timber since July, up 200 percent on the same 1997
period, with imports of plywood rising nearly 61 percent to
55,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to the country's campaign against
smuggling in place since the national anti-smuggling conference
held in July.
</P>
<P>
The city's timber imports for the January-October period grew
77 percent on an yearly basis to top 192,000 cu.m., with the
volume for plywood rising 14.7 percent to 117,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
China has witnessed an increasing demand for timber due to the
damage resulting from this year's devastating summer flooding, and
measures introduced to prohibit logging in order to control soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
Major timber importers such as Japan and the Republic of Korea
have reduced imports due to the financial crisis engulfing
Asia. On the other hand, however, major timber producers such as
Malaysia and Cambodia have increased timber exports to China in
order to offset losses resulting from the crisis.

<HEADLINE> China's Beer Brewers Criticized for Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) --China's rapidly growing beer
business needs to tackle problems like overproduction and
packaging for healthier development, according to "China Light
Industry News."
</P>
<P>
The paper reports that, by 1997, China had gained a
24-million-ton capacity in its breweries and produced almost 19
million tons of beer last year.
</P>
<P>
But, although output went up, average earnings per ton dropped
50 yuan from the 1996 level, and this year about 50 percent of the
breweries are losing money.
</P>
<P>
China is now No.2, after the United States, in beer output in
the world. It is estimated that the country's beer output will
exceed 20 million tons by next year, so developing the market
through more market research while controlling production
capacity is essential, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that more groups, lead by famous brands, be
established. China had 550 breweries by 1997, only 50 of which
belonged to conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
A greater effort needs to be made to improve quality, develop
new products, and increase environmental protection awareness, the
paper concludes.

<P>
LIMA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Bolivia will sign an
agreement in December on the construction of a pipeline to
transfer liquefied gas from La Paz in Bolivia to the docks of the
Peruvian port of Ilo, press reports said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, measuring 420 kilometers, will extend over 300
kilometers in Peru and 120 kilometers in Bolivia, Bolivian
Ambassador to Peru Jorge Gumucio said in Monday's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Gumucio said a memorandum on the pipeline had been signed last

and 120 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the final agreement would be signed in the
second week of December during Bolivian President Hugo Banzer's
trip to Peru.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia also wants Peru to give it a concession to build
maritime installations to the south of the port of Ilo so that
Bolivia will be able to sell its liquefied gas abroad and in Peru.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Banzer is expected to reiterate his support
for the joint infrastructure programs in Ilo which were agreed on
by the two countries back in 1992, including an unfinished highway
between La Paz and the port.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Calls for Albanians' Turnout in Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N.
Under-Secretary-General Vladimir Petrovsky Monday called on the
Albanians to take part in the November 22 referendum on the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on human rights held in
Tirana, Prtrovski said he hopes all Albanian citizens will turn
out in the forthcoming referendum as the constitution is the basic
law ensuring human rights of the international standards.
</P>
<P>
The constitution to be voted on was drafted earlier this year
and is expected to fill up the vacancy following the annulment in
1990 of the former basic law.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution prescribes that Albania shall be a
democracy with a market economy, which guarantees private
property, human rights and the separation of the legislative,
executive and judicial powers.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Democratic Party has urged boycott of the
vote, saying that it would not recognize the outcome of the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Albanian President Rexhep Meidani on Monday,
Prtrovski said the international conference held on October 30 in
Tirana showed that the international community was much concerned
with Albania.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.N. official believed that the Albanian people
would be able to demonstrate their political maturity through
their own judgement.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A priceless Sri Lankan
artifact, the Thara Devi bronze statue dating back to the 5th
century BC, has been stolen from the Anuradhapura Archaeological
Museum in North Central Province, according to reports reaching
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This happened in a spate of similar thefts of artifacts and
vandalism of historic archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
Although the security guards who were on duty have been
arrested by the police, no further headway has been made. It has
not been established when and how it disappeared, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The missing statue was kept in a glass case with similar other
statues. The statue was found missing by a guard last Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The statue in a sitting position is three and a half inches in
height and two and a half inches in width.
</P>
<P>
The police suspect that this priceless statue had been smuggled
out of the museum, police sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The museum is open to the public every day from 8 a.m. to 5:45
p.m. There are about 15 guards for each section.
</P>
<P>
After the museum closes for the day the security guards are
expected to check every artifact and inform the officer in charge
of the museum. The keys are then handed over to police custody,
the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
Anuradhapura, over 200 kilometers from Colombo, is capital of
North Central Province. This ancient capital is foremost among the
Buddhism sacred cities in the country, dating back 2,500 years
with a glorious past of culture and heritage.

MANAGUA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua has lost 90,000
U.S. dollars in its banana export earnings in the aftermath of
Hurricane Mitch, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 170,000 crates of bananas due to be exported have been
held up in the border town of El Guasaule in the past three weeks
because of the hurricane, the Nicaraguan banana producers'
association said.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua traditionally exported its bananas to Europe and the
United States through the ports of Puerto Castilla and Puerto
Cores of Honduras, the worst hit by Mitch in its ravage of Central
America.

BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has sent troops and
Border Patrol Police to destroy opium plants in mountainous areas
of the golden triangle before the harvest.
</P>
<P>
The target is to destroy up to 60 percent of plants cultivated
on 10,000 rai (1,600 hectares) of land in Chiang Mai, Mae Hong
Son, Tak, Chiang Rai and Phayao provinces, northern Thailand, the
Bangkok Post Tuesday quoted Lt. Gen. Sommai Vichavorn, commander

</P>
<P>
Hilltribe people who grow poppy have introduced modern
technology which allows for year-round cultivation and improved
yields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Destroying the crop is time-consuming and labor-intensive
because the plants are being grown in small plots over a wide
area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Sirichai Suwansiri, director of Northern Narcotic
Prevention and Suppression Coordinating Center, said there were
2,000 rai (320 hectares) of poppy in Mae Hong Son province. So far
only 200 rai (32 hectares) had been destroyed, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Launch Joint Initiative to Help Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Japan launched a joint initiative here Monday night to help Asian
nations affected by the economic crisis obtain financing to revive
their banking systems and remove obstacles to restructuring.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since the crisis which began in July
1997 that the United States has come forward to help the troubled
economies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who is here representing President
Bill Clinton to attend the 6th APEC Leaders Meeting, said the
initiative, known as the Asian Growth and Recovery Program (AGRP),
would be implemented with the help of Asian Development Bank and
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Gore announced this at the APEC Business Summit dinner at the
Putra World Trade Center in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Both countries and the two banks are working together to
mobilize five billion U.S. dollars initially to help private
financing for countries in the region which have put comprehensive
restructuring program in place.
</P>
<P>
The AGRP consists of four main components which are
accelerating the pace of bank and corporate restructuring;
increased trade finance to give Asian companies greater access to
funds needed to revive production and create jobs; efforts to
mobilize new private sector capital to help Asian companies
rebuild their balance sheets; and, enhancing technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Details of the program will be finalized in a meeting in Tokyo
next month, bringing together senior officials and technical
experts from the United States, Japan and other Asian economies
and multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the financial crisis was not just about weakness in
particular nations. "It demands that we strengthen the operations
of the entire international financial system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Vice President said it was urgent that greater transparency
and openness was brought into the international economic system.

<HEADLINE> Kurds in Sofia on Hunger Strike Over Leader's Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Twenty Kurds were on the third
day of a hunger strike here Monday to protest against the arrest
of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leader Adullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"Our protest will continue indefinitely," Said Sipan, a
representative of the strikers, was quoted by Bulgarian Telegraph
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Learning that Ocalan went on a hunger strike immediately after
his arrest at Rome airport on November 13, Kurds gathered at the
cultural and information center on Kurdistan in central Sofia and
followed suit, Sipan said.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the Italian authorities release Ocalan or
grant him political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 100 Kurdish residents in Moscow and about
50 Kurdish leaders in the Armenian capital of Yerevan have also
been on separate hunger strikes since Saturday in support of
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, some 700 Kurds reportedly marched through Yerevan to
the United Nations representative office to press for his release.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for Kurdish autonomy in
Turkey. Some 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year-old
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested in Rome on a Turkish warrant after stepping
off a plane from Moscow, where he had fled after being expelled
from Syria. Russia denied him asylum. Italy has yet to decide
whether to grant him refuge.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan has been put on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges
of leading a terrorist organization, threatening the country's
territorial integrity and ordering killings. The charges can
bring the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Kurds demonstrated in support of Ocalan in Rome
and in towns across Germany over the weekend.

</P>
<P>
Lacoste's products are too expensive for Chinese right now, but
China's market potential is unparalleled, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first store in China to sell Lacoste clothing opened in

</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of China's progress in clothing
production, saying that the quality of loosely woven shirts made
here is up to French standards.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for End to Redundant Rural Power Grid Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Redundant construction in
China's vast rural area has a bad effect on the ability to improve
power grids and needs to be avoided, according to Zou Yanyu, an
economist with the Hunan Electric Company.
</P>
<P>
Zou told Xinhua today that the central government has listed
rural power grid construction as one of the infrastructure
priorities and will spend 130 billion yuan over the next three
years on this.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by Zou's company found that hundreds of millions
of yuan had been spent on redundant low-voltage substations and
transmission lines, most of which do not comply with provincial
government plans.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that this redundancy is a waste of funds and leads to
economic inefficiency, which in turn will drive power suppliers to
raise prices, and that this goes against the original reason for
investment, which includes cutting the price of electricity in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient local studies and planning should be done before
construction work takes place, he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Upbeat About Latin America's Response to Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Managing Director of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus said
Monday he was "optimistic" about Latin America's response to the
worldwide financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic. I believe that what the countries have done
and what is being done throughout the world to contain the crisis
give us a possible exit" and avoid too prolonged consequences,
Camdessus said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been "impressed" by the fact that Latin American
countries did not wait for international aid to counter the
crisis, but were organizing a meeting of their finance ministers
and central bank presidents to work out appropriate measures.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that Latin America's reaction proved that the
region's economies were "out of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
He noted that an IMF rescue package for Brazil "gives an idea
of the magnitude of the support the international community is
ready to give to voluntary and healthy policies to resist the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said Latin American economies would benefit from the support
package given to Brazil in exchange for a strict austerity
policy.

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
submitted its pilot projects to help special groups of people use
"easy euro" at the time of transition to the euro, the European
Commission said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that for the first time they proposed the
projects for evaluating specific difficulties which may arise for
three target groups: the elderly, the socio-economically
disadvantaged, as well as the blind and persons with impaired
vision.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 working parties, each composed of 15 of these persons,
have been set up in Belgium, France and Italy, aiming to create
between now and mid-1999 a source of information and training on
the euro, based on their own experiences and work, adapted to
their needs, practices and their methods of expression and
communication, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
This source, once established, will be made available to all EU
members.

<HEADLINE> Sika Does Fails in Attempt to Kill Twin Offspring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A Sika doe in a park in
northeastern China's Liaoning Province recently failed in an
attempt to kill her twin offspring, apparently for a better life.
</P>
<P>
The doe gave birth to twins, a male and a female, on November
11 at the Dalian Labor Park. An attendant discovered the new
arrivals on the morning of the second day and noted that the doe
was attempting to use her body to suffocate the twins.
</P>
<P>
The twins were separated from their mother and timely medical
treatment greatly improved their condition within a short
time. The male, the largest twin, was able to drink milk and his
body temperature rose somewhat. The female twin failed to
immediately respond to treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to the park's director, the breeding season of Sika
deer normally occurs in May or June, with most doe having only one
offspring. He noted a November birth was extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
He said the mother quite likely tried to kill the twins fearing
they would be unable to survive the cold winter and the lack of
milk.
</P>
<P>
Sika deer are listed as a first-class animals under state
protection. The park is home to 21 Sika deer.

<P>
SANTIAGO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chilean ambassador to Spain
Sergio Pizarro will remain in Santiago for the time being amid
wrangling over Madrid's bid to try former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet, the Chilean government said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is public knowledge that relations have been affected by a
Spanish judge's extradition request against Augusto Pinochet,"
Vice-Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pizarro would return to Madrid "soon," but did not say
exactly when.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador was recalled to Santiago on November 6 as a sign
of the Chilean government's protest against the extradition
request by Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon.
</P>
<P>
Garzon, who is investigating human rights abuses during
Pinochet's reign, earlier called for Pinochet's detention in
London.
</P>
<P>
A British court has declared Pinochet, detained over one month
ago, to have immunity as a former head of state. The House of
Lords will confirm or revoke Pinochet's immunity this week.

<HEADLINE> Armed Groups' Remnants Turn In to Government in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 16 members of
various anti-government armed groups in Myanmar laid down their
arms to surrender to the government in October, the official New
Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These armed groups' remnants, including those from the ethnic
Kayin National Union (KNU), the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front (ABSDF) and the People's Liberation Front (PLF), "exchanged
arms for peace" with the government in different military command
areas.
</P>
<P>
While in armed opposition to the Myanmar government, the KNU
and the ABSDF reportedly operate on the Myanmar-Thai border.
</P>
<P>
In April, former KNU central committee member Phado Aung San
defected to the government side with more than 200 of his men in
Hpa-an, Kayin state.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1988, a total of 17 anti-government ethnic armed
groups in the country have made peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
The government said it still permits the turned-in armed groups
to retain their arms for "self-protection and area-defense."

<HEADLINE> Surprising Graf Earns Berth in Tour Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But after beating 10 consecutive foes, including world No. 1
Lindsay Davenport of the United States and No. 2 Martina Hingis
of Switzerland, the 29-year-old superstar now has an eye on a
closer prize: the Chase Championships, which begin today in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Davenport and Hingis, who are locked in a down-to-wire fight
for the year-end No. 1 ranking, are the top seeds at the
16-player season finale.
</P>
<P>
Graf will play No. 3 Jana Novotana of the Czech Republic on
Tuesday in the first round. No. 5 Monica Seles of the United
States opens Wednesday against Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
Graf earned the final berth Thursday after Ai Sugiyama of
Japan lost at the Advanta Championships and No. 5 Venus Williams
of the United States withdrew because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Graf won her second consecutive and 106th career title Sunday,
beating Davenport in the Advanta Championships final in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
"To be able to qualify for the Championships even though I
didn't play much this year is a big surprise," Graf said. "If you
had seen me four weeks ago, you would have said, "Wow how did
that happen?"
</P>
<P>
Graf's coach Heinz Gunthardt says: "Two weeks ago, I doubt if
she even thought about qualifying for the Chase. It just wasn't
something she aimed to."
</P>
<P>
Graf's recent winning spree undoubtedly became sweeter after
she beat former No. 1 Hingis Friday. When Hingis became No. 1
last year, the 18-year-old dismissed Graf as a challenger,
saying: "Steffi has had some results in the past, but it's a
faster, more athletic game now than when she player. She is old
now. Her time has passed."
</P>
<P>
Graf has been the women's tour's dominant player during her
16-year career. In 1988, she became the only player, man or
woman, to win the four grand slam. She also is the only player to
win each of the four grand slam event four times.
</P>
<P>
Her 21 grand slam titles is three shy of the record held by
Margaret Court. She also holds the record for career earnings
with 20,489,142 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nottingham Forest Draw Derby County in Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dutch international, who came back to the Midlands club
two weeks ago after refusing to play in the opening months of the
season, put Forest 2-1 up when he headed home Scott Gemmill's
corner in the 62nd minute.
</P>
<P>
But Forest's hopes of a first league win since August lasted
just 10 minutes, Argentine defender Horacio Carbonari scoring his
first goal for Derby to make it 2-2.
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing first half Derby had gone ahead in the
56th minute when Thierry Bonalair tripped Dean Sturridge in the
box and Tony Dorigo calmly stroked in the penalty.
</P>
<P>
The lead lasted only two minutes, Dougie Freedman tucking away
the rebound after Derby goalkeeper Russell Hoult had blocked his
initial shot.
</P>
<P>
Then came Van Hooijdonk's goal, which the Dutchman celebrated
virtually alone as most of his disgruntled team mates showed what
they thought of his self-imposed exile by refusing to
congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
Hoult was taken to hospital later for precautionary X-rays
after being knocked unconscious in a collision.
</P>
<P>
The point lifted Forest one place, up to third-last in the
standings. Derby remain eighth.

BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry sector
grew by 9.9 percent during the first nine months of this year
compared to the same period last year, with the total output value
standing at 4,164.12 billion yuan, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The sector's value-added hit 642.8 billion yuan, up 8.5 percent

</P>
<P>
A report released by the State Statistics Bureau indicated
increased output for 13 of 25 major light industrial products,
including air conditioners, soft drinks and vacuum cleaners.
</P>
<P>
Production fell for 12 products, including electric ovens, salt
and bicycles.
</P>

The idea, first mooted at the end of September, will see
Antwerp acting as a 'feeder' club to make it easier for United to
attract talented youngsters from outside the European Union to
Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United Secretary Paul Bastio told BBC Radio 5 Live
that the idea had developed following a meeting between the two
club chairmen in 1996.
</P>
<P>
United youngster Danny Higginbotham, a 19-year-old defender,
is already on loan at Antwerp and United manager Alex Ferguson
and director Maurice Watkins traveled to Belgium on Monday to
conclude a "memorandum of co-operation" between the clubs.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC on Monday, details of the financial
arrangement between the two clubs have not been revealed but
Bastio said: "Let's say that each side will bear the financial
burden according to its possibilities."
</P>
<P>
Current regulations mean the UK government will not grant work
permits to non-EU players unless they have been capped by their
country at senior international level and even then, will not
renew them unless a player appears in 75 per cent of a club's
games in the first season.
</P>
<P>
The scheme would see players spending two seasons in Belgium
to earn EU citizenship and then moving to United without
restriction.
</P>
<P>
"What we are hoping to achieve here is a co-operation with
Royal Antwerp which will work for the benefit of our respective
footballing businesses.
</P>
<P>
"It will enable us to have a look at players from outside the
European Union through the medium of the Antwerp team, whereas at
the moment we cannot look at players - particularly young players
-because of the immigration rules and Premier League rules," said
Watkins.
</P>
<P>
The two clubs will be able to play each other competitively in
Europe if drawn to face each other in future despite the link-up.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of that being a problem because
Manchester United would not be obtaining any interest in Royal
Antwerp, so there is no conflict with any of UEFA's rules and
regulations with regard to their competitions," Watkin added.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Nets 33 Million Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The money, which is donated to the Lawn Tennis Association
LTA) for the improvement of the British game, was due to improved
TV and merchandising income, plus a record 13-day crowd of
424,998, almost 20,000 up on the previous record.
</P>
<P>
The semi-final between Tim Henman, the British number one, and
Pete Sampras, the world number one, ranked as one of the top
televised sporting events of the year, attracting an audience of
12 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
The LTA also reported increased sales of merchandise at the
championships featuring both Henman and the injured Greg Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
LTA chief executive John Crowther said: "At a time when Tim
and Greg are once again raising the profile of tennis outside the
Wimbledon period, we can reflect on the progress of the world's
most successful tennis tournament and the contribution it makes
to the improving health of the game in this country.
</P>
<P>
"The revenue from the championships enables the LTA to
continue its commitment to improve the tennis infrastructure and
help more players to a world-class standard.
</P>
<P>
"However, the LTA must also generate other sources of income
in order to sustain the kind of investment needed to catch up
with other leading tennis nations in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Crowther said that 8.5 million pounds (about 14.1 million U.S.
dollars had been spent this year on staging events, tournaments
and national coaching in support of the top 180 players.

That represents a useful display by Fu, who despite his fine

Fu reeled off four frames without reply with two breaks of 83

ALGIERS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman of the Algerian
Foreign Ministry Abdul-Aziz Sab'e on Monday expressed his
country's relief over the peaceful end of the standoff between
Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Iraqi recent decision on the resumption of
cooperation with the U.N. would open new horizons for lifting the
embargo on the brotherly people of Iraq," Sab'e said at a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Iraq agreed to unconditionally resume cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors, thus averting a possible military
strike threatened by the U.S. and Britain to force Iraqi
compliance.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian official noted that Algeria always highlighted the
necessity of respecting Iraq's sovereignty and territorial safety
as well as the necessity of integrating Iraq into the Arab family.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis between Iraq and the U.N. was triggered by
Iraq's decision on October 31 to halt all cooperation with the
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM verifies that Iraq has

BUCHAREST, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A first bank of tissue and
bones, necessary for the transplants to the injured with serious
orthopedical illness, is set up recently in Romania at the
Bucharest Central Military Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of this bank is "absolutely necessary since
it can keep up the necessary biological material for the
transplant aiming to resolve the serious injury cases, tumors or
congenital deformities," the national Rompres news agency Monday
quoted the Orthopedics clinic's chief dr. Silviu Diaconescu as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Certain tissues were preserved until now from the patient or his
family members, but some times they did not match or were repelled
by the injured. Now, the people in sufferance could be replaced
large tissues or bones without problems, and the injured could be
saved from cutting off.
</P>
<P>
The donor could be a living person for certain tissues, when
for most of the cases a dead, Diaconescu said, stressing that
donation is made on the basis of an analyses record aiming to
notice the presence of hepatitis B and C, the HIV virus and the
malaria, the nervous degenerative illness or tumors.
</P>
<P>
Biological materials collected up now are sufficient for about
10 transplant operations, Diaconescu added.

<HEADLINE> Duma Not to Ratify Start-2 Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, or the
lower house of parliament, can hardly ratify the Start-2 treaty,
for many factions are to vote against the ratification, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Itar-Tass, Vladimir Volkov, a member of
the Duma defense committee, said that in the run-up to hearings on
Start-2 due in late November, many factions in Duma showed
opposition to the treaty's ratification.
</P>
<P>
Volkov said, "I guess no qualified majority will be gained in a
vote for ratification of this document. Many large factions are
not ready to vote `for,' presuming that the treaty in its very
essence can damage interests of Russia's national security."
</P>
<P>
He noted that a major number of Duma members are uncertain
about Russia's being on schedule with equipping its army with the
new missile system Topol-M as planned.
</P>
<P>
Former Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov said at the State
Duma Monday that Russia should not ratify the START-2 treaty.
</P>
<P>
Calling the treaty "a treacherous treaty," Rodionov said, "The
treaty was strategically disarming us."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Russia should withdraw from the treaty until it was
not too late."
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, under the critical situation in the economy of
the country, Russia is unable to keep pace with the USA in the
weapon's quantity and quality.
</P>
<P>
"Further deterioration of the economic situation and
destructive processes underway in the army will undermine our
combat efficiency without any ratification," Rodionov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia should proceed from its national interests when
considering the ratification problem, and should not "cater for
NATO and the USA."
</P>
<P>
The START-2 treaty signed by the United States and Russia in
1993 was ratified by the U.S. House of Representatives in January
1996.

<P>
ANKARA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Ministry has
submitted a motion to abolish capital punishment as part of the
effort to extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan from
Italy.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, the draft law for the lifting of the death
penalty is finished," Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu told
reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
The draft will be discussed at the Cabinet meeting later this
week before being presented to the Parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has never executed any criminals since 1984 in spite of
such penalty stipulations in its law.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that this step was taken to convince
Italy, which arrested Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) last week, for using a false passport, that
the rebel leader will not be executed if he is extradited to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is accused by Ankara of killing large numbers of
Turkish armymen and innocent civilians since the PKK launched the
separatist war in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
At present, Turkey is also making diplomatic efforts for the
extradition of Ocalan.

WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Republican Party Chairman
Jim Nicholson warned on Monday that a challenge to his leadership
could trigger "turmoil or a bloodbath," and predicted he will be
re-elected despite the party's weak showing in midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Nicholson's detractors continued to discuss the
possibility of a challenger emerging before the Republican
National Committee (RNC) hands out another two-year term in
January. This week's gathering of the Republican Governors
Association (RGA) in Louisiana could test Nicholson's standing.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think in the end anybody will run against me because I
really do have it locked up," Nicholson said in an interview with
The Associated Press. Nicholson said more than two thirds of the
165 RNC members had promised to give him a second term.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's more important to the party than it is to me,
because we have a lot of work to do to get everything put back
together... and also to raise money for the party the next two
months, rather than to deal with any turmoil or a bloodbath that
might result over a fight with leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although nobody has challenged Nicholson, several Republicans
have let their names be circulated by his dissenters.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson has tried to secure his position before the RGA
meeting, which begins Wednesday. Several RNC members will attend
the conference, and many governors have expressed disappointment
with Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said he has promised to get governors more
involved in the RNC, both in crafting the Republican message and
representing the party on national television. He also plans
brainstorming sessions among the governors, congressional leaders
and RNC leadership.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Succeed in Changing Plant Enzyme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. biochemists from
Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Carnegie Institution of
Stanford University, have for the first time changed a plant
enzyme, turning it into another enzyme with a different function
through genetic manipulation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Science magazine said that the achievement advances the
prospects of "designer" plants for renewable industrial raw
materials, fuel and food. It also sheds new light on how plant
enzymes evolved to perform different functions.
</P>
<P>
John Shanklin and his colleagues worked on two enzymes called
desaturases and hydroxylases, taken from different species of
related cruciferous plants.
</P>
<P>
Both enzymes perform important tasks. Desaturase converts plant
molecules called fatty acids from straight to bent, by turning
single chemical bonds into double ones. Hydroxylase adds hydroxy
groups to the faty acids' structure. These simple chemical changes
can make huge differences in plant oil properties. for example, a
fatty acid molecule with two bends may be sensitive to heat, while
a fatty acid with an added hydroxy group is heat-resistant and
performs well as a high-temperature lubricant.
</P>
<P>
By careful detective work, U.S. scientists were able to
identify which amino acids in the sequence are responsible for a
particular activity of the desaturase and hydroxylase enzymes. By
modifying the genetic blueprint for the enzymes, they swapped
several amino acids from one enzyme for their equivalents in
another enzyme.
</P>
<P>
Then they examined the consequences by implanting the genes
in a plant known as Arabidopsis. An analysis of the oil that
accumulated in the modified plant's seeds showed that the
"morphing" had been successful- the desaturase had become a
hydroxylase and vice versa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tobacco Industry, States Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. tobacco companies have
agreed to a 206 billion U.S. dollar settlement of lawsuits, paying
smoking-related health care and stopping public advertising in
states.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton called the settlement "a step in
the right direction," but still wants Congress to do more to curb
teen smoking, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"The new Congress has the chance to put politics aside and do
what the last Congress failed to do, by acting now to prevent 3
million children from starting smoking and saving 1 million lives
over the next five years," a White House statement said.
</P>
<P>
Eight state attorneys general reached the proposed deal with
tobacco companies after months of negotiation, and have sent the
proposal to all other states in hopes they, too, will join in.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine states now are suing the tobacco industry to
recover Medicaid money spent treating sick smokers, but seven
others that have not sued the industry are eligible to join the
settlement also.
</P>
<P>
Four states -- Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota --
already have separately settled with tobacco companies for a total
of 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed deal, the states would end their lawsuits in
exchange for millions of dollars each. Plus, cigarette makers
would establish a 2 billion dollar foundation to "tell the truth"
about the addictiveness of nicotine and the dangers of smoking.
The foundation would send anti-tobacco advertising into every home
in America.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cigarette companies agreed to end advertising of
tobacco on billboards and public transportation such as taxis and
to stop marketing tobacco paraphernalia such as hats and T-shirts
that are particularly popular with youths.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, states that agree to the settlement would
receive 12 billion dollars in upfront money from cigarette makers
over the next five years. The remainder of the state payments
would be spread out until 2025.
</P>
<P>
The cigarette companies that agreed to the proposed deal are
Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco
and Lorillard Tobacco. The negotiating states in addition to
Washington were California, New York, North Carolina, Colorado,
Oklahoma, North Dakota and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stocks Rally, Dow Above 9,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks rallied Monday
with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping back to the above
9,000 level for the first time in three and half months.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the worldwide stock rallies following the removal
of military confrontation between the U.S. and Iraq over U.N. arms
inspection in Iraq and the announcement of a new economic plan by
the Japanese government, the Dow closed 91.66 higher to 9,011.25.
</P>
<P>
Most of the market indicators also posted gains.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip barometer is still 326.72 points or 3.5 percent
away from its record high of 9,337.97 reached on July 17. The last
time it stayed above 9,000 was July 30. Its recent comeback has
made up over 1,500 points since it plunged to the 7,400 level in
late August amid contagion of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council decided Sunday to send back arms
inspectors to Iraq. A peaceful solution to the crisis sent a
stimulus to markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese government promised to turn the
recession-bound economy around by next year with a new package of
public spending, also a factor favorable to the business climate.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancers led decliners 7-6
with trading volume up to 610 million shares from 600 million
previously.

<HEADLINE> Nerve Abnormality Found to Cause Disabling Rapid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A disabling disease that
causes rapid heartbeat and occurs most often in young women may be
due to a pronounced abnormality in "autonomic" nerve activity --
the body's central control panel for vital life functions like
breathing.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in Monday's Circulation, a journal of the American
Heart Association, scientists say that the disease, called chronic
orthostatic intolerance (COI), is often mistaken for emotional
distress or other medical problems. It has been misdiagnosed as
chronic fatigue syndrome, mitral valve prolapse or panic disorder.
Some patients are referred for psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
According to scientists at Vanderbilt University, the United
States, and the University of Milan, Italy, individuals with COI
lose their balance upon standing and will have a runaway
heartbeat, called tachycardia. These and other symptoms including
dizziness, light-headedness, tunnel vision and general discomfort
can severely disrupt the lives of those with the condition.
</P>
<P>
People with this disorder tend to lie down most of the day, the
report said. As many as 500,000 Americans might suffer to some
degree from the problem.
</P>
<P>
COI is not well defined in medical textbooks and thus its
prevalence is underestimated because physicians don't know how to
deal with the disorder, whose physiological basis is formed by
irregularities in the heart, the scientists said in the report.
</P>
<P>
The scientists found that COI patients have an abnormally high
sympathetic output to their heart and blood vessels, even at rest.
That is potentially related to a central nervous system
abnormality.
</P>
<P>
Typically patients complain that they "can't stand up" -- so
they drastically restrict physical activity, leading to weakened
muscles that only make matters worse. The scientists say that it
is helpful to gradually increase exercise, especially swimming and
other activity in water, where gravity has less impact. Increased
intake of fluids and even small amounts of salt have been shown to
be beneficial, they said. Therapy can also include medications,
such as "alpha 1-receptor agonists, drugs that mimic the body
chemical that helps blood vessels constrict normally.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Plunge with Iraq Strikes Called off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) - World oil prices slided near
10-year lows on Monday after the possibility of U.S air strikes
against Iraq subsided and worries over the glut of global supplies
resurged.
</P>
<P>
On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent crude for
January delivery traded 57 cents off at 11.75 US dollars a barrel
after plunging through the psychologically-important level of
12.00 dollars a barrel as the market drew to a close. This was
within 20 cents of a 10-year low of 11.55 dollars reached on
August 11.
</P>
<P>
U.S. light crude for December delivery closed down 77 cents at
12.80 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"We have been been bearish all day; the standoff (between Iraq
and the United Nations) is over, the tension is gone, they called
off the strike and they got the (U.N. arms) inspectors back in and
the physical market is weak, so the fundamentals are re-asserting
themselves," a London trader was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The market has given up the increases in price from early last
week when the crisis was intensifying," John Russel, managing
director of Bangkok-based Petroleum Economics Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts monitoring Iraq crude exports for the United
Nations as part of an oil-for-food program remained in place in
Iraq during the latest crisis and loadings went ahead virtually
uninterrupted, according to shipping sources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.8 million barrels from Turkey's Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan and 3.4 million barrels from Mina al-Bakr in the Gulf
loaded in the last two days and more loading is now in progress,
Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
But the threat of U.S air strikes stopped some oil loading as
scheduled, the sources said. Bulgaria's Rosbulneft loaded only
400,000 barrels instead of its scheduled 1.9 million barrels,
citing safety concerns for its decision.
</P>
<P>
James Brown, Asia energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, said "I am
not convinced that this present conflict is over. It leaves the
oil market on edge until such a time as this whole question is
resolved."
</P>
<P>
The price slide brings into the spotlight once again high
global oil stocks and efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to bolster oil prices, which are more
than 6 dollars lower than levels a year ago.
</P>
<P>
OPEC meets in Vienna next week to decide whether to cut output
further or to try to enforce greater compliance with the existing
cuts and extend their duration.
