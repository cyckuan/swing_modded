<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Plunge Amid Fears / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices of Treasury securities plunged more than  
a point on Friday after two reports showed strong economic growth, 
stoking fears that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates 
against to check inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1 5-32  
points, or $11.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, jumped to 6.13 percent from 6.04 percent 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds began tumbling after a business group reported the  
nation's manufacturing sector grew in September much more strongly 
than expected, while prices of raw materials soared to the highest 
level in more than four years. The report by the National 
Association of Purchasing Management provided further evidence that 
the overall economy rebounded from a sluggish second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department said the personal income of  
Americans climbed in August for the eighth consecutive month. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined news kept alive Wall Street's fears that the  
economy is overheating, sending bonds as well as stocks tumbling on 
worries that the Federal Reserve will try to cool things off by 
raising interest rates for a third time this year. Fed 
policy-makers meet Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 3/16 point to 9/32 point, while intermediate maturities fell 
7/16 point to 11/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to  
4.86 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.73 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.99 percent as the discount rose 
0.03 percentage point to 4.80 percent. One-year yields rose to 5.24 
percent as the discount rose 0.07 percentage point to 4.98 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.50 percent from 5.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 9/16 to 111 29/32. The average yield to 
maturity of the index rose to 5.91 percent from 5.89 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ORONO, Maine (AP) -- A man was killed Friday when his pickup  
truck apparently smashed through a fence and landed in a tank of 
raw sewage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's body was recovered from the 400,000 gallon tank Friday  
afternoon after authorities noticed a hole in the fence and tire 
tracks leading into the wastewater treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon searching the uncovered tank, they found a light blue Mazda  
pickup truck and a body next to it. 
</P>
<P>
	The holding tank was being drained to make sure there weren't  
any passengers in the truck. 
</P>

	Officials believe the car crashed into the tank sometime  
overnight.

<HEADLINE> State's Trooper Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The head of Alabama's state police  
resigned under pressure Friday after questions were raised by The 
Associated Press about evidence showing his office had helped fix 
traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Don Siegelman announced Mike Sullivan's resignation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how long this practice has gone on in Alabama,  
but my administration will not tolerate this kind of action. It is 
wrong and it stops today,'' the governor said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said anyone involved would be punished, but he didn't  
elaborate on how far the ticket-fixing scheme may have stretched. 
Documents and interviews conducted by the AP showed some drivers 
may have appealed to state lawmakers for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Illegally fixing a traffic ticket or asking an official to do so  
is a misdemeanor in Alabama. No evidence that any money was 
involved has surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan, a 33-year veteran of the department, was out of town  
and could not be reached for comment Friday. He remained on the 
payroll but no longer as the head of the Department of Public 
Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reviewed copies of traffic tickets written by troopers  
over two years and payments of fines, and interviewed drivers who 
said their fines disappeared after they asked for help. Some of the 
documents, including correspondence with people whose fines were 
dropped, were signed with Sullivan's secretary's initials. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you know the right people you can get it done,'' said  
Virgil Roberts of Prattville, whose July 5 speeding ticket was 
dropped after he requested help. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts wouldn't say who helped him with the ticket.  
</P>
<P>
	Allen Horn, manager of the Bay Oaks Golf Club near Mobile, said  
he had helped members of the golf club contact Sullivan for help 
with tickets. He said he knows several state officials because of 
the charity golf tournaments held at his course.

<HEADLINE> Torre To Name Game 1 Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Joe Torre isn't completely sure  
Roger Clemens will open the playoffs, saying he will decide 
Saturday between the five-time Cy Young Award winner and Orlando 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had these two guys up front, ``El Duque'' and Roger, for  
the most part the whole time,'' the New York Yankees manager said 
before Friday night's game at Tampa Bay. ``You just want to make 
sure you cover all aspects of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will open their first-round series against Texas or  
Cleveland on Tuesday and play Game 2 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	One factor under consideration is Clemens' performance with  
extra rest. He pitched Thursday and Game 1 falls on what normally 
would be his next day to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching with two extra days of rest Thursday, Clemens struggled  
and lost the first game of a doubleheader at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``If for some reason it's not Game 1, he's just going to have to  
simulate (game preparation) to be ready when he does pitch,'' Torre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees trailing 2 games to 1 in last year's AL  
championship series against Cleveland, Hernandez pitched for the 
first time in 15 days and beat the Indians at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said the Yankees' roster for the opening playoff round  
won't be set until a team workout on Monday. Among the unanswered 
questions are whether Hideki Irabu will part of the Yankees' 10-man 
staff.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wary of Tax Credit Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain  
said Friday that Congress shouldn't ``tamper with a much-needed tax 
credit for working Americans'' and suggested cutting special 
interest subsidies would be a better way to meet budget targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our goal is to have lower-income Americans lifted up into  
the middle class, this is the wrong way to do it,'' said McCain, a 
senator from Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-led Congress is mulling several bookkeeping maneuvers to  
keep a promise to avoid spending portions of the federal surplus 
reserved for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal under consideration by Republican House leaders  
would produce $8 billion in savings by spreading the earned income 
tax credit over 12 monthly payments rather than the lump sum now 
paid with tax refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have criticized the tactic, saying it would take money  
from working families that earn less than $30,000 a year. George W. 
Bush, Texas governor and front-runner in the race for the GOP 
nomination, also has criticized the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview from his Phoenix campaign headquarters,  
McCain said he has found at least ``$9 billion worth of pork and 
wasteful spending'' in the appropriations bills now being 
considered by Congress that could fill the budget gaps. He 
specified subsidies for oil, ethanol and sugar as examples. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has found the funds to raise their own salaries but  
they can't find enough to help and lower and middle-income 
Americans,'' said McCain, who called the phase-in an ``accounting 
gimmick and Americans are tired of this kind of gimmick from 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R. Ill., said Friday that House  
leaders ran the tax credit phase-in by Bush's staff, ``as well as 
others,'' but got no response. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said House leaders did not  
consult with the senator before suggesting the phased-in tax credit 
as a budget option. ``We have not had a discussion with the House 
leadership,'' Opinsky said. ``We would have told them we need to 
put working families ahead of special interests.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Underwood To Get Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood, who cut his neck with  
steak knives in an apparent suicide attempt, was released from the 
hospital and will get psychological care elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Dolphins rookie was in good spirits and ``very  
peaceful,'' Underwood's agent, Craig Domann, said Thursday. He did 
not identify his client's new treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's mother, Eileen Underwood, did not return messages to  
her Philadelphia home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood had been at Sparrow Hospital since slashing his neck  
Sunday. The hospital said he was released, but declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A police report Thursday said Underwood chanted ``I'm not worthy  
of God'' before he used two steak knives to cut his throat at the 
Lansing home of his girlfriend and their twin toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend said Underwood was confused and upset. She and  
her stepfather were driving Underwood to the hospital when he 
jumped from the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was covered with blood and saying, ``You are Satan and  
you're going to hell'' and ``I want to be saved, I want to meet 
God,'' when officers arrived to help him, according to reports 
obtained by the Lansing State Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	A day before the stabbing, Underwood was arrested on a warrant  
accusing him of nonpayment of child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found him with the knife wound 13 hours after a woman  
posted his bond and Underwood left the jail. 
</P>
<P>
	His friend and former Michigan State teammate, Sedrick Irvin of  
the Detroit Lions, told the Detroit Free Press he visited Underwood 
at the hospital Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had tubes and machines all around him, but he said, `This  
ain't nothing. The Man upstairs is real,''' Irvin said. ``He's 
confused right now and he did what a person who's confused does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who played at Michigan State, was a first-round draft  
pick by the Minnesota Vikings. But he left the team in August 
without explanation a day after signing a five-year, $5.3 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter later found him in a Philadelphia hotel, where  
Underwood said he was torn between his religious faith and his 
football career. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood returned to football to support his family, and the  
Dolphins picked him up on waivers. He played one exhibition game on 
Sept. 2, then injured his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins said they are placing Underwood on the  
reserved-nonfootball injury list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really disappointed that as his coach, there wasn't  
something that I could do to help this guy accomplish what he wants 
to accomplish,'' Nick Saban, Underwood's coach at Michigan State, 
told Detroit TV station WJBK.

<HEADLINE> Political Donor's Home Searched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- FBI agents on Friday searched the home of a  
political donor who was implicated in a fund-raising scandal by a 
former county Republican official. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency would not disclose what it sought or took from the  
Englewood home of David Chang. FBI spokeswoman Monica M. Patton 
said Chang was not charged or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang could not be reached for comment. The house does not have  
a listed number, and a message left at his international trading 
firm was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang contributed $41,586 to candidates and organizations of  
both parties during the 1997-98 election cycle, according to Mother 
Jones magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the former head of the Republican Party in New Jersey's  
Bergen County pleaded guilty to evading campaign finance rules. 
Berek Paul Don admitted he funneled up to $11,000 to the successful 
1996 Senate campaign of the county's Democratic congressman, Robert 
Torricelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Don said he and a onetime law partner took that sum in a  
corporate check labeled ``legal fees'' from Chang and used it to 
reimburse ``straw donors'' because Chang had asked him to get the 
money into Torricelli's campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Chang's company was a client of Don's law firm.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal election law limits individual contributions to $1,000  
per election to a single candidate for federal office, and 
prohibits corporate donations to candidates for federal office. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang also was linked to the campaign financing problems that  
toppled former Rep. Jay Kim, R-Calif. Chang cooperated with federal 
authorities and was not charged.

<HEADLINE> Guenter Grass Wins Nobel Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Praise poured in from literary colleagues after  
novelist Guenter Grass, Germany's best-known postwar writer, was 
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Academy in Stockholm, Sweden, honored Grass on  
Thursday as one of the most prominent authors to emerge from a 
group of young intellectuals who set out to revive German 
literature after the Nazi era. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 71-year-old author of ``The Tin Drum,'' the prize  
bolstered his standing as a moral arbiter of post-unity Germany who 
has untiringly warned his compatriots to remain vigilant against 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	British author Salman Rushdie, in a statement through his agent,  
called Grass ``the greatest European novelist of the second half of 
the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grass is widely admired by his literary contemporaries, but also  
controversial for his outspoken political stands. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who once said the horrors of Auschwitz could not have  
occurred without a strong Germany was horrified at the nation's 
quick unification in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 
has never shed his fear that Germany may stray again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be that my children and grandchildren will have to  
suffer under the stigma of being German,'' he said after Thursday's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``But these late-born children also have a share of the  
responsibility for ensuring that such things -- even their stirrings 
-- never happen in Germany again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, publishers rushed Grass' books into print to meet huge  
demand in the wake of the Nobel announcement. Bookstores set up 
special tables with his works as Germans snapped them up. The 
Steidl publishing house, which holds the rights to his works, said 
its entire stock of some 100,000 Grass books sold out after the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, German public television paid an unlikely tribute to  
Grass: It had him read an early-morning weather forecast that 
combined the mundane with his leftist views. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing outdoors, Grass said Sunday would be sunny in the  
south. He then urged people in neighboring Austria to turn out to 
vote against a rightist party whose popularity is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass has infuriated politicians in recent years with critiques  
of ``barbaric'' capitalism taking over after communism and by 
attacking German immigration policy as racist. 
</P>
<P>
	His literary reputation was made with ``The Tin Drum,'' ``Cat  
and Mouse'' and ``Dog Years,'' published between 1959 and 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``The Tin Drum,'' the Nobel Academy said, ``it was as if  
German literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of 
linguistic and moral destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book's main character, Oskar Matzerath, refuses to grow up  
under the Nazi regime, staying a dwarf in protest and beating his 
tin drum as a warning. German director Volker Schloendorff later 
based a movie on the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining naturalistic detail with fantastical images, the novel  
trilogy captured the German reaction to the rise of Nazism, the 
horrors of the war and the guilt that lingered after Adolf Hitler's 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass drew on his own experience of military service in the Nazi  
air force late in World War II and his captivity as a prisoner of 
war held by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Again and again, his books returned to his native town of Danzig  
(now Gdansk, Poland), a symbol of Germany's painful relationship 
with its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never failed to confront Germans with what they did, but  
always with a great sense of the vitality,'' 1991 Nobel laureate 
Nadine Gordimer told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, some reactions were more muted. Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder honored Grass as a ``competent critic of society.'' His 
culture minister, Michael Naumann, called him a ``difficult, 
imaginative author.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Grass' more recent works received decidedly mixed  
reviews. His 1995 novel ``A Broad Field'' attempted to explain 
Germany's new identity after unification, but many critics said it 
fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass and other German writers of his generation are criticized  
in a recent book, ``The Language of Silence,'' by Ernestine 
Schlant, a professor of German and comparative literature at New 
Jersey's Montclair State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlant, the German-born wife of Democratic presidential  
candidate Bill Bradley, says the writers' books virtually ignore 
the Holocaust and experiences of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass' latest work, ``My Century,'' is a collection of short  
pieces reviewing German history, coupled with an exhibition of 
Grass watercolors. The book is to be published in 23 languages by 
the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> Gore Replaces Longtime Pollster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore continued his campaign  
house cleaning Friday, replacing a longtime pollster, Mark Penn, 
with Democratic operative Harrison Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Gore official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
said the move was made because Penn was unable to devote his full 
attention to the primary battle with former New Jersey Sen. Bill 
Bradley. Penn will continue polling for the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickman and his partner Kirk Brown will take over the polling  
operation from Penn, who had authority to hire other pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Gore supporters had complained privately that Penn had  
underestimated the threat posed by Bradley, though the official 
stressed that Gore's senior advisers considered Penn's polling 
accurate and insightful. The shakeup in the polling operation comes 
two days after Gore announced he was moving his headquarters to 
Tennessee in an effort to revitalize a campaign that was shaken by 
Bradley's surprisingly strong showing in primary voter polls and in 
the fund-raising race. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickman's other clients include the National Abortion and  
Reproductive Rights Action League and Democratic Rep. Marty Meehan, 
Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Sen. John Edwards of North 
Carolina and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, as well as Philadelphia 
mayor Ed Rendell, the newly installed general chairman of 
Democratic National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Hull's Goal Still Haunts Sabres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres will never forget it,  
whether they want to or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull's disputed goal gave the Dallas Stars the Stanley Cup  
last season, prompted a change in the rulebook and left the Sabres 
with a never-ending stream of questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere I went in the offseason, people wanted to talk  
about that goal,'' said Sabres captain Rob Ray, whose team begins 
another season in Detroit on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray hopes to convert last season's frustration into energy for  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will probably be brought up throughout the year that we got  
robbed and we want to get back there and get what's rightfully 
ours,'' Ray said. ``It's fuel for the fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull had one of his skates in the crease when he scored the  
Cup-clincher for Dallas in the third overtime of Game 6, appearing 
to violate the man-in-the-crease rule. But after watching the video 
replay, officials allowed the goal because Hull had control of the 
puck. 
</P>
<P>
	Many said the questionable goal tainted one the NHL's greatest  
playoff games. Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff was incensed. Goaltender 
Dominik Hasek demanded an apology from the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no choice but to put that behind us and try to learn  
from last year and maintain that same level of excitement that we 
created,'' Sabres forward Dixon Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	The old rule automatically nullified a goal if a player was in  
any part of the crease when the goal was scored. Under the new 
rule, which allows on-ice officials to decide if an attacking 
player in the crease interferes with the goaltender, Hull's goal in 
the third overtime of Game 6 never would have been reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	While they still believe Hull's goal was an infraction of the  
man-in-the-crease rule as it then stood, the Sabres like the rule 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you interfere with the goalie, the goal should be taken  
away,'' Buffalo defenseman Jason Woolley said. ``But it shouldn't 
be taken away just because you have a hair in the crease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley and his teammates have more pressing problems, however,  
like facing off against the Red Wings minus four holdouts and with 
Hasek sticking to his retirement plans for the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek announced his retirement in the Czech Republic in July.  
But in a recent interview he said that while he hadn't changed his 
mind he would try living without hockey for a while and see how it 
goes. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever that means, Buffalo looks at this season as the last  
one for the two-time league MVP and 1998 Olympic gold medalist. 
Hasek's imminent departure lends a measure of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our guys have it in their minds that if we don't win  
this year we're not going to have the opportunity because Dominik's 
gone,'' Ray said. ``But I don't believe that. It would nice to win 
this year for him. I just hope people don't think that we can't win 
next year without Dominik.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of Hasek's announcement was meant to minimize  
distraction to the team, but it could create more hoopla as city 
after NHL city says goodbye to the world's greatest goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the players realize what's going to happen,''  
said Woolley, a Pittsburgh Penguin when Mario Lemieux said goodbye 
in 1996-97. ``A thing like that can be a big-time distraction, but 
I don't think it will affect us. We can overcome anything.''

<HEADLINE> Possible Nazi Victims Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- The remains of 375 people believed to be  
victims of the Nazis were found during excavation work near a 
Belarusian cathedral that had served as a Nazi prison, officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains were unearthed on the premises of the abandoned  
Assumption Cathedral in the northwestern city of Vitebsk, said an 
official in charge of the excavations, Alexander Gutsev, according 
to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe the remains date from the early 1940s, the  
report said. The cathedral served as a Gestapo prison during the 
Nazi occupation of Belarus during World War II. Several bullets and 
cartridges found near the mass grave are similar in caliber to 
those used in German weapons during the war, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary inspection indicated that up to 1,000 people may  
be buried in the cathedral grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The report didn't say when the remains were discovered. Interior  
Ministry officials in Vitebsk and the capital Minsk confirmed the 
find, but provided no details.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Quake Hurts Hewlett-Packard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. warned Friday it  
will report quarterly sales at the low end of Wall Street 
projections after an earthquake last month in Taiwan slowed 
production of parts that power its computers and other machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard is the first major U.S. technology company to  
formally warn of financial damage from the massive 7.6 magnitude 
earthquake last week in Taiwan, one of the world's top producers of 
the semiconductor chips used to run computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company is a major maker of  
computers, printers and imaging products. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the situation is still somewhat fluid, we are sure of  
some disruptions and delays in the PC supply chain,'' 
Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina said in a conference 
call with analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan accounts for about 10 percent of semiconductors used  
worldwide, plus about 60 percent of the motherboards, the main 
circuit board for chips, analysts said. Taiwan also is a key 
supplier of memory chips, flat-panel screens used in notebook 
computers, small microprocessors used in toys and other consumer 
electronics, and core-logic chipsets, the chips that link the 
processor to the rest of the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorina said the company's revenue would grow about 10 percent  
in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends Oct 30. Wall Street had 
expected Hewlett-Packard to report sales growth ranging from 10 
percent to 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	H-P's stock, which has been under pressure in recent months,  
fell 3.7 percent, down $3.37 1/2 a share to $87.37 1/2 in trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hewlett-Packard said it would meet profit projections of 99  
cents a share in the quarter, according to the most recent survey 
of analysts by First Call Corp. In the year-earlier period, profit 
was $832 million, or 79 cents a share before charges, on sales of 
$12.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard also announced a realignment of its executive  
ranks to ensure accountability and teamwork to motivate its sales 
force. Fiorina suggested the changes would make it less 
conservative and more nimble in responding to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Livermore, the chief executive of its enterprise computing  
group and head of its Internet services business, will head its top 
100 business accounts. Antonio Perez will oversee digital imaging, 
and Duane Zitzner will head the servers and software business. 
Carolyn Ticknor will oversee the printer business.

<HEADLINE> Party Chair Asks Ventura To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The national chairman of the Reform Party  
asked its highest elected official, Gov. Jesse Ventura, to quit the 
party on Friday because of the ex-wrestler's controversial 
interview with Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the governor, party Chairman Russ Verney  
criticized Ventura for his comments about religion, sexual assault, 
fat people, drugs, prostitution and women's undergarments, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have brought shame to yourself and disgrace to the members  
of the Reform Party,'' Verney wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In taped comments for NBC's ``Meet the Press'' to be aired  
Sunday, Ventura dismissed Verney's request because the national 
party ``did virtually nothing to help me to win the election 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verney is a longtime ally of Reform Party founder Ross Perot;  
Ventura has said Perot is no longer a viable presidential candidate 
and should step aside. Ventura also supported Jack Gargan's 
successful bid to replace Verney as party chairman. Gargan takes 
over in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Three national political leaders added their voices to the  
criticism of Ventura on Friday, particularly about the governor's 
statement that organized religion is ``a sham and a crutch for 
weak-minded people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert said he was ``shocked and  
chagrined.'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said: ``Can you 
believe a governor of a state in America would say such an 
insensitive, bigoted thing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition,  
declared Ventura was ``off his rocker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said his comments to Playboy about organized religion  
referred to extremists. He also said he sent a letter to religious 
leaders saying he respects the role they play in communities.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Violence to Fetuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House, over the objections of abortion  
rights lawmakers, has approved legislation that would make it a 
crime to harm a fetus during a violent act against a pregnant 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the bill, passed Thursday by a 254-172 vote,  
argued that the fetus should have the same legal protections as the 
mother from criminal assault. Opponents said it was another attempt 
to erode abortion rights guaranteed by the 1973 Roe vs. Wade 
Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The intent was not to reopen the abortion debate, insisted the  
bill's sponsor, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., but to ensure that the 
criminal who injures or kills a fetus ``is going to pay a separate 
debt to society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, calling it an ``unprecedented''  
effort to make the mother and fetus separate victims, threatened a 
presidential veto. Senate action on the bill this year is uncertain 
at best. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill still served as the most visible showdown this year  
between supporters and opponents of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Family Research Council spokeswoman Janet Parshall said  
recognizing ``the personhood of the preborn child'' was a 
``profoundly significant moment in pro-life history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and  
Reproductive Rights Action League, said the bill ``does nothing to 
protect women against violence'' and is meant ``to forge new legal 
ground that would eventually undermine'' the Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation makes it a separate offense to injure or kill a  
fetus in the commission of a federal crime of violence against a 
pregnant woman. 
</P>
<P>
	A person need not have knowledge of the pregnancy to be charged  
with harming a fetus. When an assailant intentionally kills or 
attempts to kill a fetus, the punishment is the same as that for 
similar acts against a person. 
</P>
<P>
	Exceptions are that the death penalty would not apply and the  
bill would not apply to abortions performed with the mother's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 24 states have laws concerning violence against fetuses,  
and Graham said federal laws must also allow a prosecutor to bring 
murder charges when a fetus dies in an attack that the mother 
survives. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you recognize the baby's need for prenatal care and  
reject the baby's right to protection from violence?'' House 
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, asked abortion rights 
supporters. ``I just can't believe anyone could be that cruel, 
heartless and selfish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the bill said its backers were equally callous in  
using a popular cause, stopping violence against women, to promote 
an anti-abortion agenda. ``This time they found a brand-new way of 
chipping away at a woman's right to choose,'' said Rep. Carolyn 
Maloney, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the most contentious abortion issue coming  
before Congress has been the effort to ban a form of late-term 
abortion opponents call ``partial birth abortion.'' But after two 
vetoes by President Clinton, the bill has not come up again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House issued a statement saying it would veto the  
``Unborn Victims of Violence Act'' in its present form. The Justice 
Department, in a letter to Congress in September, said the 
identification of a fetus as a separate and distinct victim of 
crime is ``unprecedented as a matter of federal statute'' and could 
be seen as ``gratuitously plunging the federal government'' into a 
complex religious and scientific issue. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats, led by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., offered a  
substitute that would have created a federal criminal offense for 
violence against pregnant women without mentioning the fetus. It 
was defeated 224-201. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2436.

<HEADLINE> Feds Take Over Fishing in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Federal authorities took back a treasured  
prize of Alaska's statehood Friday, seizing partial control of the 
state's rich fisheries to protect the rights of rural Alaskans who 
depend on fish for food. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law requires the subsistence fishing priority for rural  
residents -- including Eskimos, Indians and other native people -- 
freeing them from many regulations that govern sport hunting and 
fishing. Opponents contend that discriminates against urban 
residents who also rely on fish and game. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal takeover came after eight Republican state senators  
blocked an attempt to send voters an amendment to the state 
constitution that would allow the rural subsistence fishing 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about protecting subsistence fishing for villages in  
Alaska and the people who live there,'' said Marilyn Heiman, 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's top aide in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsistence priority applies to about 20 percent of  
Alaskans, or about 120,000 people, who are classified as rural. 
Slightly less than half of those people are Native Alaskans -- 
including Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule allows them to catch more fish and use more efficient  
methods for fishing. It also allows federal wildlife managers to 
protect the subsistence users by restricting the amount of wildlife 
taken by other hunters and fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate impact of the takeover will likely be negligible  
because the summer fishing season is nearly over. But the impact is 
expected to grow over time. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal managers could begin restricting commercial fishing  
as early as next year to allow more salmon to reach remote 
villagers on waterways such as the Yukon River. Some subsistence 
fisheries there have been limited in recent years after commercial 
fisheries took a big bite out of weak salmon runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of federal fish managers is a bitter pill for many  
who recall disastrous federal practices that depleted salmon runs 
before Alaska became a state in 1959. The federal government's cozy 
relationship with big fish canneries was such a sore subject that 
more people voted to abolish the commercial fish trap than for 
ratification of the state's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have prevented the offensive intrusion of federal  
management of Alaska's fish and game resources, a right that really 
was at the root of statehood,'' said Gov. Tony Knowles, who called 
the Legislature into special session in a last-ditch effort to 
amend the constitution. ``We could also have at the very same time 
protected the vital importance of subsistence to the economy, to 
the culture, to the way of life in rural Alaska.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict between state and federal law dates back to 1980,  
when Congress included the rural priority in the Alaska National 
Interest Lands Conservation Act. Nine years later, the Alaska 
Supreme Court ruled that it violated the state constitution's 
guarantee of equal access to fish and game. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal managers took over subsistence hunting on federal land  
the next year. A 1994 court decision expanded federal authority to 
lakes, rivers and streams within or alongside that land. 
Intervention by the state's powerful congressional delegation 
fended off the takeover until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight Republican lawmakers repeatedly blocked attempts to  
amend the state's constitution, arguing instead for a legal 
challenge to the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only course of action now remaining is for the governor to  
file a direct action suit in Supreme Court of the United States and 
request an immediate injunction to halt any federal action,'' said 
one of the eight, Sen. Robin Taylor.

<HEADLINE> Pack's Bidwell Gets Help With Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers punter Josh Bidwell  
could amass more than $100,000 in medical bills as he recovers from 
testicular cancer, but teammates and even school children want to 
help him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Bidwell so far has more than $50,000 in medical  
bills, but is ineligible for NFL medical benefits because he was 
never on Green Bay's active roster. Bidwell punted in exhibition 
games, but before the final one against Miami on Sept. 2, the 
Packers announced he was out for the season because of the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason Bidwell cannot get league money is that his  
injuries were not caused in a game, said Carl Francis of the NFL 
Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unfortunate and an ironic situation,'' Francis said.  
</P>
<P>
	The punter's teammates have contributed about $50,000 out of  
their pockets to help out the fourth-round draft pick, said Green 
Bay players programs director Gil Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	More funds are expected to be raised next week, when the Packers  
hold their annual golf tournament. A group of players and their 
wives also have organized a dinner and auction later in the month 
to benefit Bidwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Packers' young fans want to help out, too. A group  
of middle school students in Appleton is holding a car wash 
Saturday to raise money for Bidwell's treatment and the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids were talking about it, and they were saying Josh  
Bidwell is not getting insurance and this is not fair,'' said 
Madison Middle School teacher Denise Steiner, who is supervising 
the event. ``We all said, `What can we do?' And we decided, why not 
have a car wash?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell said in an interview Thursday with The Post-Crescent of  
Appleton that his insurance under his father's policy expired at 
the beginning of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was OK through the NFL,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The moment I realized I wasn't insured was very difficult. It  
was the icing on the cake of a bunch of bad situations. The 
financial situation was one more burden I didn't need. I was 
concentrating on my form of cancer and ways to beat it. To find out 
the financial part was very stressful for my family and I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell, who is at his home in Eugene, Ore., for his recovery,  
was stunned when he heard of the children's event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing. It warms my heart to think a school is doing  
this for me,'' Bidwell said. ``I'm really in shock. I'm really 
floored by the love and the respect shown by these kids. They are 
going to wash cars in about 50-degree weather for a guy like me. I 
really don't know what to say about that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm also so grateful to my teammates for helping me. I'm just  
some rookie who they knew for a couple of months. It's just such a 
nice feeling that both the Packers and the community are doing 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell hopes to start kicking in January and is expecting to  
participate in minicamps in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, I feel great now,'' he said. ``But physically, I  
still have a ways to go. When I stand up, it's a reality check. It 
hurts. ... But I know I'm healing and I will be well. I will be 
back with the Packers next year.''

<HEADLINE> Ford May Spin Off Parts Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. plans to spin off its auto parts  
division directly to shareholders and give wage and job guarantees 
to factory workers, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to be announced within a month, the Times  
reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	What to do with Visteon Automotive Systems has been a problem  
for Ford as it tries to reach a new labor contract with the United 
Auto Workers. The union has opposed a spinoff of Visteon, which has 
28,500 UAW members, saying it could lead to pay cuts, plant 
closures and fewer union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had considered selling Visteon, but decided against it  
because of labor issues and tax considerations, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the UAW reached tentative agreements with  
General Motors Corp. and Delphi Automotive Systems, which was spun 
off from GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals reportedly provided 185,000 workers with 3 percent pay  
raises each year for four years and a signing bonus of $1,350, 
among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is expected to allow Ford to follow the same pattern  
for Visteon's 23,500 workers, making a tax-free spinoff of the 
division to shareholders an attractive option, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Visteon would reportedly agree to a four-year contract with the  
same wage, benefit and job protections reached in a Ford pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Visteon had $17.8 billion in revenue in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Starr Spent $7M During Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr spent $7.2  
million investigating President Clinton during the six-month period 
that included the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought expenses so far for Starr's five-year investigation  
of President and Mrs. Clinton and their associates to $47 million. 
More than a quarter of that was spent during the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation and the impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	With the investigation continuing, Starr is on the brink of  
becoming the most expensive independent counsel ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh spent $48.5 million on a  
six-year investigation of whether the Reagan administration 
attempted arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and its secret war 
against Nicaragua's leftist government. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's expenses for the six-month period ending March 31  
included $5.7 million for salaries, travel and rent and $1.5 
million for costs of U.S. Marshal Service, FBI and Justice 
Department employees detailed to Starr's office, the General 
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said in a 
report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate began the first week  
of January and ended in acquittal on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Starr began investigating 1980s Arkansas land deals  
involving Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. In January 1998 
Starr's investigation was expanded to include Clinton's 
relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spent more than $13 million during the year that covered  
most of the Lewinsky investigation and impeachment, the GAO figures 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the law creating independent counsels expired June 30,  
investigations already under way are allowed to continue. Starr 
plans to leave his post soon, and several of his deputies have 
interviewed with a three-judge panel to take his place, courthouse 
employees have said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report, updated every six months, showed that seven  
other special investigations -- five active and two closed -- spent 
$7.3 million during the period: 
</P>
<P>
	--Carol Elder Bruce, appointed to investigate allegations that  
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt lied to Congress, spent $2.4 
million. Babbitt has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	--Donald C. Smaltz, independent counsel investigating former  
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, spent $1.8 million. Espy was 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	--Independent Counsel David M. Barrett's probe of allegations  
that Henry Cisneros, the former secretary of housing and urban 
development, lied to the FBI about payments to a former mistress 
cost $1.6 million. Cisneros pleaded guilty Sept. 7 to a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ralph I. Lancaster Jr.'s investigation of allegations that  
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman engaged in influence peddling and 
solicited illegal campaign contributions spent $1.1 million. The 
investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An investigation by prosecutors Arlin M. Adams and Larry D.  
Thompson of Reagan administration-era corruption at the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development spent $382,043. 
</P>
<P>
	--Daniel S. Pearson, whose investigation of financial dealings of  
the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown ended when Brown died in an 
April 1996 plane crash, spent $42,381. 
</P>
<P>
	--Curtis E. von Kann, who investigated and cleared a former  
Clinton White House official, Eli J. Segal, of conflict-of-interest 
allegations, spent $22,632.

during the past two years of global turmoil, the Asian financial 
crisis still pointed up a need for increased supervision of the 
country's 30 largest banks, a Federal Reserve official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Fed's board of governors,  
said that the central bank had begun to overhaul its regulatory 
processes to provide closer supervision of these huge financial 
institutions even before the Asian crisis struck in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that Fed officials realize that ``further  
modifications are required in both that approach and capital 
regulations'' for these institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer said the group of about 30 banks, including one-third that  
are subsidiaries of large foreign banks, have been assigned their 
own team of bank examiners, which is ``dedicated full-time to 
understanding and supervising everything about that organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 banks -- called LCBOs, for large, complex banking  
organizations -- were selected because Fed officials believe they 
have grown to a size and diversity that ``would threaten the 
stability of financial markets around the world in the event of 
their failure,'' Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not specify in his prepared remarks, delivered to a  
conference of bank regulators in Chicago, what modifications to the 
Fed's supervision of these banks was under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that the central bank in all of its regulatory  
activities was looking mainly ``at incremental improvements'' that 
need to be put in place within an existing regulatory structure 
that worked well in the recent crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason the U.S. financial system fared as well as it did,  
Meyer said, was that U.S. banks had learned lessons from a previous 
global crisis, the Latin American banking problems of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the Latin debt problems in 1982, American banks'  
direct exposure in the forms of loans to Latin America represented 
about 125 percent of their capital, the amount in reserves banks 
are required to have on hand to deal with bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Meyer said, in mid-1997, U.S. banks' direct  
exposure to all developing countries around the world represented 
just one-third of their capital. 
</P>
<P>
	While banks have learned the importance of diversifying their  
risks, Meyer said the severity of the Asian crisis, along with the 
near collapse of a highly regarded U.S. hedge fund, Long Term 
Capital Management, demonstrated the need for financial market 
participants to face the future with humility. 
</P>
<P>
	``These examples serve as a reminder that we will not be able to  
know where, when or with how much force the next crisis will hit,'' 
he said. ``However, one of the surest lessons of history is that 
there will be a next crisis, a crisis that will share some 
attributes of the ones that came before while offering new 
challenges in its own right.''

<HEADLINE> Washington To Play Va. Coach in Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Denzel Washington will star in a movie  
about a 1971 high school football team that overcame racial strife 
to win the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember the Titans,'' based on Alexandria's T.C. Williams  
High School, will be filmed in Atlanta, but residents here are 
getting a taste of Hollywood as Disney Films turns to the city to 
help recreate details like police uniforms and Virginia accents. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, the city's three high schools had just merged into T.C.  
Williams High. Two of the three schools were predominantly black. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was the center of racial tension after a white football  
coach was passed over for the top job in favor of Herman Boone, who 
will be portrayed by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Though rumors abound that Washington may visit the school, his  
publicist, Alan Nierob, said this week that is unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Updates To Aid Retirement Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New annual benefit updates for workers paying  
into the Social Security system will help Americans plan for 
retirement, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 500,000 annual contribution and benefit statements  
were being mailed today, Clinton said. Eventually, the Social 
Security Administration plans to send the printed updates to 125 
million workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal administrators hope the statements will encourage more  
workers to see Social Security payments as only one part of a 
broader retirement income plan they must organize before they stop 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	Progress reports are already provided routinely to people  
participating in pension plans and private retirement savings and 
investment programs. Until now, workers had to ask for the 
equivalent statement detailing their Social Security standing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's hard to fully plan for tomorrow when you don't  
know where you stand today,'' Clinton said before leaving for a 
weekend fund-raising swing through Nevada and California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new Social Security statement will help more Americans  
understand what Social Security means to them,'' Clinton said. ``It 
will form a vital part of any family's financial planning and help 
more Americans chart a course to retirement that is clear and 
secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Social Security ``an unshakable covenant among  
generations between workers and retirees, between the disabled and 
the able-bodied,'' Clinton also took a few swipes at congressional 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	While both parties have pledged to protect Social Security from  
budget raids, Clinton said the GOP is using a surplus in the Social 
Security trust fund to offset other spending. Republicans insist 
they will not do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult thing for the Republicans because unlike  
us, they don't want to provide reasonable offsets so that we can 
begin this year to segregate the Social Security surplus from the 
general revenue surplus, and not dip into the Social Security 
surplus anymore,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He congratulated Texas Gov. George W. Bush for his blunt  
put-down of House GOP spending proposals. On Thursday, Bush, the 
front-running Republican for the 2000 presidential nomination, said 
House Republicans should not ``balance their budget on the backs of 
the poor,'' a reference to a proposed plan to save $8 billion over 
the next year by deferring tax credits for low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was delighted to see that he or that any prominent  
Republican finally had joined our position on this,'' Clinton said. 
``What they propose to do is unconscionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, the personalized Social Security letters will go  
out in batches of 500,000 a day, timed so that every worker over 
age 25 will receive an update once a year about three months before 
his or her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted in 1989 to require the mailings, which at 56  
cents a letter will cost about $70 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Administration has been gearing up for the  
task since 1995, by sending sample statements to about 73 million 
people, most over age 40.

<HEADLINE> Nieman Foundation Curator To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman  
Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, has announced he 
will step down from the post in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the foundation's advisory board, Kovach, 67,  
cited ``personal and practical'' reasons for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to wanting to spend more time with his family,  
Kovach said he believes it's time for the program to be led by 
someone with broader knowledge of communications technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The university and future fellows are, as we say these days,  
ready for an upgrade,'' Kovach wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovach said he also plans to write books, including a memoir.  
</P>
<P>
	Kovach came to Harvard as a Nieman fellow himself in 1988 after  
resigning as editor of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution 
following a dispute with the newspaper's owners over editorial 
independence. He was named curator of the program in August 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovach, who submitted his resignation this week, is the third  
head of a major university-based journalism program to resign in 
the past year. James V. Risser, director of the John S. Knight 
Fellowships at Stanford, and Marvin Kalb, head of the Shorenstein 
Center for Press, Politics and Public Policy at the Kennedy School 
of Government at Harvard, announced their retirements earlier this 
year.

<HEADLINE> Big Tuna Stirring Dangerous Hunts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Big tuna are so plentiful off Cape Cod  
this year that inexperienced, weekend fishermen are taking to the 
seas -- and getting in over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three vessels have capsized in the past week, two of  
them because the fish were too big for the boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, we've been very fortunate that we haven't lost anyone  
yet,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Craig Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 47 years he has been fishing off Cape Cod, old salt Russ  
Chase said he has never seen tuna fever like this. ``You get the 
plumbers going out, you get the carpenters,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisheries officials are not sure exactly why there is an  
abundance of tuna this year. What is certain is that fishermen are 
risking their necks for the thrill of landing a 700-pound tuna -- 
and because a single fish can bring in a lot of clams. 
</P>
<P>
	At an average of $6 to $8 a pound, a big tuna can mean earning  
$4,000 to $5,000 for one day's work. And there are rumors that 
buyers from Japan, where tuna is prized for sushi, will pay $50,000 
for an especially fatty bluefin, said Kevin Sullivan of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service in New Bedford. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Hatch, who fishes on the 30-foot fishing boat Big Eye II,  
said he caught a 650-pound tuna on Monday and intended to go out 
again next week. The fishing has been so good, Hatch said, he's 
seen hundreds of boats at one time clustered in prime waters, 
looking for a bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of gone crazy,'' he said. ``There's so much pressure  
when the bite's on. ... There's the potential to make a lot of 
money and people do stupid things like going out in bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the weekend fishermen are venturing 50 miles or so off  
Cape Cod in small boats that aren't sturdy enough to handle a 
bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the weather changing real quick, they can get into  
trouble,'' said Andrea Currie, acting commander of the Coast Guard 
cutter Hammerhead, which has stepped up patrols of the tuna fishing 
grounds. ``You'll have two or three people in a boat, they'll catch 
a tuna and all go to the same side of the boat with the fish -- then 
over they go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 23, a 28-foot boat was hauling a 600-pound fish off  
Nantucket when it swamped and sank. Another vessel rescued the 
skipper and crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, a 27-foot boat capsized while being towed to port  
after running into problems tangling with a tuna. That night, the 
skipper of a 19-foot vessel had to be rescued after it capsized 
during a battle with a tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisheries officers have gone undercover on the piers and on the  
fishing grounds, investigating tips that some people are catching 
more than one tuna per day -- a federal offense punishable by a fine 
up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard is also boarding and inspecting fishing vessels,  
checking to make sure they have the added safety equipment -- rafts, 
flares, immersion suits and beacons -- that is required farther from 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our primary concern is that we don't lose anyone,'' Jaramillo  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Pistons Center Dele Might Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Detroit Pistons center Bison Dele's  
announcement that he might retire came as no surprise, but his 
talent will be missed, coach Alvin Gentry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love to have Bison on our team. ... I think talent rules  
in this league,'' Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, 30, told the Pistons Wednesday of a possible desire to  
retire. In the following 48 hours, Pistons' executive vice 
presidents Rick Sund and Joe Dumars and Gentry talked with Dele. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele was in Beirut and didn't plan to return to the United  
States for a couple of weeks, missing the start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Gentry said Terry Mills, who returned to Detroit after two years  
on the bench of the Miami Heat, could replace Dele in the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not prepared to lose a good player, but we're prepared  
to move ahead,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sund emphasized the team's commitment to have Dele return, but  
said he doesn't anticipate that Dele would report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to be realistic,'' Sund said. ``He's still  
contemplating whether he wants to play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele's agent said when Dele gets back, they will talk with team  
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going through an epiphanal moment in his life,'' agent  
Dwight Manley said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``His representative has said he doesn't have the motivation,''  
Dumars, the Pistons director of player of personnel, said. ``If he 
shows up, he shows up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gentry and Sund said Dele has handled the situation well. Sund  
suggested that a worse situation would be Dele showing up for camp 
without the right mindset to play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, a 6-foot-11 center, has played two seasons in Detroit. He  
stands to walk away from about $30 million, with five years left on 
a contract that called for him to receive $45 million for seven 
seasons. He was the team's highest-paid player. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele was signed by Detroit as a free agent, and his relationship  
with his teammates was known to be strained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had heard that he might not come back, and I have tried a  
couple of times to call him,'' Pistons star Grant Hill said. ``I 
don't want to comment on any of this because I don't know what is 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after joining the Pistons, Dele admitted his passion for  
basketball was not the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had the kind of passion for basketball that my dad had  
for music,'' said Dele, whose father was a member of the Platters. 
``If I had the same kind of passion for basketball as my dad had 
for music, I probably would be a better player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele averaged 10.5 points and 6.2 rebounds last season, 16.2  
points and 8.9 rebounds the previous season.

	LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- A couple who ran a day care center in their  
home were charged with supplying drugs that were sold from a gas 
station at all hours of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The day care operators, Nancy Nunez, 31, and Edwin DeJesus, 30,  
pleaded innocent Friday to drug trafficking and distribution 
charges. Each was held on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	When police went to arrest the couple at the home Thursday, they

scales and more than $20,000 in cash. Six children were at the 
house at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nunez has been licensed to run a family child care center  
from her home since 1995. The state suspended her license pending 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police went to the day care center after arresting the owner and

seven-month investigation. Police said Ms. Nunez and DeJesus 
supplied the drugs that were sold at the station.

<HEADLINE> HUD Aids Welfare-to-Work Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting dollars behind the effort to guide  
welfare recipients to employment, the government awarded $280 
million in vouchers designed to help about 50,000 families across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	This initial distribution of the welfare-to-work vouchers by the  
Department of Housing and Urban Development will subsidize rents of 
low-income families receiving welfare or recently off welfare to 
enable them to rent apartments near available jobs, child care and 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The vouchers will be distributed to 121 state and local housing  
agencies, Indian tribes and tribally designated housing agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight largest awards were designated by Congress and went to  
Anchorage, Alaska; San Bernardino County, Calif.; Miami-Dade 
County; Prince George's County, Md.; Kansas City, Mo.; Charlotte, 
N.C.; New York City; and Cleveland. Each of the largest awards was 
about $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're helping members of struggling families get jobs so they  
can work their way out of poverty and build better lives,'' HUD 
Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Friday.

	``Our economy is booming, and many suburban employers can't find  
all the workers they need. When we help unemployed people get 
housing closer to these unfilled jobs, we enable them to move off 
the welfare rolls and onto payrolls,'' Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vouchers are designed to correct an imbalance that has  
hindered the transition for some who left welfare. It arises 
because two-thirds of new jobs are in suburbs, while most welfare 
recipients live in rural areas or central cities, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us blessed with good housing and good jobs shouldn't  
turn our backs on those left behind,'' Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, a federal report showed the percentage of Americans  
on welfare at the lowest level since 1967. Welfare rolls were 49 
percent lower than their all-time high in 1994, and 29 states had 
cut their rolls by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	As of March, just 2.7 percent of the population -- or 7.3 million  
Americans -- was on welfare, the fewest since Lyndon Johnson's 
presidency. In 1967, the figure was 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> UAW Presents Tentative GM Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers presented tentative  
contracts with General Motors Corp. and its former parts unit to 
its local union leaders Friday, while negotiations at Ford Motor 
Co. intensified. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 union officials gathered here to hear details of the  
contracts covering 185,000 workers at GM and Delphi Automotive 
Systems. The union said the deal gives the average assembly worker 
$29,900 in wage increases, bonuses and holidays over the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's executive council unanimously recommended the  
contract to the local unions, where ratification votes are expected 
to be completed by Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW President Stephen P. Yokich said labor relations between GM  
and the UAW have improved since last summer's 54-day strike at two 
Flint parts factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Hawkins, chairman of Local 598 in Flint, said the deal  
gives workers more money and greater job security, and hopefully 
sets the stage for smoother relations between the union and GM. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials and Ford spokesman Ed Miller said committee  
meetings were planned at Ford through the weekend. Miller said 
there was progress in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Friday that Ford plans to spin off  
its auto parts division to shareholders and give wage and job 
guarantees to factory workers -- the same steps GM took with Delphi 
when it spun it off last May. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible spinoff of Ford's Visteon Automotive Systems has  
been opposed by UAW leaders, who fear that Visteon's 23,500 UAW 
members would face pay cuts, plant closures and fewer union jobs 
under an independent company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said an announcement about Visteon was expected in  
about a month. Yokich said Friday the issue had not been discussed 
yet with Ford. ``They know more about it than I do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford declined to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	The GM and Delphi deals closely follow the UAW's contract with  
DaimlerChrysler AG, according to a union summary of the agreements. 
They give workers an annual increase of 3 percent a year for all 
four years, a $1,350 signing bonus and improved cost of living 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deals have several clauses aimed at protecting union  
jobs. If employment drops below 80 percent of a set level in a 
bargaining unit, GM and Delphi must replace each job lost. If the 
level is between 80 percent and 90 percent, one of every two empty 
positions must be filled; between 90 and 100 percent, the ratio is 
1-to-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The job minimums drop 5 percent over the life of the contract.  
</P>
<P>
	GM and Delphi also agreed not to spin off any division into a  
separate business or close or sell any factories. GM and Delphi 
also pledged to take a neutral stance toward union organizing 
drives, and would not take work away from a plant that forms a 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delphi contract allows workers to transfer back to GM when  
openings occur, and gives them until Jan. 1 to retire with GM 
pensions. If Delphi goes out of business during the contract, the 
workers' layoff benefits would come from GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also improves pensions -- an important goal for the  
UAW's older workforce. For a GM or Delphi worker who retires with 
30 years of experience and is not yet eligible for Social Security, 
monthly benefits would rise from $2,295 under the existing pact to 
$2,730 by the end of the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also increased the lump sum payment retirees would  
get based on inflation. If inflation increases by up to 2 percent a 
year, retirees would get a lump sum of $885. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few new clauses. GM agreed to involve the union  
earlier in the design process of a new vehicle or part, including 
fuel cell projects. Workers won the right to ask for a review of a 
work assignment if they believe it to be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Delphi will hire 3,000 new apprentices in skilled trades,  
and increased the maximum moving payment to $23,500, a raise of 
$1,500. Workers will get the federal Election Day off in 2000 and 
2002, and the UAW flag will be flown over plants the union 
represents. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW negotiators with Ford have presented the DaimlerChrysler  
contract to the company as a starting point. The Times reported 
that the union is expected to allow Ford to follow the lead of GM's 
spinoff of Delphi, which the union also opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had considered selling Visteon, but decided against it  
because of labor issues and tax considerations, the Times reported. 
Visteon had $17.8 billion in revenue in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Drops Restroom Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAPHNE, Ala. (AP) -- A high school teacher who charged students  
25 cents to go to the bathroom ended the practice after a student 
who didn't have the money soiled himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Floyd said her 14-year-old son could not go to to the  
restroom during Robert McKillion's computer class because he didn't 
have a quarter. The boy waited until the end of class but could not 
make it to the restroom in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teacher told him that he should have said it was an  
emergency,'' Mrs. Floyd said Thursday. ``He shouldn't have had to 
do that. Kids don't like to call attention to themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKillion, who teaches at Daphne High School in southwest  
Alabama, did not return a call for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Principal Barry Pennington said students in McKillion's four  
computer classes unanimously approved the charges. Pennington said 
the intention was to use the accumulated money for a pizza party at 
the end of the semester. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said students were not required to pay.  
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney David Whetstone said he would investigate.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe you can take money from students to go to the  
bathroom, even if the payment is voluntary,'' Whetstone said. ``I'm 
quite sure we could not treat prisoners that way.''

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Grew in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector grew in  
September much more strongly than expected, while prices of raw 
materials soared to the highest level in more than four years, 
according to a business survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the National Association of Purchasing Management  
confirms that industry is recovering from the setbacks of the Asian 
financial crisis and provides further evidence that the overall 
economy rebounded from a sluggish second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department said the personal income of  
Americans climbed in August for the eighth consecutive month. But 
their spending rose faster, leaving the nation's savings rate 
matching a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of reports kept alive Wall Street's fears that  
the economy is overheating, sending stocks and bonds tumbling on 
worries that the Federal Reserve will try to cool things off by 
raising interest rates for a third time this year. Fed 
policy-makers meet Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down nearly 153 at one  
point Friday and closed with a drop of 63.95 points at 10,273.00. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' group said the manufacturing sector  
grew in September for the eighth consecutive month. Its index rose 
to 57.8 percent -- the highest since a reading of 59.2 percent in 
November 1994 -- and was up sharply from 54.2 percent in August. 
Analysts had expected little change in September. 
</P>
<P>
	A reading of more than 50 is a sign of an expanding industrial  
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The index is closely watched because it is the first national  
reading for September on U.S. manufacturing performance, a key 
sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said earlier this week that the U.S. economy grew  
at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent in the April-June quarter, 
but many analysts viewed the spring lethargy as a brief pause, 
predicting stronger growth for the second half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	David Huether, director of economic analysis for the National  
Association of Manufacturers, said Friday's purchasing managers' 
report appeared to support expectations of renewed economic 
strength. He said he believed the nation's gross domestic product 
grew by at least 3 percent in the July-September period. 
</P>
<P>
	Huether said that while there were signs of recovery from the  
Asian crisis, which began in the summer of 1997, exports still 
remain sluggish. ``I don't see exports increasing a lot until 
probably mid-2000,'' Huether said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's economic expansion, which began in March 1991,  
already is the longest period of peacetime growth in U.S. history. 
It would match the record of 106 months -- set in the period of 
February 1961 until December 1969 -- of it continues through January 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the management group's business  
survey committee, said in a statement releasing the September 
results that NAPM's price index jumped to its highest level since 
May 1995, ``indicating that manufacturers continue to pay higher 
prices for their purchases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price index surged to 67.6 percent in September from 59.8  
percent in August. That was the highest since 70.5 percent in May 
1995, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price reading could signal a squeeze for manufacturers, said  
Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. 
But he said it does not necessarily mean a rise in consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's little evidence manufacturers will be able to pass on  
higher prices to consumers because of a lot of import 
competition,'' he said. As a result, he said, manufacturers 
probably will have to find ways to absorb the added costs or to 
increase productivity further. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department report showed that personal income --  
which includes wages, interest and government benefits -- rose 0.5 
percent in August, the eighth straight monthly increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was a bit more than the 0.4 percent forecast by  
analysts and followed a 0.2 percent increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	But spending went up 0.9 percent in August, also more than  
analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage  
of after-tax income -- fell to minus 1.5 percent, matching the 
record low set in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, the Commerce Department said that  
construction spending fell an unexpected 0.4 percent in August to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $692 billion, a sign that one of 
the economy's strongest sectors is beginning to slow.

<P>
	LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- Eva Israelsen, who lived long enough to have  
271 great-grandchildren, died Thursday, five days before her 105th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Israelsen appeared in Life magazine in October 1993 in an  
article noting the birth of her 200th and 201st 
great-grandchildren. Since then, her progeny has grown to 271 
great-grandchildren and 40 great-great-grandchildren. She had 11 
original children, and they had 67 kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Eva May Butler on Oct. 5, 1894, she met Victor E. Israelsen  
while attending Utah Agricultural College, now Utah State 
University, in the 1920s and later married him. 
</P>
<P>
	They spent their lives on a dairy farm. Mrs. Israelsen remained  
active well past her 100th birthday, walking at least a mile a day.

representative and restaurateur, died Wednesday from cancer. He was 
55. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelso was a political novice in 1996 when he ran for the state

	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jack Kiefer, a two-time winner on  
the Senior PGA Tour who was diagnosed last year with cancer in his 
spinal cord, died Sept. 24. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer won the 1994 Ralphs Senior Classic and the du Maurier  
Champions in 1997, when he finished 16th on the money list. He 
played 12 events in 1998 before he was diagnosed with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiefer was a pitcher for Millersville State College in 1961, and  
his knuckleball earned him a contract with the Detroit Tigers. But 
after three days in camp, he left baseball and took up golf. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned professional in 1967 and joined the senior tour in  
1990. He had a reputation as an iron man for playing at least 30 
tournaments a year every season except 1992.

``straightforward explanation'' about the Vietnam war, died 
Wednesday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' 1967 sermon to the visiting Johnson at Bruton Parish  
Episcopal Church prompted the church's vestry and the governor of

</P>
<P>
	Lewis was rector of the church from 1956-85. The congregation

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Dmitry Likhachyov, a literary historian who was  
one of Russia's most respected cultural figures, died Thursday. He 
was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Likhachyov, sometimes described as ``the conscience of Russia,''  
spent four years, from 1928-32, in one of the Soviet Union's most 
dreaded prison camps, Solovki, located in a former monastery on a 
northern Russian island. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he became a prominent defender of the country's  
cultural heritage. He fought to protect the purity of texts written 
by Russia's most famous poet, Alexander Pushkin, to whom 
counterfeiters have long attributed fake diaries. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, President Boris Yeltsin awarded Likhachyov one of  
the country's highest honors, the Order of St. Andrew, for 
contributions to the development of national culture. 
</P>

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Arville Schaleben, a reporter and editor who  
filed dispatches from six continents and interviewed Will Rogers in 
Alaska just before the humorist's death in an airplane crash, died 
Thursday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaleben was hired by The Milwaukee Journal as a reporter in  
1929 and became an assistant city editor about eight years later. 
He was named executive editor in 1962 and an associate editor soon 
after. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a major factor in the Journal's coverage of water  
pollution, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1967, retired editor 
Richard Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaleben interviewed Rogers while in Alaska to write about the  
more than 1,100 members of Depression-era families from the Midwest 
who colonized the Matanuska Valley as part of President Roosevelt's 
New Deal. The interview would be Rogers' last. Shortly after that 
his plane crashed, killing both Rogers and pilot Wiley Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaleben was a past president of the Wisconsin Associated Press  
Managing Editors Association and sat on the national APME board. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1936-40 he was president of the Milwaukee Press Club.  
</P>
<P>
	He lectured at about 50 college campuses and, after retirement  
from The Journal, taught journalism at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and 
Indiana University in Bloomington.

<P>
	Survivors include his wife and four children.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Deliberations To Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- Jurors deliberating a breach of contract  
case against State Farm went home Friday without reaching a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury is scheduled to resume its work on the class-action  
lawsuit at 9 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for policyholders suing the Bloomington-based insurer  
claim the company's requirement that body shops use generic 
auto-body repair parts on its customers' cars violates its 
contractual promise to restore vehicles to the way they were before 
an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of so-called aftermarket parts say they fail to meet the  
standards for fit, finish, corrosion protection and, in some cases, 
safety, provided by original equipment parts. Aftermarket parts are 
modeled on parts made for automakers but produced without benefit 
of factory specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm says use of the parts does not affect driver safety  
and helps hold premiums down. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate consumer fraud count being decided by Williamson  
County Judge John Speroni, the lawyers are accusing State Farm of 
consumer fraud for concealing concerns about the parts' quality. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the plaintiffs are seeking nearly $5.4 billion in  
damages. The lawsuit combines the potential claims of 4.7 million 
current and former State Farm policyholders.

<HEADLINE>  Candidates Woo Christian Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Republican presidential candidates showed  
off their conservative credentials Friday, Christian Coalition 
founder Pat Robertson deemed Gary Bauer a ``lost cause,'' Elizabeth 
Dole ``a Southern belle'' and George W. Bush ``worthy of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Pat Buchanan, Robertson gave a stern warning that Christian  
conservatives will desert him if he ditches the GOP for a 
third-party presidential run with the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform supporters are ``180 degrees out in terms of social  
issues. They don't share any of the views that Pat Buchanan claimed 
to espouse so vociferously,'' Robertson told a news conference at 
the coalition's annual ``Road to Victory'' conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see him taking many Christian conservatives with him --  
not to the Reform Party,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day conference drew 3,500 of the coalition's 2.1 million  
members and six of the eight Republicans running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Bush, the Texas governor and front-runner for the GOP  
nomination, who filled all the seats -- and lined the perimeter's 
standing room -- in a cavernous hotel ballroom. ``Every child born 
and unborn must be protected by law and welcomed to life,'' he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	He advocated parental-notification laws on abortion, saying  
``Parents should be the first to help, not the last to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, the religious broadcaster who commands the  
grass-roots army of Christian activists that helped sweep 
Republicans into control of Congress in the 1994 elections, said he 
will not endorse any presidential candidate during the primary 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But his preferences were clear.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Robertson all but dismissed Bauer, whose  
teen-aged supporters in campaign T-shirts worked Friday's 
convention in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to win,'' Robertson told The New York Times.  
``You don't win with 1 or 2 percent. Most people are not terribly 
keen on riding a lost cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who once ran the Family Research Council and prides  
himself on his Christian conservative appeal, appeared taken aback 
when informed of Robertson's remark. He said he was disappointed 
Robertson was not taking a straw poll of members at this year's 
convention. ``Then we wouldn't have to sit around and speculate on 
where the leaders are,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said some of what he's heard from Bush's ``centrist''  
campaign ``so far would cause me to believe he would be worthy of 
support of the coalition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Robertson added he is eager to see a series of debates  
force Bush to ``crystallize his positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bauer promised that, unlike Bush, he would make a  
judge's opposition to abortion rights a prerequisite for 
appointment to any federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Bauer shouted, ``My judges are going to understand that  
marriage is between a man and a woman -- not two men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole took the stage to the rolling crescendos of the music from  
``Gone With the Wind'' and talked of her religious upbringing. She 
called her grandmother's tattered Bible her dearest treasure. 
</P>

the latest polling data.''

<HEADLINE>  Candidates Woo Christian Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Republican presidential candidates showed  
off their conservative credentials Friday, Christian Coalition 
founder Pat Robertson deemed Gary Bauer a ``lost cause,'' Elizabeth 
Dole ``a Southern belle'' and George W. Bush ``worthy of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Pat Buchanan, Robertson gave a stern warning that Christian  
conservatives will desert him if he ditches the GOP for a 
third-party presidential run with the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform supporters are ``180 degrees out in terms of social  
issues. They don't share any of the views that Pat Buchanan claimed 
to espouse so vociferously,'' Robertson told a news conference at 
the coalition's annual ``Road to Victory'' conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see him taking many Christian conservatives with him --  
not to the Reform Party,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day conference drew 3,500 of the coalition's 2.1 million  
members and six of the eight Republicans running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Bush, the Texas governor and front-runner for the GOP  
nomination, who filled all the seats -- and lined the perimeter's 
standing room -- in a cavernous hotel ballroom. ``Every child born 
and unborn must be protected by law and welcomed to life,'' he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	He advocated parental-notification laws on abortion, saying  
``Parents should be the first to help, not the last to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, the religious broadcaster who commands the  
grass-roots army of Christian activists that helped sweep 
Republicans into control of Congress in the 1994 elections, said he 
will not endorse any presidential candidate during the primary 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But his preferences were clear.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Robertson all but dismissed Bauer, whose  
teen-aged supporters in campaign T-shirts worked Friday's 
convention in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to win,'' Robertson told The New York Times.  
``You don't win with 1 or 2 percent. Most people are not terribly 
keen on riding a lost cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who once ran the Family Research Council and prides  
himself on his Christian conservative appeal, appeared taken aback 
when informed of Robertson's remark. He said he was disappointed 
Robertson was not taking a straw poll of members at this year's 
convention. ``Then we wouldn't have to sit around and speculate on 
where the leaders are,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said some of what he's heard from Bush's ``centrist''  
campaign ``so far would cause me to believe he would be worthy of 
support of the coalition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Robertson added he is eager to see a series of debates  
force Bush to ``crystallize his positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bauer promised that, unlike Bush, he would make a  
judge's opposition to abortion rights a prerequisite for 
appointment to any federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Bauer shouted, ``My judges are going to understand that  
marriage is between a man and a woman -- not two men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole took the stage to the rolling crescendos of the music from  
``Gone With the Wind'' and talked of her religious upbringing. She 
called her grandmother's tattered Bible her dearest treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment is to strive to lean on the lord with my whole  
heart, reading his word daily and earnestly seeking his will in my 
life,'' Dole said. ``I learned from the best -- President Reagan -- 
that you have to lead with the convictions of your heart, not with 
the latest polling data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said later that she gave a ``wonderful speech'' and  
enjoys ``real support'' from his members. Asked to explain the 
music organizers chose for her entrance, Robertson boyishly 
shrugged. ``She's the Southern belle, right?''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Discusses Managing Someday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Someday, Mark McGwire might like Tony La  
Russa's job. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman has never enjoyed daily  
contact with reporters. But heading into the opener of a 
season-ending, three-game series against Sammy Sosa and the Chicago 
Cubs, McGwire said Friday night that things would be different once 
his playing days end. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wouldn't be asking me all these (home run) questions,''  
McGwire said. ``It'll be, `Why didn't you bunt, or hit and run?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who turned 36 Friday, has no plans to retire anytime  
soon. Not after hitting a record 70 homers last year and entering 
the final weekend of this season with 63 -- one more than Sosa. He 
entered the series with 520 homers, one behind Ted Williams and 
Willie McCovey for 10th on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	But someday he'd like a shot at working with young players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to stay in the game,'' McGwire said. ``I  
want to teach. I've been on the top of the game, I've been on the 
bottom of the game, I've had injuries and I've thought about 
retiring, so I've got a lot to offer. I don't know where I'd start, 
but this is the only game in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire even said he already has a coaching staff in mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once, he said I could be his bench coach,'' La Russa said.  
``He said he thought I was good enough to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa, who's expected to sign a contract extension after the  
season to stay in St. Louis, said McGwire, unlike many star 
players, would make a good manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's actually been talking about it for years,'' La Russa  
said. ``I think he could. Whenever you hear any player that says he 
wants to coach or manage, especially a star player talking about 
staying in the game, it gets your attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said it definitely would be about love of the game,  
rather than income flow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys you might think, `Well, he doesn't have enough money  
and that's his profession,' '' La Russa said. ``But when a star 
player with a lot of money does it, that tells you how much he 
really enjoys the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both McGwire and Sosa downplayed the home run chase sequel.  
McGwire, who won 70-66 last year, said Sosa's presence won't 
greatly affect his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's all Sammy that pushes me, it's myself that  
pushes me,'' McGwire said. ``I think everybody gets motivated from 
other people, not just in athletics but in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa said he didn't worry about whether he finished first or  
second. He also said with a bit of sarcasm that he pays attention 
to McGwire's at-bats because: ``I'm in right field. I've got to 
watch the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs manager Jim Riggleman downplayed it even more than the  
stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how uninterested I am in all of this,''  
Riggleman said. ``Sure, Sammy's a big reason we win ballgames, like 
Mark is a big reason they win ballgames. But somebody's going to 
have to tell me how many home runs they end up with.''

<HEADLINE> Airwalk Moving HQ to Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOALSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Airwalk International plans to move its  
corporate headquarters to the Denver, Colo., area by mid-December, 
the footwear and outdoor sports equipment company announced. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 100-person staff at the Boalsburg headquarters  
will make the move to Colorado, according to a company news release 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was acquired in July by Sunrise Capital Partners, a  
New York-based investment fund, from George Yohn of Altoona, a 
company founder. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Airwalk officials insisted the company would stay  
local and management would stay intact. But spokeswoman Linda 
Nielander said an internal analysis concluded that a Colorado 
address would better mesh with its youthful image. 
</P>
<P>
	Airwalk targets 8- to 24-year-olds. The company is named for a  
skateboarding term.

<HEADLINE> AP Sample Stock Portfolio Survives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There's no getting around the fact that the third quarter was a  
loser for stocks -- even the most well-diversified portfolios took a 
big hit. But a sample portfolio for small investors put together by 
The Associated Press found a small hedge in a once-unlikely place: 
Pacific Rim stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio, which contains three mutual funds and three  
widely-held stocks, lost 6.5 percent of its value during the 
quarter, faring slightly worse than the Dow Jones industrial 
average, which lost nearly 5.8 percent, and just beating the 6.6 
percent decline in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
	But the portfolio, put together in October 1997, is still up  
nearly 8.2 percent for the year, behind the Dow's 12.6 percent but 
ahead of the S&AMP;P's 4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about interest rates dominated Wall Street during the  
quarter, pulling major market indexes including the Dow industrials 
down from record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio's worst performer was Coca-Cola, which fell 22.2  
percent as the company's own problems, including a warning that 
third-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations, were 
compounded by the overall market's malaise. 
</P>
<P>
	A relatively minor 1.4 percent drop in Wal-Mart's stock helped  
lessen some of the damage to the portfolio. The third stock 
holding, IBM, was off 6.4 percent during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The brightest spot in the portfolio was the Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter Pacific Growth Fund, which had the only gain among the 
portfolio's six holdings. The fund, which along with other Asian 
investments continued its recovery from devastating losses that 
began two years ago, was up 4.5 percent in the just-ended quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and other Asian nations showed increasing signs that their  
economies were regaining strength, and investors who have patiently 
waited for Pacific stocks and funds to recover found these 
investments were a good buffer against losses in U.S. investments. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the T. Rowe Price U.S. Treasury Long-Term Fund, added  
to the portfolio to help cushion against stock market declines, 
fell short of that goal during the third quarter. The fund suffered 
a 1.7 percent loss as the bond market was consumed by its own 
interest rate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The last component of the portfolio, the Vanguard Index Trust  
500 Portfolio fund, which tracks the S&AMP;P 500, fell 6.5 percent 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio was valued at $25,299.85 at its inception and was  
worth $39,242.51 as the third quarter ended.

<HEADLINE> Nixon Secret Tapes To Be Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Copies of President Nixon's tapes wound around  
5,000 plastic reels will be shredded and burned in the next few 
months because they contain personal and political talk the court 
says the public isn't allowed to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Archives holds 3,700 hours of Nixon tapes the  
government seized when the president resigned in August 1974 
following a break-in of the Democratic National Committee 
headquarters at the Watergate complex and the White House cover-up 
that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Archives spokeswoman Susan Cooper emphasized that no original  
tapes are being destroyed, saying those being destroyed are just 
copies made from the originals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not archival records,'' she said. ``We are simply  
cleaning house and we're doing it in response to the court 
ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tape from the copies ``will be taken off the reels and  
deposited in burn bags,'' said Ms. Cooper. ``We will take them to 
the Pentagon where they are shredded and then burned. All of these 
procedures are witnessed by two of our employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, the Supreme Court ordered the archives to destroy or  
return to the Nixon estate all portions of the tapes that contain 
personal or private conversations, such as Nixon's chats with his 
wife or daughters. The court also ordered the archives to destroy 
or return purely political conversations in which Nixon was 
speaking as head of the Republican Party, not president. Subsequent 
court rulings affirmed the 1977 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	John Taylor, executive director of the Nixon Library &AMP;  
Birthplace Foundation in Yorba Linda, Calif., said he is not 
disturbed by the planned destruction of the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the course of working on the tapes over the last quarter  
century, the archives has made all kinds of different copies -- some 
of which are no longer state-of-the-art and are not digital,'' 
Taylor said. ``With all this dramatic burning and splicing and 
everything that the archives talks about, not a single second of 
information is being lost or destroyed. They're not destroying 
anything that's otherwise irreplaceable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While no portions of the original Nixon tapes are being  
destroyed now, the archives is working on a tedious project to cut 
an estimated 15,000 snippets of conversation determined to be 
personal, private or political that are scattered throughout the 
fragile originals. This project was also required by the 1977 court 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're waiting to get a response from the Nixon estate as to  
what they want us to do with the excised material,'' said Karl 
Weissenbach, director of Nixon materials at the archives. ``It's up 
to them whether we can dispose of it or return it to the Nixon 
estate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Nixon resigned 25 years ago, only about 420 hours of  
the 3,700 hours of his tape recordings have been released. On 
Tuesday, the archives plans to release 445 more hours of Nixon 
tapes recorded in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Five Family Members Shot in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAYNESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Five family members who had just come  
home from a fair were shot to death by two men who stole their 
pickup truck and car, police said. One suspect was arrested Friday 
and charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Shotgun shells littered the winding driveway leading to the  
rural home where the victims were slain Thursday night. Four were 
found dead inside, while the fifth was outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the killers apparently stole the pickup but  
wrecked it at the bottom of the family's driveway, went back and 
took another car, which was discovered smashed into a guard rail on 
Interstate 40 two miles east of the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Wesley Roache, 25, was caught by a neighbor of the  
victims and later charged with murder. The neighbor held him at 
gunpoint until police arrived, while the other suspect fled. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are good people who live down here,'' Haywood County  
Sheriff Tom Alexander said. ``They look out for each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 officers, aided by tracking dogs and helicopters,  
searched the rugged Blue Ridge Mountain foothills for the second 
man, who was believed to be on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	David Barnes, an agent with the State Bureau of Investigation,  
said blood was found in both vehicles, meaning the gunman was 
probably injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander identified the victims as Earl Phillips, 72; his wife,  
Cora, 71; their son Eddie, 40; their daughter-in-law, Mitzi, 44; 
and their granddaughter, Katie, 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good people, they were churchgoing people, they never  
harmed nobody,'' neighbor Rita Messer said. ``It's awful. You ain't 
safe in your own home, you're not safe in church. I don't know what 
this world is coming to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Phillipses were retired. Eddie Phillips was a dump  
truck driver, and his wife worked at a textile plant and ran a 
beauty shop out of her home, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to comprehend something like this happening where,  
you know, nothing ever happens,'' said Robert Rose, a 66-year-old 
cousin of Earl Phillips.

<HEADLINE> Guenter Grass Wins Nobel Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Praise poured in from literary colleagues after  
novelist Guenter Grass, Germany's best-known postwar writer, was 
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Academy in Stockholm, Sweden, honored Grass on  
Thursday as one of the most prominent authors to emerge from a 
group of young intellectuals who set out to revive German 
literature after the Nazi era. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 71-year-old author of ``The Tin Drum,'' the prize  
bolstered his standing as a moral arbiter of post-unity Germany who 
has untiringly warned his compatriots to remain vigilant against 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	British author Salman Rushdie, in a statement through his agent,  
called Grass ``the greatest European novelist of the second half of 
the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grass is widely admired by his literary contemporaries, but also  
controversial for his outspoken political stands. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who once said the horrors of Auschwitz could not have  
occurred without a strong Germany was horrified at the nation's 
quick unification in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 
has never shed his fear that Germany may stray again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be that my children and grandchildren will have to  
suffer under the stigma of being German,'' he said after Thursday's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``But these late-born children also have a share of the  
responsibility for ensuring that such things -- even their stirrings 
-- never happen in Germany again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, publishers rushed Grass' books into print to meet huge  
demand in the wake of the Nobel announcement. Bookstores set up 
special tables with his works as Germans snapped them up. The 
Steidl publishing house, which holds the rights to his works, said 
its entire stock of some 100,000 Grass books sold out after the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, German public television paid an unlikely tribute to  
Grass: It had him read an early-morning weather forecast that 
combined the mundane with his leftist views. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing outdoors, Grass said Sunday would be sunny in the  
south. He then urged people in neighboring Austria to turn out to 
vote against a rightist party whose popularity is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass has infuriated politicians in recent years with critiques  
of ``barbaric'' capitalism taking over after communism and by 
attacking German immigration policy as racist. 
</P>
<P>
	His literary reputation was made with ``The Tin Drum,'' ``Cat  
and Mouse'' and ``Dog Years,'' published between 1959 and 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``The Tin Drum,'' the Nobel Academy said, ``it was as if  
German literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of 
linguistic and moral destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book's main character, Oskar Matzerath, refuses to grow up  
under the Nazi regime, staying a dwarf in protest and beating his 
tin drum as a warning. German director Volker Schloendorff later 
based a movie on the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining naturalistic detail with fantastical images, the novel  
trilogy captured the German reaction to the rise of Nazism, the 
horrors of the war and the guilt that lingered after Adolf Hitler's 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass drew on his own experience of military service in the Nazi  
air force late in World War II and his captivity as a prisoner of 
war held by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Again and again, his books returned to his native town of Danzig  
(now Gdansk, Poland), a symbol of Germany's painful relationship 
with its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never failed to confront Germans with what they did, but  
always with a great sense of the vitality,'' 1991 Nobel laureate 
Nadine Gordimer told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, some reactions were more muted. Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder honored Grass as a ``competent critic of society.'' His 
culture minister, Michael Naumann, called him a ``difficult, 
imaginative author.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Grass' more recent works received decidedly mixed  
reviews. His 1995 novel ``A Broad Field'' attempted to explain 
Germany's new identity after unification, but many critics said it 
fell short. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore Attacks Bradley for Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore accused Democratic rival Bill Bradley  
of trying to ``duck'' his challenge to debate every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Gore challenged Bradley to a series of  
debates leading up to the primaries. His campaign later said Gore 
wanted a series of biweekly debates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has not specifically turned down Gore's proposal, but  
his campaign chairman sent a letter to Gore's campaign outlining 
several previously arranged events in the next several months that 
will give the two candidates an opportunity to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley claims he's a different kind of politician but  
apparently he's the kind that ducks debates -- the very forums that 
offer voters their very best chance to hear what the candidates 
have to offer and lets them go one-on-one,'' Gore spokesman Chris 
Lehane said in response. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser disputed Lehane's assessment.  
``The letter makes it clear that we are happy to debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Douglas Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman,  
pointed to an Oct. 27 joint town hall meeting in Manchester, N.H., 
and several forums next year at which the candidates could debate 
issues. 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth  
Dole wants President Clinton to act quickly to help residents in 
her home state of North Carolina who were hardest hit by Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the president, the former American Red Cross  
president said hurricane damages are expected to exceed $6 billion. 
Thousands of people are without homes and jobs because of flooding 
and many are living in temporary shelters, Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to send to Congress a comprehensive disaster  
assistance package for the ravaged communities caught in the wake 
of Hurricane Floyd,'' Dole wrote in the Sept. 30 letter that her 
campaign made public on Friday. ``To delay would only add to the 
devastation suffered by those affected communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has issued disaster declarations for North Carolina to  
speed the release of federal funds for recovery efforts. On 
Thursday, Vice President Al Gore announced the release of $20.3 
million in funds to help families in low-income areas rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also is expected to send a disaster relief package to  
Congress.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush has removed a Houston Chronicle sports columnist as the 
ghostwriter of his upcoming autobiography in a dispute over how 
many policy details should be included in the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes will complete the book, and her  
name will appear as ghostwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Herskowitz said his initial deal was that the book would  
be ``30 percent biography, 70 percent issues and (campaign) 
platform,'' the Chronicle reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hughes disagreed, saying it was to be a ``broad-strokes book  
on the governor's themes and philosophies and how he arrived at 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herskowitz said he sought detailed policy positions from the  
Bush campaign after completing the biographical portion of the book 
last summer but that he could not glean Bush's stands on the issues 
from a carton of speeches sent over by the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush's staff said the governor's positions were ``still  
evolving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting between Ms. Hughes, Herskowitz and Bush, they  
decided that the veteran spokeswoman would finish the policy 
portion of the book and take the writing credit. Herskowitz will be 
acknowledged for ``getting the project started,'' she said.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Republican Party launched  
a Web site Friday that will track Vice President Al Gore's 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced Wednesday that he will move his campaign  
headquarters from Washington to Nashville next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are happy to welcome Al Gore back to Tennessee with a Web  
page dedicated to highlighting his record as a liberal, Washington 
insider,'' said Chip Saltsman, the state GOP chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site will be used to solicit money to pay for an  
anti-Gore campaign in Tennessee. It includes audio of Gore parodies 
aired on The Rush Limbaugh Show, and parodies created for the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The address is GoreFreeTennessee.com.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Nations Consider Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Economic ministers from Southeast Asia and  
their counterparts from Australia and New Zealand said Friday they 
will consider establishing a free trade zone for the region by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us by ourselves is too small to carry a significant  
weight in the international balance,'' said George Yeo, Singapore's 
Minister of Trade and Industry. ``But collectively, we will speak 
with the louder voice and exert a stronger influence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trade volume between Southeast Asian countries and Australia and  
New Zealand totaled more than $16 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Southeast Asian Nations already has taken  
steps toward making the region a ``zero-tariff'' trade area. From 
Jan. 1, import taxes within the six founding ASEAN countries will 
be reduced to a maximum of 5 percent for various agricultural and 
manufacturing products. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a special task force will be established to study whether  
Australia and New Zealand could be included in those arrangements 
by 2010, said the ministers, who were meeting in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers said recent political tensions between Australia and  
Indonesia over East Timor would not hinder the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an ASEAN effort, something which all of us in ASEAN  
unanimously consider to be important,'' said Hatanto Reksodipoetro, 
director-general of Indonesia's Ministry of Industry and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia is leading an international peacekeeping force in East  
Timor, which voted for independence from Indonesia in a 
U.N.-sponsored referendum Aug. 30. Indonesian politicians have 
accused Australia of meddling in their affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers also noted that the region shows ``significant  
signs'' of recovery from the economic crisis that erupted in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who will  
lead the World Trade Organization for three years beginning in 
2002, also said Friday that China should be admitted to the group 
during the next round of talks, which start in November in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	China insists that it wants to join the world trade body, but  
many bureaucrats and provincial politicians fear that opening 
domestic markets to global competition will hurt state industries 
and spur unrest at home. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN includes Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,  
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Demonstrators Denounce NYC Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of the opening of a controversial  
exhibit, demonstrators gathered outside the Brooklyn Museum of Art 
on Friday to denounce the mayor, who has called the show ``sick'' 
and threatened to cut the museum's funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of signs held by the demonstrators contained crude  
pictures of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and pointed statements claiming 
he has no respect for the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani is under fire for his strident criticism of the British  
exhibit ``Sensation'' set to open Saturday, and his threats to pull 
$7 million in funding to the museum, or about one-third of its 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit includes a painting of the Virgin Mary with a spot  
of elephant dung on it and a 13-foot high rendering of a notorious 
British child killer, created with the shapes of children's 
handprints. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration attracted several hundred people, including  
actress and activist Susan Sarandon, who saluted the large number 
of people under 30, urging them: ``Don't roll over on this one, 
this is really a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooklyn resident Claire Coleman said of the mayor: ``I think  
he's a fascist. I think he's trying to make the rich upper 
Manhattan people happy. Creativity has many faces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani was unmoved by his opponents.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want any money coming out of my pocket to pay for this  
kind of sick demonstration of clear psychological problems,'' the 
mayor said. ``This should happen in a psychiatric hospital, not in 
a (city-funded) museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have filed suit -- the city in state court in an  
effort to evict the museum from its building, the museum in federal 
court to retain its city funding. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the museum amended its lawsuit to name Giuliani  
personally. It accused him of violating the equal protection due 
the museum under the Fourteenth Amendment.

<HEADLINE> Spending Rising Faster Than Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose in August but  
their spending climbed much faster, leaving the nation's savings 
rate matching a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income -- which includes wages, interest and government  
benefits -- rose 0.5 percent in August, the eighth straight monthly 
increase, the Commerce Department said today. The increase was a 
little faster than the 0.4 percent gain forecast by many analysts 
and followed a 0.2 percent increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	But spending went up 0.9 percent in August, more than many  
analysts had expected. That was the biggest increase since 
February, when spending grew by the same amount. Many analysts were 
forecasting a 0.7 percent increase in August. It rose 0.4 percent 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate, closely watched report today, the National  
Association of Purchasing Management said the nation's 
manufacturing sector grew in September for the eighth consecutive 
month, while prices of raw materials spurted to the highest level 
since May 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger-than-expected manufacturing performance was viewed  
as additional evidence of strong third-quarter economic growth 
after a lackluster second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, the Commerce Department said today that  
construction spending fell an unexpected 0.4 percent in August to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $692 billion, a sign that one of 
the economy's strongest sectors is beginning to slow. In July, 
construction spending declined 0.6 percent. Many analysts were 
forecasting a 0.6 percent rise in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on all private construction projects was down 1.1  
percent with decreases reported for single-family homes, hotels and 
motels and industrial projects, although spending on office 
buildings was up. Spending on big government projects, however, 
rose 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, seeking to slow the economy and keep  
inflation at bay, bumped up interest rates twice this summer, 
making borrowing more expensive. Fed policy-makers meet again on 
Tuesday and many economists doubt another rate increase is in the 
offing, although some say it is a close call. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued uncertainty about interest rates apparently was  
hurting stocks today. The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip 
industrial stocks lost more than 100 points in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Because consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the  
nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- has set a string of record lows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And in August, the savings rates was minus 1.5 percent, matching  
the record low set in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for the negative savings rate, economists say, is  
that the stock market is boosting Americans' net worth and making 
them more comfortable about dipping into savings to pay for their 
spending sprees. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's personal income and spending report also said wages rose  
0.6 percent in August, following a 0.7 percent gain in July. But 
farm proprietors' income fell 8.8 percent in August, reflecting the 
pattern of disaster relief subsidy payments to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, a big increase in those subsidy payments caused farm  
proprietors' income to surge, boosting overall personal income. In 
July, those payments decrease, causing farm proprietors' income to 
fall sharply and slow overall income growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket manufactured items  
expected to last at least three years, such as washing machines and 
cars -- rose 2.6 percent in August, compared with a decline of 0.7 
percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	For nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, spending went up by  
0.8 percent, more than the 0.3 percent gain the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the government reported that the nation's economic  
growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second 
quarter, the smallest gain in four years. However, many private 
economists believe that was only a temporary lull and are expecting 
growth in the existing third quarter to be considerably higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending in the second quarter rose at an annual rate  
of 4.8 percent. That was brisker than previously estimated but 
slower than the torrid 6.7 percent rate of spending in the first 
quarter. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total 
economic activity.

	The Palo Alto, Calif.-based computer maker warned that its

<P>
	The New York-based company, one of the best-known makers of

</P>
<P>
	The York, Pa.-based company expects to report third-quarter

<HEADLINE> FCC Closer to SBC Merger Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are nearing a decision on  
the fate of the proposed merger between Ameritech Corp. and SBC 
Communications, which would create the nation's largest local 
telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission approval is the last step in  
completing the deal -- originally valued at $57 billion. The Justice 
Department and state regulators have already signed off on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials and analysts have predicted that the deal --  
which brings together two regional Bell companies -- would go 
through, but with conditions to preserve competition in local 
markets. The combined business would control 57 million, or 
one-third, of the nation's local phone lines spread across 13 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard voted to approve the deal several  
weeks ago, according to agency sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity. Two other commissioners, Gloria Tristani and Susan Ness, 
also have voted on the matter but aides would not say whether they 
supported or opposed the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one commissioner has not voted, according to the FCC  
sources. Commissioner Michael Powell's office would not reveal 
whether he had voted. Calls to Commissioner Harold 
Furchtgott-Roth's office were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal needs only three votes for approval, but all five  
commissioners must cast a vote for the action to be binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard has placed the merger on the agenda for the commission's  
Oct. 8 meeting to force a final decision on the matter, but it 
could come before then. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states involved in the proposed merger are Arkansas,  
California, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's staff recommended approval of the deal, based on  
conditions that the two companies had submitted to the government. 
Under the deal, SBC-Ameritech would enter 30 new markets within 30 
months to compete with established local phone companies. It also 
would establish a separate subsidiary to provide advanced 
telecommunications services such as high-speed Internet access. At 
least 10 percent of its upgraded services would go to low-income 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also would have to provide deep discounts on key  
pieces of their networks to competitors who want to buy them. 
Failure to meet the conditions could mean stiff penalties. Just for 
failing to meet the new market deadline, the companies could face a 
$40 million fine for each market, up to a maximum of $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech say the merger  
is good for consumers. They contend it will spur local phone 
competition and possibly reduce prices, accelerate the rollout of 
high-speed Internet access and data services and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But long-distance companies trying to get into the local phone  
market -- including MCI, Sprint and AT&AMP;T -- said the concessions were 
accompanied by so many other limitations that they would do nothing 
to aid competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups also have opposed the deal, saying they do not  
believe the merger conditions go far enough to protect the public 
interest.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Mayor Girds for Toughest Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Ohio (AP) -- Mayor John Coyne has run City Hall his way  
for 52 years, longer than any of his colleagues across the nation 
have been in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Day in, day out, he's balanced the books of this Cleveland  
suburb, pushed through groundbreaking laws and led the Cuyahoga 
County Democratic Party. He's been courted by presidents and 
presidential candidates, and pictures of him with everyone from 
Jimmy Carter to Robert Kennedy hang in his memorabilia-stuffed 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	But at 82, the spry, straight-talking mayor may be in his  
toughest political fight yet against an opponent who hadn't been 
born when Coyne was first elected. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the party has endorsed Coyne's opponent,  
Kenneth Patton, in Brooklyn's nonpartisan mayoral election on Nov. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	The move punishes Coyne for backing Republican Gov. Bob Taft's  
successful 1998 campaign -- a ``mortal sin,'' said Jimmy Dimora, 
chairman of the county's Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Coyne backed Taft because of bad blood between the mayor  
and Lee Fisher, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. The mayor 
will say only that he backed Taft because he thought the Republican 
would do more for Ohio's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people think by any stretch of the imagination I'm the only  
Democrat who voted for Taft, they've got a lot to think about,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coyne says he doesn't regret his decision. It's true to form,  
supporters and critics agree: The mayor's always done things 
according his own plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Conference of Mayors believes Coyne, first elected in  
1947, is the nation's longest-serving mayor currently in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say he's kept his job through a mix of tight control  
over the city's money and by offering extensive public services for 
the nearly 12,000 residents in Brooklyn, just outside Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has received a dozen recent state awards for  
bookkeeping. It offers services like $5 snow removal and grass 
cutting for seniors and a host of recreational facilities, 
including indoor and outdoor swimming pools, racquetball courts and 
batting cages. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the same community that in 1966 passed a law requiring  
seat belts for drivers, a move considered a national first. This 
year came another pioneering rule: a ban on cellular telephone use 
while driving unless both hands are on the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	But Coyne's big-boss style has its critics, who say he holds  
grudges and is unable to tolerate dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	As county Democratic chairman from 1982-93, Coyne earned the  
nickname ``the Irish Godfather.'' Former county Commissioner Tim 
Hagan and ex-Congressman Ed Feighan, a Democrat, once blasted him 
in a joint statement. ``To those who think Fidel Castro is the last 
dictator in the Western Hemisphere,'' they said, ``come to Cuyahoga 
County.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patton, 48, was Brooklyn's service director for 17 years until  
quitting last December to become public works director in nearby 
Parma. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men say they want to improve public services. But Patton  
said he's offering as much a change in style as in substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to talk to the people,'' he said. ``I'm just letting  
them know that I would not be the old iron-fisted mayor.''

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Siemens-Fujitsu Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators Friday  
granted antitrust approval to a joint venture between Japan's 
Fujitsu Ltd. and Siemens AG of Germany that will create one of 
Europe's largest personal computer vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval came after the companies agreed to reduce their  
hold on the market for financial workstations like automatic teller 
machines and cash dispensers. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission said Siemens has agreed to sell its  
subsidiary Siemens Nixdorf Retail and Banking Systems GmbH, to 
address ``serious competitive concerns in the financial 
workstations market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced their joint-venture in June. It will  
have estimated sales of over $8.1 billion for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Siemens and Fujitsu will cooperate in PCs,  
server and mainframe computer systems, aiming to achieve a position 
among the world's three leading manufacturers in the computer 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A new company, called Fujitsu Siemens Computers, is expected to  
start operations this month and will be active in Europe, former 
the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and Africa.

<HEADLINE> Highway Safety Head Leaves Govt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Ricardo Martinez, chief of the federal  
government's highway safety agency, said Thursday he was stepping 
down to spend more time with his family and work as a health care 
executive in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration for five years, was at the helm of the regulatory 
agency when it crafted a series of initiatives to respond to the 
public outcry over deaths from automobile air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recently lead a successful effort to phase in a  
universal anchorage system in cars for child seats so they would be 
less complicated to install and used correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a remarkable opportunity, but it has meant my family  
life was on hold,'' Martinez said in an interview. ``Now I'm going 
to change my focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez has a wife and two children, ages 2 and 4. He has  
accepted a job as vice president of health affairs for Web MD, 
Inc., an Atlanta-based company that provides health news and 
services to physicians and consumers over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said he will leave the agency in mid-October.  
</P>
<P>
	Some groups expressed concern that Martinez is leaving before  
the completion of a controversial rulemaking on regulating future 
generations of automobile air bags. The agency has blamed air bags 
for 143 deaths -- mostly to children, while also crediting them with 
saving 4,400 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how the decision-making is going to be made or  
who would be most involved in the process,'' said Gloria Bergquist 
of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an association 
representing 11 automakers including General Motors Corp., Ford 
Motor Co., and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martinez said the proposed rule, which is to be announced in  
October, has mostly been crafted and that experienced staffers 
would keep it on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was an emergency-room physician and Stanford University  
professor when he joined the agency in September 1994. He has had a 
longtime interest in auto safety, once taking a sabbatical to study 
vehicle performance during crashes and injury patterns involving 
occupants.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows Rugby World Cup Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The United States, a decided underdog at  
the Rugby World Cup, isn't satisfied with just being there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a big heart and we'll get in there and try to play  
like dogs,'' American George Sucher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which has only four professional players and  
comes into the tournament following a 106-8 defeat by England last 
month, opens against Ireland Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sucher, one of the American amateurs, had to ``scrounge'' for  
money to play at the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being able to represent your country is a huge honor,'' he  
said. ``Whenever you put the red, white and blue on, or sing the 
Star Spangled Banner, it gets the blood pumping and makes you want 
to go out and fight hard for your country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rugby World Cup began Friday when Prince Charles welcomed  
the ``World in Union'' to Wales at the opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Expected to reach television audiences of 3 billion in 150  
countries and attract 2 million spectators at 20 sites in five 
countries, the tournament will have 41 games over the next five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. coach Jack Clark tried to play down talk that his team  
might be initimidated by the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect Ireland's going to come out and play hard,''  
Clark said. ``We wouldn't want it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's important not to confuse the fact that we acknowledge  
we're underdogs and that they're a more skilled team with the 
thought that we're at all frightened -- that's not what's at stake 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Told To Repay $1.4B Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Creditors on Friday rejected Ecuador's pleas for  
more time to renegotiate $6 billion in U.S.-guaranteed ``Brady 
bonds'' and demanded immediate repayment of $1.4 billion of its 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador defaulted on the bonds Thursday, missing a $44.5 million  
interest payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Brady bonds'', named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary  
Nicholas Brady, were issued in 1994 to restructure bad loans 
resulting from the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. They 
are partly backed by U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Though other nations have restructured their payments, Ecuador  
became the first to default. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by investors Friday gave impatient bondholders a  
``clear mandate'' to accelerate the repayment schedule, according 
to Andy Tuck, spokesman for Chase Manhattan Corp., which is the 
agent for creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bondholders know the cash-strapped South American country  
doesn't have the money to repay the first phase of $1.4 billion 
discount bonds. But they didn't want to go along with Ecuador's 
plan for renegotiating its payments out of fear of setting a 
precedent for other countries that owe billions in Brady bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador knew the demand for repayment might be coming, Carlos  
Larreategui, an Ecuadorean government spokesman, told reporters in 
Quito. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation was considered,'' he said Friday, adding that  
Ecuador ``doesn't have the capacity to pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The repayment demand Friday is likely to lead to defaults on the  
other Brady bonds, meaning Ecuador could soon end up owing the full 
$6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem of restructuring is complicated because no  
individual or institutional investor holds a majority of Ecuador's 
Brady bonds, and there appeared to be no coordinated group for 
Ecuadorean officials to negotiate with. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's president, Jamil Mahuad, said Thursday his government  
had signed a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund 
for a $400 million loan that could lead to $1.3 billion in overall 
international aid. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials urged Ecuador to develop a new economic strategy  
and reach a comprehensive accord with creditors before receiving 
the IMF loan. The deal hinges on Ecuador passing austerity measures 
and tax increases that most lawmakers there oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's total public debt is $13 billion and is expected to  
top 117 percent of the country's gross domestic product by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ecuadorean financial experts said the nation could  
expect creditors to back up their demand for repayment with legal 
reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consequences are grave because it could mean the seizure  
of accounts, cutting off of oil purchases and the blockage of 
imports,'' financial analyst Jorge Rodriguez said.

<HEADLINE> Medicare To Pay for Low-Fat Diet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare will pay for up to 1,800 elderly  
Americans with severe heart disease to try Dr. Dean Ornish's famous 
but radical ultra low-fat diet, to see if it could be an 
alternative to heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pilot project, announced Friday, Medicare patients who  
have been told they will soon need bypass surgery or an angioplasty 
to clear clogged heart arteries can instead try the intensive 
diet-and-lifestyle program. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare will study the patients to see if the Ornish program is  
medically effective and if it can save some of the more than $6 
billion a year now spent on heart surgery by the nation's health 
care program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart disease is the nation's No. 1 killer.  
</P>
<P>
	The diet doctor's regimen is very strict: Patients become  
vegetarians and limit dietary fat to no more than 10 percent of 
total calories, eating mostly fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 
They exercise regularly, learn stress-management techniques such as 
yoga and attend support meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ornish contends the program can help heal heart disease without  
surgery. In a study published in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association last winter, Ornish reported that 28 patients 
who followed his program for five years suffered half the rate of 
heart problems as patients who ate a moderately low-fat diet and 
used cholesterol-lowering drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everyone is interested in changing lifestyle, and some  
people with extremely severe disease need surgery,'' acknowledged 
Ornish, who runs the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in 
Sausalito, Calif. But Medicare access ``empowers the individual 
(and) may immediately and substantially reduce health care costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare was urged to try the program by, among others, Ornish  
patient Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But many heart experts are skeptical, because Ornish's studies  
involved small numbers of patients and some other scientists have 
been unable to duplicate his findings, said American Heart 
Association nutrition specialist Terry Bazzarre. 
</P>
<P>
	Some research even suggests that cutting too much fat out of the  
diet may be detrimental. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Medicare project could provide much-needed information,  
particularly if 1,800 people stick with the Ornish diet for four 
years, Bazzarre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will certainly shed more light on the application of Dr.  
Ornish's studies,'' he said. ``We applaud Medicare for trying to 
explore further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has long been a heated debate over which diet is best. The  
average American consumes 34 percent of total daily calories from 
fat. Most health experts advise getting no more than 30 percent 
fat. The type of fat eaten is important, too: The AHA urges heart 
patients to get no more than 7 percent of calories from saturated 
fat a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ornish's more strict diet took some getting used to, but  
provides cooking lessons and support groups that help, said 
70-year-old Frank Cummings of surburban Pittsburgh. He has been on 
the Ornish program since January 1998, when the Highmark Blue 
Cross-Blue Shield insurer began offering it to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	He had only mild heart disease, but weighed 205 pounds. He is  
now down to 160 and treadmill tests indicate improved health. ``I'm 
very happy. I feel so much healthier, and people tell me I look 
healthier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year Medicare project aims at more severe patients, who  
will have the choice of the Ornish program or conventional 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ornish program will cost $7,200 per patient, compared with  
$16,000 to $29,000 Medicare typically pays for heart surgery. But 
Medicare must see if the Ornish patients do as well medically to 
know if the program saves money. Later this fall, Medicare will 
announce studies of whether other lifestyle-modification programs 
also could help heart disease.

<HEADLINE> Bernadette O'Farrell Dies at 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bernadette O'Farrell, the Irish-born actress who  
played Maid Marian in the long-running 1950s television series, 
``The Adventures of Robin Hood,'' has died at 75, the Daily 
Telegraph reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear which day this week she died. The  
newspaper report was published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Farrell was often seen in film parts written by her  
husband Frank Launder, who with Sidney Gilliat created the St. 
Trinian's films about lively pranks in a girls' school. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was as Maid Marian that she made her name. ``The  
Adventures of Robin Hood,'' which ran from 1955 to 1959, was very 
popular with younger viewers, not least because of its catchy theme 
tune, sung by Dick James, which became a hit in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	The series, a traditional version of the Robin Hood legend, was  
one of the first British productions to succeed in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	But, after 78 episodes, Ms. O'Farrell became worried that she  
was being typecast and in 1957, she quit the series, despite 
thousands of letters from fans begging her not to leave Robin. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the turning point came when shopkeepers in the Chelsea  
district of London, where she lived, began to greet her with, 
``Good morning, Maid Marian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born at Birr in County Offaly, she attended convent school.  
While working as a lawyer's secretary, she met Launder, 17 years 
her senior, who gave her a small part in ``Captain Boycott,'' the 
1947 film that starred Stewart Granger. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, she appeared as the glamorous sports teacher in  
Launder and Gilliat's ``The Happiest Days of Your Life,'' with 
Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford, and in 1950, she and Launder 
were married. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, she combined repertory stage work with film parts,  
including ``Lady in the Fog'' (1952) with Cesar Romero and ``The 
Square Ring'' (1953) with Robert Beatty. After leaving ``Robin 
Hood,'' she appeared in Launder and Gilliat's ``The Bridal Path'' 
(1959). 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband died in 1997. She is survived by their two  
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral details were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Professor Hopes To Clone Mammoth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- It sounds like a movie plot come to  
life: A Northern Arizona University geologist aims to excavate and 
clone a woolly mammoth from DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Agenbroad concedes that cloning the animal is unlikely.  
Still, he says biologists remain optimistic and he is excited about 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Agenbroad is part of an international team of scientists whose  
first task is to cut the cloning candidate -- the likes of which 
roamed the earth about 23,000 years ago -- from a Siberian ice 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult male mammoth, estimated to be about 40 years old when  
it became frozen, was found by a 9-year-old nomadic reindeer herder 
in 1997. It's been named Jarkov, after the boy's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``To feel the skin and touch the flesh of the mammoth will be  
quite spectacular. It's the closest I've gotten to an animal I've 
been chasing for more than 30 years,'' said Agenbroad, sitting in 
an office crammed full of mammoth bones, teeth, figurines and 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	Agenbroad and scientists from the Netherlands, France and  
Russia, are removing the ice-encased animal from the Taimyr 
Peninsula in Siberia and airlifting it more than 200 miles to the 
city of Khatanga. 
</P>
<P>
	The mammoth will be kept frozen there in an underground tunnel,  
where scientists will study the 11-foot-tall animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides analyzing dirt, pollen, and even its stomach contents, a  
primary task is to extract DNA for cloning. 
</P>
<P>
	The cloning process involves putting DNA from the mammoth into  
an Asian elephant's egg that has been stripped of elephant genes. 
So even though an elephant would give birth, the baby would be a 
mammoth, not a hybrid, Agenbroad said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think (the elephant) would know the difference, though  
she might wonder why her baby is so hairy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agenbroad said he is not counting on success.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it would be a rarity, but the biologists are quite  
optimistic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A medical ethicist at the medical school and the department of  
philosophy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham is among the 
naysayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need live nuclei and live eggs, plus a host mammoth mother  
to gestate the fetus. Because none of these are available, 
'Jurassic Park' to the contrary, it won't succeed,'' Greg Pence 
said, referring to the movie in which cloning was used to resurrect 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists at Texas A&AMP;M University proved last month that  
live cells are not needed for cloning. The team successfully cloned 
a steer from the hide of another that died a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the odds are slim for mammoth cloning, said Hessel Bouma  
III, a cell biology expert at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would start with DNA not from a fresh cell, but from one  
haphazardly frozen by nature,'' Bouma said. ``The chances of DNA 
being completely intact is very, very small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But why bring back the mammoth in the first place?  
</P>
<P>
	``Why not?'' asked Agenbroad.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have a cloned mammoth than another sheep,'' he  
added, referring to Dolly, cloned in 1997 from the udder of a 
6-year-old ewe. 
</P>
<P>
	Agenbroad isn't the only one excited about the cloning  
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a really wonderful thing,'' said Paul  
Martin, a retired professor of geosciences and a large mammals 
expert from the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a moon shot.''

<HEADLINE> Jimmy Carter Celebrates Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) -- Performers including Pat Boone, country  
music star Lynn Anderson and the McGuire Sisters were invited to 
the party, along with veteran members of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	Today is Jimmy Carter's 75th birthday.  
</P>
<P>
	The former president and his wife, Rosalynn, were to be honored  
tonight during two hours of entertainment at the Rylander Theater 
in Americus, 12 miles east of the Carters' hometown of Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC television analyst Sam Donaldson and White House  
correspondent Helen Thomas of United Press International were 
scheduled to speak. Both covered Carter's campaign and presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pre-birthday interview, Carter said he may cut back on some  
of his activities, but not anytime soon. He plans trips to England, 
Switzerland and Norway this month to raise money for the Carter 
Center, which works to improve health and sends observers to 
monitor elections worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the nice things about having been president is Rosalynn  
and I can choose what items on a very long menu we want to 
undertake,'' Carter said. ``If we don't want to do something, we 
just say no.''

<HEADLINE> Brind'Amour's Streak Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Rod Brind'Amour  
was placed on injured reserve Friday, ending the longest 
consecutive-game streak in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour will miss Saturday's opener against Ottawa but is  
eligible to play in the Flyers' second game, against Carolina, on 
Thursday. He said he hopes to be ready by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour, who has played in 484 straight regular-season  
games, suffered a hairline fracture in his left foot on Sept. 25 
during the first period of the Flyers' 4-2 exhibition loss at New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling better every day,'' he said. ``With the treatment,  
it's started to feel a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour hasn't missed a game since Feb. 22, 1993, when a  
hand injury kept him out of a game against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 defenseman Eric Desjardins, who lost nine teeth when hit  
by an errant puck in Tuesday night's exhibition game at Detroit, 
said he hopes to be ready for Saturday's game.

<HEADLINE> FCC Closer to SBC Merger Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are inching closer to a  
final decision on a merger that would bring together two regional 
Bell companies to form the largest local phone company in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials and analysts predicted the merger between  
Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications would go through, but with 
conditions to preserve competition in local markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission approval is the last step in  
completing the deal -- originally valued at $57 billion. The Justice 
Department and state regulators have already approved it. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined business would control 57 million, or one-third, of  
the nation's local phone lines spread across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard voted to approve the deal several  
weeks ago, according to agency sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity. Two other commissioners, Gloria Tristani and Susan Ness, 
have voted on the matter. But their offices would not reveal how 
they voted. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one commissioner has not yet voted on the deal, according  
to the FCC sources. Commissioner Michael Powell's office would not 
reveal whether he had voted. Calls to Commissioner Harold 
Furchtgott-Roth's office were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal needs only three votes for approval, but all five  
commissioners must cast a vote for the action to be binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard has placed the merger on the agenda for the commission's  
Oct. 8 meeting to force a vote by the remaining commissioner. But a 
final decision could come before then. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have expressed confidence that the merger would  
receive approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's staff this summer recommended approval of the deal,  
based on conditions that the two companies had submitted to the 
government. Under the deal, SBC-Ameritech would enter 30 new 
markets within 30 months to compete with established local phone 
companies. It also would establish a separate subsidiary to provide 
advanced telecommunications services such as high-speed Internet 
access. At least 10 percent of its upgraded services would go 
toward low-income regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also would have to provide deep discounts on key  
pieces of their networks to competitors who want to buy them. 
Failure to meet the conditions could mean stiff penalties. Just for 
failing to meet the new market deadline, the companies could face a 
$40 million fine for each market, up to a $1.2 billion cap. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech claim the  
merger is good for consumers, claiming it will spur local phone 
competition and possibly lower prices, accelerate the roll-out of 
high-speed Internet access and data services, and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But long-distance companies trying to get into the local phone  
market -- including MCI, Sprint and AT&AMP;T -- said the concessions were 
accompanied by so many other limitations that they would do nothing 
to aid competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups also have opposed the deal, saying they do not  
believe the merger conditions go far enough to protect the public 
interest.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Admits Possible Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The future of new men's basketball coach Quin Synder's first two  
prospective recruits is in question after Missouri reported 
possible NCAA recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri athletic director Mike Alden notified the NCAA on  
Friday that the university may have violated recruiting rules by 
allowing the mothers of Detroit basketball prospects Rickey 
Paulding and Arthur Johnson to join their sons on a chartered plane 
to Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA told Missouri late Friday afternoon that a ruling on  
the violation will arrive on Monday. The NCAA was working on 
several other eligibility cases from other schools Friday, and 
could not immediately investigate Missouri's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	A Missouri sports information spokesman said Friday the  
university will release a statement when the infraction ruling 
arrives on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski wouldn't speculate on when a  
ruling might be made or any possible implications it might hold for 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said the university interpreted NCAA rules to mean a  
prospect could be accompanied on a noncommercial flight if the 
extra party paid fair market value for the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The women paid the university between $200 and $300 each for  
their tickets prior to flying from Detroit to Columbia Regional 
Airport on Sept. 17 and returning Sept. 19, Alden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel confident in the process. I feel confident in our  
basketball program. And, I feel confident in the NCAA,'' Alden 
said. ``Do I feel confident in a great result? I have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jankowski would not comment specifically on Missouri's  
situation, she said NCAA rules are clear regarding transportation 
of prospective recruits and their relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	A school can use commercial flights or noncommercial flights --  
the school's own plane, charter or private planes -- to bring 
prospects to campus for official visits, Jankowski said. But 
relatives, friends and legal guardians can accompany prospects only 
on commercial flights. On those flights, the prospect's fare is 
paid by the school. Anyone accompanying the prospect must pay his 
or her own way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA does not support that a parent can be on a  
noncommercial flight,'' Jankowski said. It does not matter whether 
the parents pay for the flight, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding and Johnson, both seniors, orally committed to Missouri  
last week. But now they could be declared ineligible, at least 
temporarily, before the Nov. 7 signing day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once an institution determines there's been a violation  
involving an athlete or prospective athlete, it's their 
responsibility to make an eligibility ruling,'' Jankowski said. The 
university would then seek to have the athlete reinstated by the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this would affect a student's ability to play at another  
school, Jankowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alden said Missouri had yet to decide what to do with  
Paulding and Johnson's eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if an infraction has indeed taken place,'' Alden  
said. ``The NCAA is the only one that can determine if an 
infraction has taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said the call to the NCAA followed one Wednesday to the  
Big 12 Conference, which advised Missouri that it would be 
``beneficial'' to notify the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who was heavily involved with recruiting as an assistant  
coach at Duke before being hired by Missouri in April, told the St. 
Louis Post-Dispatch on Friday that he bears responsibility if an 
infraction had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unequivocally I do,'' he said. ``I'm the head basketball  
coach. That's what it means to be the head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding, a 6-foot-4 guard, averaged 25.6 points, 11.2 rebounds,  
4.0 assists and 3.0 blocked shots last season at Detroit 
Renaissance High. He said having his mother on the visit made it 
easier to choose a college. Paulding also visited Ohio State, Miami 
and Michigan State, but his mother made only the trip to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding and his mother, Virginia Robinson, told the St. Louis  
Post-Dispatch that the two mothers and their sons were the only 
passengers on the chartered plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nice plane,'' Paulding said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a 6-9 forward, averaged 16.4 points last season at  
Detroit Pershing High. He only visited Miami before choosing 
Missouri. Both players made an unofficial visit together to 
Missouri in August. But the September trip to Columbia over Parents 
Weekend solidified their choices.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Court Says HMOs May Be Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled  
that patients may sue health maintenance organizations over alleged 
malpractice, affirming a right consumer advocates failed to win 
from lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the successful plaintiff called Thursday's decision  
a landmark that holds HMOs responsible for the actions of doctors 
they promote and for cost-containment measures that hurt patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone with a straight face can deny that not  
all, but some HMOs are interfering with the care patients are 
receiving from their doctors to the patients' detriment,'' said 
attorney Lynn Dowd of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Inga Petrovich of Chicago sued Share Health Plan of Illinois  
Inc. as well as two physicians who attended her, claiming the 
doctors failed to diagnose cancer in her mouth quickly enough after 
she complained of pain in fall 1990. Ms. Petrovich, 73, died of 
complications from the cancer last October. 
</P>
<P>
	A circuit court ruled Ms. Petrovich could not sue Chicago-based  
Share because the doctors were independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Thursday's decision, Justice Michael Bilandic wrote that  
Share is liable for the doctors' action because Ms. Petrovich had 
reason to believe they were Share employees based on what Share 
said in its advertising. And, he added, Share had control over the 
doctors because HMOs often make decisions about what treatment is 
medically necessary and encourage doctors to keep costs low by 
making them responsible for referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where an HMO effectively controls a physician's exercise of  
medical judgment and that judgment is exercised negligently, the 
HMO cannot be allowed to claim that the physician is solely 
responsible for the harm that results,'' Bilandic wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	No justices wrote dissents in the case.  
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Illinois lawmakers approved legislation that gives  
HMO customers more rights in challenging coverage decisions and 
getting emergency treatment. But it passed only after sponsors 
dropped a provision letting customers file malpractice suits 
against HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Vincent, a lawyer for Share, declined to comment until  
the company has time to study the opinion. The case now goes back 
to Cook County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other states are broadening HMO patients' rights. Just  
this week, California Gov. Gray Davis signed a health reform 
package into law that lets patients to sue HMOs -- a right enjoyed 
by patients in Texas and a handful of other states. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Congress is weighing a measure that would  
create uniform nationwide regulations on managed health care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court this week agreed to take up  
an Illinois case that could decide whether patients have an 
unlimited right to sue HMOs. Current federal law limits lawsuits 
against health plans.

	Japan Lifts Nuclear Plant Advisory  
</P>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of people were  
told they could safely leave their houses today, one day after 
Japan's worst nuclear accident sent radiation levels soaring, put 
three workers in the hospital and exposed nearly 50 more to 
radiation. Officials said the accident at the uranium processing 
plant has been contained. A spokesman said radiation levels in the 
area are back to normal and the government was lifting an advisory 
that ordered more than 310,000 residents to stay indoors. A 
380-yard radius around the plant is still off-limits.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
warned Pat Buchanan today that Christian conservatives will desert 
him if he ditches the GOP for a third-party presidential run with 
Ross Perot's Reform Party. Robertson claimed Reform supporters are 
``180 degrees out in terms of social issues. They don't share any 
of the views that Pat Buchanan claimed to espouse so 
vociferously.'' He also accused congressional Republicans of 
betraying -- by inaction and timidity -- the Christian conservatives 
who helped the GOP take control of Congress.

	F-22 Deal Would Restore House Cuts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators today ended a  
long deadlock over the high-tech F-22, giving the Air Force only 
half the $1.8 billion it had requested for next year to get the 
world's most expensive jet fighter off the ground. Still, the 
compromise spared the $65 billion program from being scrapped, as 
the House had voted last July. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told 
reporters that basic agreement on the F-22 had been achieved, and 
that a House-Senate conference panel would meet Monday to act on it 
and on the larger $270 billion Pentagon spending bill to which it 
is attached.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The opposition raised the ante in  
its escalating showdown with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, 
preparing another march on his home despite two nights of police 
attacks that left dozens of protesters hurt. In a new twist to the 
past 10 days of protest marches, opposition leaders called on 
supporters to drive to the president's home later tonight, in a 
continued attempt to pressure Milosevic to step down. An hour 
before the scheduled protest drive, police closed to traffic one of 
the routes toward Milosevic's residence.

the start of the Korean War, but the protesters also demanded that 
Washington punish some of the U.S. veterans involved and compensate 
the victims' relatives. ``It is a sad tragedy that the revelation 
about the massacre should come to light so late,'' said Yu 
Jin-jeong, who led a group of about 50 demonstrators.

remained murky. Russian political leaders said yesterday that 
government troops had taken strategic heights several miles inside

Israel exhibit at Epcot, which is part of Walt Disney World's

<HEADLINE> F-22 Deal Would Restore House Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators have agreed to  
restore much of the $1.8 billion the House cut from the Air Force's 
F-22 ``stealth'' fighter program, while delaying production of 
combat-ready models for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference committee may announce as early as  
today that it has restored $1.3 billion for the F-22 program in the 
final defense spending bill for fiscal 2000, according to those 
close to the negotations. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise includes $1 billion to buy test models of the  
ultra-sophisticated warplane and $300 million in ``termination 
liability'' for Lockheed Martin, manufacturer of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The $300 million would be released for procurement in fiscal  
2001 if the program is not canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	But production of final versions of the radar-evading aircraft,  
which are being built at the Lockheed Martin plant in Marietta, 
Ga., would have to wait at least until 2001, under the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters on Thursday  
that a deal on the F-22 was close and ``I would hope we would 
finish that bill quite quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force had wanted to begin buying production planes  
during the coming year. It has already spent $25 billion to develop 
the F-22 and plans to spend an additional $40 billion to build 339 
of them. They would replace the F-15 jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-22s, which the Air Force envisions as the core of its  
fleet for the early 21st century, would cost nearly $200 million 
apiece, making it the most expensive jet fighter ever built. 
</P>
<P>
	But House critics, led by defense appropriations subcommittee  
chairman Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., argued that the money was needed 
for other military projects and that the F-22 was not ready for 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was struck during closed-door meetings of Republican  
congressional leaders Wednesday night and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It should end a stalemate that blocked progress on a nearly $270  
billion bill to run the military through fiscal 2000, which begins 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise would probably be enough to purchase three or  
four of the test aircraft, instead of the six that the full $1.8 
billion would have bought. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force could buy up to six of the test models under the  
deal, but probably would have to request additional money next year 
to buy that many. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate earlier approved the full $1.85 billion while the  
House voted to scrap the program, arguing that the plane's 
computers were not fully tested and that the money was needed for 
other defense programs.

<HEADLINE> After-Hours Trading Confuses Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Confusion is mounting across a wide range of  
industries as to how U.S. stock markets will determine a closing 
price for stocks as trading days get longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes wrought by the nation's evolving stock markets are  
rippling far beyond Wall Street as a result of the recent surge in 
after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits are just one example of how broader society is affected  
when it no longer is clear what stock price should be counted as 
the final one of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider a divorce case in which the assets of a couple are to  
be divided. One lawyer may argue that the value of a couple's stock 
portfolio should be determined by the traditional 4 p.m. Eastern 
time closing price of the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. The other lawyer may argue that the value should be 
settled at midnight to provide for trading activity during the 
after-hours sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Estate settlements are expected to get bogged down by similar  
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do on occasion have the need to determine the value of a  
stock, and an issue can arise where we'll need to establish a 
cutoff time for that value. But now the market may never close, and 
that becomes a problem,'' said Jeff Advokat, a general practice 
attorney in Morristown, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	And as after-hours trading becomes more popular, and more and  
more stocks are traded during the sessions, the likelihood 
increases that the value of a client's assets will change after 4 
p.m., Advokat said. ``The more stocks we're talking about, the more 
it's going to affect us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the exchanges or the law profession itself sets definitive  
guidelines, judges will be forced to rule on a case by case basis, 
Advokat added. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, in response to calls for more information  
during after-hours sessions, the organization that distributes 
stock prices for the NYSE said it will extend its hours to 6:35 
p.m. Eastern time from 5:15 p.m. The Nasdaq agreed to do the same 
thing last month. That means the time at which closing stock prices 
are determined is effectively being pushed back one hour and twenty 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many areas of the securities industry will be affected. They  
include: investment bankers who complete transactions -- such as 
mergers and acquisitions or stock splits -- based on a company's 
stock price; options traders and investors, who must decide whether 
to exercise stock options contracts based on a closing price; and 
stock quote vendors who sell price information to a wide range of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this stuff is up in the air. Nobody knows how its going to  
play out,'' said Charles Jones, a finance professor at Columbia 
University's business school in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those impacted say they are waiting for direction from  
the two primary exchanges -- the NYSE and the Nasdaq, both of which 
plan on extending their trading hours next year. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE and Nasdaq spokesmen said Friday that both exchanges still  
consider 4 p.m. to be the official close of the trading day. That 
could change, however, once the Big Board and the Nasdaq open their 
own after-hours sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutual fund industry, which prices its funds based on the 4  
p.m. closing prices on the NYSE and Nasdaq, is also keeping the 
status quo in place -- at least until the after-hours sessions prove 
active enough to warrant changes. The nation's two largest fund 
families -- Fidelity and Vanguard -- have both said they will 
continue to price their funds based on the traditional closing 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	But more complex issues remain unresolved.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Keefe, director of marketing for quote vendor DTN  
Financial Services in Omaha, Neb., said her company provides its 
customers, mostly individual investors, with timely, in-depth stock 
information, including the price of a share's last recorded sale of 
the day, which is frequently used to determine the direction a 
stock might head the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	DTN Financial, she said, received a memo from the Nasdaq which  
recommended taking a ``snapshot'' of last sale prices anytime after 
5:15 p.m. ``But that's not an official price by anyone's standards, 
and you're going to see discrepancies among the vendors,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hundreds of newspapers that publish previous day stock  
prices in their morning papers are expected to adapt to the changes 
on an individual basis.

<HEADLINE> $180M Pepsi Center Opens in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tim Romani stood with a smile on his face, a glass  
of champagne in his left hand and a half-empty bottle of bubbly in 
his right. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of working 11 hours a day, Romani's mission was  
completed Friday as the Pepsi Center opened on his 37th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of planned it that way,'' said Romani, general manager  
in charge of construction for the $180 million Pepsi Center. ``We 
didn't know if it would work out, but it did. ... It's quite a day, 
a special day. We're going to see how well this building holds up, 
and how well we all did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pepsi Center, privately financed without taxpayer money,  
will be home to the NHL's Colorado Avalanche and NBA's Denver 
Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Celine Dion was the first performer at the new arena,  
holding a concert Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Dion took the stage, the Pepsi Center opened with a  
ribbon-cutting ceremony complete with bugles, a balloon drop and an 
appearance by former Ascent Entertainment Group chief executive 
Charlie Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was heavily criticized for brokering an unsuccessful deal  
to sell the Nuggets, Avalanche and Pepsi Center. The teams and 
arena later were sold to billionaire Donald Sturm, and Lyons 
resigned and received a $3.6 million severance in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to tell you, it's a marvelous day of celebration for  
the hard work of a lot of very talented people that I was lucky 
enough to be surrounded by,'' Lyons said. ``I may not be part of 
it, but it's always going to be part of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ceremony was not without its glitches. Two champagne  
glasses shattered on the marble floor of the foyer, and Sturm was 
briefly blanketed when the large, ceremonial red ribbon fell to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, however, could dampen the mood.  
</P>
<P>
	``We like doing things first rate and first class,'' Mayor  
Wellington Webb said. ``I think this builds upon Denver as being 
the best sports place in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pepsi Center is Denver's second new sports venue since 1995,  
when the Colorado Rockies moved into Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos are scheduled to move into a new stadium in  
2001. Romani will be in charge of that job as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denver already has the finest baseball park in the world,''  
Romani said. ``Tonight it opens this world-class sports and 
entertainment arena, and in two years -- if I have anything to say 
about it -- Denver will also will have the finest football stadium 
that the world has to offer.''

<HEADLINE> Jays Offer Deals to Delgado, Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green, both eligible for  
free agency after the 2000 season, were offered long-term contracts 
by the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was hitting .317 with 41 homers and 121 RBIs entering  
Friday night's game against Cleveland and could win a Gold Glove 
for his outfield play. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado, Toronto's first baseman, hit .272 with 44 homers and  
134 RBIs before his season was cut short last week because of a 
broken bone in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1998 season, Delgado turned down a four-year contract  
worth about $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Green's agent, Jeff Moorad, said a major factor in Green's  
decision will be whether Delgado re-signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ownership has stepped up. They understand the dynamics of a  
major league club. We have a payroll for next year and a plan,'' 
said general manager Gord Ash, who didn't receive a set budget last 
year until December. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said next season's payroll will be in the $47 million to $49  
million range, an increase of about $5 million.

<HEADLINE> Flo-Jo's Mom Sues Son-in-Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The mother of late Olympic gold medal  
sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner is suing her son-in-law, Al 
Joyner, for the death of her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrongful death lawsuit filed Sept. 21 in Orange County  
Superior Court by Florence Griffith claims Joyner failed to 
``exercise reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of harm'' to 
his wife and that ``harmful or offensive touching'' caused her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Griffith's lawyer didn't immediately return a phone call  
Friday from The Associated Press seeking further explanation about 
the allegations made in the four-page lawsuit. She is seeking 
monetary and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith Joyner, 38, better known as Flo-Jo, died in her Mission  
Viejo, Calif., home in September 1998. A county coroner's report 
concluded she suffered an epileptic seizure in her sleep and 
suffocated. The autopsy found no indications of foul play or 
suspicious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no telephone listing for Al Joyner in Mission Viejo.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Griffith, 69, told the Los Angeles Times in Friday's  
editions the lawsuit stems in part from a dispute with Joyner over 
control of the famed runner's legacy. She told the Times a 
foundation that Joyner started is undermining the efforts of the 
Florence Griffith Joyner Youth Foundation, which she supports. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith also said Joyner tried recently to evict her from the  
Rancho Santa Margarita home in which she lives. Joyner owns the 
home, but her daughter had allowed her to live there, she told the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for a Mrs. Griffith in Rancho Santa Margarita was  
not immediately returned Friday. There is no listing for the youth 
foundation in Rancho Santa Margarita, Mission Viejo or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In his wife's memory, Joyner established the Flo-Jo Memorial  
Community Empowerment Foundation. There is no listing for the 
empowerment foundation in Mission Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita or 
Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> National Enquirer Redesigns Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elvis has left the magazine.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Enquirer, the supermarket tabloid best known for  
celebrity gossip and breathless news of Elvis sightings and UFOs, 
has redesigned itself in hopes of boosting its respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, whose weekly circulation has dipped to 2.2 million  
this year from 2.8 million in 1995, has been trying for several 
years to improve the credibility of its stories, editor Steve Coz 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think of the Enquirer as pictures of Elvis  
being alive and aliens, but we're trying to attack that,'' said 
Coz, who became editor of the magazine in 1996. ``We are bold and 
saucy, but the design gives us a bright, credible look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new design, which can be seen in the issue currently on  
newsstands, uses bolder typefaces and more modern-looking 
headlines, which the editors hope will create a more newsy feel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer's new look was created by Roger Black, a respected  
consultant who has given face lifts to several major magazines, 
including TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment firm Evercore Partners bought the Enquirer's  
parent company, American Media Inc., for $300 million last spring. 
Evercore also hired a veteran magazine executive, David Pecker, 
away from Hachette Filipacchi Magazines to head up American Media. 
Hachette publishes Elle, Mirabella and about two dozen other 
titles.

<HEADLINE> Five Family Members Killed in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAYNESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Five family members who had just come  
home from a fair were shot to death by two men who stole their 
pickup truck and car, police said. One suspect was arrested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shotgun shells littered the winding driveway leading to the home  
where the victims were slain Thursday night. Four were found dead 
inside, while the fifth was outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the killers apparently took off separately,  
wrecked both vehicles and abandoned them. The pickup was found off 
an embankment below the house; the car was on Interstate 40 a few 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	One suspect was arrested after someone who recognized him from a  
description heard on news reports held him at gunpoint until a 
sheriff's deputy arrived, said David Barnes, an agent with the 
State Bureau of Investigation. No immediate charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The other gunman was believed to be on foot. Barnes said blood  
was found in both cars, meaning the gunman was probably injured, 
though Barnes said it wasn't clear how. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings took place in a rural area about 20 miles west of  
Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, Rita Messer, identified the victims as Cora and Earl  
Phillips, a couple in their 70s; their son Eddie, 40; their 
daughter-in-law, Mitzi, 42; and their granddaughter Katie, a middle 
school student. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Phillipses were retired. Eddie Phillips was a dump  
truck driver, and his wife worked at a textile plant and ran a 
beauty shop out h+er home, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good people, they were churchgoing people, they never  
harmed nobody,'' Ms. Messer said. ``It's awful. You ain't safe in 
your own home, you're not safe in church. I don't know what this 
world is coming to.''

<HEADLINE> Muslims Protest Disney Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Walt Disney World opened its  
Israel exhibit at Epcot Center on Friday with both Jews and Muslims 
unhappy over its depiction of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith complained that the  
exhibit doesn't celebrate Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
Muslim groups said it wrongly depicts Jerusalem as a unified city. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Muslims protested outside the park, carrying banners  
reading ``Israeli Exhibit of Falsehood'' and ``Disney and Israel -- 
Partnership for Propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the park, a delegation of Arab Americans toured the  
exhibit with Disney officials. The group later said it would demand 
a Palestinian exhibit be added to the park's 24-country Millennium 
Village, a new temporary display. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney spokesman Bill Warren said officials needed time to  
evaluate the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Arab countries -- Morocco and Saudi Arabia -- are among the  
countries represented in the Millennium Village. The exhibits were 
partially paid for by the countries themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney did everything it could to avoid politics when it  
designed its exhibits, said Linda Warren, Walt Disney World's 
senior vice president of marketing and brand management. ``What 
we're trying to do here is showcase cultures,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Israel, politics and culture can be hard to separate.  
</P>
<P>
	Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast  
War, annexed it and claimed the entire city as its capital. The 
Palestinians want the eastern part of the city to be the capital of 
their future state. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of the capital is so thorny that most countries,  
including the United States, have their embassies in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our problem is not with Disney itself, but Disney has chosen  
to be on the wrong side in this instance,'' said Khalid Turaani, 
executive director of the Washington-based group American Muslims 
for Jerusalem. It is boycotting Disney over the Israel exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab foreign ministers had considered a Disney boycott but  
decided against it last week. Walt Disney World President Al Weiss 
met with Arab and Muslim leaders in Washington several weeks ago to 
assuage their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmad Saidi, an Orlando businessman who toured the exhibit  
Friday, said ``it was fair.'' But Hussein Ibish, spokesman for the 
Washington-based American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and 
others said it should have mentioned Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this is occupied territory,'' Ibish said during the  
tour, waving his hand in front of an enlarged photo of Jerusalem's 
Old City. ``It's an excellent piece of propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Israel exhibit includes a 30-foot replica of the Western  
Wall and scenes of modern-day Israel. Videos tells the stories of 
Abraham, King David, the Roman conquest and the exile of Jews from 
Israel, as well as the rise of Islam in the seventh century and how 
Jerusalem became a holy city for Judaism, Islam and Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	Shai Bazak, the Israeli consul general in Miami, said he  
regretted the exhibit had become political. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want any political confrontations from the this  
exhibit,'' Bazak said. ``I didn't like the political pressure of 
some Arab groups and I hope it's the end of it.''

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis News Ends Publication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Staffers of the city's oldest newspaper knew  
this day would come. 
</P>
<P>
	They had prepared for the closing since July, when the  
management of Indianapolis Newspapers Inc. announced it would cease 
publication of The Indianapolis News, blaming television and 
changing reader habits for the afternoon daily's declining 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't make it any easier Friday, as the final edition  
rolled off the presses at 10:31 a.m. Some cried and hugged as the 
morning passed, some laughed and joked in typical newsroom 
jocularity. All reflected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like you go to see a friend, and you know this friend has  
six months to live and you see this friend go steadily downhill,'' 
said longtime reporter Skip Hess. ``And you're kind of happy to see 
the end come because there's no more suffering. I think the News 
had gotten to that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper was founded in 1869. Rumors of its demise had  
circulated for years as changes in lifestyles and mass media eroded 
its readership. In the end, there were only about 30,000 
subscribers -- down from about 100,000 a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star and the News merged newsroom staffs in 1995, and the  
News' late-afternoon edition ceased publication shortly after 
longtime publisher Eugene S. Pulliam's death on Jan. 21. Saturday 
editions of the papers were merged in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no single economic event or catastrophe that  
overwhelmed it or crushed it,'' The News said in its own front-page 
obituary. ``Like Gen. Douglas MacArthur, it just faded away, a pale 
shadow of its earlier self when it was the most-circulated 
newspaper in Indiana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The obituary was below a headline in 1 3/4-inch type that said,  
``Farewell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final edition also included a special 34-page section  
commemorating the newspaper's history, from the day it was founded 
to Friday, when 100,000 copies of its farewell were printed. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing The News eliminated about 20 newsroom jobs, but most are  
being absorbed through existing openings at The Star and voluntary 
severance. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon newspapers have suffered declining circulation for  
years. In the past year, two others -- The Evansville Press and The 
Chattanooga Times -- ceased publication. When the Honolulu 
Star-Bulletin shuts down by the end of the month, there will be 46 
U.S. cities with two or more newspapers, according to figures 
compiled by The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Involved in Euthanasia Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Two weeks into the school year, Princeton  
professor Peter Singer works in an unmarked office, posts no office 
hours and teaches bioethics in a guarded classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old scholar has come under fierce criticism because  
of his view that parents should be able to euthanize severely 
disabled infants. His appointment as a tenured professor at the 
university's Center for Human Values has led to threats, a barrage 
of e-mails and demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, some 250 protesters -- many in wheelchairs --  
barricaded entrances to the administration building and demanded 
the university rescind its offer to the Australian scholar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good thing to stimulate people to think,''  
Singer said in an interview at his office Thursday. ``You can't 
separate debate and learning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even presidential candidates are being drawn into the  
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Steve Forbes, a member of Princeton's board of  
trustees, has said he will no longer donate to his alma mater for 
as long as Singer teaches there. The wealthy publisher and his late 
father, Malcolm, have been among the university's most generous 
donors; an undergraduate residence hall at Princeton is named after 
the younger Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocacy groups for the disabled are calling on Democratic  
presidential candidate Bill Bradley, also a Princeton alumnus and 
trustee, to condemn Singer's hiring. So far, Bradley has not 
commented on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer's views on euthanasia were first detailed in his 1979  
book ``Practical Ethics.'' He has written that children less than a 
month old have no human consciousness and that parents should be 
allowed to kill a severely disabled infant to end its suffering and 
to increase the family's happiness. ``Killing a defective infant is 
not morally equivalent to killing a person. Sometimes it is not 
wrong at all,'' he has written. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Animal Liberation,'' which Singer considers his most  
important work, he argues that the life of a person is not 
necessarily more valuable than that of an animal. The 1975 book led 
to the founding of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and 
turned Singer into the philosophical father of the animal rights 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some opponents liken his views to those of the Nazis.  
</P>
<P>
	``He provides a convenient ethical framework for bigotry and  
cost-saving measures that cut lives,'' said Stephen Drake of the 
Forest Park, Ill., disability group Not Dead Yet. ``I really don't 
think there's room for this kind of discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer, who is married and has a daughter, says he has actually  
received support from some parents of disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no unanimity among those who live with disabled  
children,'' he said. ``If people attack me because of that belief, 
why aren't they going to clinics that offer prenatal testing and 
protesting there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Griss, a Princeton graduate who is director of the Center on  
Disability and Health in Washington, said when he first heard of 
Singer's appointment, he petitioned the university to reconsider. 
But after exchanging e-mails with Singer over several weeks, Griss 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally view him more as an ally of the disability  
community than our archenemy,'' Griss said. ``I think that he's in 
a position to recognize the dangers of the implementation of his 
theoretical questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer eats no meat, wears no leather and donates one-fifth of  
his income to international aid organizations. In a New York Times 
Magazine article, Singer wrote that members of affluent Western 
societies should donate at least 10 percent of their income to help 
ease starvation in poor countries. The article resulted in $75,000 
in unexpected donations to Oxfam over three weeks, spokeswoman 
Peggy Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attention has put Princeton in the difficult position of  
ensuring Singer's place without defending -- or condemning -- his 
views. The university has provided him with a guarded classroom and 
promised to maintain his safety and that of the 23 students taking 
his course, ``Questions of Life and Death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the controversy can be attributed to misrepresentation  
or misinterpretation of his views,'' university President Harold T. 
Shapiro wrote in an editorial for the Daily Princetonian last 
November, shortly after Singer was appointed. ``But some of the 
controversy arises from the fact that he works on difficult and 
provocative topics and in many cases challenges long-established 
ways of thinking -- or not thinking -- about them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer, who has taught at universities in Britain and Australia,  
has been assaulted in Germany for his views and made an 
unsuccessful run for the Australian Senate as a Green Party 
candidate. He said the American controversy has not changed his 
larger views on life and death. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people read this as part of a broader context,'' he said,  
``they understand that I'm trying to alleviate the amount of 
unnecessary suffering in the world.''

<HEADLINE> McHale, Thompson Head to Hoops Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale drove himself to the very  
edge. John Thompson pushed others to the limit, and sometimes 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always thinks about what he says,'' Hall of Fame coach  
Clarence Gaines said of Thompson, the voluble Georgetown coach. 
``Then he goes ahead and says it anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHale and Thompson shared some common ground Friday -- a spot in  
the Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's other inductees were former NBA star Wayne Embry,  
women's college coach Billie Moore and the late NBA pioneer and 
owner Fred Zollner. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing on a frontline with Larry Bird and Robert Parish, McHale  
helped shape the 1980s as another era of greatness for the Boston 
Celtics. They played with size, smarts and championship intensity, 
winning titles in 1981, 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale arrived in 1980 from the University of Minnesota as a  
gangly, 6-foot-10 sixth man. But he eventually transformed himself 
into one of the most feared attackers in the game with his jump 
hook, fadeaway jumper and agile moves. He shot 55 percent from the 
field for his 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was ... one of the best low-post scorers in the NBA I've  
ever seen. There were times he was unstoppable,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always a lot more concerned with how good I could be,''  
said McHale, who used to spend 10-15 minutes after each game 
sorting out his play. ``I was always self-analyzing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McHale also borrowed inspiration and ideas from Bird and  
others on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry helped everyone improve their games,'' McHale said. ``As  
you saw him do things, you thought, maybe I'm going to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bird, McHale was ready to grunt through pain. In the 1987  
failed playoff effort against the Lakers, McHale played with a foot 
so badly battered he sometimes needed to lean on furniture to 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Another habitue of postseason play, Thompson was the backup  
center for Bill Russell on the Celtic championship teams of 1965 
and 1966. Later, with the hulking Thompson draping a towel over his 
shoulder, his 27 Georgetown teams made 24 postseason appearances. 
They went to three NCAA Final Fours and captured the national 
championship in 1984, the first time a black coach won the national 
basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his unyielding standards for both basketball and academics  
challenged and sometimes frustrated his players. His demands for 
greater minority access in sports gave him more than a few 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	He endured racial taunts when he first fielded a predominantly  
black team at Georgetown. He later boycotted two games in 1989 to 
protest NCAA Proposition 42, saying its financial limits hurt 
minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks such views hurt his two earlier nominations to the  
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody asked me what I think I'll be remembered most for,''  
he said Friday. ``I said, `The things that kept me out of the Hall 
of Fame.''

<HEADLINE> Congress On Verge of Deal on F-22's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force appears to have been thwarted in  
its quest to get the first, combat-ready models of its prized F-22 
stealth fighter as a House-Senate fight over the 
ultra-sophisticated warplane draws to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders were expected to announce as early as  
today that they have agreed to provide $1 billion for the Air Force 
to buy test models of the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	But production of final versions of the radar-evading aircraft  
would have to wait at least until 2001, said congressional 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	While cautioning that ``it's never done until it's done,'' House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters today that a deal on 
the F-22 was close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope we would finish that bill quite quickly,''  
Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force had wanted to begin buying production planes  
during the coming year. It has already spent $25 billion to develop 
the F-22 and plans to spend an additional $40 billion to build 339 
of them. They would replace the F-15 jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-22s, which the Air Force envisions as the cornerstone of  
its fleet for the early 21st century, would cost nearly $200 
million apiece, making it the most expensive jet fighter ever 
built. 
</P>
<P>
	But House critics led by Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., argued that  
the money was needed for other military projects and that the F-22 
was not ready for production. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision would mark a setback for the Lockheed Martin Corp.,  
the prime contractor, the Clinton administration and the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, struck during a closed-door meeting of Republican  
congressional leaders Wednesday night, would end weeks of stalemate 
that blocked progress on a nearly $270 billion bill to run the 
military through fiscal 2000, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a good breakthrough,'' House Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, an F-22 supporter, said while leaving the meeting. 
But he and other lawmakers would provide no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 billion would probably be enough to purchase three or  
four of the test aircraft, one official said, which would be used 
for trials that would help determine the plane's final 
configuration. The Air Force could buy up to six of the test 
models, but probably would have to request additional money next 
year to buy that many. 
</P>
<P>
	In its defense bill, the Senate had provided $1.85 billion this  
year, enough to buy six of the planes. But the House deleted the 
money in July, arguing that the plane's computers were not fully 
tested and that the money was needed for other defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	During weeks of bargaining, the House offered about $1 billion,  
or enough for three or four test fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	House negotiators also offered to support $500 million the  
Senate has approved for construction of a giant LHD-8 transport 
ship at the Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., hometown of 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately learned whether the money for the  
Mississippi ship was included in the agreement. Lott has long 
favored the shipbuilding project, but had been unable to persuade 
the House to go along.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Back to School After Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINETOPS, N.C. (AP) -- Wearing borrowed jeans, teacher Delores  
Porter was back at work Friday, cleaning up damage from Hurricane 
Floyd so her elementary school will be ready when its 650 students 
return next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Porter's eyes grew moist when she thought about what she  
planned to say to her 25 fourth-graders on Monday. Like her, 
several of them were forced out of their homes by the storm's 
catastrophic flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be emotional,'' she said. ``This is not one of  
those times when you tell someone, `I know how you feel,' but you 
really don't. I'm experiencing it. I know how it feels to leave 
your home in the middle of the night with only the clothes on your 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students at Carver Elementary School have missed nearly  
three weeks of school because of the high waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Canceled classes could shorten holiday vacations and extend the  
school year to ensure children get the 180 days of instruction 
required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	In Edgecombe County, which includes Pinetops, 8,000 students  
were affected. Classes will resume in 12 of the county's 14 schools 
Monday. The other two were completely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials are moving temporary trailers near two other  
schools to take in the 550 students from the two closed schools, 
but it will be at least a week before they are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	In Carver's gymnasium, where some ceiling tiles were hanging  
down, fourth-grader Reid Beamon was helping his mother count 650 
stuffed animals that will be handed out when the students arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing my math and practicing my spelling words,'' he  
said. ``I want to go back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said the principal, Rubin Thompson IV: ``We need to get the kids  
back in school to return some sense of normalcy to their lives. 
This helps the entire community, not just the kids.''

<HEADLINE> Video Producer Admits Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A video producer faces up to five years in  
prison and hefty fines after pleading guilty to using a Cayman 
Islands bank to evade as much as $40,000 in taxes over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle A. Pruyn admitted Friday she concealed $240,000 at the  
now-defunct Guardian Bank &AMP; Trust Ltd. of Grand Cayman by working 
with its chairman, John M. Mathewson. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say many others could face similar charges now that  
Mathewson has pleaded guilty to charges and cooperated with 
authorities by providing lists of depositors to U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The records exposed perhaps 1,500 U.S. citizens as tax cheats,  
the FBI said, representing a massive breach of the vaunted bank 
secrecy of the tiny British colony in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson opened an account for Ms. Pruyn in the name of Cogan  
Corp. about 1991, and she deposited income from her video 
production companies. No evidence exists that Cogan conducted any 
business, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pruyn, 45, admitted that with funds from the Cogan account,  
she bought a building and had the property held in trust for her 
children. She filed for bankruptcy in 1996, but did not disclose 
her interest in the building or the offshore Cogan account, she 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pruyn, who pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud and tax  
evasion, faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines, as 
well as an order to pay back taxes and penalties, at sentencing 
Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing Mathewson's ``unparalleled'' cooperation, a federal judge  
in August sentenced him to six months under house arrest, a $30,000 
fine and 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentencing revealed that Mathewson had pleaded guilty in  
March 1997 to charges including conspiracy, money laundering and 
aiding income tax evasions as part of plea bargains with federal 
prosecutors in Florida, New Jersey and New York. He could have 
faced nearly five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Mathewson's help, the U.S. government has recouped  
$50 million in back taxes and penalties, and can expect to get a 
total of $300 million, his lawyer has said. Authorities have not 
confirmed those figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caymans, with just 40,000 residents, are home to 580 banks,  
whose deposits make it the world's fifth-largest banking center. 
Its secrecy laws make it a haven for shelter money, whether 
legitimate income or ill-gotten gains, U.S. officials say.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in University Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A white former vending machine company  
employee whose route included Florida A&AMP;M University was arrested 
Friday in two bombings at the predominantly black school after he 
was recognized on a surveillance tape buying the pipe used in the 
blasts, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Michael Lombardi, 41, an unemployed, married father of  
two, was held without bail on two counts of manufacturing a bomb. 
He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi's attorney, R. Tim Jansen, said, ``He is absolutely  
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first bomb exploded Aug. 31 in the restroom of an  
administration building. The second went off Sept. 22, damaging a 
restroom surrounded by classrooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in either blast, but the explosions spread  
fear across the 12,000-student campus. Dozens of police officers 
searched every campus building each morning, and everyone had to 
show ID to enter. Surveillance cameras were installed at state 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi worked for a vending company and his route had included  
machines at two buildings where bombs exploded, the FBI said. An 
employee told investigators that Lombardi had been issued a 
university ID card and that he did not surrender the card when he 
left the company in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vending company employee described Lombardi as having no  
personality and as an individual who did not like blacks and has 
used the `N' word,'' the FBI wrote in its affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Jansen said that was not true. ``They did not find any  
identification card at his house. He did not have one at the time 
of this event,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In both bombings, the FBI said there were anonymous calls filled  
with racial slurs and threats of more violence. 
</P>
<P>
	One said: ``FAMU has seen the beginning of this. ... They got no  
business having a college where there ain't nobody ... smart enough 
to get a degree. ... This is just the beginning, brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another call warned that something else would happen at the  
university Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi denied building any bombs but admitted to making a  
phone call tinged with racist comments to a Tallahassee TV station 
hours after the second bomb went off Sept. 22, according to FBI 
agent Matthew Pellegrino. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they matched bomb fragments with PVC pipe  
that Lombardi bought at a Lowe's home improvement store the day 
before the first explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to state records, Lombardi holds an embalmer's license  
and resigned from a funeral home about a year ago. Investigators 
said three former co-workers identified Lombardi from a store 
surveillance tape and recognized his voice on a recording of the 
threatening phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	One former co-worker told investigators Lombardi had talked  
about finding bomb-making instructions on the Internet, the FBI 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities would not say whether Lombardi was part of a larger  
group, but indicated they felt the campus was safe after the 
arrest. Hundreds of people are expected to attend school's annual 
parents' weekend, which started Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like our nightmare may be over,'' FAMU President  
Frederick S. Humphries told students at a rally Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said some of the increased security will remain at the  
school, including the surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been on edge because you couldn't be sure when  
the next one was going to happen,'' said Charles Slaton, 21, a 
student from Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Senator Warns on Y2K Air Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senator says he will publicize in the  
Congressional Record all companies with Federal Aviation 
Administration certificates that have not responded to a survey 
about their readiness for the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is drafting  
legislation to ground as of Dec. 31 any certificate holder involved 
in flying passengers that has not responded to the survey by 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	The threatened action came after a hearing Thursday in which the  
Transportation Department's inspector general, Kenneth Mead, said 
1,900 companies regulated by the FAA had not responded to the 
agency's readiness survey issued in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other federal regulatory agencies, the FAA did not  
require a response. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing what I know -- that 1,900 carriers have failed to  
respond to the agency responsible for regulating them about whether 
or not they're Y2K ready -- I think, frankly, knowing that and not 
taking some action could cause this Congress to be held accountable 
for lacking responsibility on this issue,'' Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the FAA checked the figures and said 1,700 companies  
-- instead of the 1,900 companies cited by Dodd and Mead -- had 
failed to respond to the survey, and they include about 200 that 
regularly carry passengers. Of the 200, most operators were small, 
and some, like Kiwi International Air Lines, had gone out of 
business, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the remaining 1,500 companies, some were aerospace  
manufacturers and others were on-demand commercial carriers, 
roughly half of which are charter operators in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told Dodd at Thursday's hearing  
that she welcomed his proposal to publicize the non-respondents and 
ground them if necessary. ``I think the idea of legislation could 
be helpful to us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency always retains the right to ground unsafe operators,  
Garvey said, although the Transportation Department said in recent 
days that a lack of Y2K readiness does not necessarily constitute a 
safety threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The year 2000 problem stems from the design of some older  
computers, which recognize years in a two-digit format, such as 
``99'' for 1999. Some could malfunction when the new century starts 
if they confuse ``00'' for 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer problems are especially troubling in the aviation  
industry, where everything from radar screens to runway lights are 
computerized. In June, the FAA said it had repaired and tested all 
computers critical to safe operations. U.S. and Canadian airlines 
recently offered the same assurance.

<HEADLINE> Pfeiffer To Lead Intershop Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Eckhard Pfeiffer, former chief executive  
officer of Compaq Computer Corp., is taking over as chairman of 
Intershop, which helps clients build electronic storefronts on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer was ousted from Compaq last spring after disappointing  
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent the last five months determining my next steps,''  
he said. ``I've fielded more than 100 proposals, from joining a 
board to becoming a CEO and taking on a venture capital role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston resident does not plan to work full-time with the  
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to lock myself into a CEO position where you  
just keep going for 16 hours a day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer serves on the boards of other companies, including  
General Motors and Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based Intershop was founded seven years ago in  
Germany and lost $17.3 million on sales of $20.4 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the challenge of growing small companies into big  
global companies,'' he said. ``I think I can bring a lot to 
Intershop in terms of industry contacts. I believe this is a truly 
outstanding company in the e-commerce space.''

<HEADLINE> Ind. Man Sentenced in Church Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A man who admitted he helped burn down a  
rural Indiana church has been sentenced to 27 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald A. Puckett also must serve three years of probation, pay  
a $1,500 fine and perform 450 hours of community service for his 
conviction on an arson charge, U.S. Attorney Judith A. Stewart said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett, 38, admitted helping Jay Scott Ballinger and  
Ballinger's girlfriend, Angela Wood, burn the Concord Church of 
Christ in Lebanon, in January 1994. The century-old white frame 
church was featured in the opening scene of the movie ``Hoosiers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett admitted Thursday he sprayed a flammable mixture of  
gasoline, kerosene and paint thinner while Wood wrote satanic 
symbols on the porch and Ballinger lit the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 24, also has been charged with arson.  
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger, 37, is accused of burning a total of 33 churches in  
California, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, South 
Carolina and Tennessee since 1994. He is scheduled to stand trial 
Feb. 7.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Hundreds of passengers were left stranded Friday  
after low-cost airline Debonair was placed in receivership, a 
victim of fierce competition in the discount flights market. 
</P>
<P>
	Debonair Holdings PLC, based at Luton Airport, north of London,  
announced that its 14 aircraft had been grounded. Shares in the

</P>
<P>
	``I am currently seeking finance to see if we can get the  
Debonair planes to fly, but at the moment they are all grounded,'' 
Dargan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said administrators would be looking for offers for  
Debonair, which became one of Britain's first low-cost airlines 
when it launched flights on short-haul European routes in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Offers could come from Lufthansa, Swissair and Richard Branson's  
Virgin, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-cost airlines spawned by the recent deregulation of Europe's  
aviation industry are able to offer cheaper fares by avoiding many 
of the costlier, big-city airports favored by their larger rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	They include Go, British Airways' cut-price service based at  
Stansted Airport; the Irish carrier Ryanair; and easyJet, also 
based at Luton. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by Southwest Airlines and other low-cost U.S. carriers,  
they have attracted customers despite their no-frills service and 
spotty record for punctuality. But the battle for passengers has 
intensified as more players enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, which employs 480 people, had charged $188 for a  
round-trip betwen Luton and Rome, compared with Lufthansa's typical 
economy-class fare of $306.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Transportation Funds OKed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The first congressional funding for  
Olympic transportation projects in Utah advanced Friday when the 
House of Representatives voted to allocate $76 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate negotiators on a conference panel have agreed on the  
funding, part of $290 million sought by Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not certain they will get all the money.  
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest requests will come next year,'' said John Njord,  
the Olympic coordinator for the Utah Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The $76 million includes the final federal installment for the  
north-south light-rail line from downtown Salt Lake to suburban 
Sandy. The final payment was $37.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Transit Authority hopes to tap more federal funding to  
build an east-west line from downtown to the University of Utah in 
time for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. The opening and closing 
ceremonies will be held at the U.'s Rice-Eccles Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Friday also approved:  
</P>
<P>
	-- $10 million in unitemized ``Olympic transportation  
investment'' funding. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $6.5 million for Park City transit buses.  
</P>
<P>
	-- $3 million for electronic signs alerting Interstate 15 drivers  
to congestion and alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $5 million for transportation planning for the Winter Games.  
</P>
<P>
	-- $3.7 million to widen state Route 248 between Park City and  
Kamas. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $3 million for road improvements near Soldier Hollow, the  
biathlon venue at Wasatch Mountain State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $2.5 million for repair and fueling stations in Salt Lake City  
for additional transit buses that will be used for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $2.5 million for Olympic park-and-ride lots.  
</P>
<P>
	-- $1.5 million for ``intermodal'' stations linking transit buses  
and light rail. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $500,000 to cover the expense of shipping and deploying  
transit buses that Salt Lake plans to borrow from other cities.

<HEADLINE> Five Family Members Shot in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAYNESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A search continued in the rugged Blue  
Ridge Mountain foothills for a second suspect in the shooting 
deaths of a family of five, while relatives and friends came to 
grips with the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a terrible thing,'' Robert Rose, 66, a cousin of  
shooting victim Earl Phillips, said Friday. ``It is hard to 
comprehend something like this happening where, you know, nothing 
ever happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 officers, aided by tracking dogs and helicopters,  
searched for the second suspect in Thursday night's shootings in 
this Maggie Valley tourist community, about 28 miles west of 
Asheville and 32 miles east of the Tennessee-North Carolina border. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Phillips, 72; his wife, Cora, 71;  
their son Eddie, 40; their daughter-in-law, Mitzi, 44; and their 
granddaughter, Katie, 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were killed Thursday night after returning home from  
the Haywood County Fair. Four bodies were found inside their 
ranch-style house and a fifth outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the family apparently was targeted only because  
the suspects were trying to steal a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can find no (other) connection between the suspects and the  
victims,'' Haywood County Sheriff Tom Alexander said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	One suspect was in custody. Charles Wesley Roache, 25, was  
caught by a neighbor of the victims and later charged with murder. 
The neighbor held him at gunpoint until police arrived, while the 
other suspect fled. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander refused to say if Roache had given a statement to  
police. The sheriff said he has a felony record, but did not have 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the killers apparently stole the family's  
pickup but wrecked it at the bottom of the family's driveway, went 
back and took another car, which was discovered smashed into a 
guard rail on Interstate 40 two miles east of the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
	A pickup stolen earlier in the week in Iredell County was driven  
off an embankment near the Phillipses' home. 
</P>
<P>
	``My personal opinion is that they came off to dump that vehicle  
and just decided, 'I bet those people got a vehicle,''' said David 
Barnes, an agent with the State Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Phillipses were retired. Eddie Phillips was a dump  
truck driver, and his wife worked at a textile plant and ran a 
beauty shop out of her home, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good people, they were churchgoing people, they never  
harmed nobody,'' neighbor Rita Messer said. ``It's awful. You ain't 
safe in your own home, you're not safe in church. I don't know what 
this world is coming to.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Softens on Support-Check Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans were retreating today from  
their plan to delay income-support checks for poor workers after 
Republican GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush said it was 
a bad idea. President Clinton, armed with a veto pen, declared, ``I 
believe I can stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the idea is running strong among Senate  
Republicans and moderate GOP lawmakers in the House, where the 
party's narrow margin means that as few as five Republican 
defections can defeat one of the party's initiatives. Privately, 
many Republicans fear that the proposal has become a political 
distraction from the party's high-profile goal of protecting Social 
Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,  
defended the idea, saying it would help needy families. But asked 
if Republicans were reconsidering their support, he said, ``We're 
always reassessing what's happening here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the headline today,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey,  
R-Texas, told a reporter about the negative reaction by Bush and 
other Republicans. ``Obviously, that means you have to assess the 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hastert and Armey said, ``I don't know,'' when asked if  
there were enough votes to push the plan through the House. 
</P>
<P>
	A pile of unfinished spending bills awaited lawmakers today on  
the first day of the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was hoping to approve an enormous, $324 billion  
measure financing health, education and labor programs. It was 
among nine of the 13 annual spending bills yet to be passed, and 
one of five facing a veto threat, due to cuts Republicans would 
make in Clinton's plans to hire thousands of new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	But with both sides sensing an issue that could echo in next  
year's elections, a driving force in the budget battle has become 
the GOP pledge to not use Social Security surpluses to pay for 
spending. Central to that is their plan, pushed through the House 
Appropriations Committee on Thursday, to save money by paying 
earned-income tax credits monthly instead of the usual lump sum. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't lose a dime,'' the plan's sponsor, House Majority  
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said of the nearly 20 million working poor 
who receive the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``Rather than getting one check, and who knows what  
they do with that one check once a year, they get a monthly 
income.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said to replace some of the savings the plan would  
produce, Republicans were considering leaving the lump sum payments 
in place, but making monthly payments an option. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, DeLay, who introduced the plan, said Republicans  
had proposed it because, ``This is the one members will support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, Democrats jumped all over the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, leaving the White House today for a trip to Nevada and  
California, said he was delighted that Texas Gov. Bush opposed the 
GOP plan and -- in language almost like the president's -- had said, 
``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs of 
the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Republican proposal was ``unconscionable'' and  
threatened a veto. ``I intend to do everything I can to stop it,'' 
the president said. ``And I believe I can stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the GOP tactic would be unfair, because it would  
siphon money from working families who earn less than $30,000 a 
year. Bush agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned for someone who is moving from near-poverty to  
middle class,'' said Bush, who is trying to build an election 
coalition by blending traditional conservative values with moderate 
rhetoric. Afterward, his spokeswoman Karen Hughes confirmed that 
Bush was criticizing the proposal to change the earned income tax 
credit distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked later about Bush's remarks, DeLay said, ``It's obvious Mr.  
Bush needs a little education on how Congress works.'' He added, 
``I don't think he knew what he was talking about,'' suggesting 
Bush may not have realized that benefits would not be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed legislation Thursday keeping the government  
financed through Oct. 21. That gives all sides three more weeks to 
work through dozens of disputes ranging from public housing to 
mining on federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	One legislative deadlock was broken when House and Senate  
conferees finally agreed on a $8.7 billion farm relief package 
after dropping a provision that would have eased the embargo on 
trade with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee approved its $316 billion  
version of the labor-health bill by a near party-line 33-26 vote. 
It did so after approving the delay in earned income payments by a 
party-line 32-27 tally. 
</P>
<P>
	That budgetary sleight-of-hand would produce $8.7 billion in  
savings in fiscal 2000. That is because with monthly payments, much 
of next year's funds would be paid out after Oct. 1, 2000 -- the 
start of fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old tax credit program is designed to help 20  
million low-income people avoid becoming welfare recipients. The 
credit averages $1,890 annually for families with children, and 
should cost nearly $32 billion next year, the Treasury Department 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the fourth spending bill Thursday, a $21 billion  
measure financing energy and water projects. He has also signed 
measures financing the Treasury Department, Congress' own 
operations and military construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine unfinished bills cover 12 Cabinet departments including  
Defense, Health and Human Services, Interior and Justice, plus 
dozens of smaller agencies.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Researcher Rall Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cancer researcher David Platt Rall has died as  
the result of injuries suffered in an automobile accident in 
Bordeaux, France. He was 73 and lived in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Rall died Tuesday, 10 days after the accident, according to the  
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which he 
headed until retiring in 1990. He also formerly was in charge of 
the National Toxicology Program and held the rank in the Public 
Health Service of assistant surgeon general. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study of how the environment affects our health has lost a  
pioneer,'' Kenneth Olden, current director of the two institutes, 
said in a statement. ``Dr. Rall established the credibility of our 
two federal environmental health organizations and set the pace. 
His name is synonymous with environmental health research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rall was born in Naperville, Ill., and joined the National  
Cancer Institute in 1954. His research there resulted in methods 
for preventing spread of leukemia to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	He became increasingly interested in how anti-cancer drugs tend  
to be highly toxic when used in effective dosages. That led him to 
study the impact of chemicals in the environment on people's 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	Prof. Ellen Silbergeld of the University of Maryland called Rall  
``truly the intellectual and ethical founder of modern 
environmental medicine.''

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Nations Consider Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Economic ministers from Southeast Asia and  
their counterparts from Australia and New Zealand said Friday they 
will consider establishing a free trade zone for the region by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us by ourselves is too small to carry a significant  
weight in the international balance,'' said George Yeo, Singapore's 
Minister of Trade and Industry. ``But collectively, we will speak 
with the louder voice and exert a stronger influence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trade volume between Southeast Asian countries and Australia and  
New Zealand totaled more than $16 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Southeast Asian Nations already has taken  
steps toward making the region a ``zero-tariff'' trade area. From 
Jan. 1, import taxes within the six founding ASEAN countries will 
be reduced to a maximum of 5 percent for various agricultural and 
manufacturing products. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a special task force will be established to study whether  
Australia and New Zealand could be included in those arrangements 
by 2010, said the ministers, who were meeting in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers said recent political tensions between Australia and  
Indonesia over East Timor would not hinder the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an ASEAN effort, something which all of us in ASEAN  
unanimously consider to be important,'' said Hatanto Reksodipoetro, 
director-general of Indonesia's Ministry of Industry and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia is leading an international peacekeeping force in East  
Timor, which voted for independence from Indonesia in a 
U.N.-sponsored referendum Aug. 30. Indonesian politicians have 
accused Australia of meddling in their affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers also noted that the region shows ``significant  
signs'' of recovery from the economic crisis that erupted in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who will  
lead the World Trade Organization for three years beginning in 
2002, also said Friday that China should be admitted to the group 
during the next round of talks, which start in November in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	China insists that it wants to join the world trade body, but  
many bureaucrats and provincial politicians fear that opening 
domestic markets to global competition will hurt state industries 
and spur unrest at home. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN includes Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,  
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Admits Possible Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The future of new men's basketball coach Quin Snyder's first two  
prospective recruits is in question after Missouri reported 
possible NCAA recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri athletic director Mike Alden notified the NCAA on  
Friday that the university may have violated recruiting rules by 
allowing the mothers of Detroit basketball prospects Rickey 
Paulding and Arthur Johnson to join their sons on a chartered plane 
to Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA told Missouri late Friday afternoon that a ruling on  
the violation will arrive on Monday. The NCAA was working on 
several other eligibility cases from other schools Friday, and 
could not immediately investigate Missouri's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	A Missouri sports information spokesman said Friday the  
university will release a statement when the infraction ruling 
arrives on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to the resolution of this issue in a  
swift and just manner,'' Snyder said. ``We regret any negative 
impact that this has had on our institution and continue to accept 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski wouldn't speculate on when a  
ruling might be made or any possible implications it might hold for 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said the university interpreted NCAA rules to mean a  
prospect could be accompanied on a noncommercial flight if the 
extra party paid fair market value for the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The women paid the university between $200 and $300 each for  
their tickets prior to flying from Detroit to Columbia Regional 
Airport on Sept. 17 and returning Sept. 19, Alden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel confident in the process. I feel confident in our  
basketball program. And, I feel confident in the NCAA,'' Alden 
said. ``Do I feel confident in a great result? I have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jankowski would not comment specifically on Missouri's  
situation, she said NCAA rules are clear regarding transportation 
of prospective recruits and their relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	A school can use commercial flights or noncommercial flights --  
the school's own plane, charter or private planes -- to bring 
prospects to campus for official visits, Jankowski said. But 
relatives, friends and legal guardians can accompany prospects only 
on commercial flights. On those flights, the prospect's fare is 
paid by the school. Anyone accompanying the prospect must pay his 
or her own way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA does not support that a parent can be on a  
noncommercial flight,'' Jankowski said. It does not matter whether 
the parents pay for the flight, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement released Friday evening, Mary Ann Austin,  
Missouri's director of compliance, said the NCAA's rules were not 
that clear cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``NCAA rules do not clearly state that it is impermissible to  
allow parents to accompany prospects on a chartered flight,'' 
Austin said. She said that elements of four NCAA bylaws, not a 
single rule, ``outline the intent that this arrangement is not 
permissible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding and Johnson, both seniors, orally committed to Missouri  
last week. But now they could be declared ineligible, at least 
temporarily, before the Nov. 7 signing day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once an institution determines there's been a violation  
involving an athlete or prospective athlete, it's their 
responsibility to make an eligibility ruling,'' Jankowski said. The 
university would then seek to have the athlete reinstated by the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this would affect a student's ability to play at another  
school, Jankowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alden said Missouri had yet to decide what to do with  
Paulding and Johnson's eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if an infraction has indeed taken place,'' Alden  
said. ``The NCAA is the only one that can determine if an 
infraction has taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said the call to the NCAA followed one Wednesday to the  
Big 12 Conference, which advised Missouri that it would be 
``beneficial'' to notify the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding, a 6-foot-4 guard, averaged 25.6 points, 11.2 rebounds,  
4.0 assists and 3.0 blocked shots last season at Detroit 
Renaissance High. He said having his mother on the visit made it 
easier to choose a college. Paulding also visited Ohio State, Miami 
and Michigan State, but his mother made only the trip to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding and his mother, Virginia Robinson, told the St. Louis  
Post-Dispatch that the two mothers and their sons were the only 
passengers on the chartered plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nice plane,'' Paulding said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a 6-9 forward, averaged 16.4 points last season at  
Detroit Pershing High. He only visited Miami before choosing 
Missouri. Both players made an unofficial visit together to 
Missouri in August. But the September trip to Columbia over Parents 
Weekend solidified their choices.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Woo Christian Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Republican presidential candidates showed  
off their conservative credentials Friday, Christian Coalition 
founder Pat Robertson deemed Gary Bauer a ``lost cause,'' Elizabeth 
Dole ``a Southern belle'' and George W. Bush ``worthy of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Pat Buchanan, Robertson gave a stern warning that Christian  
conservatives will desert him if he ditches the GOP for a 
third-party presidential run with the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform supporters are ``180 degrees out in terms of social  
issues. They don't share any of the views that Pat Buchanan claimed 
to espouse so vociferously,'' Robertson told a news conference at 
the coalition's annual ``Road to Victory'' conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see him taking many Christian conservatives with him --  
not to the Reform Party,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day conference drew 3,500 of the coalition's 2.1 million  
members and six of the eight Republicans running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Bush, the Texas governor and front-runner for the GOP  
nomination, who filled all the seats -- and lined the perimeter's 
standing room -- in a cavernous hotel ballroom. ``Every child born 
and unborn must be protected by law and welcomed to life,'' he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	He advocated parental-notification laws on abortion, saying  
``Parents should be the first to help, not the last to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, the religious broadcaster who commands the  
grass-roots army of Christian activists that helped sweep 
Republicans into control of Congress in the 1994 elections, said he 
will not endorse any presidential candidate during the primary 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But his preferences were clear.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Robertson all but dismissed Bauer, whose  
teen-aged supporters in campaign T-shirts worked Friday's 
convention in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to win,'' Robertson told The New York Times.  
``You don't win with 1 or 2 percent. Most people are not terribly 
keen on riding a lost cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who once ran the Family Research Council and prides  
himself on his Christian conservative appeal, appeared taken aback 
when informed of Robertson's remark. He said he was disappointed 
Robertson was not taking a straw poll of members at this year's 
convention. ``Then we wouldn't have to sit around and speculate on 
where the leaders are,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said some of what he's heard from Bush's ``centrist''  
campaign ``so far would cause me to believe he would be worthy of 
support of the coalition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Robertson added he is eager to see a series of debates  
force Bush to ``crystallize his positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bauer promised that, unlike Bush, he would make a  
judge's opposition to abortion rights a prerequisite for 
appointment to any federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Bauer shouted, ``My judges are going to understand that  
marriage is between a man and a woman -- not two men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole took the stage to the rolling crescendos of the music from  
``Gone With the Wind'' and talked of her religious upbringing. She 
called her grandmother's tattered Bible her dearest treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment is to strive to lean on the lord with my whole  
heart, reading his word daily and earnestly seeking his will in my 
life,'' Dole said. ``I learned from the best -- President Reagan -- 
that you have to lead with the convictions of your heart, not with 
the latest polling data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said later that she gave a ``wonderful speech'' and  
enjoys ``real support'' from his members. Asked to explain the 
music organizers chose for her entrance, Robertson boyishly 
shrugged. ``She's the Southern belle, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch promised to be a ``conservative president  
with guts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Penberth of Bethlehem, Penn., remained undecided.  
``These 20-minute speeches don't get you anywhere. It's just 
rah-rah,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain declined an invitation to speak. And  
though Buchanan appeared on Saturday's program, he canceled earlier 
this week, his campaign said. Alan Keyes was addressing the Friday 
evening session. Steve Forbes issued an open invitation to picnic 
by the pool after his Saturday morning speech. 
</P>
<P>
	From atop a massive, political-convention-styled dais and  
accompanied by the ``Rocky'' fight song, Robertson opened the 
conference with an eye on the 2000 elections and appeal to his 
followers. ``If we aren't in the field in this coming election, 
Republicans will lose,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was Robertson's primary target. ``As we  
prepare for a new millennium, I want to start with cleansing the 
highest office of the land from the sleaze and the equivocation and 
the moral rot which has embarrassed us all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Clinton, the villain in abstentia here was Minnesota  
Gov. Jesse Ventura, who, in a Playboy magazine interview this week, 
called organized religion ``a sham and a crutch for weak-minded 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said Ventura was ``off his rocker.'' Bauer suggested  
the former pro-wrestler change his name to ``Jesse 'the Bigot' 
Ventura.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Anti-Osteoporosis Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday gave Eli Lilly and  
Co. approval to sell anti-osteoporosis drug Evista as a 
preventative for brittle bones in women who are past menopause. 
</P>
<P>
	A study published in the Journal of the American Medical  
Association in August found the drug reduced the risk of spinal 
fractures by 30 percent to 50 percent in women who already had the 
bone-thinning disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year study of 7,705 women in 25 countries was funded  
by Lilly, an Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Evista, known generically as raloxifene, was first approved in  
1997 for the prevention of osteoporosis. It is one of four 
anti-osteoporosis drugs currently on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lilly is pleased to provide for women a new therapy option to  
treat osteoporosis and help reduce the risk of fractures,'' said 
Hunter Heath III, Lilly's U.S. medical director of endocrinology. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteoporosis afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans and  
costs $13.8 billion annually.

<HEADLINE> Oilers Retire Gretzky's Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- With the retirement of his jersey in  
Edmonton, Wayne Gretzky called it the official end of his hockey 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweater of hockey's greatest player was raised to the  
rafters of the building he made famous before his family, 
ex-teammates and more than 17,000 screaming, cheering fans on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's only fitting that they're parking me (the banner)  
behind that net,'' said Wayne Gretzky, referring to the area where 
he was offensively potent. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple blue banner bearing Gretzky's name, number and the  
team's oil drop logo was lifted to the ceiling following an 
eye-popping light show and video extravaganzia highlighted by 
Gretzky's greatest goals being replayed on the Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
	The voice of Rod Phillips, longtime Edmonton Oilers public  
address announcer, cracked and tears flowed as he said: ``Ladies 
and gentlemen, we'll now say these words for the last time ever in 
the building: Hockey fans, tonight's first star, No. 99 Wayne 
Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two then hugged.  
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour ceremony took place prior to the Oilers'  
home-opener against the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave Gretzky a five-minute standing ovation when he  
entered in a cloud of dry ice and circled the rink standing on the 
bed of a slow-moving black pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	Flashbulbs popped as players, fans and even the refs saluted  
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank You For The Memories, Wayne Gretzky, said one of the many  
signs in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky then hopped off and was hugged by mentor and former  
coach Glen Sather, who is now team president. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Sather called Gretzky ``a great Canadian hero.''  
</P>
<P>
	Also at center ice were Gretzky's father Walter, mother Phyllis,  
wife Janet and children Paulina, Ty and Trevor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Oiler greats Mark Messier, Jari Kurri and Dave Semenko  
unveiled a Wei Luan portrait of Gretzky celebrating a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities began with a song by the rock group the Moffats  
written specifically for Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky thanked the club and the city's fans, saying ``the years  
here have been nothing but wonderful, nothing but great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony capped a day of Wayne-adoration that began at noon  
when 5,000 screaming fans ignored freezing temperatures to jam the 
City Hall square to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``One more year! One more year!'' they chanted to Gretzky.  
</P>
<P>
	``They took my skates to the Hall of Fame!'' he shouted back.  
``I don't even have skates!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans began lining up at 7 a.m., shivering under their  
Gretzky sweaters and Oilers jackets, sporting handmade cardboard 
signs plastered with hearts and 99s. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was joined on stage by Sather, NHL commissioner Gary  
Bettman and Edmonton mayor Bill Smith. Gretzky's parents, wife and 
children sat shivering off to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave Gretzky three standing ovations, booed Bettman,  
shouted ``Gretzky for Mayor!'' when Smith spoke and cheered when 
Sather joked that Gretzky ``has agreed to come back one more year 
for the Edmonton Oilers -- and he said `No charge' so it fits into 
our budget!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city hall affair was to officially change the name of the  
3-mile expressway that runs past Skyreach -- the site of his four 
Stanley Cup triumphs -- to Wayne Gretzky Drive. 
</P>
<P>
	A bronze statue of him hoisting aloft hockey's Stanley Cup  
already stands outside the rink. It was erected a decade ago after 
his trade to the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second piece of pavement dedicated to No. 99. The Wayne  
Gretzky Parkway runs through his home town of Brantford, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	After the city hall ceremony, Gretzky told reporters that the  
number-retirement brings the curtain down once and for all on his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the sweater goes up, it's the official end,'' said  
Gretzky, adding, ``I still wish I could play. I still wish I could 
be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old center retired last spring after a 20-year  
career that featured stops in Edmonton, Los Angeles and St. Louis 
before reaching the end of the line with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has already announced his No. 99 will be retired  
throughout the league, but Edmonton is the first city to send his 
jersey to the rafters. Los Angeles and New York are expected to 
follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets for the game -- priced at $80 and $150 -- were hard to  
find. On-air auctions and bids in the classified ads saw that price 
triple and quadruple. Fans came from as far away as Norway. About 
39,000 signed up for an Internet and in-person lottery for the 
remaining 760 walk-up tickets in the 17,099-seat building. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-owner Peter Pocklington, who endured the wrath of  
Edmontonians after he traded Gretzky to the Kings on Aug. 9, 1988, 
was not part of the official festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who joined defenseman Al Hamilton as the only Oilers  
player to have his number retired, is the NHL's career scoring 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The holder of 61 league records, he had 894 goals and 1,963  
assists for 2,857 points. In 208 career playoff games, he collected 
122 goals and 260 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	He played one season in the now-defunct World Hockey  
Association. He scored 46 regular-season goals plus 10 more in the 
playoffs to give him a combined pro hockey mark of 1,072 -- one more 
goal than boyhood idol Gordie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto  
on Nov. 22. The hall's directors have waived the usual three-year 
waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	He has moved his family back to southern California but has been  
so busy with endorsement and charity work, he now travels in his 
own nine-passenger jet.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Sector Grew in Sept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector grew in  
September for the eighth consecutive month, while prices of raw 
materials spurted to the highest level since May 1995, a business 
group reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall index for the industrial economy, as portrayed in  
the survey released today by the National Association of Purchasing 
Management, was much stronger than analysts had predicted, reaching 
its highest level in nearly five years. That was further evidence 
the economy grew strongly in the third quarter after a lackluster 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' index for September was 57.8 percent  
compared with 54.2 percent in August -- the strongest reading since 
a 59.2 percent in November 1994, the association said. Analysts had 
projected a 54.2 percent index for September. A reading of more 
than 50 is a sign of an expanding industrial economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' index is closely watched because it is  
the first national reading for September on U.S. manufacturing 
performance, a key sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector continued to grow in September and at  
a faster rate than it grew in August,'' Norbert J. Ore, chairman of 
the management group's business survey committee, said in a 
statement releasing the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both production and new orders accelerated during the month,  
while NAPM's price index jumped to its highest level since May 
1995, indicating that manufacturers continue to pay higher prices 
for their purchases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price index surged to 67.6 percent in September from 59.8  
percent in August. That was the highest since 70.5 percent in May 
1995, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 42 percent of those surveyed in September said prices of  
input materials were higher, compared with 32 percent in August. Of 
the balance, 6 percent saw decreases and 52 percent said prices 
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price reading is extraordinarily high,'' said Mark Vitner,  
an economist at First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. He described 
it as ``a very strong bounce-back'' from depressed levels during 
the Asian crisis that began in the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the rise in prices was more problematic for  
manufacturers than consumers. ``There's little evidence 
manufacturers will be able to pass on higher prices to consumers 
because of a lot of import competition,'' he said. As a result, 
manufacturers probably will have to find ways to absorb the added 
costs or increase productivity further. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures of future manufacturing strength -- new orders and the  
backlog of orders -- also showed healthy growth in September, the 
report showed. New orders increased to 64.4 percent in September 
from 56.6 percent the month before, while the backlog of orders 
went to 54.5 percent from 52.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventories declined, and employment weakened slightly.  
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers group represents executives who buy raw  
materials and supplies for industry.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Sign Power Forward Smith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Wizards, looking for better  
performance on the boards, signed free agent power forward Michael 
Smith on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-year NBA veteran, Smith has averaged 6 points and 7.1  
rebounds per game with Sacramento and Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Although terms of the contract weren't disclosed, the Wizards  
had a $2 million roster exemption available to cover the first year 
of Smith's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael instantly makes us a better rebounding team,'' Wizards  
general manager Wes Unseld said. ``He is a solid rebounder, has 
good defensive skills, and that's why the coaches and I feel he 
will be an asset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Smith, a Washington native, will compete with Aaron  
Williams, who played for Seattle last year, for the starter's job 
at power forward. Smith had been traded to Orlando last month as 
part of an 11-player, three-team deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards open their training camp Monday at Shepherd College  
in Shepherdstown, W.Va.

<HEADLINE> Female Hall Inductee Reminisces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- First is an adjective that naturally  
tags along with Billie Moore's name: The first woman's coach to win 
national championships at two schools, Cal State-Fullerton and 
UCLA. The coach of the first U.S. Olympic women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	But first there was a small town in Kansas in the 1950s and a  
father, who tripled as high school principal and coach of the boys 
and girls basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very fortunate. It was such a small town that I didn't  
know girls weren't supposed to compete,'' said Moore, recalling her 
path from Westmoreland, Kan., to Friday's induction into the 
Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the family moved to Topeka there were no sports for  
girls in the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Girls were supposed to play for social purposes,'' the  
56-year-old Moore said. ``But, by that time the idea of playing to 
win was too ingrained in me for any of that to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has done her share of winning.  
</P>
<P>
	In 24 seasons of coaching Moore compiled a 436-196 record. She  
led Cal State-Fullerton to the AIAW national title in 1970. And 
then won the 1978 title with a UCLA team that included Hall of 
Famers Ann Meyers and Denise Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie college coach, she was already giving coaching  
clinics, because that was also the first year colleges abandoned 
the half-court women's game and Moore had grown up playing boy's 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``One woman actually asked me how you get the ball from one end  
of the court to the other,'' she said. ``It gave me a bit of an 
edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While she revels in the growth of the game and the attention the  
WNBA has brought to it, Moore also has some cautions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women's collegiate game has to be careful with all the  
recruiting and attention paid to the athletes that they do not end 
up spoiled and pampered,'' she said. ``Sometimes people think they 
are on third base when they are only on first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her own barometer of the growth of the game is the contrast  
between the millions of dollars and attention devoted to the 1996 
Olympic team, and her unheralded 1976 squad, which first turned the 
national television spotlight on women's basketball with its silver 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, including Meyers, fellow Hall of Famers Anne Donovan  
and Nancy Lieberman and Tennessee coach Pat Summitt, had six weeks 
to train, often playing high school boys teams. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the women left for Montreal, Moore had $500 in cash and  
the personal credit card of Bill Wall, the head of the organization 
running the national team, to cover the team's expenses.

<HEADLINE> NASA Craft Goes Down on Calif. Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARSTOW, Calif. (AP) -- An unmanned experimental NASA aircraft  
being tested for environmental research crash landed in the Mojave 
Desert on Friday, sustaining moderate damage and partially blocking 
a highway. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured when the Perseus aircraft crash landed at  
8:45 a.m. crash 4 miles east of Barstow, said Leslie Mathews, a 
spokeswoman for the NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards 
Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate details on the damage. The aircraft,  
appearing intact but its nose resting on the ground, blocked the 
westbound side of Interstate 40 through the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	California Highway Patrol Officer Randy Lefebure said the craft  
came down like a helicopter and hit on its nose shortly before 9 
a.m. The Perseus is 25 feet long with a wingspan of 71 1/2 feet. It is 
designed to reach an altitude of 65,000 feet and stay aloft up to 
24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine aircraft had been in the air 2 1/4 hours under  
remote control by a pilot on the ground, Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perseus is part of NASA's Environmental Research Aircraft and  
Sensor Technology program to develop a variety of unmanned aircraft 
that can carry science packages for long duration and at very high 
altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	Perseus aircraft are intended to be able to reach 82,000 feet  
with a 165-pound science payload. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane that went down Friday was Perseus B, a model expected  
to reach a maximum altitude of 65,000 feet and stay aloft for up to 
24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Perseus A was lost in a crash in November 1994, a little less  
than a year after the first Perseus flight. The aircraft were built 
by Aurora Flight Sciences Corp. of Manassas, Va. Development of 
each plane cost $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	According to NASA, Perseus' 9-foot-diameter propeller requires  
an unusual launch technique. With its engine running but the 
propeller locked in a horizontal position, the aircraft is towed 
into the air by a ground vehicle. At a certain altitude, the tow 
line separates and the propeller is engaged by remote control.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Back Test Ban Vote Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An offer by Senate Republican leaders to force  
a vote on a long-languishing nuclear test-ban treaty won 
conditional Democratic support today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota told  
reporters he was attempting to negotiate a week's delay with 
Majority Leader Trent Lott and to buy more time for debate in an 
effort to win ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and Senate Democrats have made the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty a top priority and were caught by 
surprise Thursday by a Republican move to schedule a vote next 
week. Republicans say they have the votes to kill the 152-nation 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have long pushed for action on the treaty, but until  
this week GOP leaders had blocked action, bottling it up in the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott announced that he was prepared to call up the treaty Oct. 6  
and vote on it after 10 hours of debate, bypassing any hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle objected to the move Thursday and today made a  
counteroffer: a final vote Oct. 12, after 14 hours of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Daschle suggested that hearings might be held by  
the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees, since 
Foreign Relations, chaired by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., refuses to 
take it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he still resented Lott's efforts to force a vote  
with no, or limited, hearings. But he said the treaty is so 
important that Democrats couldn't afford to turn their backs on the 
offer for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides said Lott is expected to go along with the  
week's delay, at the very least. 
</P>
<P>
	And Daschle hinted that Democrats want to see a vote on the  
treaty even if not entirely on their terms. As to whether he could 
marshal the 67 votes needed for ratification, Daschle said, ``I 
don't know at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, a State Department official told reporters the  
administration needs ample time to make its case for the treaty. 
John Holum, the administration's top arms-control official, said he 
believes the votes could be mustered given enough time. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke before the Democratic efforts to delay the vote for  
just one week were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum said the treaty was of vital importance because, once it  
takes effect, it will be ``very difficult for new countries to 
develop nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of a vote next week prompted Defense Secretary  
William Cohen to decide today to cut short by one day his Asian 
trip so he can return to Washington and take part in the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's offer to bring up the long languishing treat divided  
Democratic ranks, with some treaty backers urging Daschle to accept 
the offer even if the administration lacked the apparent votes to 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bring it up next week,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a  
leading test ban activist. He said the offer was ``all right with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Kimball, director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear  
Dangers, a pro-treaty advocacy group, called Lott's offer 
disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a rush to judgment,'' he said. ``The Senate needs to  
hold fair hearings, have thorough debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms taunted apprehensive Democrats. ``The same people  
clamoring for action go running to the hills,'' he said. ``If it 
were not so pitiful, this behavior would be amusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which calls for an outright ban on nuclear testing,  
has been signed by 152 nations, including the United States. But it 
has only been ratified by 47 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulgaria and South Korea ratified the treaty just this week.  
</P>
<P>
	If all 45 Democrats support the treaty, as is expected, 22  
Republicans must vote ``yes'' for it to be ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of support for the pact clearly figured into the GOP change  
of strategy. Republican opponents of the pact said they were 
confident they would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, said he was optimistic Daschle could 
negotiate more than 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But if not, Biden suggested it was time to move ahead. ``I'm  
ready to roll the dice,'' he said.

	Biden said Democrats appear to be about 15 votes short. He

<HEADLINE> Pistons Center Dele Might Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Detroit Pistons center Bison Dele has  
told the team that he might retire and will miss the start of 
training camp next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele is in Beirut and doesn't plan to return to the United  
States for a couple of weeks, the team said in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going through an epiphanal moment in his life,'' agent  
Dwight Manley said Thursday night. ``We'll sit down with the team 
when he gets back and we'll discuss everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, 30, told the Pistons Wednesday of a possible desire to  
retire. In the past 48 hours, Pistons' executive vice presidents 
Rick Sund and Joe Dumars and coach Alvin Gentry have talked with 
Dele. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me that he was tired and his heart was not in it,''  
Dumars, the Pistons director of player of personnel, said. ``He 
said he did not have the motivation to keep on playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Sund emphasized the team's commitment to have  
Dele return. 
</P>
<P>
	Pistons players are to report to training camp Monday. The first  
practice is Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, a 6-foot-11 center who formerly was known as Brian  
Williams, has played two seasons in Detroit. He stands to walk away 
from about $30 million, with five years left on a contract that 
called for him to receive $45 million for seven seasons. He was the 
team's highest-paid player. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele spent two seasons in Detroit after signing as a free agent,  
and his relationship with his teammates was known to be strained. 
Dele's name came up frequently in trade rumors during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had heard that he might not come back, and I have tried a  
couple of times to call him,'' Pistons star Grant Hill said. ``I 
don't want to comment on any of this because I don't know what is 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after joining the Pistons, Dele admitted his passion for  
basketball was not the greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had the kind of passion for basketball that my dad had  
for music,'' said Dele, whose father was a member of the Platters. 
``If I had the same kind of passion for basketball as my dad had 
for music, I probably would be a better player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele averaged 10.5 points and 6.2 rebounds last season, 16.2  
points and 8.9 rebounds the previous season.

<HEADLINE> Apple Inspires Rainbow of Laptops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major computer makers are giving their laptops a  
splash of color this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM plans to unveil a laptop computer that can be dressed in a  
$30 snap-on cover in different tones of blue, gray, green or red. 
Dell Computer, another longtime purveyor of plain-looking 
computers, introduced blue and gray laptops last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Emboldened by the initial success of Apple's new iBook portable  
computer, stodgier computer makers are splashing up their laptops 
to attract buyers whose taste for color extends well beyond basic 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	While the changes are merely cosmetic, the rise of colorful  
portables is the latest symbol of the industry's progression from 
targeting a single flavor of users to pursuing a rainbow of 
distinctive tastes and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-decade-old market for home computers is undergoing a  
shift much like the automotive industry in the early 1900s, when 
the black-only Ford Model T was supplanted by colorful cars from 
General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, computer makers differentiated their products by  
touting processing power and storage capacity. But a steady drop in 
prices has made powerful computers ubiquitous, leaving makers to 
scramble for new ways to distinguish their wares. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a very image-oriented society, and for computers to  
ignore that is kind of silly,'' said Matt Sargent, an analyst with 
the ZD InfoBeads research firm in La Jolla, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer began tapping that image-mindedness last year  
when it introduced the futuristic-looking iMac personal computer, 
sold in five bright colors, and then again in early September with 
the new iBook laptop, sold in two fruity colors. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac spurred several imitators to deviate from the boxy  
design of most desktop computers, and the iBook is apparently 
having the same impact the market for portable computers. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's ``i'' series of ThinkPad laptop computers, starting at  
$1,500, will be offered next week. Customers who don't want a black 
model can buy a snap-on plastic cover that comes in metallic colors 
that look much like the finish on cars -- Mars Red, Terra Green, 
Eclipse Blue and Lunar Gray -- as well in non-metallic versions. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM boasts that the covers will enable consumers to change the  
color of their machines like a chameleon. A corporate executive, 
for example, might want to choose formal black when toting a laptap 
to a client's office, but switch back to Mars Red back at the home 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	But more importantly for IBM, the removable jacket helps the  
company avoid the costly inventory hurdles facing rivals who make 
computers in more than one color. 
</P>
<P>
	The electronics chain Best Buy, for instance, refused to sell  
Apple's iMacs early this year because Apple wanted it to feature 
all five colors, even though some are less popular than others. 
</P>
<P>
	The removable cover ``means we don't have to predict what will  
be hot in the marketplace,'' an IBM spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the new crop of laptops strives to retain some of the  
formal look of the machines they seek to out-class. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer introduced its Inspiron laptops in Tahoe Blue and  
Storm Gray last week. The machines are encased in colored plastic 
that surrounds the keyboard and computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new Dell colors appear more subdued than Apple's or even  
IBM's, there's a good reason, said Greg Nakagawa, director of 
Dell's Inspiron brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's was a little bit of a compromise,'' he said. ``We didn't  
want to be so wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People using a Dell laptop for a presentation to clients,  
Nakagawa explained, ``may want to show a demonstration on a 
platform that doesn't distract from the message they want to 
relay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting at $1,800, the portables are key to a Dell push to  
expand sales to home and small business users. Consumers, seen as 
more likely to go for different colors, comprise just one-third of 
the market for portables, but demand is growing quickly, according 
to ZD Infobeads.

<HEADLINE> 100 Sick From Fast Food in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLENSBURG, Wash. (AP) -- More than 100 people became sick with  
stomach and intestinal inflammation this week after eating at a 
Jack in the Box restaurant in this central Washington town, health 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The illnesses do not appear linked to hepatitis or the E. coli  
bacteria blamed for a 1993 outbreak that sickened hundreds of 
people and killed four. That was linked to tainted hamburger meat 
distributed to Jack in the Box outlets in Washington and other 
Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 new cases of mild to moderate viral gastroenteritis  
were reported Friday, three days after people began showing up at 
the emergency room at Kittitas Valley Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The only person admitted to the hospital was released Thursday,  
and others with the illness reported their symptoms -- nausea, 
vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhea -- were subsiding Friday, said 
John Wolpers of the Kittitas County Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials believe an employee who reported to work Monday  
and then became ill during his shift is likely the source of the 
illnesses. The restaurant closed Wednesday, passed health 
inspections and was expected to reopen Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego-based Foodmaker Inc., the fast-food chain's corporate  
parent, said Friday it will pay the medical bills for patrons who 
became ill.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Chairman Gives Up Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Bill Giles, chairman of the Philadelphia  
Phillies and the team's president until 27 months ago, will give up 
his day-to-day responsibilities with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retirement isn't quite the right word,'' Giles, 65, told The  
Philadelphia Inquirer in an interview published today. ``I've just 
decided to stop working so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giles said he will remain as chairman, a title he assumed in  
June 1997, when he was replaced as team president by David 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made an arrangement with the other partners that I'm not  
going to work hard if I don't want to,'' Giles said. ``I'll enjoy 
other things in the world instead of worrying about building a 
stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's effort to build a new baseball-only park just a few  
blocks north of City Hall had been Giles' project, but he turned 
that job over to Montgomery last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighborhood opponents of the stadium project as proposed by the  
Phillies have been vocal, and Giles put the chances the park would 
actually be built at Broad and Spring Garden Streets at ``50-50,'' 
significantly lower than the 70-30 odds Mayor Edward Rendell gave 
the downtown stadium project a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still might be a way to pull it off, but the hurdles are  
getting higher,'' Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles said he would keep his 15 percent ownership in the team  
``as long as I'm alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also admitted for the first time that his decision to  
step down as team president had not been voluntary, as had been 
reported in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't `Do it or else.' I wasn't forced out,'' Giles said.  
``It was a strong suggestion, but it was my decision. The business 
part of the game had gotten to me. I wasn't as effective as I had 
been. Some of the partners said `Don't you think it's time to let a 
younger man worry about all those things?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Giles, the son of former National League president Warren Giles,  
had a background in promotion and public relations when, as 
president of the Phillies, he put together an investment group that 
bought the team in October 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was in charge, the Phillies had only four winning  
seasons. In two of them, however, they went to the World Series. 
Giles played a major role in building the team that won the World 
Series in 1980, including convincing former owner Ruly Carpenter to 
hire free agent Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is moving in the right direction,'' he said. ``And  
so am I.''

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Returning NHL to Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A billboard hovering above a downtown freeway has  
been in a countdown mode. On Saturday, it will stop at ``0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 19 years, the wait for the NHL to return to Atlanta is  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	The city that originally brought the ice age to the Deep South  
is back in the game. The Atlanta Thrashers, taking over what the 
Flames left behind in 1980, make their debut against the New Jersey 
Devils before a sellout crowd of 18,559 at the $213 million Philips 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to do well and make it a memorable night,''  
center Ray Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Flames moved to Calgary, the city went more than a  
decade without a team. The minor-league Knights rekindled interest 
when they were launched in 1992, winning the IHL championship and 
playing before several sellout crowds at the old Omni. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knights left, too, when it became apparent the city was  
moving toward bigger and better things. The Omni was torn down to 
make way for the new arena, and Atlanta was awarded an expansion 
franchise along with three other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville Predators started play last season, while the  
Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets will enter the league in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``First-year teams are a lot of fun -- especially if things are  
going well on the ice,'' said left wing Denny Lambert, part of a 
Predators team that surprisingly won 28 games last season. 
``There's no pressure on you. No one expects you to win any games. 
But if you do win, everyone jumps on the bandwagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bandwagon already is crowded. The Thrashers have about  
13,000 season ticket holders and have sold out their first three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been so long since the Flames were here,'' Lambert said.  
``These people have been waiting for hockey to return. You can tell 
already that they want to be a part of this team. They're eager to 
learn the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On opening night, the team plans to close off an adjacent street  
and set up ``Thrasherville,'' a collection of games and interactive 
exhibits for early-arriving fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were secretive about some elements of the pregame  
festivities, such as who will sing the national anthem and take 
part in the ceremonial puck drop. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the players, they tried to maintain as much normality as  
possible with all the excitement swirling around them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to make it too big a deal,'' Ferraro said.  
``You might end up tightening yourself up and not play as well as 
you should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie coach Curt Fraser also figures to be nervous.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly going to be a lot of distractions,'' he  
said. ``I want to find something for us to do so we don't have to 
think about that. A lot of these guys have been through it. They 
can help me with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of those players are Lambert and left wing Andrew Brunette.  
</P>
<P>
	Teammates a year ago in Nashville, they are going through the  
expansion process all over again with the Thrashers, who acquired 
them in separate trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, there was a little regret when I left Nashville,''  
said Brunette, doing his part to fit in with his new city by 
wearing an Atlanta Braves cap after a recent practice. ``I thought 
I would be there a long time. Now, hopefully, I'll be here a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with all expansion teams, the Thrashers are desperately short  
on scorers. With a roster that includes no one with more than 13 
NHL goals last season, the team was shut out in its final two 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to natural goal scorers, there's probably only  
10 in the league,'' said Ferraro, one of the players who must score 
about 20 goals for the Thrashers to be successful. ``We don't have 
a Brett Hull who can bury goals on the power play. We don't have a 
(Joe) Sakic or a (Peter) Forsberg. Then again, a lot of other teams 
don't, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers will play an aggressive, forechecking style,  
hoping to outwork their opponents and create scoring chances off 
turnovers. But, as the preseason showed, there aren't many players 
outside of Ferraro, Nelson Emerson and top draft pick Patrik Stefan 
who look comfortable with the puck on their stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're producing a lot of chances,'' Fraser said. ``We've got  
to work on finishing around the net.''

<HEADLINE> French Food Agency: Avoid Brit Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's food safety agency recommended today that  
a ban on imports of British beef remain in place, saying the meat 
may still be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts at the French Food Safety Agency deemed that British  
beef, which has been linked to what is commonly called ``mad cow 
disease,'' still presents health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the ``current scientific understanding and epidemological  
data available, the risk of Britain exporting contaminated beef can 
still not be considered completely controlled,'' said a statement 
by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission warned France it could face legal action  
if it ignored an EU decision to lift the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the French authorities take this report as a pretext not to  
lift the ban on UK exports of beef, the Commisssion would be 
obliged to consider to take the necessary infringement 
proceedings,'' EU Health and Consumer Protection Commission David 
Byrne said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne said a first look at the French agency's report appeared  
to have ``no information that has not already been examined'' by EU 
scientists who approved the lifting of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grounds for the decision to lift the ban were taken on  
sound scientific advice and on the basis of strict safeguards,'' 
Byrne said. ``They are designed to ensure that UK beef exports are 
safe and pose not threat to public health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British conservatives were outraged by the French decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``France's continued ban on British beef infringes EU treaty  
obligations and contravenes the principle of free movement of 
goods,'' said Chris Heaton-Harris of the Conservative group in the 
EU assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the group called on the European Commission to  
immediately start legal actions against France. If the EU executive 
body failed to act, the Conservatives said British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair should ``not hesitate to take France to the European 
Court of Justice'' over the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission banned exports of British beef three  
years ago after evidence emerged linking British beef to bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy, or ``mad cow disease,'' that can develop 
into a new strain of the fatal human brain ailment, 
Creutzfeldt-Jacob.

<HEADLINE>  E.Timor Peacekeepers on the Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- International peacekeepers ventured deep  
into hostile territory today near the border of West Timor, where 
thousands of militia fighters reportedly have assembled. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Australian defense officials say there are indications  
that 2,000 to 4,000 pro-Indonesian militias in West Timor may be 
preparing to begin guerrilla raids on the peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers from the U.N.-approved force known as Interfet were  
flown by helicopter to Balibo, the closest town in East Timor to 
the West Timorese city of Atambua, which has become headquarters 
for the militias who ravaged the territory after its people voted 
to break away from Indonesia on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atambua, militia leader Joao da Silva Tavares said he planned  
to lead 12,000 fighters back into East Timor on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interfet doesn't have any right to kick me out of the land  
where I was born,'' Tavares said. ``If the Interfet dares to 
threaten us, we will attack them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a spokesman for the force, Lt. Col. Mark Kelly, said  
the peacekeepers had no intention of crossing the border with West 
Timor even if they encounter militia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are conscious of our mandate. It stops in East Timor,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks seemed to differ with the position voiced Thursday  
by Australian Defense Minister John Moore, who said the 
multinational force had the right to cross into West Timor if it 
was engaged in battle, but that it had to withdraw as soon as any 
conflict ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi called Moore's statement  
``very arrogant.'' He said that if Australian troops crossed into 
Indonesian territory, ``we have to review our diplomatic relations 
with Australia. We have to be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, meeting with officials in  
Thailand, also said today that peacekeepers should be able to 
venture into West Timor in case of cross-border attacks by 
militias. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most important aspects of peacekeeping is that  
there should be adequate force protection,'' Cohen said. The 
Australian-led force has the right to be ``aggressive in reaction 
to any attacks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra said  
Thailand did not agree. ``Indonesia's sovereignty must be 
respected,'' he told The Associated Press after meeting with Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, elite Nepalese Gurkha troops today disarmed five  
guerrillas of Falintil, the pro-independence group that led the 
resistance in East Timor after Indonesia invaded the former 
Portuguese colony in 1975. In Dili, Australian soldiers disarmed 
and detained two Falantil members. 
</P>
<P>
	Falintil has volunteered to work with the international force  
and even conduct joint patrols. But the force, under its 
U.N.-approved mandate, is instructed to seize weapons found outside 
the designated bases of any group. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, a newly formed National Commission of Human Rights in  
East Timor began its work today, urging the international community 
to speed up the investigation of atrocities in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tragedy was not random. It was a well-planned and  
systematic operation,'' said Maria Domingus Fernades Albes, a 
member of the new body. 
</P>
<P>
	She accused Indonesia of running ``concentration camps'' in West  
Timor, where up to 200,000 East Timorese either fled or were 
forcibly taken after the vote for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency is preparing to airlift relief supplies  
to East Timorese living ``in appalling conditions'' in West Timor, 
spokesman Kris Janowski said today. The U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees also is drawing up plans to start flying refugees back to 
East Timor if they want to return, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, the former  
guerrilla commander who is widely expected to become independent 
East Timor's first elected president, arrived in Portugal today in 
search of international help to rebuild his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portuguese government has donated more than $4 million in  
humanitarian assistance to its former colony since the ballot was 
held and East Timor plunged into anarchy.

	In Atambua, militia leader Joao da Silva Tavares said he planned  
to lead 12,000 fighters back into East Timor on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interfet doesn't have any right to kick me out of the land  
where I was born,'' Tavares said. ``If the Interfet dares to 
threaten us, we will attack them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a spokesman for the force, Lt. Col. Mark Kelly, said  
the peacekeepers had no intention of crossing the border with West 
Timor even if they encounter militia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are conscious of our mandate. It stops in East Timor,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks seemed to differ with the position voiced Thursday  
by Australian Defense Minister John Moore, who said the 
multinational force had the right to cross into West Timor if it 
was engaged in battle, but that it had to withdraw as soon as any 
conflict ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi called Moore's statement  
``very arrogant.'' He said that if Australian troops crossed into 
Indonesian territory, ``we have to review our diplomatic relations 
with Australia. We have to be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, meeting with officials in  
Thailand, also said today that peacekeepers should be able to 
venture into West Timor in case of cross-border attacks by 
militias. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most important aspects of peacekeeping is that  
there should be adequate force protection,'' Cohen said. The 
Australian-led force has the right to be ``aggressive in reaction 
to any attacks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra said  
Thailand did not agree. ``Indonesia's sovereignty must be 
respected,'' he told The Associated Press after meeting with Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, elite Nepalese Gurkha troops today disarmed five  
guerrillas of Falintil, the pro-independence group that led the 
resistance in East Timor after Indonesia invaded the former 
Portuguese colony in 1975. In Dili, Australian soldiers disarmed 
and detained two Falantil members. 
</P>
<P>
	Falintil has volunteered to work with the international force  
and even conduct joint patrols. But the force, under its 
U.N.-approved mandate, is instructed to seize weapons found outside 
the designated bases of any group. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, a newly formed National Commission of Human Rights in  
East Timor began its work today, urging the international community 
to speed up the investigation of atrocities in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tragedy was not random. It was a well-planned and  
systematic operation,'' said Maria Domingus Fernades Albes, a 
member of the new body. 
</P>
<P>
	She accused Indonesia of running ``concentration camps'' in West  
Timor, where up to 200,000 East Timorese either fled or were 
forcibly taken after the vote for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency is preparing to airlift relief supplies  
to East Timorese living ``in appalling conditions'' in West Timor, 
spokesman Kris Janowski said today. The U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees also is drawing up plans to start flying refugees back to 
East Timor if they want to return, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, the former  
guerrilla commander who is widely expected to become independent 
East Timor's first elected president, arrived in Portugal today in 
search of international help to rebuild his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portuguese government has donated more than $4 million in  
humanitarian assistance to its former colony since the ballot was 
held and East Timor plunged into anarchy.

<HEADLINE> Pope Honors 3 European Women Saints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Seeking to raise the profile of his church  
in Europe, Pope John Paul II on Friday honored three women saints, 
including Edith Stein, the Jewish-born nun killed at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
	He proclaimed Stein and 14th century Saints Brigid of Sweden and  
Catherine of Siena as ``co-patronesses of the European continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three are ``linked in a special way to the history of the  
continent,'' John Paul said, calling Stein ``the symbol of the 
dramas of Europe this century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul spoke at a special Mass in St. Peter's Basilica that  
opened a three-week meeting of European bishops, part of his 
efforts to prepare his church for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe already has three male patron saints, Benedict of Norcia  
and brothers Cyril and Methodius, known as the apostles of the 
Slavs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish to include the same number of feminine saints, in order  
to highlight the important role that women had and still have in 
the ecclesiastical and lay history of the continent up to our 
day,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that Europeans of all faiths who are ``sincerely  
committed to the search for truth and common good'' can take 
inspiration from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein, born into an Orthodox Jewish German family, was an  
atheist when she joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1922 and later 
became a Carmelite nun. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, Adolf Hitler's regime ordered all the converts in the  
Netherlands shipped to Auschwitz to punish the Dutch bishops for 
speaking out against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Her canonization last October drew protests from some Jews, who  
felt the Catholic church was laying claim to a martyr who died 
because of her Jewish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	The 79-year-old pope appeared tired and his voice was weak  
during the two-hour Mass. Recalling the various conflicts that have 
``bloodied the regions of Europe'' through he centuries, he 
lamented that the enthusiasm following the fall of communism a 
decade ago ``seems to have rapidly diminished'' because of 
``political and economic egotism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Synod of Bishops, as the meeting is formally called, is  
intended to find ways of strengthening the church in Europe.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns of Certain Dog Chews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dog owners should wash their hands after  
giving their pets certain dog chews, particularly those made of pig 
ears, because the popular pet treats may be contaminated with 
salmonella, the government warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 30 people in Canada are suffering infection with  
Salmonella infantis linked to dog chews made from pork- or 
beef-derived materials, including pig ears, beef jerky and pigskin, 
health authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella is not considered a risk for the dogs, but people can  
become infected easily if they touch something that carries the 
bacterium and then touch their mouths or their own food. In healthy 
people, Salmonella causes flulike symptoms, including vomiting, 
abdominal pain and diarrhea, but it can cause life-threatening 
illness in people with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	No Americans are known to be sick, but there is no way to know  
if contaminated dog chews already were imported. 
</P>
<P>
	So the U.S. Food and Drug Administration urged American pet  
owners to handle dog chews very carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who touches one should wash their hands with hot water  
and soap and watch children to ensure they do not put the pet treat 
into their mouths. Elderly people, young children and people with 
weakened immune systems are particularly at risk from salmonella 
and should avoid any contact with these chews, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said Friday it will detain imports of pig ears to test  
for salmonella, and will examine U.S. manufacturing of dog chews.

<HEADLINE> PGA Head Doesn't Regret Celebration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- The head of the PGA of America  
is not faulting American team members for their much-maligned burst 
of enthusiasm on the 17th green of last weekend's Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he says the players and wives who mobbed Justin Leonard  
after he sank a 45-foot putt were simply showing the kind of 
emotion so lacking in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come to expect our players to walk around likhey're  
carrying a briefcase,'' Jim Awtrey, CEO of the PGA of America, 
which runs the international competition, said Thursday. ``We saw 
they're human and they get excited. We had 12 Sergios (Garcia) out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Awtrey said, though, that he did regret the celebration took  
place before Spaniard Jose Maria Olabal had a chance at a 25-foot 
putt that could have kept his match with Leona alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame the celebration on 17 didn't occur after Jose's  
putt,'' Awtrey said. ``But I don't think -- and I was there -- it had 
anything to do with the outcome of the match. To let something as 
small as that overshadow what the Ryder Cup is all about, I don't 
think it's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Awtrey agreed that American fans need to be stopped  
from heckling players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have low tolerance with fans who cross the ne. People  
were taken out of the stands, I don't knw how many, but that's 
pbably what we'll have to do more of.''

<HEADLINE> Teacher Sued Over Retirement Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts is suing a retired Cape Cod teacher  
who was overpaid $814,950 in retirement benefits and never offered 
to give the money back, the state attorney general said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The overpayments to Joan L. Phillips, 74, were discovered two  
months ago after an audit of the Massachusetts Teachers Retirement 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over nine years, the state overpaid Mrs. Phillips hundreds of  
thousands of dollars she should not have accepted. It is a loss of 
the public's money,'' Attorney General Thomas Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Phillips, reached at her home Friday, said: ``There have  
been accusations made and I don't think I have to stand it. I 
really have nothing to say. I'm just so confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Phillips, who retired in 1980, was receiving $754 a month  
in benefits until 1990, when her check bumped up incorrectly to 
$8,394, the attorney general said. Records show that over the 
nine-year period, Phillips received $905,486, nearly ten times the 
amount she was due.

<HEADLINE> Ex-L.A. Dodger Guerrero Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pedro Guerrero, who had three 30-homer seasons for  
the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1980s, has been arrested for trying 
to buy cocaine from undercover Drug Enforcement Administration 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero, one of three co-MVPs of the 1981 World Series, was  
arrested at his Miami home Thursday night, DEA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two of our undercover guys had their trading cards autographed  
by him,'' DEA spokesman Brent Eaton said Friday. ``He was telling 
us that he was playing golf with O.J. (Simpson) recently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit filed by DEA agent Robert Tilley, the  
44-year-old Guerrero's arrest came after a two-month investigation 
focused on his nephew, Adan ``Tony'' Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz and Guerrero met with DEA informants and undercover agents  
Wednesday at a Miami restaurant, according to the affidavit. During 
the tape-recorded meeting, Cruz said he wanted to purchase an 
unspecified quantity of cocaine. Guerrero said he would be 
``responsible'' for 15 kilograms, or 33 pounds, of the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero indicated the transaction should take place at his  
home, in an upscale golf neighborhood just west of Miami, Eaton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	DEA agents received $70,000 as a down payment, and Guerrero  
assured them by phone that he was good for the balance, Eaton said. 
The going price for a kilogram of cocaine in Miami is about 
$16,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was arrested Thursday around 8:15 p.m. when undercover  
agents delivered the sham cocaine to him at a supermarket near 
Guerrero's house. Guerrero and an associate of Cruz's, Lary 
Mercedes, were then arrested at the former ballplayer's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not that big a case,'' Eaton said, noting that DEA  
agents had seized nearly 700 kilograms of cocaine in an unrelated 
bust on Friday. A father and son were arrested in that unrelated 
case in neighboring Broward County. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said Guerrero's bond was set at $100,000. As agents left  
him Friday afternoon, he was making arrangements to put his house 
up as equity so he could be released on bond, Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Guerrero, whose phone was  
busy Friday evening during repeated attempts to reach him. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero, a native of the Dominican Republic who played the  
outfield, first base and third base, hit 215 home runs in his 
15-year career. He also played for St. Louis, retiring from the 
Cardinals after the 1992 season.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Department Closed By Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fire Friday at the Commerce Department sent  
48 people, including 16 firefighters and emergency medical 
technicians, to the hospital to be treated for possible exposure to 
PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
	A transformer that used PCBs as a coolant caught fire about 6  
a.m., filling sections of Commerce building with smoke and PCB 
levels above the acceptable 50 parts per million, said D.C. Fire 
Chief Don Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley said the sprawling building a  
block from the White House would remain closed through the weekend 
``while experts analyze the level of contamination in the material 
that was removed from the building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least two people, both Commerce Department workers, were  
directly contaminated with PCBs, said Dr. Anthony MacIntyre, an 
emergency room physician at George Washington University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	One was sprayed with liquid from the transformer and the other  
took in heavy smoke from the fire. Everyone was released within two 
hours, except the man exposed to smoke. He was being kept for 
observation after complaining of dizziness, Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he was ``relieved'' that the fire was  
``extinguished quickly and apparently without any serious 
injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of PCB exposure include skin irritation, swollen eyes  
and upper respiratory problems. Long-term effects can include liver 
damage and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be five years, 10 years from now,'' said firefighter  
Rudolph Blyther said, one of those taken to the hospital. When 
asked if he's concerned, he said, ``You know I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no direct test to determine PCB contamination but  
results from blood tests should determine others who inhaled lots 
of smoke, which could indicate PCB contamination, MacIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exposure, if any, was minimal,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began as workers in the basement of the Commerce  
Department building heard a crash in an adjacent room, said Stephen 
Reid, a battalion chief with the District of Columbia Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered the fire and doused most of the blaze with  
extinguishers by the time firefighters arrived, Reid said. 
Approximately 400 employees were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	All 48 people, including 32 Commerce Department employees or  
contractors, considered at risk of exposure were ``decontaminated'' 
-- given showers and clean, yellow suits in a courtyard in the 
center of the Commerce building. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hospital, they bathed with soap and water in special  
decontamination showers and were tested for symptoms, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Widespread use of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, in  
transformers was phased out in the 1980s. In December, the 
Environmental Protection Agency began requiring that all facilities 
still using PCB transformers be registered. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley defended as ``absolutely necessary'' the decision to close  
the building, along with the National Aquarium inside it, all day 
Friday and through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	If the fire had occurred later in the day, some 3,700 people  
would have been in the building, Daley said.

<HEADLINE>  Thompson, McHale Get to Hoops Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Little ever came easy for John  
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	His outspoken views on minority access challenged the basketball  
world. His unrelenting high standards sometimes frustrated his 
friends. He even repeated sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was perhaps no shock that it took the retired Georgetown  
coach three tries to make the Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind saying what I don't want and what I don't like,''  
Thompson said today at a news conference. ``And I don't mind saying 
what I want and what I like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he was pleased to be entering the Hall of Fame  
tonight with Boston Celtics star Kevin McHale, Cleveland Cavaliers 
executive Wayne Embry, women's college coach Billie Moore, and the 
late NBA pioneer and owner Fred Zollner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear all these things: Hard guy, tough guy,'' McHale said,  
gesturing toward Thompson. ``Not the guy I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought that he was arrogant. I never thought that he  
was difficult. He challenged you,'' said Georgetown coach Craig 
Esherick, who played for Thompson and later served as his 
assistant. Then he added, ``There were some days I left the court 
as a player not thinking good thoughts about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big man with a husky voice and booming laugh, Thompson turned  
into a national fixture in his 27 seasons at Georgetown. Stalking 
courtside with a towel habitually draped over his shoulder, he 
watched his teams make 24 straight postseason appearances and three 
NCAA Final Fours. When his team won the national championship in 
1984, he became the first black coach with that title. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet colleagues say Thompson always demanded that his players be  
their best both on court and in class. ``He was a tremendously 
demanding educator,'' said Bill Shapland, a 15-year staffer. ``He 
was not interested in giving you a lot of excuses or wiggle room 
for not being the best you can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also made demands of the basketball world, pushing for  
more and better chances for minorities. He endured racial taunts 
when he first fielded a predominantly black team at Georgetown. He 
later boycotted two games in 1989 to protest NCAA Proposition 42, 
saying its financial limits hurt minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale, who formed a formidable frontcourt with Larry Bird and  
Robert Parish, also set high standards, but mainly for himself. In 
the 1987 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, McHale's right 
foot was so badly hurt that he was said to use a patio chair as a 
walker when he was off court. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that pain, we don't want you to play,'' his coach,  
K.C. Jones, recalls telling him. ``He said, `I'm doing this!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics lost in six games anyway, and McHale underwent  
surgery. He was hobbled by foot and ankle injuries until retiring 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But during 13 seasons with Boston, McHale played on championship  
teams in 1981, 1984 and 1986. ``He was a winner. We both had the 
same desire to win,'' said Bird, who now coaches the Indiana 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Minnesota boy with an easygoing exterior, McHale grew to a  
long-limbed 6-foot-10. He came to Boston in 1980 as the sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
	``McHale was a big, gangly kid who looked like a stand-in for  
the Frankenstein monster when he first showed up. But he had this 
indomitable will to win,'' said Tom Heinsohn, a former Celtics 
player and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale added a jump hook and fadeaway jumper to his expanding  
offensive repertoire. ``Those two shots were almost unstoppable,'' 
Parish said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale eventually transformed himself into one of the league's  
most feared offensive threats, averaging 55 percent from the floor 
during his career.

<HEADLINE> McCartney Inspired by Ga. Pharmacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- When Paul McCartney visited Atlanta earlier this  
year, he discovered a pharmacy filled with bath salts, incense, 
candles -- and the title song for his new album. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking in the shop window and I saw this bottle of bath  
salts called `Run Devil Run,''' McCartney said in a statement 
accompanying the album. ``I thought it was a good title for a song. 
So when I was on holiday after that, I started thinking of words 
for it and it came quite easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney was in Atlanta in January to see daughter Heather  
unveil her line of household creations at a trade show. He spotted 
Miller's Rexall Drugs store while he and son James, 21, walked 
around downtown. James had said he wanted to visit the ``funky'' 
side of downtown, McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The album hits stores Tuesday. The store is pictured on the  
album cover, but the name ``Miller's'' on the sign has been changed 
to ``Earl's.''

<HEADLINE>  Thompson, McHale Get to Hoops Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Little ever came easy for John  
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	His outspoken views on minority access challenged the basketball  
world. His unrelenting high standards sometimes frustrated his 
friends. He even repeated sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was perhaps no shock that it took the retired Georgetown  
coach three tries to make the Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind saying what I don't want and what I don't like,''  
Thompson said today at a news conference. ``And I don't mind saying 
what I want and what I like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he was pleased to be entering the Hall of Fame  
tonight with Boston Celtics star Kevin McHale, Cleveland Cavaliers 
executive Wayne Embry, women's college coach Billie Moore, and the 
late NBA pioneer and owner Fred Zollner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear all these things: Hard guy, tough guy,'' McHale said,  
gesturing toward Thompson. ``Not the guy I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought that he was arrogant. I never thought that he  
was difficult. He challenged you,'' said Georgetown coach Craig 
Esherick, who played for Thompson and later served as his 
assistant. Then he added, ``There were some days I left the court 
as a player not thinking good thoughts about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big man with a husky voice and booming laugh, Thompson turned  
into a national fixture in his 27 seasons at Georgetown. Stalking 
courtside with a towel habitually draped over his shoulder, he 
watched his teams make 24 straight postseason appearances and three 
NCAA Final Fours. When his team won the national championship in 
1984, he became the first black coach with that title. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet colleagues say Thompson always demanded that his players be  
their best both on court and in class. ``He was a tremendously 
demanding educator,'' said Bill Shapland, a 15-year staffer. ``He 
was not interested in giving you a lot of excuses or wiggle room 
for not being the best you can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also made demands of the basketball world, pushing for  
more and better chances for minorities. He endured racial taunts 
when he first fielded a predominantly black team at Georgetown. He 
later boycotted two games in 1989 to protest NCAA Proposition 42, 
saying its financial limits hurt minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale, who formed a formidable frontcourt with Larry Bird and  
Robert Parish, also set high standards, but mainly for himself. In 
the 1987 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, McHale's right 
foot was so badly hurt that he was said to use a patio chair as a 
walker when he was off court. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that pain, we don't want you to play,'' his coach,  
K.C. Jones, recalls telling him. ``He said, `I'm doing this!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics lost in six games anyway, and McHale underwent  
surgery. He was hobbled by foot and ankle injuries until retiring 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But during 13 seasons with Boston, McHale played on championship  
teams in 1981, 1984 and 1986. ``He was a winner. We both had the 
same desire to win,'' said Bird, who now coaches the Indiana 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Minnesota boy with an easygoing exterior, McHale grew to a  
long-limbed 6-foot-10. He came to Boston in 1980 as the sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
	``McHale was a big, gangly kid who looked like a stand-in for  
the Frankenstein monster when he first showed up. But he had this 
indomitable will to win,'' said Tom Heinsohn, a former Celtics 
player and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale added a jump hook and fadeaway jumper to his expanding  
offensive repertoire. ``Those two shots were almost unstoppable,'' 
Parish said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale eventually transformed himself into one of the league's  
most feared offensive threats, averaging 55 percent from the floor 
during his career.

	Thailand Negotiates With Hostage-Takers  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai authorities continued to negotiate  
Friday night with a dozen armed Myanmar dissidents who took over 
their country's embassy in Bangkok at gunpoint and seized about 30 
hostages. One hostage-taker, who claims to be a student, said early 
Saturday morning that he and the others distrusted the Thai 
government, and if a helicopter was not provided, they would ``have 
to do something,'' which could include killing hostages. He did not 
say there was an explicit threat to kill Myanmar hostages every 
half-hour if the aircraft didn't come, as some of his comrades had 
been quoted saying. The dissidents demanded the release of 
political prisoners and the convening of an elected parliament.

	GOP Backs Off Benefits Slowdown  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders backed away today  
from their plan to slow income-support payments to working poor 
people. Though not yet jettisoning the proposal, lawmakers and 
aides acknowledged they were looking for other ways to raise the 
$8.7 billion that they had expected the plan to save in the budget 
for fiscal 2000, which began today. Sen. John McCain joined George 
W. Bush as the second Republican presidential contender criticizing 
the idea. And House GOP moderates and Senate Republicans predicted 
the plan's demise.

	HUD Awards Vouchers to Working Poor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting dollars behind the effort to guide  
welfare recipients to employment, the government awarded $280 
million in vouchers designed to help about 50,000 families across 
the country. This initial distribution of the welfare-to-work 
vouchers by the Department of Housing and Urban Development will 
subsidize rents of low-income families receiving welfare or 
recently off welfare to enable them to rent apartments near 
available jobs, child care and transportation.

	Russia Renounces Chechen Parliament  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian government announced Friday  
that it no longer recognizes the democratically elected parliament 
of Chechnya. The military said its forces would establish a 
security zone in the breakaway republic, as jets continued to bomb 
targets across Chechnya, sending more than 88,000 civilians fleeing 
to neighboring regions. The statement underlined Russia's 
increasingly tough stance on Chechnya, clouding prospects for talks 
on preventing the conflict from escalating into an all-out war.

	March Toward Milosevic Home Halted  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Entering their third night of a  
showdown with Serbian authorities Friday, protesters were prevented 
from heading toward the home of President Slobodan Milosevic as 
riot police sealed off part of the capital. The leaders of street 
protests said they would increase pressure on Milosevic despite 
police beatings and arrests of opposition activists. The opposition 
blames Milosevic for a decade of economic misery, aggravated by his 
defiance of NATO that led to prolonged bombing and the de facto 
loss of the Serbian province of Kosovo.

	Medicare To Pay for Low-Fat Diet  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare will pay for up to 1,800 elderly  
Americans with severe heart disease to try Dr. Dean Ornish's famous 
but radical ultra low-fat diet, to see if it could be an 
alternative to heart surgery. Under the pilot project, Medicare 
patients who have been told they will soon need bypass surgery or 
an angioplasty to clear clogged heart arteries can instead try the 
intensive diet-and-lifestyle program.

	Big Tuna Stirring Dangerous Hunts  
</P>
<P>
	CHATHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Big tuna are so plentiful off Cape Cod  
this year that inexperienced, weekend fishermen are taking to the 
seas -- and getting in over their heads. At least three vessels have 
capsized in the past week, two of them because the fish were too 
big for the boats. Fisheries officials are not sure exactly why 
there is an abundance of tuna this year.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed their slide today after new  
reports showed that the economy's surging growth has not slowed in 
recent months. The data renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates next week. The Dow industrials closed 
down 63.95 at 10,273.00 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.31 to 
2,736.85.

99 jersey to the ceiling of the rink where he helped the Oilers win 
four Stanley Cups. The rink already has a bronze statue of him in 
front.

<HEADLINE> Case Raises Murder, Mercy Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD CAVERNS NATIONAL PARK, N.M. (AP) -- The young man opened  
the spiral notebook and started writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed and buried my best friend today ...''  
</P>
<P>
	He was at the bottom of a canyon in the Chihuahuan Desert, on a  
bed of white rocks the size of a helicopter pad. 
</P>
<P>
	``David had been in pain all night. At around 5 or 6 he turned  
to me &AMP; begged that I put my knife through his chest. I did, &AMP; a 
second time when he wouldn't die ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he wrote, the Guadalupe Mountains towered above him. The  
chirrup of grasshoppers and crickets echoed across cacti and 
juniper. The only other sound was the occasional hum of a passing 
jet -- a sign, however distant, of civilization. It was Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still breathed &AMP; spoke so I told him that I was going to  
cover his face. He said OK ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mercury was already nearing 95, though the reflection of  
heat off the rocks could push the temperature past 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``He struggled but died ...''  
</P>
<P>
	The rocks were all around the campsite, and he formed them into  
a pile 7 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I buried him w/ love ...  
</P>
<P>
	``God &AMP; his family &AMP; mine,'' the man finished, ``please forgive  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	That Raffi Kodikian took the life of David Coughlin that day in  
Carlsbad Caverns National Park, plunging a 4-inch folding knife 
twice into his chest, is undisputed. He confessed to a park ranger 
and in the journal authorities found at the scene, containing 
entries purportedly made by both men during their ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains in question is whether it was a mercy killing -- one  
final act of devotion and desperation between best friends -- or 
something else entirely. The answer could determine whether 
Kodikian spends the rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, 25, of Boston, is charged with first-degree murder in  
the slaying of Coughlin, 26, of Millis, Mass. He remains at his 
parents' home in Doylestown, Pa., on $50,000 cash bond until trial, 
set for Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Coughlin begged Kodikian to kill him, the slaying still  
is considered murder, authorities say. But they have doubts about 
Kodikian's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I might die trying to carry him out, drag him out,  
walk out to find help and bring it back,'' says Eddy County Sheriff 
M.A. ``Chunky'' Click. ``But I don't think I could kill my best 
buddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	They arrived at the park the afternoon of Aug. 4.  
</P>
<P>
	They had been on the road several days, headed from  
Massachusetts to California, where Coughlin intended to pursue a 
master's degree in environmental science at the University of 
California at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin had planned to travel alone but delayed the trip so  
Kodikian, his best friend since undergrad, could join him. 
Coughlin's co-workers at the Town Hall in Wellesley, Mass., where 
he researched transportation issues, were relieved his friend had 
decided to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very happy for that,'' says co-worker Sandy Hobson.  
``Raffi was a great guy; David wouldn't have been friends with him 
if he wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An added benefit: Kodikian, who worked at a Boston investment  
firm, had experience jaunting cross-country. Two years earlier he 
spent 10 weeks traveling through 25 states, camping out for most of 
the trip. He chronicled the journey in a freelance series for The 
Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had traveled through deserts, grasslands, mountains,  
prairies, swamps, rain, and a sandstorm,'' Kodikian wrote. ``My 
trip has been caked on my tires, dripped on my boots, and seared 
into my memory as one of the greatest experiences I could have 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	``And God willing, I'll get the chance to do it again.''  
</P>
<P>
	They pulled up to the visitors center around 3 p.m. Coughlin's  
uncle had suggested they stop at the park, known for its 
underground caverns inhabited by thousands of Mexican Freetail 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
	But Coughlin and Kodikian didn't have much time to explore. They  
picked up an overnight camping permit, listening patiently as the 
desk attendant reviewed regulations and recommended they carry 1 
gallon of water per person per day. Then they drove about a mile to 
the trailhead for Rattlesnake Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gear in tow, they headed down the footpath, carefully  
negotiating its twists and turns as they descended deep into the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``HELP''   	
</P>
<P>
	``We filled out a back country card on Wed afternoon/evening &AMP;  
headed down. Camped Wed, started back on Thursday morning but 
couldn't find the entrance to the trail leading to the car. ... 
We've got minimal water &AMP; have been eating cactus fruit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to journal entries released by Kodikian's lawyer, Gary  
Mitchell, Coughlin and Kodikian had run out of water by Friday. The 
words in the notebook grew cryptic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not let the buzzards get us alive,'' read one passage.  
``God forgive us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another page contained a letter addressed to Sonnet Frost,  
Coughlin's girlfriend. It was signed ``David Andrew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in utter agony and I know you would understand. ... I  
have barely eaten &AMP; drank since Wed. evening. Nobody is going to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell says Coughlin became violently ill, vomiting day and  
night. Kodikian also was sick, he says, though not as ill as his 
friend. They hastily scribbled out wills, Mitchell says, and 
prepared to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both boys couldn't stand what was about to happen to them --  
that is, a slow death -- and one friend did what his other friend 
requested and ended it,'' Mitchell says. ``There wasn't any malice 
or evil, just your best buddy doing what your other best buddy 
requested and begged for, because they thought it was the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At about 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 8, Park Ranger Lance Mattson stood  
alongside a maroon Mazda with Massachusetts plates, scanning the 
vast canyon below. The camping permit assigned to the vehicle had 
been issued to two men four days earlier for a one-night stay. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't unusual for campers to remain an extra night, or even  
two, but these guys were way overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wanna go look for some lost hikers?'' he asked the park  
volunteer who had alerted him to the car, before setting off past 
the post marked ``Rattlesnake Canyon Trail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mattson worked his way across the mountainside to the top of a  
ridge and spotted the campsite immediately, although he saw no 
campers. He began the 670-foot descent. As Mattson approached the 
campsite, a man rolled out from under a tent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please tell me you have water,'' Raffi Kodikian gasped.  
</P>
<P>
	Dirty and unshaven, he wore only a pair of shorts. Scrapes  
crisscrossed his arms and legs, wounds typical of hiking through 
the back country brush. The ranger quickly passed him a bottle. The 
young man gulped ferociously before vomiting -- a sign of 
dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just wet your lips,'' Mattson advised as he looked for the  
other camper. ``Where's your buddy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Over there,'' he responded, gesturing toward the canyons  
beyond. But Mattson didn't see anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Right there,'' Kodikian insisted, this time pointing to the  
mound of rocks just a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed him.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Mattson says when he first arrived on the scene, the situation  
appeared desperate. He saw three empty water bottles -- just 3 
quarts between the two men. Someone had lugged heavy rocks into the 
pattern of an SOS, although the last S was unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of their gear -- a blue sleeping pad, a T-shirt, a sock --  
was smudged with blood, as were some rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kodikian, although dehydrated, could speak coherently and  
was fine within an hour of receiving a saline IV. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin's autopsy showed he was moderately to severely  
dehydrated, but his urine and blood levels were not deficient to 
the point of causing death, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very much alive when he was stabbed,'' says Sheriff  
Click. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also question how the pair could have gotten lost  
in the first place. Their campsite was only 240 feet from the 
trailhead, which is marked with rock cairns, and a mile from their 
car. Had they hiked to a higher point, they should have been able 
to see the trail or the visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
	They also wonder how Kodikian, if he was as weak and ill as his  
lawyer contends, could have buried his friend under rocks weighing 
up to 50 pounds. Another mystery is why one of the men's sleeping 
bags -- Coughlin's, authorities believe -- was burned in a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	And they note that the men still had provisions: an unopened,  
family-size can of beans, a hot-dog bun, even a first-aid kit were 
found at the campsite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep trying to put myself in their place, and it doesn't  
wash,'' says Ranger Mark Maciha, who arrived at the scene after 
Mattson. 
</P>
<P>
	But desert survival experts warn against trying to rationalize  
what might happen in such a situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start going into dehydration you start making very  
irrational decisions,'' says David Alloway, who teaches a desert 
survival workshop at Texas' Big Bend Ranch State Park. ``I've seen 
where people have done some silly things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin's family appears to be standing by Kodikian. At a  
memorial service, Coughlin's brother asked mourners to pray for 
Kodikian. Coughlin's father, reached at home, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least one man who knew Coughlin wonders how Kodikian  
could kill the man he called best friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worst case scenario: If David did get to the point that he  
thought it was all over, it was up to Raffi to say, `No, we're 
going to get out of here. Hang in there,''' says Wellesley Deputy 
Police Chief Terry M. Cunningham, who worked with Coughlin at the 
Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd find me dead walking out of there, and I'd be carrying  
my buddy.''

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Discovery Shocks Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -- In this easygoing town best known as  
the site of Richard Nixon's Western White House, neighbors say 
Jerry Peacock seemed like the average neighbor, a school district 
groundskeeper whose biggest concern appeared to be paying for his 
duplex. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said he kept to himself. Brad Sewell, who lived next door,  
described Peacock as a ``smooth-talking salesman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said a search of Peacock's home turned up 80 weapons  
and 50,000 rounds of ammunition. The weapons included handguns, 
World War II-era carbines, assault rifles and machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The arsenal was found as authorities searched for missing school  
equipment -- rakes, buckets and cleaning supplies taken from the 
Capistrano Unified School District, 65 miles southeast of downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacock, 43, was arrested Wednesday and jailed on $1 million  
bail for investigation of receiving stolen property -- the school 
equipment. He was scheduled for arraignment today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never mentioned anything about selling a weapon, and I  
never saw a gun,'' Sewell said Thursday. ``I've been in his little 
apartment there, and I never, ever had a clue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were tracing the guns, and Peacock still could face  
possible weapons violation charges. His attorney in a previous 
civil lawsuit said the rifles are part of a family collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``His father started the gun collection a long time ago,''  
attorney Michelle Reinglass said in today's Orange County Register. 
``He's not a Columbine kind of guy. He's not a guy who is out of 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She did not return a telephone call late Thursday from The  
Associated Press. Columbine is a high school in Littleton, Colo., 
where 12 students and a teacher were slain in April by two student 
gunmen who killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo called Peacock's arrest a  
``good ending'' to a potentially deadly situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a disgruntled employee, you get the schools, you get  
the weapons, and you have the makings of a tragedy,'' Jaramillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent James Fleming said the district will ask school  
board officials to fire Peacock for the alleged thefts. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacock passed fingerprint and background checks when he was  
hired in 1993, Fleming said. He worked as needed at the district's 
41 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm personally horrified that someone who has daily contact in  
the vicinity of children and teachers owned the arsenal he 
apparently had,'' Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Peacock had been on disability since April and  
recently had knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacock sued the district several years ago, Fleming said,  
claiming that a male supervisor had sexually harassed him. Fleming 
said Peacock asked for at least $1 million but the district settled 
for much less. He didn't have the exact figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it has anything to do with the current  
situation. We regarded it as a nonsense lawsuit,'' Fleming said.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Fill Out Camp Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks signed free agents Ivano  
Newbill and Antonio Smith to non-guaranteed contracts Friday, 
filling out their training camp roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Newbill, a three-year veteran, last played in the NBA in 1997-98  
with Vancouver. The 6-foot-9 forward has averaged 1.5 points and 
2.6 rebounds over 134 career games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, an undrafted rookie from Michigan State, averaged 6.7  
points and 7.9 rebounds in college. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 250-pound Smith, a forward, was acquitted Thursday  
by a jury on charges of breaking a cooler lock and stealing a 
40-ounce beer from a convenience store in East Lansing, Mich. Smith 
was accused along with a former Michigan State teammate, Mateen 
Cleaves. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japanese Share Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The release of data showing a falling unemployment  
rate boosted Tokyo share prices today. The dollar gained against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 107.10  
points, or 0.61 percent, to close the day at 17,712.56. On 
Thursday, the average climbed 323.18 points, or 1.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.94 yen, up 0.28 yen from late Thursday in  
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 106.77 yen overnight. 
The dollar ranged between 105.30 yen and 106.37 yen in today's 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices jumped following news Japan's  
unemployment rate for August improved from the previous month. The 
better-than-expected data spurred further optimism over the 
country's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate fell to 4.7 percent from July's record high 4.9  
percent as more men found jobs, the government announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for men stood at 4.7 percent in August, down  
from the previous month's record-high 5.1 percent. The rate for 
women was unchanged in August at 4.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lingering worries by traders over an accident at a nuclear plant  
north of Tokyo on Thursday had little impact on the overall market, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	An accidental nuclear reaction at a uranium processing plant was  
contained early today, nearly a full day after a leak of 
radioactive gas seriously injured three workers and possibly 
contaminated 46 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials described the accident as the most serious ever at a  
nuclear facility in Japan but said that by today radiation levels 
outside the plant had returned to normal. They added they did not 
believe there was a serious threat to local residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility where the accident occurred is about 70 miles  
northeast of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Sumitomo Metal Mining, owner of the company that  
operates the facility, fell sharply. It closed down 94 cents, or 19 
percent, at $4.03. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
123.47 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,336.95. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 543 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 559.7 million shares 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners outnumbered advancers 654 to 585, while 101 issues  
remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 8.25 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,515.08. The 
TOPIX closed up 91 points, or 2.39 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders were largely focused on the Bank  
of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment, due out Monday. 
Traders also watched the central bank for further signs of a change 
in its monetary policy amid the yen's recent strength. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 113.44 yen, up from  
112.24 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6700 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7100 percent. Its 
price rose 0.35 points to 100.26.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Journalist To Get Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Immigration officials have recommended political  
asylum for a Chilean journalist who fled to Miami after her book on 
corruption in Chile's highest court was banned there. 
</P>
<P>
	Alejandra Matus, 33, author of ``The Black Book of Chilean  
Justice,'' will qualify for asylum after passing a background 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame for the Chilean government that this happened,''  
Ms. Matus said after being notified of the INS decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Matus' 340-page book describes abuse of power,  
influence-peddling and nepotism by members of Chile's Supreme 
Court. Many of its members were appointed during Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet's military regime from 1973-90. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chilean judge banned Ms. Matus' book and ordered her arrested  
last April under a 1950s law that makes it a crime to slander the 
South American country's president, cabinet ministers, legislators 
or judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the law has been used principally to silence  
journalists and politicians, about 26 of whom have been jailed 
since 1990, according to freedom-of-the-press organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	John D. Hopkins, chairman of the International Journalism  
Committee of the Society of Professional Journalists, called the 
asylum recommendation ``good news for journalists throughout the 
Americas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad reminder, though,'' he said, ``that there still  
are parts of the world where the cost to speak, publish or read the 
truth can be the loss of someone's beloved homeland.''

<HEADLINE> Probe Eyes Mental Hospital Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least 24 people died and 1,000 were injured  
or abused after being restrained or put into seclusion at mental 
health facilities in 1998, congressional investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual number of avoidable deaths and injuries probably is  
much higher, said the General Accounting Office, Congress's 
investigative arm. Only 15 states have reporting systems, it said, 
and most facilities are not required to report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The random use of restraints cited by the GAO suggests bad  
luck, more than medical science, determines which patients end up 
restrained, secluded or even dead,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, 
D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in the House and the Senate, following Hartford  
Courant investigative articles in Lieberman's home state, have 
introduced bills that would require better reporting, better 
training of mental health care workers and a doctor's authorization 
before a patient is restrained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate will hold hearings on the issue before Congress  
adjourns for the year, said Sen. William Roth, the Delaware 
Republican who chairs the Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to tell you that hospitals should be places of  
safety and healing,'' Roth said. The GAO report and the articles 
suggest an urgent need to ``rededicate ourselves to continued 
improvement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health experts generally agree that a patient must be  
restrained or put into seclusion on an emergency basis when he is a 
danger to himself or to others, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far less agreement exists about the use of restraint and  
seclusion in any other situation,'' such as punishment or staff 
convenience, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said 240,000 people require either inpatient treatment  
in mental hospitals or residential treatment in centers or group 
homes each year. About 120,000 people with mental retardation lived 
in intermediate care facilities and 240,000 others lived in smaller 
residential settings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	No federal regulations governed the use of restraint and  
seclusion in those facilities until July 1999, when the Health Care 
Financing Administration put new restrictions on hospitals that 
received federal Medicare money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this is a positive step, people in residential  
treatment centers and group homes participating in the Medicaid 
Home and Community-Based Waiver program have limited federal 
protection,'' the GAO report said. ``While some states have 
regulations in place governing the use of restraint and seclusion, 
often these regulations do not apply to privately operated 
facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about protecting our loved ones from deadly  
restraint,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``They should not fear 
for their lives -- and their families should not fear for their 
lives -- when they check into a hospital.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Subsistence Fishing Mediated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- The federal government today took control  
of subsistence fishing on most Alaska waters after state 
legislators failed to agree on a constitutional amendment that 
would bring state law in line with federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	A contingent of opponents in the Senate defeated a proposed  
amendment that, if then passed by voters, would have allowed 
priority for rural fishermen. That would discriminate against 
people who live in urban areas who depend on fish and game for 
food, opponents said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bitter debate struck on historical fears that stem from  
Alaska's territorial days before it became a state in 1959. Before 
then, federal fish management practices created many problems. 
Supporters said the failure to act jeopardized the freedom from 
federal control that Alaska won with statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have prevented the offensive intrusion of federal  
management of Alaska's fish and game resources -- a right that was 
at the root of our battle for statehood,'' said Gov. Tony Knowles, 
who called the special session in an effort to pass the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feds are here and certainly its a sad day,'' said House  
Speaker Brian Porter, R-Anchorage, after Thursday night's 
adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal managers already oversee subsistence hunting on federal  
land. This step expands the control to fishing on most lakes, 
rivers and streams. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsistence priorities free those who depend on wildlife for  
food -- often, but not exclusively, Indians, Eskimos and other 
native groups -- from many regular hunting and fishing regulations. 
It also allows federal wildlife managers to restrict the amount of 
wildlife taken by other hunters and fishermen to protect the 
subsistence users. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate impact of the takeover will likely be negligible  
because the summer fishing season is nearly over. But the Federal 
Subsistence Board could begin restricting commercial fishing as 
early as next spring to protect subsistence users, and the impact 
of federal management decisions on commercial, sport and 
personal-use fishing is expected to grow over time. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed the constitutional amendment, but the measure  
fell short in the Senate. The House then adjourned to block a 
Senate plan to try to pass a drastically revised version. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict originated when a federal law enacted in 1980, the  
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, provided that 
rural residents would have priority for subsistence hunting and 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the federal law  
violated the state Constitution, which guarantees equal access to 
fish and game. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the amendment, which would have revised the  
Constitution to allow for the rural priority and bring the state 
into compliance with federal law, instead want the federal law 
challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senators protected the interests of all Alaskans and their  
civil rights by not compromising,'' said Dick Bishop, the vice 
president of the Alaska Outdoor Council. 
</P>
<P>
	But Julie Kitka, president of the Alaska Federation of Natives,  
expressed disappointment, saying, ``For over 10 years we've waited 
and urged the state to do what's right for its Native citizens -- 
what is morally right and what is right by federal law.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio State Hoops Exec Is Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The director of operations for Ohio  
State's men's basketball team has been charged with domestic 
violence and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware County Sheriff's deputies arrested Randall Shrout, 49,  
at his home near Powell on Monday night. Also charged was Shrout's 
girlfriend, Tammy Oakes, 37, who lives with Shrout. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have been charged with two counts of domestic violence and  
one count of disorderly conduct, Maj. Gil Borchers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrout is accused of grabbing Oakes by the throat and  
threatening her and ransacking his home, Borchers said. Oakes is 
accused of hitting Shrout over the head with a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrout pleaded innocent to the charges. Oakes is to be arraigned  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A message seeking comment was left for Shrout at his office  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Andy Geiger said he has talked to Shrout about  
what happened, but will let the courts handle the matter before 
determining whether anything should be done. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrout's duties include coordinating team travel and overseeing  
team managers, camps and clinics. He also helps with recruiting.

<HEADLINE>  Giants End Run at Windswept Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants didn't leave their  
heart at Candlestick Park. They took it with them. 
</P>
<P>
	On a brilliant Thursday that belied the park's reputation for  
swirling winds, fog and cold, the Giants played the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the last baseball game at Candlestick and then 
celebrated the end of their 40-year-stay at the park. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't leave without a relic, digging out home plate,  
putting the old park's heart on a helicopter and flying it uptown, 
where it was planted into the team's new stadium near downtown 
that's opening next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a sad day for the Giants,'' Peter Magowan, the  
club's managing general partner, said during postgame ceremonies. 
``Yes, we are leaving our home, but we are going to a new one, and 
I promise you it will be the best ballpark in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many ways, Candlestick Park might have been the worst, its  
predominantly chilly, windy environment producing the zany and the 
weird, and posing a survival test for fans and players alike. 
</P>
<P>
	But Candlestick was also the scene of some of baseball's great  
moments and the venue for some of the game's best players, 
including Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Juan 
Marichal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very special,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.  
``Fans were really into it today, but they weren't too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it was in that spirit that the curtain came down on baseball  
at the 'Stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal tossed out the ceremonial first pitch, signaling the  
beginning of the end, and after the Dodgers beat the Giants 9-4, 
Mays came on to throw the symbolic final pitch to his godson, 
Giants star Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess all you can say is, `Tell it goodbye,' '' longtime  
Giants broadcaster Lon Simmons said during postgame ceremonies that 
ended with the blowing out of a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of good memories, a lot of bad memories here,''  
Mays said. ``I'm happy. I don't understand why when you leave a 
good thing and you go to another thing that's going to be good for 
the fans that you've got to be sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last day for baseball was unlike any other at Candlestick in  
other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The park's famous winds were quiet, the familiar shroud of cold  
and fog nowhere to be seen or felt. Even so, the elements loomed in 
everyone's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind and the cold made it miserable. Night games were  
terrible,'' recalled Mike Ivie, who was among some 60 former Giants 
players on hand to take a final bow before a crowd of 61,389, the 
most ever to attend a regular-season game here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a little bit to put on the insulated underwear and go  
play nine innings, but just being here and seeing all the old 
coaches players and made it enjoyable for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were rousing cheers for the oldtimers and current players  
and plenty of boos for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the crowd wore old jerseys and hats and some made their  
feelings known in signs dotting the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adios Candlestick,'' one sign read. ``We'll miss the thrills  
and chills,'' read another. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to be out here today, seeing all those players  
who gave me sleepless nights,'' said Tommy Lasorda, who managed the 
Dodgers for 20 years and now is a team vice president. ``I love 
this place, but the new park is going to be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maligned for its bitter weather and isolation, Candlestick was  
also remembered for withstanding the October 1989 earthquake that 
ravaged the Bay area and interrupted the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game was played at the 'Stick in 1961, when the  
winds blew pitcher Stu Miller off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedicated the year before by Vice President Richard Nixon as  
``the finest ballpark in America,'' Candlestick also was the scene 
of the 16-inning scoreless duel between Marichal and the Braves' 
Warren Spahn (Mays won it with a homer); McCovey's 500-foot 
upper-deck homer in a 1966 loss to the Mets and lefty Dave 
Dravecky's August 1989 miracle comeback from cancer, in which he 
beat the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1964 game was delayed after a visiting Dodgers outfielder lost  
a fly ball in the fog, though the final game was played under a 
brilliant sun. The temperature at gametime was 82 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the sun out and the stands and dugout warmed by  
nostalgia, even the bad, cold days didn't seem so windy or so cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really minded it,'' said San Francisco manager Dusty  
Baker, a native of Sacramento who got his first hit here in 1968 as 
a rookie with the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I'm here, I've had all my friends and family here, so  
it was always like a homecoming for me. I had to have my best games 
here in front of my home boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* In his last game of the season, Bonds went 0-for-4. He  
faced season-ending arthroscopic surgery on his right knee today. 
... Raul Mondesi hit the last homer at Candlestick, a three-run 
shot in the sixth. ... San Francisco's Marvin Benard homered to 
lead off the game. ... The Giants went 49-32 at home this season. 
... Eric Karros had two singles for Los Angeles, extending his 
hitting streak to 10 games. ... Shawn Estes (11-11) was the loser 
and Jeff Williams (2-0) got the win.

<HEADLINE> 4 Tenn. Players Cleared To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Four Tennessee players suspended as part  
of the school's academic fraud investigation have been cleared to 
play in Saturday's game against Auburn, school president J. Wade 
Gilley said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilley said investigators ``found nothing'' indicating any  
wrongdoing by the players, so the Southeastern Conference will 
allow them to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no cloud over the players,'' Gilley said.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the four seldom-used redshirt freshmen, starting  
center Spencer Riley was cleared of any wrongdoing, Gilley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley had not been suspended, but school officials decided to  
look again into a 1995 allegation that an athletic department 
employee had co-written a paper with the player. Riley was cleared 
in 1995, and investigators found no new evidence to change that 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is continuing its investigation of allegations that  
athletic department tutors did schoolwork for athletes, a possible 
violation of school honor codes and NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN reported this week that internal memos show high-level  
administrators in Tennessee's athletic department were told four 
tutors might have done schoolwork for Riley and four unidentified 
football players, a baseball player and a female athlete. Three of 
the football players have transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, none of the information was passed on to campus  
authorities charged with investigating possible rules infractions, 
university officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilley said the allegations were ``rumor and speculation'' by  
people at the school ``who had an ax to grind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four redshirt freshmen -- kick returner Leonard Scott, tight  
end Reggie Ridley, linebacker Keyon Whiteside and defensive tackle 
Ryan Rowe -- were held out of the seventh-ranked Volunteers' 17-16 
victory over Memphis last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee athletic director Doug Dickey and two of the school's  
investigators drove to Birmingham, Ala., on Thursday and told SEC 
commissioner Roy Kramer of the university's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC issued its decision about the players late Thursday,  
though no statement from the league was released, Gilley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey said a written report will be prepared and submitted to  
the SEC and NCAA as quickly as possible, but that ``since no 
players were ruled ineligible, we don't have a lack of 
institutional control charge and (the NCAA has) no infraction to 
react to us about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues raised in the investigation that deal with tutors,  
writing laboratories, coordination and oversight of the programs 
will be looked by the Faculty Senate and the Athletics Board, 
Dickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA could get involved in that aspect of the investigation.

<HEADLINE> NBA Champion Spurs Return To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs start training camp  
this weekend, beginning the chase for another NBA title while Sean 
Elliott watches from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	As the championship trophy delighted fans in a tour of San  
Antonio, a summer of celebration was offset by the startling news 
of Elliott's kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year veteran received a kidney from his brother Noel on  
Aug. 16. Elliott had a condition that prevents the kidneys from 
properly filtering waste from the blood. Without the transplant, he 
soon would have needed dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old forward, who averaged 12 points per game through  
the title run despite his illness, wants to play again. Such a 
comeback would be unprecedented in professional sports. He has 
gradually increased his activity and earlier this week shot baskets 
with teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of right now I'm going to talk to the doctors and they will  
certainly monitor the situation,'' Elliott said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to stay up on everything so I don't get lost in the  
shuffle in case I come back earlier than expected. The last two 
years have certainly helped me get ready for this. Being a shell of 
your former self is harder than anything. I never asked `why me,' I 
asked 'why not me?' We'll just have to see what happens,'' Elliott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to watch training camp workouts. If he does indeed  
return, it would be late in the season, at the earliest. In the 
meantime, he intends to travel with the team and work as a Spurs 
broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Players reported to camp late Friday, with twice daily workouts  
starting Saturday. On Oct. 14-16, the Spurs will take part in the 
six-team McDonald's Championship in Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio won its first championship in its 26-year history,  
going 15-2 in the players and drawing on the strength of 7-footers 
Tim Duncan and David Robinson to defeat New York in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the camp will revolve around replacing Elliott and  
acclimating the new players. In the offseason, the Spurs re-signed 
free agent forward Malik Rose and guard Jaren Jackson. Will Perdue, 
a 7-0 backup center, left for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone will be coming at us every night. We plan to play  
exactly as we did last year, only better,'' coach Gregg Popovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be different for us without Sean Elliott. We don't  
know what we're going to do at the No. 3 spot. We have 30 days of 
training camp to help us tell the tale. The best thing to do is 
develop a rotation to help solve the problem. We are not going to 
find someone to do for us what Sean Elliott did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs signed free agents Samaki Walker and Felton Spencer.  
Terry Porter, a guard, also was added to the roster. The Spurs 
agreed to terms this week with forward Chucky Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, the MVP of the NBA Finals after averaging 27.4 points  
and 14 rebounds in the series, has one year remaining on his 
three-year, $10 million rookie deal with the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	So far Duncan hasn't said if he will remain in San Antonio after  
his contract expires. His decision will be tied to whether the team 
gets a new arena, ensuring a long-term commitment to San Antonio. 
The Spurs' home in the Alamodome is designed for football. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters go the polls Nov. 2 -- the day the Spurs start the regular  
season -- to decide whether to increase hotel and car rental taxes 
to fund an arena on county property about two miles from downtown.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 106.38 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed their downward trek today after  
new reports showed the economy's surging growth has not slowed in 
recent months. The data again raised concerns that the Federal 
Reserve will further boost interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 106.38 at 10,230.57. The blue-chip index was off 
as much as 135 points in earlier trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 9.11 at 1,273.60, and the Nasdaq composite index 
fell 34.02 to 2,712.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after the Commerce Department reported that personal  
income -- which includes wages, interest and government benefits -- 
rose 0.5 percent in August, the eighth straight monthly increase. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, consumer spending rose 0.9 percent in August  
and the personal savings rate matched a record low of negative 1.5 
percent. While robust consumer spending has powered the growth of 
the U.S. economy, many economists fear that if spending continues 
unchecked, inflation will begin escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the National Association of Purchasing Management  
reported that the nation's manufacturing sector grew at a 
stronger-than expected rate in September. It was the eight 
consecutive month of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM also reported that prices of raw materials spurted to  
the highest level since May 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, the personal income and consumer spending report  
knocked the market down,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of 
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``Then 
the NAPM really was the bullet. The market really didn't like the 
rise in prices paid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has tried to stave off inflation by raising interest  
rates twice so far this year. Fears of a third increase have kept 
stocks off balance for the past month, and while many analysts 
expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged when it meets next Tuesday, 
today's reports injected a last-minute note of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say interest rate increases take several months to  
produce a measurable effect on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about rising interest rates also led to a slump in bond  
prices, which pushed up the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 
6.16 percent this afternoon from 6.04 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett Packard fell 3 13/16 to 86 15/16, contributing to the  
Dow's decline. The computer maker warned that its fiscal 
fourth-quarter revenue could fall short of Wall Street expectations 
because of component shortages caused by last week's earthquake in 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM fell 5 to 116, the steepest decliner in the Dow.  
</P>
<P>
	Revlon shares also slumped, falling 5 3/4 to 12 1/2 after the  
cosmetics giant said it expected a loss in the third quarter. The 
New York-based company has not been able to find a buyer, so it now 
is looking to sell off its salon-based business and some Latin 
American brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Lilly rose 3 to 67 3/16. The U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration granted the company approval to sell an estrogen 
substitute used to prevent brittle bones in women who are past 
menopause as a treatment for osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 686.34 million 
shares, compared with 743.00 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 5.22 to 422.08.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 63.95 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed their slide Friday after new  
reports showed that the economy's surging growth has not slowed in 
recent months. The data renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.95 to close at  
10,273.00, after falling nearly 153 points earlier in the session. 
The blue-chip index ended a fairly volatile week just 6.33 points 
below last Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 edged up 0.10 to 1,282.81, and the Nasdaq composite 
index fell 9.31 to 2,736.85.

percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds had a very bad day, and were certainly a trigger for the  
weakness in stocks,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ``Overall, there's still a 
lot of risk in this market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington also cited weakness in the dollar, which slipped to  
104.96 Japanese yen from 106.27 late Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Giants End Run at Windswept Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants didn't leave their  
heart at Candlestick Park. They took it with them. 
</P>
<P>
	On a brilliant Thursday that belied the park's reputation for  
swirling winds, fog and cold, the Giants played the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the last baseball game at Candlestick and then 
celebrated the end of their 40-year-stay at the park. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't leave without a relic, digging out home plate,  
putting the old park's heart on a helicopter and flying it uptown, 
where it was planted into the team's new stadium near downtown 
that's opening next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a sad day for the Giants,'' Peter Magowan, the  
club's managing general partner, said during postgame ceremonies. 
``Yes, we are leaving our home, but we are going to a new one, and 
I promise you it will be the best ballpark in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many ways, Candlestick Park might have been the worst, its  
predominantly chilly, windy environment producing the zany and the 
weird, and posing a survival test for fans and players alike. 
</P>
<P>
	But Candlestick was also the scene of some of baseball's great  
moments and the venue for some of the game's best players, 
including Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Juan 
Marichal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very special,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.  
``Fans were really into it today, but they weren't too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it was in that spirit that the curtain came down on baseball  
at the 'Stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal tossed out the ceremonial first pitch, signaling the  
beginning of the end, and after the Dodgers beat the Giants 9-4, 
Mays came on to throw the symbolic final pitch to his godson, 
Giants star Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess all you can say is, `Tell it goodbye,' '' longtime  
Giants broadcaster Lon Simmons said during postgame ceremonies that 
ended with the blowing out of a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of good memories, a lot of bad memories here,''  
Mays said. ``I'm happy. I don't understand why when you leave a 
good thing and you go to another thing that's going to be good for 
the fans that you've got to be sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last day for baseball was unlike any other at Candlestick in  
other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The park's famous winds were quiet, the familiar shroud of cold  
and fog nowhere to be seen or felt. Even so, the elements loomed in 
everyone's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind and the cold made it miserable. Night games were  
terrible,'' recalled Mike Ivie, who was among some 60 former Giants 
players on hand to take a final bow before a crowd of 61,389, the 
most ever to attend a regular-season game here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a little bit to put on the insulated underwear and go  
play nine innings, but just being here and seeing all the old 
coaches players and made it enjoyable for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were rousing cheers for the oldtimers and current players  
and plenty of boos for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the crowd wore old jerseys and hats and some made their  
feelings known in signs dotting the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adios Candlestick,'' one sign read. ``We'll miss the thrills  
and chills,'' read another. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to be out here today, seeing all those players  
who gave me sleepless nights,'' said Tommy Lasorda, who managed the 
Dodgers for 20 years and now is a team vice president. ``I love 
this place, but the new park is going to be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maligned for its bitter weather and isolation, Candlestick was  
also remembered for withstanding the October 1989 earthquake that 
ravaged the Bay area and interrupted the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game was played at the 'Stick in 1961, when the  
winds blew pitcher Stu Miller off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedicated the year before by Vice President Richard Nixon as  
``the finest ballpark in America,'' Candlestick also was the scene 
of the 16-inning scoreless duel between Marichal and the Braves' 
Warren Spahn (Mays won it with a homer); McCovey's 500-foot 
upper-deck homer in a 1966 loss to the Mets and lefty Dave 
Dravecky's August 1989 miracle comeback from cancer, in which he 
beat the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1964 game was delayed after a visiting Dodgers outfielder lost  
a fly ball in the fog, though the final game was played under a 
brilliant sun. The temperature at gametime was 82 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the sun out and the stands and dugout warmed by  
nostalgia, even the bad, cold days didn't seem so windy or so cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really minded it,'' said San Francisco manager Dusty  
Baker, a native of Sacramento who got his first hit here in 1968 as 
a rookie with the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I'm here, I've had all my friends and family here, so  
it was always like a homecoming for me. I had to have my best games 
here in front of my home boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* In his last game of the season, Bonds went 0-for-4. He  
faced season-ending arthroscopic surgery on his right knee today. 
... Raul Mondesi hit the last homer at Candlestick, a three-run 
shot in the sixth. ... San Francisco's Marvin Benard homered to 
lead off the game. ... The Giants went 49-32 at home this season. 
... Eric Karros had two singles for Los Angeles, extending his 
hitting streak to 10 games. ... Shawn Estes (11-11) was the loser 
and Jeff Williams (2-0) got the win.

<HEADLINE> Gore Promotes Health Care Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore countered the ambitious  
health care plan unveiled by rival Bill Bradley with a visit Friday 
to a local hospital to meet with doctors and nurses and push his 
own plan to provide health insurance to all children. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also urged Congress to swiftly pass legislation that would  
increase patients' rights in dealing with managed health care 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the partisanship that has delayed passage of this  
measure will subside and that Republicans will join Democrats in 
passing this,'' he said. ``I hope they'll go further and see it's 
time to expand access to health insurance for every child in this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also took a jab at Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
the GOP presidential front-runner who on Thursday criticized GOP 
spending proposals, saying they would allow Congress to ``balance 
their budget on the backs of the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Bush needs to break from the Republican majority on  
other issues, such as the so-called patient's bill of rights and a 
proposed increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not provide any new details on his insurance plan, nor  
did he refer to the one offered by Bradley, the former U.S. senator 
who wants universal access to affordable health care. When asked 
about the differences between the two proposals, Gore only promised 
there would be ``plenty of time'' to make point-by-point 
comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned,'' he said. ``There will be plenty of opportunity  
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also urged Congress to extend health coverage to uninsured  
adults by ``fixing Medicare and adding prescription drug benefits 
for seniors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the members of Congress opposing these measures could  
listen to the EMTs, the nurses and the emergency room nurses and 
the doctors and hear what they have to say about the choices that 
their patients are having to make, they'd make different 
decisions,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also would act differently toward the proposed budget, he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP budget plan slashes funding for critical health  
programs, Gore said. About 170,000 fewer children would be 
immunized and services for 100,000 mentally ill patients would be 
reduced. The plan also would deny substance abuse assistance to 
31,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to resist the conclusion that they are truly headed  
in the wrong direction,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Stars Sign Matvichuk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Hours before opening their Stanley Cup defense  
Friday night, the Dallas Stars signed defenseman Richard Matvichuk 
to a four-year contract and announced they'd given goaltender Ed 
Belfour a two-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Matvichuk, who starts alongside captain Derian Hatcher, had been  
holding out for a five-year deal. Dallas refused to go longer than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the holdout, the Stars weren't sure whether to  
include Matvichuk in pregame ceremonies honoring last year's 
champions. They decided to invite him and his acceptance became the 
opening needed to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hammered out the deal and it's good for both sides,''  
Matvichuk said. ``I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matvichuk, 26, stayed in shape while waiting out training camp  
and the exhibition season, but Dallas general manager Bob Gainey 
said he won't play until next week at the soonest. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainey wasn't happy about giving up the fifth year because it  
means Matvichuk and Hatcher will both be free agents after the 
2002-03 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gainey said the compromise was worth keeping up the  
excitement surrounding the season opener against Pittsburgh and the 
team's momentum towards repeating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems the timing was right,'' Gainey said. ``Our wish is to  
keep our players thinking about being a championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour has led the Stars to the NHL's best regular-season  
record in his first two years in Dallas. But until last summer he 
had a reputation for not being able to come through when it 
mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagle erased that by going 16-7 with three shutouts in the  
playoffs. He won two triple-overtime games, including the 
title-clincher against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars offered the extension before training camp to let him  
know they wanted to keep him off the free-agent market after this 
season. Belfour was glad to stay and he's now locked up through 
2002, when he'll be 38. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he is physically capable of playing at the same level  
at that age, and we feel we can continue to put a quality team 
around him for the term of his contract,'' Gainey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainey said the team also offered a two-year extension to  
Stanley Cup MVP Joe Nieuwendyk, but after several counteroffers by 
both sides everyone agreed to wait until the summer.

<HEADLINE> N.D. Governor Not To Run Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Republican Gov. Ed Schafer stunned his  
supporters Friday by announcing he will not run for a third term 
next year, saying it will be time ``to turn the reins over to a new 
leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision made the Democratic attorney general, Heidi  
Heitkamp, the front-runner for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy decision would have been to run again,'' Schafer said  
during an emotional news conference at the state Republican 
headquarters. ``The accomplishments are many. The support is 
tremendous. ... However, we feel it is time, a year from now, to 
turn the reins over to a new leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer, 53, said it was ``quite possible'' he would return to  
politics -- even the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Schafer's decision boosted the campaign of Ms. Heitkamp, the  
only declared Democratic candidate. She praised Schafer, saying he 
brought ``a great deal of class to the office of governor, whether 
you believed in his programs or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota's economy expanded on Schafer's watch -- helped, he  
said, by his insistence on holding down taxes.

<HEADLINE> Congress On Verge of Deal on F-22's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force appears to have been thwarted in  
its quest to get the first, combat-ready models of its prized F-22 
stealth fighter as a House-Senate fight over the 
ultra-sophisticated warplane draws to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders were expected to announce as early as  
today that they have agreed to provide $1 billion for the Air Force 
to buy test models of the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	But production of final versions of the radar-evading aircraft  
would have to wait at least until 2001, said congressional 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	While cautioning that ``it's never done until it's done,'' House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters today that a deal on 
the F-22 was close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope we would finish that bill quite quickly,''  
Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force had wanted to begin buying production planes  
during the coming year. It has already spent $25 billion to develop 
the F-22 and plans to spend an additional $40 billion to build 339 
of them. They would replace the F-15 jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-22s, which the Air Force envisions as the cornerstone of  
its fleet for the early 21st century, would cost nearly $200 
million apiece, making it the most expensive jet fighter ever 
built. 
</P>
<P>
	But House critics led by Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., argued that  
the money was needed for other military projects and that the F-22 
was not ready for production. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision would mark a setback for the Lockheed Martin Corp.,  
the prime contractor, the Clinton administration and the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, struck during a closed-door meeting of Republican  
congressional leaders Wednesday night, would end weeks of stalemate 
that blocked progress on a nearly $270 billion bill to run the 
military through fiscal 2000, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a good breakthrough,'' House Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, an F-22 supporter, said while leaving the meeting. 
But he and other lawmakers would provide no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 billion would probably be enough to purchase three or  
four of the test aircraft, one official said, which would be used 
for trials that would help determine the plane's final 
configuration. The Air Force could buy up to six of the test 
models, but probably would have to request additional money next 
year to buy that many. 
</P>
<P>
	In its defense bill, the Senate had provided $1.85 billion this  
year, enough to buy six of the planes. But the House deleted the 
money in July, arguing that the plane's computers were not fully 
tested and that the money was needed for other defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	During weeks of bargaining, the House offered about $1 billion,  
or enough for three or four test fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	House negotiators also offered to support $500 million the  
Senate has approved for construction of a giant LHD-8 transport 
ship at the Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., hometown of 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately learned whether the money for the  
Mississippi ship was included in the agreement. Lott has long 
favored the shipbuilding project, but had been unable to persuade 
the House to go along.

<HEADLINE> Tough Week To Be an Artist in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If it looks like horse manure and smells like  
horse manure -- it just may be art. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-described artist Scott LoBaido was grabbed by police  
outside the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Thursday for hurling fistfuls 
of horse manure at the museum's facade. It was his way of 
protesting an elephant dung-decorated painting of the Virgin Mary 
set to go on display this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expressing myself creatively!'' shouted LoBaido, who  
criticized the upcoming exhibit as Catholic-bashing as police led 
him away. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest added to a wild week in the New York art world in  
which the museum and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani went to war and a 
gallery owner found herself jailed for distributing live ammunition 
as part of an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap in the centuries-old battle over what  
constitutes art began when Giuliani took on the Brooklyn museum for 
booking ``Sensation: Young British Artists from the Saatchi 
Collection,'' which opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the controversial show was in London, it drew more than  
300,000 visitors eager to glimpse the controversial Virgin Mary 
piece by Chris Ofili, and dissected pigs floating in formaldehyde 
by Damien Hirst. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani ripped the exhibit and vowed to withhold $7 million in  
annual city funding for the museum. A city lawsuit, filed Thursday, 
claims the exhibit violates terms in a lease requiring the museum 
``to educate and enlighten school children and the public,'' and to 
provide free admission on most days. Exhibit tickets are $9.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers on both sides are also squaring off in federal court,  
where museum attorney Floyd Abrams accused the city and the mayor 
of ``seeking to punish the museum for exercising its First 
Amendment rights.'' U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon set a hearing 
for next week to hear the museum's request for an injunction 
barring the city from cutting its funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Michael Hess, the city's top lawyer, said  
Giuliani ``is concerned with taxpayers' money, and he feels it 
should not be used on an exhibition of vile (art).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Abrams: ``Why in the world would the mayor... want to  
throw the museum out of the city?'' If the mayor wins, he said, 
``the museum would probably wind up in New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, in California on a fund-raising trip, said the  
exhibit gives voice to ``some very, very disturbed people'' at 
taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in court Thursday was art dealer Mary Boone. She was  
arrested the night before at her Manhattan gallery, where visitors 
to a one-man show by artist Tom Sachs were welcomed to take home a 
9mm bullet as souvenir. A display of homemade guns, Sachs' 
signature artwork, was also seized. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was charged with illegal distribution of ammunition and  
other misdemeanors, including resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an outrageous attack on the artists' right to express  
themselves,'' she said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many feel similarly about Giuliani's opposition to the Brooklyn  
exhibit. A full-page advertisement supporting ``Sensation'' 
appeared in today's New York Times, signed by more than 100 
writers, artists and actors, including Steve Martin, Joyce Carol 
Oates, Norman Mailer, Arthur Miller and Kurt Vonnegut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times' critic, meanwhile, called the show ``uneven'' but  
said its best work ``does what all good art should do: It makes you 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others have been less supportive. New York Observer critic  
Hilton Kramer wrote this week that the much-hyped exhibit is 
``appallingly witless and stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Art exhibits didn't always spark such a response in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	The Guggenheim Museum accepted $3 million worth of Robert  
Mapplethorpe's work with barely a peep in 1992, two years after the 
photographer's homoerotic works were nearly banned in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, the Brooklyn museum's ``Sensation'' gift shop is  
selling lunch boxes with the biohazard symbol and lapel pins shaped 
like traffic caution signs with a label that has ``Danger'' over 
the word ``Art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Museum officials have placed a plastic screen in front of  
Ofili's ``The Holy Virgin Mary'' to prevent vandalism. The work, 
meanwhile, received praise by many who attended a Thursday night 
preview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get the feeling the artist is poking fun at the  
church,'' said Steven Richman, among those who attended. ``It's an 
interpretation. Dung is considered a respectful symbol.''

<HEADLINE> Medical School To Beef Up Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- The University of California, Irvine  
medical school lacks proper supervision, the dean and university 
chancellor said as they announced steps to improve security in the 
wake of a series of scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest one involves Christopher S. Brown, director of UCI's  
Willed Body Program, who was fired after he was accused of 
profiting from the sale of body parts from cadavers donated to the 
university. He denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	University Chancellor Ralph J. Cicerone and medical school Dean  
Thomas C. Cesario sent letters on Thursday to the staff that 
outline three changes to beef up security. 
</P>
<P>
	Cesario said his office will make unannounced spot reviews of  
departments and programs. A group of doctors, medical ethicists and 
others will be asked to come up with ways of improving oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also will hire an associate dean to work with  
department chairmen and administrative managers. The associate dean 
will serve as the contact person for whistleblowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have realized, and maybe we could have avoided, some  
of these problems.'' Cicerone said. ``I'm angry about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, allegations surfaced that doctors at the school's  
internationally known Center for Reproductive Health stole eggs 
from patients and implanted them in other women, some of whom gave 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, a researcher resigned after an investigation alleged  
he used patients' blood samples for two research projects without 
proper approval and appeared to have falsified patient signatures 
on consent forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Internal documents showed that researchers in the mid-1990s  
treated patients with unapproved doses of experimental vaccines, 
grew human tissue cells without required federal and university 
approval, and injected an experimental drug into a girl dying of a 
brain tumor.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg To Buy Worthington Foods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Less than a week after unloading its frozen bagel division,  
Kellogg Co. on Friday got into the vegetarian burger business, with 
hopes of broadening its appeal to health conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Battle Creek, Mich.-based cereal maker, which has suffered  
in recent years with sagging sales and profits, agreed to acquire 
Worthington Foods for $307 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Worthington Foods specializes in manufacturing and marketing  
products including veggie burgers and meatless sausage, chicken, 
and hot dog products. Its brand names include Morningstar Farms, 
Natural Touch, Worthington, and Loma Linda. 
</P>
<P>
	Worthington stock surged 60 percent, rising $8.68 3/4 to $23.06 1/4 a  
share in trading Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Kellogg slipped 
31 1/4 cents to $37.12 1/2 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes five days after the cereal maker  
announced it was selling its struggling Lender's Bagel business to 
Aurora Foods Inc. for $275 million, 41 percent below the 1996 
purchase price of $466 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their past management bought Lender's, which was yesterday's  
product,'' Prudential Securities analysts John McMillin said. 
``Kellogg's new management is trying to buy tomorrow's products, 
which they believe will be healthier foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since he took the helm of the company in April, Kellogg chief  
executive Carlos Gutierrez has stressed the need for the company to 
expand its product line, especially since fewer Americans are 
eating cereal for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he told analysts that Kellogg has the marketing  
expertise to increase the sales of Worthington's existing product 
lines, and perhaps develop new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their research department has a lot of experience working with  
soy ... and we are looking at different products with soy,'' 
Gutierrez said. ``This will give us a bigger head start once soy 
takes off, which we believe is the next big hot food product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Worthington representative did not immediately return phone  
calls Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomi Ghez of Goldman Sachs said this appears to be a competitive  
acquisition, which is an important part of a company's growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worthington is in a very strong growth category and one which  
has very low consumer penetration, about 15 percent. It clearly ... 
has strong growth prospects,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Worthington Foods is expected to have sales in excess of $170  
million this year, more than 20 percent above its sales in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg will pay $24 for each of Worthington's approximately  
12.8 million shares outstanding or approximately $307 million. 
Kellogg expects to complete the transaction by the end of the year, 
and said the purchase should have little effect on its earnings for 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to cut costs and turnaround its business, Kellogg  
has gone through significant restructuring recently, including 
slashing jobs and closing its historic Battle Creek cereal plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Worthington employs 650 hourly and salaried people at its  
Worthington, Ohio, headquarters and two plants. The company's 
management team, including its CEO, is expected to stay on at least 
through the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	A Kellogg spokesman said no immediate job cuts are planned.

<HEADLINE> GOP Approves Farm Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP -- The House today approved an $8.7 billion  
package of farm relief despite complaints that it wasn't enough 
money and didn't deal with disputes over dairy policy and the Cuban 
trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved 240-175, offers $7.5 billion for growers hurt  
by a second year of low market prices, including $5.5 billion that 
would be paid to farmers who have ``market transition'' contracts 
with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department said those checks could be sent to  
farmers within two weeks after the bill is signed into law by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is expected to take up the bill next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Also included is $1.2 billion for farmers who lost crops to  
drought and floods. Moving separately through Congress is $500 
million for hurricane-related farm losses in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers can't wait. They need assistance now,'' said Rep. Joe  
Skeen, R-N.M., chairman of the House Appropriations agricultural 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, tried unsuccessfully to get the House  
to order the bill rewritten. She said much of the money would go to 
well-off farmers and landowners who don't need the help. ``Some of 
these people aren't the ones who are truly hurting in this 
economy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm aid is included in a $69 billion appropriations bill  
for operations of USDA, with its myriad of agriculture and 
nutrition programs, and the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders forced the measure out of a House-Senate  
conference committee Thursday without provisions that would allow 
sales of food and medicine to Cuba and block the Agriculture 
Department from implementing new dairy-pricing rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference committee stopped work on the bill last week  
after GOP leaders refused to let them consider the Cuba provision. 
The leadership then coaxed a majority of the panel's members to 
endorse the bill individually, securing the last two signatures 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the committee's approval was a variety of special  
provisions for the lawmakers' home-state farmers: $125 million in 
subsidies for dairy producers, a requirement that meatpackers start 
reporting the prices they pay for cattle and hogs and a guarantee 
that livestock producers would get $200 million in drought aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., said he agreed to the compromise to  
keep Republican leaders from having to make additional concessions 
to Democrats. ``They were all over me to get this out of the 
station,'' he said, referring to the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is expected to meet some opposition in Senate as well  
as the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have people who are upset about what's not in the bill and  
you have people who are upset about what's in,'' said Sen. Pat 
Roberts, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans were angry that GOP leaders  
prevented the committee from meeting and voting on the Cuba 
measure, which had passed the Senate, 70-28. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process was manipulated,'' complained Sen. John Ashcroft,  
R-Mo., the amendment's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain elements of the House are more concerned with  
continuing the Cold War than with helping our nation's farmers,'' 
said Jim Dornan, a spokesman for Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash. 
``But we will be back to fight this another day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers from dairy states in the South and East wanted to  
use the must-pass spending bill to overturn a new nationwide 
milk-pricing system that was scheduled to take effect today. A 
federal judge on Tuesday postponed implementation of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwestern lawmakers, who support the new pricing system,  
persuaded GOP leaders to keep it out of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee may have eliminated some  
opposition to the bill by agreeing Thursday to put in another 
spending measure $508 million for crop and livestock losses in 
North Carolina due to Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a down payment, but it will go a long way to  
meeting the staggering losses our farm families have suffered in 
the flood,'' said Rep. David Price, D-N.C.

<HEADLINE> Kid Grounded After Sneaking on Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A 12-year-old Alexandria boy was grounded  
at home after taking an unauthorized and unticketed flight to St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Renee Peregory told WUSA-TV her son, Christopher, was trying to  
see what he could get away with when he sneaked onto a TWA airliner 
at Reagan National Airport Wednesday. He had skipped school and 
taken a Metro train to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, he got as far as St. Louis, then panicked and called  
his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously a 12-year-old child was able to get onto a plane and  
ride off -- without anybody noticing him whatsoever,'' the mother 
said. ``And then getting to the destination and nobody checking to 
see if he's at the right stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But TWA spokesman Jim Brown said, ``He did something wrong, he  
did something that was a violation of several statutes, and that 
should be the focus of what occurred here and the ramifications 
afterwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the boy hid from the gate agent by walking in  
the shadow of an adult. Then he found an empty seat in the back of 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher spent Wednesday night in a St. Louis juvenile  
detention facility, and was escorted on a return flight Thursday by 
a TWA employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating how he  
could have gotten onto the plane without a ticket or a boarding 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been extremely quiet because he's just waiting for the  
other shoe to fall,'' Christopher's mother said. Asked if he was 
ground from flying in the future, she replied, ``He's grounded from 
lots of things actually.''

<HEADLINE> Consumers To Get Medicine Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Can I drink alcohol while taking an  
antidepressant? Can I swallow my heart medicine with grapefruit 
juice? Does my daughter really need to finish this antibiotic when 
it's obvious she's feeling better? 
</P>
<P>
	Taking medication can be complicated.  
</P>
<P>
	First you must know when and how to take prescription and  
over-the-counter drugs. That means more than how many pills a day -- 
it also means knowing what other medicines, foods, even herbs are 
safe with the drugs, what to do about missed doses and how long to 
take them. 
</P>
<P>
	Then you must know what to do if you're among the millions of  
Americans who suffer a drug-caused side effect each year. When is 
it serious enough to seek help? 
</P>
<P>
	For women, dealing with medicine can be even more complex. Women  
typically take more prescription drugs than men. And studies 
suggest moms make more of a family's health decisions, from when to 
call a pediatrician to ensuring a forgetful grandparent doesn't 
miss a dose. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing those studies, the Food and Drug Administration is  
targeting American women with a campaign on using medicine more 
wisely -- hoping to distribute 5 million brochures in October that 
offer what can be lifesaving tips. 
</P>
<P>
	Popping a few prescription pills or teaspoons of a cold remedy  
may not seem risky, but all drugs, even nonprescription ones, cause 
some side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``Using medicines wisely will help to reduce that risk,'' said  
FDA Commissioner Jane Henney. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2 million Americans are hospitalized annually from  
drug side effects, and 100,000 die. The vast majority of those 
cases are believed preventable, and the FDA says those illnesses 
cost some $76 billion in health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Some problems are caused when the wrong drug or dose is provided  
to a patient. But consumers bear responsibility, too: About 30 
percent to 50 percent of patients fail to follow instructions from 
their doctor or the drug's label, the FDA says. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the women's education campaign, co-sponsored by the  
National Association of Chain Drug Stores, comes in. 
</P>
<P>
	The advice, in a free ``My Medicines'' brochure, is pretty  
simple: 
</P>
<P>
	--Read the drug's label. If you or a family member are allergic  
to any ingredients, request a different drug. Read the warnings, 
check the expiration date and don't use expired medicine -- it might 
not work. 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep a record of all your medicines -- prescription,  
over-the-counter, even dietary supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Many people see numerous doctors. Without a list of what  
each advises taking, patients may be given prescriptions that 
interact dangerously with each other, or accidentally get double 
drugs for the same illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescriptions aren't the only worry, said pharmacist Mary Ann  
Wagner of the drugstore association. The herb ginkgo, touted as a 
memory booster, can thin blood, potentially dangerous for people on 
Coumadin or other blood thinners, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask questions. If you forgot to query the doctor, call back or  
ask the pharmacist, who should be willing to engage in a private 
conversation about a drug's safe use, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions can be vital. A warning that grapefruit juice can  
interact dangerously with certain drugs, or that it's wise to avoid 
alcohol with some others, might be hidden in the label's fine 
print, Wagner said. So ask when to take a drug and with what foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask how long to take medicine. People on antibiotics, for  
instance, are supposed to finish them even if they feel better. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask what side effects to expect, and what to do. Patients on  
painkillers, for instance, should know the symptoms of stomach 
ulcers so they can quit the drugs and call a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though these are very simple messages, their importance  
cannot be minimized,'' Henney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, interviews with women who received the brochures in a  
pilot program last year suggested more had begun keeping medication 
lists, a big step in avoiding drug interactions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 20,000 chain drugstores will distribute the free brochures  
beginning today. They also can be ordered by calling 
1-888-8-PUEBLO, or via the Internet at 
http://www.fda.gov/womens/tttc.html. They will be offered in 
English, Spanish and several other languages.

<HEADLINE>  Candidates Woo Christian Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Republican presidential candidates showed  
off their conservative credentials Friday, Christian Coalition 
founder Pat Robertson deemed Gary Bauer a ``lost cause,'' Elizabeth 
Dole ``a Southern belle'' and George W. Bush ``worthy of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Pat Buchanan, Robertson gave a stern warning that Christian  
conservatives will desert him if he ditches the GOP for a 
third-party presidential run with the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform supporters are ``180 degrees out in terms of social  
issues. They don't share any of the views that Pat Buchanan claimed 
to espouse so vociferously,'' Robertson told a news conference at 
the coalition's annual ``Road to Victory'' conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see him taking many Christian conservatives with him --  
not to the Reform Party,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day conference drew 3,500 of the coalition's 2.1 million  
members and six of the eight Republicans running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Bush, the Texas governor and front-runner for the GOP  
nomination, who filled all the seats -- and lined the perimeter's 
standing room -- in a cavernous hotel ballroom. ``Every child born 
and unborn must be protected by law and welcomed to life,'' he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	He advocated parental-notification laws on abortion, saying  
``Parents should be the first to help, not the last to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, the religious broadcaster who commands the  
grass-roots army of Christian activists that helped sweep 
Republicans into control of Congress in the 1994 elections, said he 
will not endorse any presidential candidate during the primary 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But his preferences were clear.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Robertson all but dismissed Bauer, whose  
teen-aged supporters in campaign T-shirts worked Friday's 
convention in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to win,'' Robertson told The New York Times.  
``You don't win with 1 or 2 percent. Most people are not terribly 
keen on riding a lost cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who once ran the Family Research Council and prides  
himself on his Christian conservative appeal, appeared taken aback 
when informed of Robertson's remark. He said he was disappointed 
Robertson was not taking a straw poll of members at this year's 
convention. ``Then we wouldn't have to sit around and speculate on 
where the leaders are,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said some of what he's heard from Bush's ``centrist''  
campaign ``so far would cause me to believe he would be worthy of 
support of the coalition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Robertson added he is eager to see a series of debates  
force Bush to ``crystallize his positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bauer promised that, unlike Bush, he would make a  
judge's opposition to abortion rights a prerequisite for 
appointment to any federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Bauer shouted, ``My judges are going to understand that  
marriage is between a man and a woman -- not two men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole took the stage to the rolling crescendos of the music from  
``Gone With the Wind'' and talked of her religious upbringing. She 
called her grandmother's tattered Bible her dearest treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment is to strive to lean on the lord with my whole  
heart, reading his word daily and earnestly seeking his will in my 
life,'' Dole said. ``I learned from the best -- President Reagan -- 
that you have to lead with the convictions of your heart, not with 
the latest polling data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said later that she gave a ``wonderful speech'' and  
enjoys ``real support'' from his members. Asked to explain the 
music organizers chose for her entrance, Robertson boyishly 
shrugged. ``She's the Southern belle, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch promised to be a ``conservative president  
with guts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Penberth of Bethlehem, Penn., remained undecided.  
``These 20-minute speeches don't get you anywhere. It's just 
rah-rah,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain declined an invitation to speak. And  
though Buchanan appeared on Saturday's program, he canceled earlier 
this week, his campaign said. Alan Keyes was addressing the Friday 
evening session. Steve Forbes issued an open invitation to picnic 
by the pool after his Saturday morning speech. 
</P>
<P>
	From atop a massive, political-convention-styled dais and  
accompanied by the ``Rocky'' fight song, Robertson opened the 
conference with an eye on the 2000 elections and appeal to his 
followers. ``If we aren't in the field in this coming election, 
Republicans will lose,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was Robertson's primary target. ``As we  
prepare for a new millennium, I want to start with cleansing the 
highest office of the land from the sleaze and the equivocation and 
the moral rot which has embarrassed us all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Clinton, the villain in abstentia here was Minnesota  
Gov. Jesse Ventura, who, in a Playboy magazine interview this week, 
called organized religion ``a sham and a crutch for weak-minded 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said Ventura was ``off his rocker.'' Bauer suggested  
the former pro-wrestler change his name to ``Jesse 'the Bigot' 
Ventura.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Republican presidential candidates showed

<HEADLINE> Study: Race Has Powerful Role in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Blacks still end up at the bottom of the pack when  
it comes to opportunities ranging from jobs to housing, according 
to a new study that indicates race continues to play an enormous 
role in the success of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty researchers studied the cities of Atlanta, Boston, Detroit  
and Los Angeles and found that race is deeply entrenched in the 
country's cultural landscape -- perhaps even more than many 
Americans realize or are willing to admit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this study tells you not only that some of these  
perceptions are true, but it tells us in more detail where 
inequality is being generated,'' said Alice O'Connor, a historian 
at the University of California-Berkeley, who wrote the 
introduction to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, released Friday, found  
that racial stereotypes and hierarchies heavily influence the labor 
market, with blacks landing at the very bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-volume study looked at job market participation,  
racial inequality and political attitudes among 9,000 households 
and 3,500 employers in the four cities. 
</P>
<P>
	It was sponsored by the Russell Sage Foundation -- a private  
research center on social policy -- and the Harvard University 
Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy. The 
Harvard program includes researchers from several Harvard graduate 
schools and disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
	Initiated in the early 1990s, the project attempted to  
understand the patterns of racial inequality in modern, 
metropolitan areas and how race has been affected by economic 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, race is pervasive at many levels,  
manifesting itself in everything from highly segregated housing to 
labor markets that prefer hiring some racial groups over others. 
Stereotyping is often at play, particularly when it comes to where 
people want to live and whom they will hire, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks ``continually end up at the bottom in terms of  
preferences for neighbors as well as when employers talk about 
hiring preferences,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the study found that minorities are doing better in the  
strong economy of the 1990s, it found that they are making less 
money and working fewer hours than their white counterparts. It 
also found that they had a significantly harder time landing a job. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, for example, it took unskilled, unemployed whites an  
average of 91 hours to generate a job offer. It took blacks 167 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there is a heavy burden that minorities face in the  
job market,'' said Katherine Newman, an urban studies professor at 
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``Minorities are working, 
but they're diverging in their good fortune from whites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the household surveys, conducted by telephone between 1992  
and 1994, and the employer interviews identified pervasive 
stereotypes, particularly targeting blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks, many of the respondents said, are more likely to be on  
welfare, more likely to commit crimes and harder to get along with 
than other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In the work force, where native-born blacks are losing jobs to  
recent immigrants, employers indicated blacks rank low on their 
hiring preference charts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get a whole lot of employers coming out and saying  
`Blacks are worthless,'' O'Connor said. Employers instead talked in 
code and subtext when referring to minorities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers also were fearful of relocating to areas that were  
perceived as heavily minority.

<HEADLINE> Questions Surround Underwood Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A young man found dead last week in a  
cooler in a Michigan State dorm basement attended the same church 
as Dimitrius Underwood, the NFL player who slashed his own neck 
after repeatedly yelling, ``I'm not worthy of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives who spoke this week to friends of Neftali Valdez  
Greene Jr. found that the 23-year-old had attended Immanuel's 
Temple Community Church in Lansing for about a year, said Capt. 
Tony Kleibecker, spokesman for Michigan State University police. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's mother, an ordained minister, earlier this week said  
the church her son attended was a ``cult that's posing as a 
church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Phillip Owens of Immanuel's Temple said Underwood had  
attended his church on and off for about a year. He denied the cult 
accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Owens refused to discuss Greene's affiliation with  
his church. It was not immediately clear if Underwood knew Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no obligation on our side to say anything until I  
find out what's going on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 22-year-old former Michigan State defensive end who  
has wavered between football and his religion in his brief NFL 
career, was found Sunday severely bleeding on a Lansing street 
after slashing his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released from Sparrow Hospital on Thursday and was taken  
to an inpatient mental health clinic, which was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, in a statement released through his agent, said  
Friday he has drawn strength from his family and faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forwward to returning to the Miami Dolphins,'' he  
said. ``I am getting help and looking forward to a full and rapid 
recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Lansing police report said Underwood repeatedly yelled ``I'm  
not worthy of God'' before he used two steak knives to cut his 
throat at the Lansing home of his girlfriend and their 17-month-old 
twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was saying, ``You are Satan and you're going to hell''  
and ``I want to be saved, I want to meet God,'' when officers 
arrived, the police report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was a first-round draft pick by the Minnesota Vikings.  
He left the team without explanation a day after signing a 
five-year, $5.3 million contract, saying later that he was torn 
between his faith in God and his football career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins picked up Underwood on waivers in August. He came  
to Lansing last weekend to visit his family and had spent several 
hours in the Ingham County Jail Saturday night on a warrant 
accusing him of nonpayment of child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene was found Sept. 22 in a 5-foot-tall cooler in a dorm  
basement storage room. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleibecker said police think Greene got into the cooler on his  
own, then could not get out when the door closed and locked behind 
him. But they are continuing their investigation and hope to know 
more when toxicology reports are in. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a remote possibility it was a suicide,''  
Kleibecker said. But police think it's more likely the former 
Michigan State student was trying to find a place to stay, although 
they could not explain why he chose the cramped, unused cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Greene's parents' home were not returned.

	Ventura Urged To Leave Reform Party  
</P>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Reform Party chairman Russell Verney  
demanded today that Gov. Jesse Ventura resign from the party, 
saying the former wrestler ``brought shame'' to himself with a 
bombastic interview in Playboy magazine. Verney's letter to the 
Minnesota governor reflects rising bitterness inside the Reform 
Party as its fractious members seek a 2000 presidential nominee. 
The governor, whose frank talk got him elected in a November upset, 
told Playboy that organized religion ``is a sham,'' the Navy 
Tailhook scandal was ``much ado about nothing'' and fat people 
``can't push away from the table.''

	Japan Lifts Nuclear Plant Advisory  
</P>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- Recovering from its worst nuclear  
accident ever, the Japanese government on Friday lifted an advisory 
that had urged residents near a hobbled uranium reprocessing plant 
to stay home and shut their windows. But even as officials at the 
plant northeast of Tokyo said danger from radiation released 
Thursday was subsiding, fears persisted that people near the 
Tokaimura facility may suffer long-term effects from the accident. 
Police began investigating whether criminal negligence was 
involved.

	Russia Renounces Chechen Parliament  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian government announced Friday it  
no longer recognizes the democratically elected parliament of 
Chechnya, a sign that Moscow is seeking allies to possibly reassert 
power in the breakaway republic. Meantime, Russian jets continued 
to bomb targets across Chechnya, raids that have sent more than 
88,000 civilians fleeing to neighboring regions that have little 
capacity to care for them. It was not clear if the advance of 
Russian troops inside Chechnya was a limited move or the precursor 
to a full invasion.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Ending a long-standing conflict over the illegal  
sale of high-performance IBM computers to Russia, visiting U.S. 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Friday inaugurated a civilian 
computer center that would use them. The computer center is 
intended to help Russian researchers find civilian jobs as Sarov, a 
city that is home to a major nuclear research laboratory and 
nuclear weapons production center, converts from weapons research 
to peaceful work.

	Thailand Negotiates With Hostage-Takers  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A self-described 29-year-old student  
said he and the other armed Myanmar dissidents who took over their 
country's embassy would ``have to do something'' -- which could 
include killing hostages -- if a helicopter was not provided for 
them. Thai authorities continued to negotiate with the dissidents, 
who seized about 30 hostages, including some foreigners. The 
dissidents seek the release of political prisoners, a dialogue 
between Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the 
military, and the convening of an elected parliament.

	HUD Awards Vouchers to Working Poor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting dollars behind the effort to guide  
welfare recipients to employment, the government awarded $280 
million in vouchers designed to help about 50,000 families across 
the country. This initial distribution of the welfare-to-work 
vouchers by the Department of Housing and Urban Development will 
subsidize rents of low-income families receiving welfare or 
recently off welfare to enable them to rent apartments near 
available jobs, child care and transportation.

	Fishing War Brews in Canada  
</P>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- A Canadian Supreme Court court ruling giving  
Indians the right to unlicensed fishing year-around has drawn 
protests from some commercial fishermen, who claim the decision 
puts their jobs at risk. Atlantic lobstermen say they can now stand 
on shore and watch Micmac Indians harvest tons of lobster two 
months before the legal season starts. Some natives have reported 
being shot at, but so far there has been no outbreak of major

	Dow Slips 63.95 to 10,273  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed their slide today after new  
reports showed that the economy's surging growth has not slowed in 
recent months. The data renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates next week. The Dow industrials closed 
down 63.95 at 10,273.00 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.31 to 
2,736.85.

	Rockets To Trade Pippen to Portland  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a six-for-one deal, Scottie Pippen will be  
traded tomorrow from the Houston Rockets to the Portland Trail 
Blazers, The Associated Press has learned. The deal will send the 
disgruntled Pippen to Portland for Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, Walt 
Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers. It's a mixed 
blessing for Pippen, who wanted out of Houston but would have 
preferred to go to the Lakers so he could be reunited with Phil 
Jackson, his coach in Chicago when Pippen and the Bulls won six 
championships.

<HEADLINE> NYC Nixed Harassment Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city violated federal law when it turned  
away women who claimed they were sexually harassed by supervisors 
in the city's welfare-to-work program, the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission says. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency finding came in the case of a homeless mother of two  
who said her supervisor made unwanted sexual advances toward her in 
the weeks after she was selected for the program in 1997. She said 
that after she refused his advances, she lost her job and had to 
fight to keep her benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is investigating as many as 10 such other cases,  
lawyers said at a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The city contends the women were not employees and had no legal  
right to protection from sexual discrimination in the workplace, as 
provided by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorna Goodman, a lawyer for the city, said the women could still  
bring private lawsuits or pursue criminal assault charges over the 
alleged harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	EEOC lawyer Ellen Vargyas said federal regulations and court  
rulings have made clear that all anti-discrimination laws apply to 
welfare recipients in workfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter what you call them,'' she said. ``It boils  
down to: 'Does the alleged employer control the manner and means of 
work?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC is now required to attempt to eliminate the unfair work  
practices through persuasion and mediation. If that fails, the 
commission can take the city to court.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Violence to Fetuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House, over the objections of abortion  
rights lawmakers, has approved legislation that would make it a 
crime to harm a fetus during a violent act against a pregnant 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the bill, passed Thursday by a 254-172 vote,  
argued that the fetus should have the same legal protections as the 
mother from criminal assault. Opponents said it was another attempt 
to erode abortion rights guaranteed by the 1973 Roe vs. Wade 
Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The intent was not to reopen the abortion debate, insisted the  
bill's sponsor, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., but to ensure that the 
criminal who injures or kills a fetus ``is going to pay a separate 
debt to society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, calling it an ``unprecedented''  
effort to make the mother and fetus separate victims, threatened a 
presidential veto. Senate action on the bill this year is uncertain 
at best. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill still served as the most visible showdown this year  
between supporters and opponents of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Family Research Council spokeswoman Janet Parshall said  
recognizing ``the personhood of the preborn child'' was a 
``profoundly significant moment in pro-life history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and  
Reproductive Rights Action League, said the bill ``does nothing to 
protect women against violence'' and is meant ``to forge new legal 
ground that would eventually undermine'' the Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation makes it a separate offense to injure or kill a  
fetus in the commission of a federal crime of violence against a 
pregnant woman. 
</P>
<P>
	A person need not have knowledge of the pregnancy to be charged  
with harming a fetus. When an assailant intentionally kills or 
attempts to kill a fetus, the punishment is the same as that for 
similar acts against a person. 
</P>
<P>
	Exceptions are that the death penalty would not apply and the  
bill would not apply to abortions performed with the mother's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 24 states have laws concerning violence against fetuses,  
and Graham said federal laws must also allow a prosecutor to bring 
murder charges when a fetus dies in an attack that the mother 
survives. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you recognize the baby's need for prenatal care and  
reject the baby's right to protection from violence?'' House 
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, asked abortion rights 
supporters. ``I just can't believe anyone could be that cruel, 
heartless and selfish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the bill said its backers were equally callous in  
using a popular cause, stopping violence against women, to promote 
an anti-abortion agenda. ``This time they found a brand-new way of 
chipping away at a woman's right to choose,'' said Rep. Carolyn 
Maloney, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the most contentious abortion issue coming  
before Congress has been the effort to ban a form of late-term 
abortion opponents call ``partial birth abortion.'' But after two 
vetoes by President Clinton, the bill has not come up again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House issued a statement saying it would veto the  
``Unborn Victims of Violence Act'' in its present form. The Justice 
Department, in a letter to Congress in September, said the 
identification of a fetus as a separate and distinct victim of 
crime is ``unprecedented as a matter of federal statute'' and could 
be seen as ``gratuitously plunging the federal government'' into a 
complex religious and scientific issue. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats, led by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., offered a  
substitute that would have created a federal criminal offense for 
violence against pregnant women without mentioning the fetus. It 
was defeated 224-201. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2436.

<HEADLINE> Panel Clears Way for Amendment Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Victims of violent crime would be entitled to  
new protections under a proposed constitutional amendment headed to 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-5 Thursday in favor of  
the proposal. A similar version also is before the House Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the new rights.  
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors say such an amendment is needed because efforts by  
states to guarantee basic rights for crime victims are inconsistent 
or sometimes ignored. Opponents of amending the Constitution argue 
that federal legislation can achieve the same goal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hurdles for adoption remain high, despite the  
committee's action. Proposals to amend the Constitution require 
approval by two-thirds of the House and Senate, followed by 
ratification by three-fourths of the states. Few such proposals 
survive the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the measure, victims of violent crime would have the  
constitutional right to: 
</P>
<P>
	--Be notified and be present at public proceedings related to the  
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make statements to the court.  
</P>
<P>
	--Be notified of their assailant's release or escape from  
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	--Receive restitution from a convicted offender.  
</P>
<P>
	--Be notified of these rights.  
</P>
<P>
	--Have judges consider their safety before releasing a defendant.

<HEADLINE> Brush Fire Threatens Calif. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORONA, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters scrambled to contain a  
fast-moving brush fire that swept across 250 acres and forced 
authorities to order 200 families out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	One home was destroyed Thursday as the blaze scorched brush and  
citrus groves within a half-mile of Corona. At least two other 
homes were damaged in the area 40 miles east of Los Angeles, 
Riverside County spokeswoman Becky Luther said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evacuation centers were opened at Corona High School and Raine  
Intermediate School. As the blaze raced down hillsides from the 
Cleveland National Forest and into back yards, residents watched 
helplessly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary when you're in the bedroom and you're looking out  
the window and all you see are flames,'' said Peter Fischetti. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the scariest feeling in my life,'' added Elizabeth  
Arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Air tankers and helicopters were dropping fire retardant and  
water, but officials couldn't say when the fire might be contained. 
</P>
<P>
	Two brush fires also burned in San Diego County, and the  
region's largest blaze, just south of the Mexico border, forced 
about 70 families to evacuate a remote area near Tecate. 
</P>
<P>
	Calmer winds and cooler temperatures gave firefighters an edge  
against blazes in Northern California, but the stable air also made 
it difficult for them to breathe since the smoke wasn't dissipating 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in the Sierra foothills doubled in size to 31,300 acres  
Thursday, forcing the evacuation of about 50 homes scattered in the 
canyons, said Karen Terrill, spokeswoman for the California 
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning-sparked fires also burned in the Trinity Alps  
Wilderness and the Los Padres National Forest near Big Sur. 
Firefighters near Big Sur used mules to bring in supplies in the 
steep terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oregon, firefighters were battling at least five wildfires,  
including a controlled burn in a farm field that blew into a 
5,000-acre wildfire on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires also burned on the slopes of Mount Emily in Oregon's  
Siskiyou National Forest and along the Oregon Coast Range. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of wildfires have scorched more than 115,000 acres in  
California and Oregon in the past month.

<HEADLINE> Revlon Stock Plunges on Makeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Plans for a relatively minor makeover at Revlon  
Inc. were anything but attractive to investors Friday and the 
company's stock lost more than a third of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon, one of the best-known names in makeup and consumer  
products, disclosed it is getting out of the business of selling 
products through beauty salons and shedding some Latin American 
brands after billionaire Ronald O. Perelman failed to find a buyer 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon also surprised Wall Street with word that it would post a  
loss for this year, and have to restructure its $1.8 billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointed investors sent Revlon's shares tumbling 34 percent,  
or by $6.25, to $12 on the New York Stock Exchange. Revlon's shares 
had traded as high as $30.25 in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon, which makes Revlon and Almay makeup, Flex shampoo and  
Charlie perfume, has been struggling to pay its debts while sales 
of its lipsticks and eyeshadows are facing new competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get by this short-term bitter pill -- and it's a big one  
-- this really speaks to a strong 2000,'' said George Fellows, 
Revlon's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Perelman put Revlon on the auction block in April, and peddled  
the company to several rivals, including the Dutch fragrance 
company Coty Inc., but couldn't get the price he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conversations we had with a number of people didn't get to  
values we thought were appropriate,'' Fellows said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Revlon is currently negotiating to sell its salon  
products business, which includes the American Crew and Creative 
Nails brands. Revlon also will sell some of its Latin American hair 
care brands, including the Colorama, Juvena, and Plusbelle names. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the two businesses account for 20 percent of Revlon's  
$2.2 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for salon products ``is consolidating quickly and  
they really don't belong in it anymore. It isn't integral to their 
company, and the dollars are better spent elsewhere,'' said Allan 
Mottus, editor of The Informationist, an industry trade 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon expects to sell the businesses for a total of $500  
million, and use the money to pay down debt, much of it borrowed 
when Perelman bought the company in 1985 for $1.83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon, which uses model Cindy Crawford to promote its new  
shades, is fighting to protect its market from Johnson &AMP; Johnson's 
new Neutrogena line of makeup and Procter &AMP; Gamble's new Oil of 
Olay makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, companies like Gap and Victoria's Secrets have  
started selling their own makeup and body care lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon tried to pump up sales by flooding drugstore shelves with  
promotional products. But retailers got stuck with inventories of 
older products, and didn't put new items in the cosmetics counters 
fast enough, so they often missed the advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	To solve this problem, Revlon said it will cut product shipments  
$280 million through December. 
</P>
<P>
	The inventory problem has been ``an albatross we've been  
carrying around for a year now,'' said Fellows, adding he wished he 
had done this earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the cut in shipments coupled with worsening economic  
conditions in Brazil, South Africa and other overseas markets will 
lead to an operating loss of $70 million to $80 million for the 
year before additional charges for its restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third quarter alone, Revlon expects a net loss before  
restructuring charges of $3.10 to $3.20 a share. Wall Street had 
expected the New York-based company to earn 45 cents a share in the 
third quarter and 72 cents for the full year.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Reports 2 Minor Y2K Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department and National Science  
Foundation suffered minor computer failures blamed on the Year 2000 
technology problem on Friday, the first day of the government's new 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both problems were solved by the end of the day, according to  
the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion, which planned 
to monitor agencies through the weekend for additional reports of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we might have a handful of issues come up,'' said  
Jack Gribben, a spokesman for the council. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department reported that a purchasing system  
temporarily failed, and the science foundation reported problems 
with a system that provides information to grant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The date system for many federal computers on Friday rolled to  
2000 to mark the beginning of the government's fiscal year, 
offering an early taste of how the nation's computer systems may 
fare in the early hours of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Y2K problem exists because many older computers  
and software programs recognize only the last two digits of the 
year and could mistakenly interpret ``00'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all states and many companies started their fiscal years  
in July. Few problems were reported then. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Friday was the first government-wide date challenge  
related to Y2K, there have been other tests in recent months: A 
date change in a satellite navigation system caused some failures, 
including problems in Japan, where thousand of drivers complained 
about the loss of their mapping computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Sept. 9 passed with no reports of serious problems,  
amid concerns that some older computers might interpret ``9999'' as 
a command to stop operating.

<HEADLINE> Clients Say Broker Bilked Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A former broker allegedly bilked $6 million from  
clients, including friends and family members who are suing him to 
try and recover their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Martineau, 56, admitted the scheme in a note to family  
members left behind last year after an unsuccessful suicide 
attempt, The Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Martineau hasn't been charged with any crimes, but federal  
prosecutors and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are 
conducting an investigation, according to a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some plaintiffs are questioning whether his employer, Merrill  
Lynch, ignored warning signs of Martineau's dealings, which were 
unrelated to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch fired Martineau after learning of the alleged  
fraud last year, company spokesman Bill Halldin told The Associated 
Press early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``These private arrangements were never disclosed to Merrill  
Lynch, and did not occur in Merrill Lynch accounts,'' Halldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martineau declined comment to the Globe, but took responsibility  
for his actions in his suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't hold this against Merrill Lynch,'' the Globe  
quoted the note as saying. ``I was the problem. Desperate people do 
desperate things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martineau, who joined Merrill Lynch in 1979, wrote that in 1987  
he began advising some clients to invest in a venture he controlled 
called D&AMP;D Real Estate. The company claimed to make short-term 
loans to options traders and guaranteed an annual return of 11 
percent. He said he also faked some clients' signatures on wire 
transfer documents. 
</P>
<P>
	D&AMP;D Real Estate was ``nothing more than a pyramid scheme,''  
according to a lawsuit filed by a former client, Hans Viezens. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch said it had no idea of the alleged scheme until  
Martineau attempted suicide in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm has returned an undisclosed amount of money to clients  
who had money stolen, or who believed money was stolen, in a 
Merrill Lynch-backed investment, the Globe said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Told To Repay $1.4B Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Creditors on Friday rejected Ecuador's pleas for  
more time to renegotiate $6 billion in U.S.-guaranteed ``Brady 
bonds'' and demanded immediate repayment of $1.4 billion of its 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador defaulted on the bonds Thursday, missing a $44.5 million  
interest payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Brady bonds'', named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary  
Nicholas Brady, were issued in 1994 to restructure bad loans 
resulting from the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. They 
are partly backed by U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Though other nations have restructured their payments, Ecuador  
became the first to default. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by investors Friday gave impatient bondholders a  
``clear mandate'' to accelerate the repayment schedule, according 
to Andy Tuck, spokesman for Chase Manhattan Corp., which is the 
agent for creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bondholders know the cash-strapped South American country  
doesn't have the money to repay the first phase of $1.4 billion 
discount bonds. But they didn't want to go along with Ecuador's 
plan for renegotiating its payments out of fear of setting a 
precedent for other countries that owe billions in Brady bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The repayment demand Friday is likely to lead to defaults on the  
other Brady bonds, meaning Ecuador could soon end up owing the full 
$6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem of restructuring is complicated because no  
individual or institutional investor holds a majority of Ecuador's 
Brady bonds, and there appeared to be no coordinated group for 
Ecuadorian officials to negotiate with. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's president, Jamil Mahuad, said Thursday his government  
had signed a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund 
for a $400 million loan that could lead to $1.3 billion in overall 
international aid. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials urged Ecuador to develop a new economic strategy  
and reach a comprehensive accord with creditors before receiving 
the IMF loan. The deal hinges on Ecuador passing austerity measures 
and tax increases that most lawmakers there oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's total public debt is $13 billion and is expected to  
top 117 percent of the country's gross domestic product by the end 
of the year.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Has Quieter Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- People who live near LaGuardia and Reagan  
National airports had their first chance Friday to hear a new 
airplane that will replace noisier US Airways jets shuttling 
between New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9 a.m. shuttle between Washington and New York, as well as  
the 11 a.m. return trip, were flown on one of US Airways' new 
Airbus A-320s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to their high-bypass jet engines, the twin-engine planes  
leave noise footprints 10 times smaller than the route's current 
Boeing 727s at National and 17 times smaller on approaches or 
takeoffs at LaGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
	In each location, residents have long complained about aircraft  
noise. The switch for US Airways is particularly important because 
the airline makes hourly flights back and forth between the 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways also operates hourly shuttle service between  
LaGuardia and Boston's Logan International Airport. That route will 
begin receiving A-320s on Nov. 1, and Airbus airplanes will account 
for about three-quarters of the shuttle fleet by the end of the 
year.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Names Best Destinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some are popular vacation spots, some can be  
reached only through a long and costly trek. One has been visited 
by only a few people and one can be enjoyed without leaving the 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years in the making, National Geographic Traveler magazine  
has selected the 50 ``places of a lifetime -- the must-see spots for 
the complete traveler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are celebrating these places as the century turns, the  
places you should visit in your lifetime if you are a real 
traveler,'' said Keith Bellows, editor of the travel magazine 
published by the National Geographic Society. 
</P>
<P>
	These places, Bellows said, ``capture the spirit and diversity  
of our world ... each of them marks you indelibly when you 
experience it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 winners -- plus one bonus destination -- were picked from  
more than 500 nominations by National Geographic writers and 
editors along with outside advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the easiest to reach spot on the list, placed in the  
``world wonders'' category, is ``cyberspace ... a destination 
unlike any visited by humans before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Directions of how to get there and what to do once you arrive  
change with each person you ask. Attempting to map cyberspace is 
impossible because it is an unchartable land that exists in the 
ether, that halfway point between your computer and my computer,'' 
Traveler reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the most-visited scale is the 51st, or bonus  
location, space. 
</P>
<P>
	``My pockets filled with a picnic lunch, I float more than 150  
miles above the Earth and I look out of the spacecraft's windows; 
they are filled with Earth, heavenly Earth. She beckons and I 
follow,'' recalled astronaut Story Musgrave, one of the few to have 
ventured to this destination. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the 51 special locations is described in an essay by a  
guest writer, including former U. N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, Virgin Airlines founder Richard Branson, Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, actor Hugh Grant, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, singer 
Eartha Kitt and actor-comedian Robin Williams, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably the best-known and most widely visited locations on the  
list are found in the category Urban Spaces -- the cities that offer 
visitors history, entertainment and culture. Included are 
Barcelona, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jerusalem, London, New York, Paris, 
Rio de Janeiro, San Francisco and Venice. 
</P>
<P>
	Wild places, the ``last bastions of Eden,'' involve more exotic  
travel but also attract many visitors. They include Africa's 
Serengeti plain, ``a vast natural ecosystem where great herds of 
wildlife have annual migrations.'' Others in this category include 
the coral reefs of Papua New Guinea, Australia's vast outback and 
Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	Also exotic but less wild is the category Paradise Found -- the  
lovely islands of the Pacific Ocean, the Boundary Waters along 
Minnesota's border with Canada and the Torres del Paine National 
Park in southern Chile, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	The great outdoors in the Country Unbound category includes such  
spots as England's Lake District, California's Big Sur, the Alps 
and Coastal Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	And World Wonders features such grand locations as The Great  
Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, the Pyramids, Vatican City and 
cyberspace.

<HEADLINE> Illnesses Said Linked to Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLENSBURG, Wash. (AP) -- More than 40 people became sick this  
week after eating at a Jack in the Box restaurant in this central 
Washington community, health officials said. One woman was 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The illnesses did not appear to be linked to hepatitis or a  
strain of E. coli bacteria blamed for a 1993 outbreak that sickened 
hundreds of people and killed four, said Dr. James Gale, the 
Kittitas County health officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said they believe an employee who became ill  
during his shift on Monday may be the source of the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Tuesday, 45 cases of people with mild to moderate  
gastroenteritis have been confirmed, said Dr. Kiet Ly, an assistant 
county health officer. All but two had eaten at the restaurant 
Monday, Ly said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The only person admitted to the hospital was an elderly woman  
with pre-existing health problems who became dehydrated after 
suffering diarrhea, Ly said. Her illness was not considered 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 was linked to tainted  
hamburger meat distributed to Jack in the Box outlets in Washington 
and other Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Finn, a spokeswoman for San Diego-based Foodmaker Inc.,  
Jack in the Box's corporate owner, said the Ellensburg restaurant 
would remain closed until an investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	An inspection of the restaurant turned up no violations of  
health regulations, Ly said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Sign Center Zan Tabak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers, trying to protect  
themselves in case Rik Smits decides to retire, signed 7-foot free 
agent center Zan Tabak on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract weren't disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Tabak, 29, a native of Croatia, averaged 5.6 points and 3.7  
rebounds while playing with Houston, Toronto and Boston from 
1994-98. He signed with a team in Turkey when the NBA lockout 
threatened to cancel last season's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-4 Smits, bothered in recent years by sore feet, considered  
retirement at the end of last season but decided to return to the 
Pacers for at least one more year.

<HEADLINE> Pizza Hut Buys Rocket Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An international space race is on again, with  
advertisers competing to boldly go where they never have before. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not about which nation pushes farther in space exploration.  
Instead, it concerns which program gets more help in an era of 
shrinking budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian space program is getting a multimillion-dollar boost  
from Texas-based Pizza Hut, which will paint a 30-foot 
advertisement on a Proton rocket in November. NASA says it isn't 
far behind, with private partnerships envisioned to reduce costs 
for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the colonization of public space by commercial  
interests,'' said James Twitchell, a University of Florida 
professor who studies commercial culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut announced Thursday that it would pay the cash-starved  
Russian space agency about half the price of a 30-second TV ad 
during the Super Bowl -- currently up to $2.5 million -- for the 
right to paint its logo on a Russian Proton rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket is scheduled to blast off in mid-November with the  
living quarters for the international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The segment carrying the Pizza Hut logo will be cast off and  
burn up in the atmosphere before it reaches orbit. But Pizza Hut 
marketers are counting on the minutes leading up to liftoff and the 
sight of the engines firing under the company's red-roof logo to 
provide enough film footage to fuel years of advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect American spacecraft to look similar any time soon.  
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. law doesn't preclude placing corporate logos on  
American spacecraft, NASA would not consider it on taxpayer 
property, agency spokesman Brian Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Daniel Tam, NASA's assistant to the administrator for  
commercialization, said space agencies need to think about the 
marketing potential they can offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to find a way to get the commercial sector involved as  
fast as possible and effectively as possible so that we can ... 
move on to explore beyond the solar system,'' Tam said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said privatizing certain projects would free NASA to perform  
cutting-edge research and development toward far frontier 
explorations. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. space agency is considering some fully commercial  
shuttle flights in the future. And NASA officials have met with 
representatives of about 100 companies, in addition to aerospace 
contractors, on possible ties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, meanwhile, have used corporate advertising to  
their advantage before. PepsiCo Inc. paid $5 million three years 
ago to have cosmonauts float a replica of a soda can outside the 
Mir space station.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis News Ends Publication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis News ran its own obituary  
as the 130-year-old paper rolled off the presses Friday for the 
last time. 
</P>
<P>
	The headline across the top of the front page read ``Farewell''  
in 1 3/4-inch type. 
</P>
<P>
	A story with the sub-headline ``Put blame for closing on  
change'' cited television and changes in the workforce among the 
reasons for the demise of the afternoon newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Staffers of the city's oldest newspaper had prepared for the  
closing since July, when management announced it would cease 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been sad. We've shed some tears,'' said Jon Schwantes,  
public affairs editor of the News and its sister publication, The 
Indianapolis Star. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper was founded in 1869. Rumors of its demise had  
circulated for years as changes in lifestyles and mass media eroded 
its readership. In the end, there were only about 30,000 
subscribers -- down from about 100,000 a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star and the News merged newsroom staffs in 1995, and the  
News' late-afternoon edition ceased publication shortly after 
longtime publisher Eugene S. Pulliam's death on Jan. 21. Saturday 
editions of the papers were merged in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon newspapers have suffered declining circulation for  
years. In the past year, two others -- The Evansville Press and The 
Chattanooga Times -- ceased publication. When the Honolulu 
Star-Bulletin shuts down by the end of the month, there will be 46 
U.S. cities with two or more newspapers, according to figures 
compiled by The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Back Test Ban Vote Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An offer by Senate Republican leaders to force  
a vote on a long-languishing nuclear test-ban treaty won 
conditional Democratic support today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota told  
reporters he was attempting to negotiate a week's delay with 
Majority Leader Trent Lott and to buy more time for debate in an 
effort to win ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and Senate Democrats have made the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty a top priority and were caught by 
surprise Thursday by a Republican move to schedule a vote next 
week. Republicans say they have the votes to kill the 152-nation 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have long pushed for action on the treaty, but until  
this week GOP leaders had blocked action, bottling it up in the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott announced that he was prepared to call up the treaty Oct. 6  
and vote on it after 10 hours of debate, bypassing any hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle objected to the move Thursday and today made a  
counteroffer: a final vote Oct. 12, after 14 hours of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Daschle suggested that hearings might be held by  
the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees, since 
Foreign Relations, chaired by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., refuses to 
take it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he still resented Lott's efforts to force a vote  
with no, or limited, hearings. But he said the treaty is so 
important that Democrats couldn't afford to turn their backs on the 
offer for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides said Lott is expected to go along with the  
week's delay, at the very least. 
</P>
<P>
	And Daschle hinted that Democrats want to see a vote on the  
treaty even if not entirely on their terms. As to whether he could 
marshal the 67 votes needed for ratification, Daschle said, ``I 
don't know at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, a State Department official told reporters the  
administration needs ample time to make its case for the treaty. 
John Holum, the administration's top arms-control official, said he 
believes the votes could be mustered given enough time. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke before the Democratic efforts to delay the vote for  
just one week were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum said the treaty was of vital importance because, once it  
takes effect, it will be ``very difficult for new countries to 
develop nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of a vote next week prompted Defense Secretary  
William Cohen to decide today to cut short by one day his Asian 
trip so he can return to Washington and take part in the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's offer to bring up the long languishing treat divided  
Democratic ranks, with some treaty backers urging Daschle to accept 
the offer even if the administration lacked the apparent votes to 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bring it up next week,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a  
leading test ban activist. He said the offer was ``all right with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Kimball, director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear  
Dangers, a pro-treaty advocacy group, called Lott's offer 
disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a rush to judgment,'' he said. ``The Senate needs to  
hold fair hearings, have thorough debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms taunted apprehensive Democrats. ``The same people  
clamoring for action go running to the hills,'' he said. ``If it 
were not so pitiful, this behavior would be amusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which calls for an outright ban on nuclear testing,  
has been signed by 152 nations, including the United States. But it 
has only been ratified by 47 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulgaria and South Korea ratified the treaty just this week.  
</P>
<P>
	If all 45 Democrats support the treaty, as is expected, 22  
Republicans must vote ``yes'' for it to be ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of support for the pact clearly figured into the GOP change  
of strategy. Republican opponents of the pact said they were 
confident they would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, said he was optimistic Daschle could 
negotiate more than 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But if not, Biden suggested it was time to move ahead. ``I'm  
ready to roll the dice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said Democrats appear to be about 15 votes short. He  
suggested that 45 Democrats and seven Republicans currently support 
the treaty. But, he said, senators still ought to be forced to go 
on the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people to pay a political price'' for voting against a  
treaty that has wide support around the world, Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives contend the pact -- which also has not been  
ratified yet by Russia or China -- could threaten the U.S. ability 
to modernize its arsenal if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters argue the United States already has a vast  
superiority in nuclear weapons, thanks to more than 1,000 nuclear 
tests during the Cold War, and the test ban treaty would lock in 
that advantage.

<HEADLINE> Spending Rising Faster Than Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose in August but  
their spending climbed much faster, leaving the nation's savings 
rate matching a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income -- which includes wages, interest and government  
benefits -- rose 0.5 percent in August, the eighth straight monthly 
increase, the Commerce Department said today. The increase was a 
little faster than the 0.4 percent gain forecast by many analysts 
and followed a 0.2 percent increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	But spending went up 0.9 percent in August, more than many  
analysts had expected. That was the biggest increase since 
February, when spending grew by the same amount. Many analysts were 
forecasting a 0.7 percent increase in August. It rose 0.4 percent 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate, closely watched report today, the National  
Association of Purchasing Management said the nation's 
manufacturing sector grew in September for the eighth consecutive 
month, while prices of raw materials spurted to the highest level 
since May 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger-than-expected manufacturing performance was viewed  
as additional evidence of strong third-quarter economic growth 
after a lackluster second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, the Commerce Department said today that  
construction spending fell an unexpected 0.4 percent in August to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $692 billion, a sign that one of 
the economy's strongest sectors is beginning to slow. In July, 
construction spending declined 0.6 percent. Many analysts were 
forecasting a 0.6 percent rise in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on all private construction projects was down 1.1  
percent with decreases reported for single-family homes, hotels and 
motels and industrial projects, although spending on office 
buildings was up. Spending on big government projects, however, 
rose 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, seeking to slow the economy and keep  
inflation at bay, bumped up interest rates twice this summer, 
making borrowing more expensive. Fed policy-makers meet again on 
Tuesday and many economists doubt another rate increase is in the 
offing, although some say it is a close call. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued uncertainty about interest rates apparently was  
hurting stocks today. The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip 
industrial stocks lost more than 100 points in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Because consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the  
nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- has set a string of record lows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And in August, the savings rates was minus 1.5 percent, matching  
the record low set in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for the negative savings rate, economists say, is  
that the stock market is boosting Americans' net worth and making 
them more comfortable about dipping into savings to pay for their 
spending sprees. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's personal income and spending report also said wages rose  
0.6 percent in August, following a 0.7 percent gain in July. But 
farm proprietors' income fell 8.8 percent in August, reflecting the 
pattern of disaster relief subsidy payments to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, a big increase in those subsidy payments caused farm  
proprietors' income to surge, boosting overall personal income. In 
July, those payments decrease, causing farm proprietors' income to 
fall sharply and slow overall income growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket manufactured items  
expected to last at least three years, such as washing machines and 
cars -- rose 2.6 percent in August, compared with a decline of 0.7 
percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	For nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, spending went up by  
0.8 percent, more than the 0.3 percent gain the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the government reported that the nation's economic  
growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second 
quarter, the smallest gain in four years. However, many private 
economists believe that was only a temporary lull and are expecting 
growth in the existing third quarter to be considerably higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending in the second quarter rose at an annual rate  
of 4.8 percent. That was brisker than previously estimated but 
slower than the torrid 6.7 percent rate of spending in the first 
quarter. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total 
economic activity.

<HEADLINE> Rapids 1, Clash 0, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rapids failed to score for the third  
straight game but prevailed in a shootout for a 1-0 victory over 
the San Jose Clash on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rapids have gone 319 minutes of regulation without scoring  
and have managed just three goals over their last 11 games. The New 
York-New Jersey MetroStars hold the Major League Soccer record for 
the longest scoring drought, going 375 minutes without a goal 
earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado keeper Ian Feuer made three saves in regulation and  
turned away all three penalty kicks by the Clash (18-13) in the 
shootout for his eighth shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapids midfielder Anders Limpar returned to the lineup after  
missing 11 games with a strained left quadriceps. He scored the 
clinching penalty kick, beating San Jose keeper Joe Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rapids (20-10) missed a chance to gain ground in the Western  
Conference. Colorado is three points behind first-place Los Angeles 
with two games remaining. The Galaxy can clinch the conference 
title with a regulation victory Sunday against Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Plane Anti-Collision System Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new system designed to prevent runway  
collisions has been delayed two more years because of problems, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Airport Movement Area Safety System, a $90 million project  
being designed by Northrop Grumman Corp., originally was to have 
been put into the field in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	A revised schedule specified deployment next August. Now the  
Federal Aviation Administration says ``human factors and software 
development problems'' will delay launch until September 2002 at a 
yet-to-be-determined cost, according to a report in next Monday's 
Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	A runway collision led to the single deadliest airline accident,  
the 1977 collision of two Boeing 747s in the Canary Islands that 
killed 538 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, there 292 so-called runway incursions, when an aircraft  
comes too close to a vehicle or object on the ground. The FAA's 
goal has been to reduce them 15 percent per year. Instead, 
incursions rose in 1998 by 11.3 percent to 325.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Tells NCAA of Hoops Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri self-reported today possible NCAA  
recruiting violations with the first two prospects to announce 
commitments to new men's basketball coach Quin Synder, the 
university's athletic director said. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri athletic director Mike Alden called the NCAA after the  
St. Louis Post-Dispatch raised questions about the mothers of 
basketball prospects Rickey Paulding and Arthur Johnson riding on a 
plane chartered by Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he contacted the NCAA today and asked officials to  
investigate ``a possible infraction.'' The call followed one 
Wednesday to the Big 12 Conference, which advised Missouri that it 
would be ``beneficial'' to notify the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if an infraction has indeed taken place,'' Alden  
said. ``The NCAA is the only one that can determine if an 
infraction has taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding and Johnson, both seniors from Detroit, orally  
committed to Missouri last week. But their status is in question 
because their mothers flew with them on a plane chartered for their 
official visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not permissible for the parents to fly with the prospect  
whether it's on the institution's plane or a noncommercial 
charter,'' said Steve Mallonee, director of NCAA membership 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules state that a school can use commercial flights or  
noncommercial flights -- the school's own plane, charter or private 
planes -- to bring prospects to campus for official visits. But 
relatives, friends and legal guardians can accompany prospects only 
on commercial flights. On those flights, the prospect's fare is 
paid by the school. Anyone accompanying the prospect must pay his 
or her own way. 
</P>
<P>
	But Missouri officials said their interpretation of the rules  
was that a prospect could be accompanied on a noncommercial flight 
if the extra party paid fair market value for the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The visits in question took place the weekend of Sept. 17-19.  
Alden said the mothers of both recruits prepaid between $200 and 
$300 for the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our understanding, and we're pretty confident, that a  
number of schools around the country do this,'' Alden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said there's room for interpretation in any ``legal  
documentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, however, said that there is no gray area on that  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule was not intended for parents to get on the plane and  
reimburse because then you get into, `What is an appropriate rate?' 
'' Mallonee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents are supposed to fly commercial. In most instances,  
kids go commercial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said the university was eager to determine whether an  
infraction had taken place. Missouri's compliance office already 
had begun investigating the matter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel confident in the process. I feel confident in our  
basketball program. And, I feel confident in the NCAA,'' Alden 
said. ``Do I feel confident in a great result? I have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said he bears responsibility if an infraction had taken  
place. ``Unequivocally I do,'' he said. ``I'm the head basketball 
coach. That's what it means to be the head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowsi said today that she could not  
confirm whether Missouri has been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospects could be declared ineligible before the Nov. 7  
signing day. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NCAA, if a rule is broken, it is up to the  
school to report the violation, then declare the prospect 
ineligible to play at that school -- at least temporarily.

<HEADLINE> Rockets To Trade Pippen to Portland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen's brief stint with the Houston Rockets is over,  
just eight months after it began. 
</P>
<P>
	In a six-for-one deal, Pippen will be traded Saturday to the  
Portland Trail Blazers, The Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, first reported earlier this week by media outlets in  
Houston and Portland, will send the disgruntled Pippen to Portland 
for Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, Walt Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw 
and Carlos Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a mixed blessing for Pippen, who wanted out of Houston but  
would have preferred to go to the Lakers so he could be reunited 
with Phil Jackson, his coach in Chicago when Pippen and the Bulls 
won six championships. 
</P>
<P>
	KRIV-TV in Houston reported Friday night the deal is imminent,  
and two league officials, speaking on condition they not be 
identified, told the AP the deal will be done Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes just days after Pippen went public with negative  
remarks about the Rockets and his teammate in Houston, Charles 
Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets could not be reached for comment, and a Blazers  
spokeswoman said she had no knowledge of an impending trade. 
Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton, could not immediately be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers had to give up six players in order to make the  
trade work under NBA salary cap guidelines. Pippen will make more 
than $14 million this season, and Portland had to put that amount 
of salaries together. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite parting with so many players, Portland didn't give  
up a starter. Pippen will join Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf as 
additions to an improved Trail Blazers team that made it to the 
Western Conference finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets were eager to part with Pippen and his $67 million  
five-year contract, which still has four seasons remaining, 
following a poor 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was somewhat of a disappointment, averaging 14.5 points  
and shooting just 43 percent from the field while complaining 
throughout the season that the Rockets' slow-down style of offense 
hindered his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen blasted Barkley on Wednesday in an ESPN interview, saying  
he ``doesn't show the desire to want to win.'' The attack came 
after Barkley criticized Pippen in August for publicly lobbying for 
a trade to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley complained he had sacrificed greatly in February to make  
salary-cap room in order for the Rockets to acquire Pippen from the 
Bulls in a sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's creating all this controversy just to get traded,''  
Barkley said Thursday. ``He wants to get traded so bad that he'll 
just say anything to make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 34, is a seven-time All-Star and two-time Olympian who  
won his six titles with the Bulls as the second option behind 
Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players acquired by Houston averaged double figures  
in points last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a seven-year veteran, will be joining his fifth NBA  
team. The 6-foot-8 forward averaged between 10.3 and 17.0 points in 
his first six seasons before dropping to 9.3 last season as a 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Augmon, a defensive specialist, will be entering his eighth NBA  
season with his fourth team. Cato, a 6-foot-11 center, is entering 
his third season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, acquired by Portland in the Steve Smith-Isaiah Rider trade  
over the summer, averaged 4.9 points for the Hawks last season. 
Shaw and Rogers barely played last season and might not even make 
the Rockets' roster for the regular season.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Cook Won't Appeal Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even though he decided not to appeal his  
one-game suspension for bumping the cap of an umpire, New York Mets 
reliever Dennis Cook does not think his punishment was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving the suspension and $2,000 fine Thursday from the  
National League for ``overly aggressive behavior and making contact 
with an umpire,'' Cook said he would ask the players' association 
to appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	He changed his mind Friday and sat out the Mets' game against  
the Pittsburgh Pirates. Cook donated his fine to a local Little 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	``One game and $2,000 in my opinion is still too steep,'' Cook  
said. ``But an appeal wasn't going to do any good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook was removed from the Mets' 9-3 loss to Atlanta on Tuesday  
night after walking Gerald Williams in the eighth inning. Cook got 
into an animated argument with plate umpire Alfonzo Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
	During the argument, Cook's cap bumped the cap of Marquez, one  
of the 25 new umpires hired this month. Cook also drew a line with 
dirt over the plate to point out where he thought his pitches went. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't initiate any contact,'' Cook contended.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mets had their problems with the umpiring crew, that  
included two replacement umpires. The crew chief, union president 
Jerry Crawford, was not behind the plate for any of the games in 
the Braves' series despite being the most experienced member of the 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Steve Phillips even called the league office  
during Thursday night's game to complain that plate umpire Phil 
Cuzzi, another new ump, refused to check with the first- and 
third-base umpires on check swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Valentine was ejected in the 11th inning after  
arguing balls and strikes with Cuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't need the added frustration of playing a game  
like this with these umpires,'' Valentine said Thursday night. 
``The season is going to be over in a week, so we're not going to 
have to worry about this nonsense. But it's hard for me to justify 
in my mind it was correct to have guys who never umpired in this 
situation umpiring.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Raise Campaign Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- President Clinton went to Paris on Friday and  
raised money for Democrats at the Eiffel Tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris is a hotel and casino in this resort town, with a  
spiraling replica of the famous tower on top. Inside the tower was 
a restaurant where Clinton addressed about 40 supporters at a 
luncheon that brought in $300,000 for the Democratic Senatorial 
Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've already had more dreams fulfilled than I could have asked  
for in 10 lifetimes, but I never dreamed I'd actually get to give a 
speech in the Eiffel Tower,'' Clinton joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's luncheon began a weekend of fund-raisers that were  
expected to raise $2.5 million for Democrats. Afterward, the 
president headed to Palo Alto, Calif., for a reception and dinner 
raising $625,000 for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest take, $850,000, was coming from a Saturday night  
dinner in Los Angeles organized by ANGLE, Action Now for Gay and 
Lesbian Equality, to benefit the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. More than 600 people are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the biggest events we've ever done outside of  
Washington,'' said DCCC spokesman John Del Cecato. ``This will be 
the most successful event that the DCCC has done with the gay and 
lesbian community, ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Friday fund-raiser's host was Arthur Goldberg, chief  
executive officer of Park Place Entertainment, which owns Paris. 
Goldberg credited Clinton with making the United States ``the 
greatest country in the world'' -- and gave the president a 
political title he's never held. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I met the distinguished gentleman with the grayish hair  
on my left, he was a senator who really gave long speeches for his 
convention,'' Goldberg said, referring to Clinton's long-winded 
address at the 1988 Democratic convention. ``We knew what would lay 
ahead. He has continued that friendship and has never forgotten the 
people who were with him early on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg's role Friday is indicative of a trend in the casino  
industry toward lobbying and contributing to campaigns. Harrah's 
has contributed more than $1 million since 1995. Mirage boosted its 
giving from $159,800 in 1995-96 to $528,846 in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt flew to Las  
Vegas to pick up a $250,000 check from Mirage. In August, House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert raised $600,000 at a Las Vegas lunch with 
casino executives, calling their business ``a great industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said those at Friday's reception had ``a sense of  
enlightened self-interest'' in their political choices. ``You're 
intelligent enough to support Democrats so you can continue to live 
like Republicans,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the $56 million that Texas Gov. George W. Bush has  
raised for his GOP presidential bid and said he was thinking of 
counting Bush's fund-raising success ``as one of the economic 
achievements of my tenure in office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't discriminate. We allowed the Republicans to make  
money too in this economy,'' Clinton said. ``It's not our fault if 
they decide to spend it in a way different than we would like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that while he can't run for the White House again  
he'd like to choose the theme song for the 2000 election -- ``Don't 
Stop Thinking About Tomorrow,'' the same Fleetwood Mac tune he used 
for his 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every country must always have its eyes pointed toward  
tomorrow,'' Clinton said. ``The question is not whether America 
will change, it is how America will change, and whether we will 
build on what we have done that is working ... or whether we will 
basically veer off and go back to an approach that got us into an 
awful lot of trouble before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of fund-raising, the president also planned to spend  
time with daughter Chelsea, who is beginning her junior year at 
Stanford University, and do some preparation work for his 
presidential library. He returns to Washington on Monday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Backs Off Benefit Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders backed away Friday  
from their plan to slow income-support payments to working poor 
people as a backlash to the idea grew within their own party. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not yet jettisoning the proposal, lawmakers and aides  
acknowledged they were looking for other ways to raise the $8.7 
billion that they had expected the plan to save in the budget for 
fiscal 2000, which began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain joined George W. Bush as the second Republican  
presidential contender criticizing the idea. And House GOP 
moderates and Senate Republicans predicted the plan's demise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to knee-jerk anything right now,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said after a meeting with rank-and-file 
lawmakers. ``We need to assess, to see where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hastert and House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,  
said, ``I don't know,'' when asked if there were enough votes to 
push the plan through the House. The GOP's margin in the chamber is 
so slight that five defecting Republicans can kill one of the 
party's initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Republicans, the worry was that the proposal had become  
a political distraction from the party's high-profile goal of 
protecting Social Security surpluses and would be used against them 
by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It positions us in a way that is not desirable, that will be  
used to portray the party as insensitive and uncaring,'' said Rep. 
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The decisive blow seemed to have been dealt Thursday by Bush,  
the party's leading presidential contender, when he said 
Republicans shouldn't ``balance their budget on the backs of the 
poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless he says, 'I had this all wrong,' then I think it's dead  
on arrival,'' said Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said that the plan had been described to the campaigns  
of Bush and other GOP candidates before it was introduced, and that 
congressional Republicans got no response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that we'd have a future dialogue on these kind of  
issues,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, approved Thursday by the House Appropriations  
Committee, would convert into 12 monthly payments the lump-sum 
payment almost all 20 million recipients of the earned-income tax 
credit now get. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said each beneficiary would receive the same amount  
of money as now. Opponents said the change would deny recipients 
the big cash infusion many now use to buy expensive items. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they propose to do is unconscionable,'' Clinton said  
Friday, reiterating his promise to kill the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers and aides said the proposal might gain public  
acceptance -- and House votes -- if they did a better job of selling 
it. They said they had to emphasize that benefits from Social 
Security and many other income-support programs are already paid 
monthly. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from his meeting with Republicans, Hastert said, ``You  
just can't duck your head and run every time there's a shot 
fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the GOP's disarray, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,  
R-Texas, the plan's sponsor, said of Republicans at the same 
meeting, ``I didn't think they understood it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, where Republicans have been critical of the idea  
since it first surfaced last month, Majority Leader Trent Lott said 
he viewed the proposal as temporary in the House GOP's search for 
savings to pay for spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, I think the House and Senate will find other ways  
to proceed with the problem, and we'll decide not to do that,'' 
Lott, R-Miss., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, McCain, R-Ariz., told The Associated Press that  
Republicans should instead cut ``pork and wasteful spending'' from 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our goal is to have lower-income Americans lifted up into  
the middle class, this is the wrong way to do it,'' said McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and aides said other savings options Republicans were  
exploring included making their plan to switch from lump-sum to 
monthly payments optional, and cutting spending bills across the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, most of the money under the $30 billion  
income-support program is paid early in the year, when 
beneficiaries file income-tax returns. Under the plan, the payments 
would be spread out so that $8.7 billion would be paid after Sept. 
30, 2000 -- spilling into fiscal 2001, and out of the books for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old program is designed to supplement the earnings  
of workers who earn between $10,000 and $31,000 and owe little or 
no income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Friday, the House approved two more compromise  
spending bills for the new fiscal year, readying them for Senate 
action and Clinton's expected signature. 
</P>
<P>
	A $69 billion agriculture bill was passed 240-175, and a $51  
billion transportation measure was approved 304-91.

<HEADLINE> Forest Health Tops Overhaul Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forest health would top all other Forest  
Service priorities under a proposed overhaul of rules for governing 
191 million acres of federal forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service officials said Thursday the new rules, which are  
being revised for the first time since 1982, represent a dramatic 
departure from past agency practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual forest plans would be more flexible and would be  
written with more involvement from scientists and the public in an 
effort to reduce conflict and lawsuits over how federal lands are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving a greater voice to those who own the forests;  
that is, the American people,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman, whose department includes the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are used as a guide by local forest administrators who  
craft management plans for 155 national forests. The plans govern 
all activity on the land, such as where tourists can hike, camp or 
ski, and where logging and mining are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for more than two-thirds of the forests are due for  
revision in the next three years, so updating the broader rules has 
been a top agency priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists said the proposed rules are an improvement  
over existing regulations that place forest ecology on the same 
level as logging, recreation and other forest uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They clearly have it written down that this (the environment)  
is their top responsibility,'' said Mary Munson of Defenders of 
Wildlife in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But groups that rely on forests for income worried that the new  
rules are a road map to logging crackdowns. Timber harvests on 
federal lands are already down about 70 percent in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic premise of the new planning regulations is dangerous  
for local communities,'' said Laura Cleland of the Independent 
Forest Products Association in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials said they remain committed to forest uses such  
as logging but recognize that no activities are possible unless the 
land is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest managers would consult with outside groups in crafting  
forest plans, and citizens could file formal objections before 
plans are completed rather than after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent scientists would help write and then review the  
plans, which would be easier to change when new data about science 
or public preferences becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're announcing really a new way of doing business,''  
Agriculture Undersecretary Jim Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will look more closely at practices such as  
clear-cutting forests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists opposed attempted rules updates in 1991 and  
1994, saying the rules lacked protections for plants and animals. 
But they praised the protections in the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists voiced worries, however, that local forest  
managers may have too much discretion in getting around rule 
requirements.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Veto Nuclear Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- President Clinton assured Nevada's two senators  
Friday that he will oppose a Republican attempt at compromise over 
disposal of nuclear waste in their state. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the two senators aboard Air Force One en route to  
Las Vegas that he will veto a Senate nuclear waste bill -- should it 
pass Congress -- because it would relax safeguards against radiation 
exposure at a permanent disposal site being considered in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The assurances echoed a statement issued in Washington by the  
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday's nuclear accident in Japan is a tragic reminder  
that we must do everything in our power to ensure safe, responsible 
handling of radioactive material,'' Clinton said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he reviewed the bill in its current form and  
``determined that it would not adequately ensure the protection of 
public health and safety. If this bill is presented to me in its 
current form, I will veto it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was crafted by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, last  
July in an attempt to break a five-year deadlock over what to do 
with thousands of tons of used reactor fuel now kept at power 
plants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would keep waste at the reactor sites temporarily,  
although the government would take title pending a decision on a 
permanent waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to reporters before leaving Washington, Clinton  
brought up the proposed waste site and said he would ``bend over 
backwards'' to assure that the site will be a safe repository for 
used reactor fuel that will be highly radioactive for more than 
10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that ``the majority of members of Congress''  
favor the Senate bill, which is expected to be considered by the 
full Senate in the coming weeks. No House action has been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard Air Force One en route to Las Vegas, Clinton discussed  
the legislation with Nevada Sens. Harry Reid and Richard Bryan. The 
two Democrats have vowed to use any parliamentary tactic to block 
its passage. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Murkowski said the legislation  
represents a compromise because it agrees to Clinton administration 
demands that the waste temporarily be kept at reactor sites. Many 
in the nuclear industry want a temporary storage facility to be 
built in Nevada until Yucca Mountain is available. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's threatening to veto a bill that hasn't even come to the  
Senate yet,'' Murkowski said. ``What's his proposal to address the 
issue of nuclear waste when 20 percent of our power in this country 
comes from nuclear energy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	By law the government must assume responsibility for the waste,  
and several utilities have filed lawsuits claiming breach of 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Murkowski bill also would require that responsibility  
for determining maximum radiation exposure levels at the future 
Yucca Mountain site be shifted from the Environmental Protection 
Agency to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, and most environmentalists as well as  
Nevada's senators, strongly object to such a change, contending 
that it would reduce radiation protection. The EPA indicates it 
wants a much more stringent radiation standard than that acceptable 
to the NRC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department is proceeding with the scientific  
evaluation of the Yucca site for eventual waste burial with a final 
decision on its suitability expected within two years. The 
repository could be completed by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada officials have complained for years that the waste site  
was pushed on the state by Congress in 1987. Potential sites in 
Texas and Washington state were eliminated from consideration, the 
Nevadans say, because other lawmakers wanted to make sure it wasn't 
built in their state. 
</P>
<P>
	About the Yucca site, Clinton said Friday: ``My feeling (is)  
that at the time it was selected there was some science in there, 
but perhaps some politics too, since Nevada was a small state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have wanted not to see this issue politicized, but to bend  
over backwards to do everything we can to deal with the nuclear 
safety issue before we adopt this course.''

<HEADLINE> Rome Streets Named for Celebrities </HEADLINE>

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- All roads may lead to Rome, but judging by the names  
chosen for some of the Eternal City's new streets, visitors may 
think they wound up in Hollywood.

	The City Council paid homage to Marilyn Monroe, Greta Garbo,  
Italian actress Silvana Mangano, comedian Buster Keaton and John 
Lennon when it announced the names of new streets Friday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Soccer League Bans Cheering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- No parents cheering. No coaches barking orders.  
</P>
<P>
	The soccer fields of the Northern Ohio Girls Soccer League will  
sound like a monastic retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed up with screaming, know-it-all coaches and parents, the  
league has banned cheering for this weekend's games, a plan dubbed 
``Silent Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want kids to be able to learn and to be able to think and  
play without the constant yelling,'' league president Al Soper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the league for 3,800 girls ages 8 to 14 had  
previously discussed a possible noise ban. But Soper decided to 
silence the crowds after refereeing a boys' soccer tournament 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted earplugs,'' he said. ``The crowd was so loud, kids  
couldn't hear the whistle, talk to each other, develop combinations 
or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some national organizations have adopted guidelines and programs  
to restrain bad parental behavior at athletic events, but Fred 
Engh, president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports, said the 
cheering ban was the first of its kind that he was aware of in any 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Engh's organization recently created the Parents Association for  
Youth Sports, a training program with a code of ethics that 
instructs parents to ``remember that the game is for youth -- not 
for adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engh thinks a silent Sunday is a great idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``Parents have lost perspective of what youth sports are all  
about,'' he said. ``This is a wake-up call, a giant timeout for 
adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Monday the father of a high school soccer player  
was charged with punching one of his son's opponents during a high 
school game in suburban Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Soper said that after his league announced the plan for silence  
earlier this month, several smaller leagues tested the concept at 
some of their games with success -- measured in subdued crowds and 
happy players. 
</P>
<P>
	Although parents and coaches in the Northern Ohio Girls League  
won't be given a red card for cheering, Soper hopes the stands will 
be completely silent when players take the field. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those players is 13-year-old Joceyln Predina, who said  
the quiet crowds will be a nice change. She said she doesn't like 
it when abuse is hurled at referees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be better on Sunday,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Joceyln isn't too worried about losing out on accolades if she  
makes a big play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be weird if people aren't saying anything,'' she  
said. ``It's nice to hear cheering. But sometimes the crowd just 
takes it too far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Pavlovich, a coach, referee and member of the league's  
board of directors, said some coaches and parents were skeptical 
when the league first announced the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``But every single player I've talked to is thrilled with the  
idea,'' Pavlovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Going noise-free for an entire season is unlikely, officials  
say. But if Sunday goes according to plan, the league will consider 
having another silent day in spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is for the kids,'' Soper said. ``If the parents and  
coaches weren't there, and we threw a ball onto the field, the kids 
would still want to play.''

<HEADLINE> PGA Head Doesn't Regret Celebration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- The head of the PGA of America  
is not faulting American team members for their much-maligned burst 
of enthusiasm on the 17th green of last weekend's Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he says the players and wives who mobbed Justin Leonard  
after he sank a 45-foot putt were simply showing the kind of 
emotion so lacking in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come to expect our players to walk around like they're  
carrying a briefcase,'' Awtrey, CEO of the PGA of America, which 
runs the international competition, said Thursday. ``We saw they're 
human and they get excited. We had 12 Sergios (Garcia) out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Awtrey said, though, that he did regret the celebration took  
place before Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal had a chance at a 25-foot 
putt that could have kept his match with Leonard alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame the celebration on 17 didn't occur after Jose's  
putt,'' Awtrey said. ``But I don't think -- and I was there -- it had 
anything to do with the outcome of the match. To let something as 
small as that overshadow what the Ryder Cup is all about, I don't 
think it's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Awtrey agreed that American fans need to be stopped  
from heckling players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have low tolerance with fans who cross the line.  
People were taken out of the stands, I don't know how many, but 
that's probably what we'll have to do more of.''

<HEADLINE> Season Removes Cloud From Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- It's a welcome change around Cincinnati -- the  
Reds are making headlines for something other than Marge Schott's 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds are bucking the small-market blues by contending for  
the playoffs with a limited budget and boundless enthusiasm. 
They've turned into baseball's darlings and revived the franchise 
with a season that defies the odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been getting a lot of calls lately from all over the  
country,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``I think we're the 
sentimental favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody would like to see us go far, all the way to  
the World Series, because we're scrappy and we have an interesting 
bunch of guys and we have a low payroll. I don't think the 
big-money guys would like to see us get in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big-money guys have dominated the playoffs in recent years  
as salaries escalated and the gap widened between the haves and 
have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams like the Reds, who had a $33 million opening day payroll,  
usually drop out of contention as the season wears on. This team 
hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day off Thursday, the Reds finish the season with three  
games at Milwaukee that will decide whether they make the playoffs. 
They're tied for first in the NL Central with Houston and two games 
ahead of New York for the wild card following the Mets' 4-3 loss to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't have scripted it any better,'' first baseman Sean  
Casey said. ``We're going into the last weekend of the season with 
the postseason on the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have held their own against teams that have outspent  
them 2-to-1. The six major league teams that already have clinched 
playoff berths had opening day payrolls ranging from $61 million to 
$85 million. The Mets' payroll was $63 million, while Houston's was 
$52 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said we were supposed to be here,'' cleanup hitter Greg  
Vaughn said. ``We were supposed to pack our bags and fly to 
Milwaukee for the last series and then go on our way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forced to do more with less, the Reds have gotten by with a few  
stars surrounded by young players and role players who have done 
their jobs without complaint. Together, they've reveled in the role 
of underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire was so impressed by the Reds' spirit last weekend  
that he wanted to talk about them, not his latest record-tying 
homers during a series at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the perfect example of what the game is all about,''  
McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the Reds have been the perfect example of what  
was wrong with baseball. Schott received punishments for 
inflammatory comments and the team went three years without a 
winning record as it slashed payroll and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott has been muzzled by baseball and is in her final days as  
owner -- she has agreed to sell control of the team to three limited 
partners for $67 million, a deal that should be signed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the spotlight has been on players like Casey, who  
arrived last year in a trade and is so personable that he's known 
as ``The Mayor'' because he seems to befriend everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are people,'' Casey said. ``I always think everyone  
wants to have a good conversation, if you can have it. Maybe I seem 
a little naive. I just enjoy people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have been a good conversation piece since the  
offseason, when general manager Jim Bowden substantially improved 
his club through trades and free-agent signings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds got the kind of break that a small-market team needs to  
compete when the San Diego Padres offered Vaughn, who was coming 
off a 50-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has hit 43 homers, driven in 114 runs and become the  
first player in franchise history with 40 homers, 100 RBIs and 15 
steals in a season. He carried the team through September with 14 
homers, matching Frank Robinson's franchise record for one month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the one that took all the pressure off our young  
players,'' Bowden said. ``You don't go out and get 40-homer, 
100-RBI guys, and you don't win without them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only downside to the season has been the fans' reluctance to  
get carried away by it. The Reds drew 2 million for the first time 
since 1993, but had hoped for more. 
</P>
<P>
	In their World Series championship season of 1990, the Reds drew  
2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a few bad years, it takes the fans a while to get  
serious,'' McKeon said. ``They say, `Are they for real or not?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds picked up for the last home series, when the Reds made  
one remarkable comeback after another that proved they're for real. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very special team,'' catcher Eddie Taubensee said.  
``I'm having more fun this year than I ever have. Whether we make 
the playoffs or not, it's something I'll never forget.''

<HEADLINE> Ditka Says Williams Won't Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- New Orleans Saints rookie running back Ricky  
Williams' hyperextended elbow will keep him out of Sunday's game 
against the Chicago Bears ``unless there's an unbelievable 
change,'' coach Mike Ditka said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said he made the decision after reading comments Williams  
made Thursday during his weekly talk with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can do a little bit of everything, but I can't do anything  
really well,'' Williams said after practice Thursday, saying the 
brace he wears makes it hard to feel the ball or switch hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also noted he had not taken a real hit in practice  
since being injured Sept. 19 against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he comes up to me and says, `I can take any hit they give  
me. I can roll. I can hit. I can do anything.' That's a different 
story, but he can't do that right now, and maybe it was wishful 
thinking on my part, and I take the blame for that. I really do,'' 
Ditka said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Williams can't play, Lamar Smith is likely to be the starter  
at halfback. Williams is the Saints' leading rusher with 120 yards 
on 32 carries, but Smith has averaged 5.1 yards with 77 yards on 15 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Frequent questions about Williams and other personnel decisions  
for Sunday's game clearly angered Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't we just call Chicago and tell them what the hell  
we're going to do?'' he asked. ``Just call them on the phone. Tell 
them, we're not going to do this. Just call them up. I told you 
after I answered the first thing, let it go. Why do you keep doing 
this to me? That bugs me. It really bugs me.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson Lectures Media Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Concerned about the portrayal of  
minorities, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is turning his attention to the 
people who own media outlets more than those who run them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who has called for Federal Communications Commission  
hearings on the effect of media mergers on minorities, warned 
broadcasters from across the country on Thursday that consolidation 
of media ownership homogenizes the culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many people's real needs are not met in the scenario of a  
concentrated ownership arrangement,'' he said at the annual 
convention of the Radio and Television News Directors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was challenged by other members of a panel addressing  
the broadcasters. Erica Farber, publisher of the trade magazine 
Radio &AMP; Records, said consolidation in radio has had the opposite 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the industry is so much more willing to take on new  
ideas,'' she said. ``There's so much more diversity in formats than 
there was 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pittman, president of America Online, and Michael  
Bloomberg, founder of the multimedia news service that bears his 
name, both said the Internet allows for many more voices in media. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six months, two years from now, everyone is going to have  
their own radio and television station,'' Bloomberg said, ``and I'm 
not so sure that's a good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson countered that the powerful media owners are much more  
able to drive the public agenda than would-be moguls. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the RTNDA teamed up with a few minority journalism  
groups to encourage radio and television stations to hire more 
minorities. The percentage of minorities in electronic newsrooms 
has slipped from a high of 21 percent three years ago to 19 percent 
now, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization steered clear of the question about minority  
ownership of the media. John Sears, RTNDA chairman, said his group 
will concentrate on what its members can control.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Tells NCAA of Hoops Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri self-reported today possible NCAA  
recruiting violations with the first two prospects to announce 
commitments to new men's basketball coach Quin Synder, the 
university's athletic director said. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri athletic director Mike Alden called the NCAA after the  
St. Louis Post-Dispatch raised questions about the mothers of 
basketball prospects Rickey Paulding and Arthur Johnson riding on a 
plane chartered by Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he contacted the NCAA today and asked officials to  
investigate ``a possible infraction.'' The call followed one 
Wednesday to the Big 12 Conference, which advised Missouri that it 
would be ``beneficial'' to notify the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if an infraction has indeed taken place,'' Alden  
said. ``The NCAA is the only one that can determine if an 
infraction has taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding and Johnson, both seniors from Detroit, orally  
committed to Missouri last week. But their status is in question 
because their mothers flew with them on a plane chartered for their 
official visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not permissible for the parents to fly with the prospect  
whether it's on the institution's plane or a noncommercial 
charter,'' said Steve Mallonee, director of NCAA membership 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules state that a school can use commercial flights or  
noncommercial flights -- the school's own plane, charter or private 
planes -- to bring prospects to campus for official visits. But 
relatives, friends and legal guardians can accompany prospects only 
on commercial flights. On those flights, the prospect's fare is 
paid by the school. Anyone accompanying the prospect must pay his 
or her own way. 
</P>
<P>
	But Missouri officials said their interpretation of the rules  
was that a prospect could be accompanied on a noncommercial flight 
if the extra party paid fair market value for the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The visits in question took place the weekend of Sept. 17-19.  
Alden said the mothers of both recruits prepaid between $200 and 
$300 for the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our understanding, and we're pretty confident, that a  
number of schools around the country do this,'' Alden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said there's room for interpretation in any ``legal  
documentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, however, said that there is no gray area on that  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule was not intended for parents to get on the plane and  
reimburse because then you get into, `What is an appropriate rate?' 
'' Mallonee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents are supposed to fly commercial. In most instances,  
kids go commercial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said the university was eager to determine whether an  
infraction had taken place. Missouri's compliance office already 
had begun investigating the matter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel confident in the process. I feel confident in our  
basketball program. And, I feel confident in the NCAA,'' Alden 
said. ``Do I feel confident in a great result? I have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder said he bears responsibility if an infraction had taken  
place. ``Unequivocally I do,'' he said. ``I'm the head basketball 
coach. That's what it means to be the head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowsi said today that she could not  
confirm whether Missouri has been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospects could be declared ineligible before the Nov. 7  
signing day. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NCAA, if a rule is broken, it is up to the

</P>
<P>
	Langway, who played four years with the Montreal Canadiens and  
11 years with the Washington Capitals, won the Norris Trophy as the 
NHL's most outstanding defenseman in the 1982-83 and 1983-84 
seasons. He was a member of the 1978-79 Stanley Cup champion 
Canadiens. Langway was chosen to the NHL All-Star First Team in

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test-Ban Vote Set for Oct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democratic and Republican leaders  
agreed Friday to vote Oct. 12 on a long-stalled treaty to ban 
nuclear tests worldwide. Both sides suggested rejection was likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement on the date came after Democrats reluctantly went  
along with a GOP move to force a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty with little advance debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have no choice,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D. ``This may be the best that we can get. ... We'll 
take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives have blocked a vote on the treaty for two years.  
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders now want the vote to occur -- both to  
silence increasing complaints from the Clinton administration and 
Senate Democrats and because they're sure they can defeat it. The 
treaty needs 67 votes -- two-thirds of the Senate. All 45 Democratic 
senators are expected to support it, but only two Republicans -- 
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James Jeffords of Vermont -- have 
endorsed it, and even optimistic supporters count only seven 
potential GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think this is a good treaty. We think it would put us  
in a weakened position internationally,'' Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Friday. ``But since there have been all 
these calls and demands for a vote, we have offered to vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they (Democrats) want to vote, let's vote,'' Lott added.  
``If there's not two-thirds to vote for it, it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which calls for an outright ban on all nuclear  
testing, has been signed by 152 nations, including the United 
States. But it has been ratified by only 18 of the 44 countries 
with nuclear capabilities that must ratify it for it to take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives contend the pact -- which also has not yet been  
ratified by Russia or China -- could threaten the U.S. ability to 
modernize its arsenal if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the United States already has a vast superiority  
in nuclear weapons, thanks to more than 1,000 nuclear tests during 
the Cold War, and the treaty would lock in that advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott proposed Thursday that the Senate take up the treaty next  
Wednesday, debate it for 10 hours, and then vote. Daschle objected 
at first, claiming the timing was too short and that no hearings 
had been held on it. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Daschle said he could go along if Democrats got  
more time to organize. He proposed the treaty be taken up Oct. 8, 
with a final vote Oct. 12, with 18 hours of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott agreed to the Democratic timetable.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were bleak about their hopes of mustering the needed  
votes by Oct. 12, with Daschle telling reporters he didn't know 
where the additional votes would come from. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the treaty fails, the vote would at least force senators  
to go on the record, said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior 
Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: If you are going to die, do you want to die  
with no one knowing who shot you or do you want to go at least with 
the world knowing who killed you?'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin stressed the  
importance of ratification, saying, ``The eyes of the world are on 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be in a far stronger position to insist that other  
countries do not go down the nuclear testing road if we ratify the 
treaty, '' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the treaty's case is made in ``a serious, sustained, and  
analytical way,'' there will be enough support to ratify it, he 
said, adding that three or four days would not be long enough to 
make that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the Armed Services Committee,  
which he chairs, will hold hearings on it next week. Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has refused to do 
so.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Korea War Deaths Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and South Korean governments are  
investigating an Associated Press report that U.S. soldiers killed 
up to 400 civilians at a railroad bridge in the early days of the 
Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera, called by Defense Secretary  
William Cohen to head the U.S. inquiry, promised a thorough review 
of the No Gun Ri incident. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Thursday that the review, which could take a year or  
more, would include the military's first interviews with veterans 
who were at the bridge in July 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reported Wednesday accounts by American veterans and  
South Korean villagers who said they witnessed the killings, 
including six ex-GIs who said they shot South Korean civilians at 
the bridge. The AP also found once-classified documents showing 
that U.S. commanders ordered their troops to shoot civilians as a 
defense against disguised enemy soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he had assurances that the Pentagon  
``wants to get to the bottom of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, in ordering the inquiry, said, ``This review is important  
to the active and retired members of our armed forces, the 
confidence of the American people in the finest armed forces in the 
world, and our relationship with the people of the Republic of 
Korea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean survivors or relatives of victims have been asking  
for investigation, compensation and apology, and renewed that call 
after the new evidence was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know where the road will lead,'' Pentagon spokesman  
Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said, expressing confidence that the Army 
would be ``candid in its findings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said he would recommend further action if necessary, but  
cautioned against ``speculating at this point what the consequences 
would be'' if details of the report are confirmed by his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP report prompted South Korean villagers on Thursday to  
renew their calls for investigation of the incident. The ex-GIs 
recalled the killing of men, women and children. Villagers said 300 
people were shot to death under the bridge and 100 by U.S. air 
attacks that preceded the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said a search of records earlier this year by the Army  
Center for Military History ``found nothing to substantiate the 
claims.'' That was in response to the latest appeal from survivors 
and victims, which had been quietly rejected as unsubstantiated by 
the Korean and U.S. governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This review, of course, is going to go beyond a search of the  
documentary records,'' Caldera said at a Pentagon news conference. 
``It will be an all-encompassing review. I am committed to finding 
out the truth of these matters as best we can after these many 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar pledge came in Seoul from South Korean Foreign  
Ministry spokesman Chang Chul-kyun, who said officials would ``try 
to verify the truth of all related things concerning this case.'' 
He said any further action would be decided after that inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera noted that the early weeks of the Korean conflict were  
chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. soldiers, although they fought with great courage under  
very harsh conditions, were ill-trained and ill-equipped to fight 
because of the large reduction in resources available to the 
military for training and equipment following World War II,'' he 
said, noting that more than 30,000 Americans died in 1950-53 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe these dead and the vast, vast majority of our veterans  
of the Korean War, our nation's gratitude for their sacrifices on 
behalf of our country,'' Caldera said. ``Regardless, we owe the 
American people, our veterans, and the people, our friends and 
allies of the Republic of Korea, a full accounting of these 
matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his review would also examine previous Pentagon  
investigations of the matter to see if there was any ``misreading 
of the record'' or other mistakes.

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Clinch AL East Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The lockers were covered with plastic, there  
was plenty of beer on ice and almost all the players were soaked in 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Just another celebration for the New York Yankees, who never  
seem to tire of such merriment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning never gets old. That's what you play for,'' said Derek  
Jeter, who had two hits Thursday night as the Yankees clinched 
their second straight AL East title with a 12-5 victory over the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore won the first game of the day-night doubleheader 5-0,  
but that only served to delay the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you do it, the better it gets,'' said Yankees manager  
Joe Torre, who has guided New York to three division crowns in four 
years. ``I feel fortunate to be here. I still get emotional, for I 
know how much work it takes to get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration occurred three weeks later than last year, yet  
the champagne tasted just as sweet and the music in the clubhouse 
was just as loud. 
</P>
<P>
	``A division title is a division title. It doesn't matter how  
you do it,'' said Scott Brosius, who hit two homers in the 
nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory eliminated the Boston Red Sox, who will enter the  
playoffs as the wild-card team. Allen Watson got the final out 
moments before the Red Sox lost to Chicago 5-2, enabling the 
Yankees to truly savor the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying so hard to get that last out before that `F'  
went up there in Chicago because we didn't want to be backing into 
it, so to speak,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have spent much of the year trying to come up with a  
sufficient encore to their amazing 1998 season, when they went 
114-48 and won the World Series. That team clinched the AL East 
crown on Sept. 9 and finished 22 games ahead of second-place 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Red Sox made the Yankees work a lot harder. But  
New York will once again enter the postseason as division 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a matter of us having a bad year as much as the team  
chasing us was having a pretty good year. There's a bunch of teams 
that want to be standing where we are right now,'' Brosius said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Williams got two hits to reach 200 for the first time in  
his career. He and Jeter are the first Yankee teammates to have 200 
hits in the same season since Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio did it in 
1937. Williams scored the go-ahead run in the fifth inning of the 
nightcap after hit No. 199, and drove in a run in the sixth with 
No. 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez (17-9) allowed three runs on eight hits in  
seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	New York went up 4-3 in the fifth when Williams, Tino Martinez  
and Chili Davis hit successive singles off Jim Corsi (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Run-scoring singles by Williams and Davis made it 6-3 in the  
sixth. New York pulled away with a six-run eighth that featured a 
three-run double by Paul O'Neill and a three-run homer by Brosius. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Spencer also homered for the Yankees, who are a game  
behind Cleveland in the battle for best record in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we've clinched, I think we can go to Tampa and play a  
little more relaxed,'' reliever Jeff Nelson said. ``We still have 
something big to play for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who was born in Baltimore, savored the irony of the  
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up loving the Orioles and hating the Yankees,'' he  
said. ``Not in a million years did I ever expect to be in this 
position. And yes, I love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Hairston Jr. had four hits, including a homer, for the  
Orioles. Derrick May and Jesse Garcia also homered and B.J. Surhoff 
had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
	New York got to celebrate its eighth AL East title after the  
nightcap, but Mike Mussina made sure the Yankees wouldn't pop any 
champagne corks at his expense in the day game. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander struck out 10 -- nine looking -- and walked one.  
Mussina (18-7) retired 13 straight during one stretch and improved 
to 5-0 in seven starts since Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles took advantage Roger Clemens' control problems to  
build a 4-0 lead after three innings. That was more than enough 
offense for Mussina, whose 18 wins is tied for second in the AL 
behind Boston's Pedro Martinez (23). 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens (14-10) hit three batters and four of his five walks  
turned into runs. He struck out nine and allowed only four hits in 
six innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not happy with the first game, but that's over,'' said  
Clemens, who last pitched in a World Series in 1986. ``It's 
exciting here, a great, great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Surhoff, with 206 hits, is just five short of Cal Ripken's 
club record. ... It was Brosius' 11th career multihomer game. ... 
Hernandez is 4-0 lifetime against Baltimore, 2-0 this season.

	Russia Steps Up Chechnya Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia pressed ahead today with a bombing  
campaign against Chechnya, and an official warned the exodus of 
refugees from the breakaway southern territory could soon reach 
100,000. The military situation around Chechnya's volatile borders 
remained murky. Russian political leaders said yesterday that 
government troops had taken strategic heights several miles inside 
Chechnya, but the military has declined to give any details on 
troop movements. More than 88,000 refugees have fled Chechnya for 
neighboring Ingushetia to the west, straining the resources of the 
impoverished territory.

	GOP Nears Farm Aid Bill Approval  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House neared final approval today of an  
$8.7 billion package of farm relief despite complaints that it 
wasn't enough money and didn't deal with disputes over dairy policy 
and the Cuban trade embargo. ``If you want to help family farms 
vote for this bill,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. But Rep. Marcy 
Kaptur, D-Ohio, said much of the money would go to well-off farmers 
and landowners who don't need the help. Republican leaders forced 
the measure out of a House-Senate conference committee without 
provisions that would allow sales of food and medicine to Cuba.

	Pat Robertson Chides GOP Congress

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
accused congressional Republicans today of betraying -- by inaction 
and timidity -- the Christian conservatives who helped the GOP take 
control of Congress. ``We want leaders who are motivated by love of 
country, not fear of the next opinion poll,'' Robertson said. 
Addressing the coalition's annual ``Road to Victory'' conference, 
the broadcaster said his primary target is President Clinton. ``As 
we prepare for a new millennium, I want to start with cleansing the 
highest office of the land from the sleaze and the equivocation and 
the moral rot which has embarrassed us all,'' he said.

	Starr Spent $7M During Impeachment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr spent $7.2  
million on his investigation during the six-month period that 
included the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton. The 
figures included in the audit released today bring the total cost 
of Starr's five-year investigation of President and Mrs. Clinton 
and their associates to $47 million, edging it closer to being the 
most expensive independent counsel probe ever. Independent Counsel 
Lawrence Walsh spent $48.5 million on a six-year probe into whether 
the Reagan administration attempted arms-for-hostages deals with 
Iran and its secret war against the communist-led government of 
Nicaragua.

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A 41-year-old white man was arrested on  
federal charges in two recent bombings at predominantly black 
Florida A&AMP;M University, the FBI said today. Lawrence Michael 
Lombardi, an unemployed father of two from Tallahassee, was 
arrested about 4:30 a.m. after agents searched his home. He was 
charged with a single count of manufacturing a bomb pending formal 
charges later. Two small explosions have gone off at the campus 
since Aug. 31. No one was injured, but racist phone calls 
accompanied each incident and warned of futher attacks, spreading 
fear on the 12,000-student campus.

soldiers paraded through Tiananmen Square today as China marked 50 
years of communist rule. President Jiang Zemin and other Communist 
Party leaders viewed the parade of a half-million soldiers and 
civilians from atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace. The party's $36 
million celebration is showcasing the nation's growing military 
might and its rapid economic progress since Mao Tse-tung stood atop

<HEADLINE> Automakers Post Strong Sept. Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Several major automakers Friday reported vigorous  
U.S. sales in September, with no signs of fatigue from buyers 
enjoying a good economy and low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. said it sales were up 8.5 percent, to  
424,184 vehicles, with a 30 percent gain in light truck sales 
offsetting a 7 percent decline in passenger cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are good times,'' said Roy Roberts, GM group vice  
president of North America vehicle sales, service and marketing. 
``Vehicles are probably more affordable now than they've been in 
seven, eight or nine years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For only the second month in at least 20 years, GM sold more  
trucks than it did cars. The company has recently put more 
attention on its high-profit trucks, delaying some small-car 
development plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said it was the best month for GM's full-size trucks  
since March 1979, with strong sales of the company's Suburban sport 
utility vehicle and new Silverado pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a real change for us, and one that we're proud of. The  
trucks have really served us well,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	He defended GM's car performance, saying the sluggish sales were  
due to lower demand for passenger cars and a few hiccups. Saturn 
sales were down 11 percent due to start-up problems with 2000 
models; Cadillac sales were off 9 percent as GM phases in the new 
DeVille. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any one reason why cars are down,'' Roberts said.  
``In the aggregate, I feel pretty good about where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But other companies reported increases in passenger cars,  
especially European and Asian makes. One analyst said imports 
appeared to be taking a larger share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some very large year-to-year increases in new  
foreign makes,'' said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham 
Securities. ``Other competitive cars may be eating GM's lunch in 
the passenger car department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG said sales at its Chrysler division were up 7  
percent, with a 5 percent gain in cars and an 8.5 percent gain in 
trucks. The truck increase was powered by the company's SUVs -- the 
Dodge Durango and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota said its sales were up 10 percent, setting a record for  
the month, with trucks up almost 21 percent. The Camry sedan was up 
16 percent, while sales of the Lexus luxury SUVs were up 32 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, Mitsubishi and Subaru also reported double-digit sales  
increases, with Mitsubishi up 36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	European nameplates also did well in September. Volkswagen said  
its sales were up 52 percent. The New Beetle nearly doubled its 
sales, and the company's Jetta and Passat cars also did well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercedes-Benz side of DaimlerChrysler posted a 9 percent  
gain, all on the strength of its M-Class SUV. Volvo, Audi and Saab 
also announced large increases in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. will report its sales Monday.

<HEADLINE> Car Rental Cos. Petition Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Car rental executives asked Congress to exempt  
them from state laws that require them to pay millions of dollars a 
year to compensate victims of accidents caused by their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve states have ``vicarious liability'' laws that allow  
accident victims to sue and collect damages from car rental and car 
leasing companies even if they were not at fault. But car renters 
from all states pay higher rates because of those judgments, 
Enterprise Rent-A-Car Vice President Ray Wagner told a Senate 
subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not fair to impose multimillion-dollar judgments on any  
entity, whether an individual or a corporation, when they have done 
nothing wrong,'' Wagner told the Senate Commerce Committee panel on 
consumer affairs, foreign commerce and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, who also is a municipal court judge in St. Louis County,  
said rental companies spend about $100 million every year on 
vicarious liability cases, not including insurance costs and legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Faulkner, a regional manager for Premier Car Rental Co.  
in Albany, N.Y., told senators she closed her own small independent 
car rental company in upstate New York in 1997 because of a 
vicarious liability case. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the renter agreed that she would be the only  
driver of the car. But she lent the car to her son, who drove it to 
New York City without her knowledge and hit a pedestrian in a 
crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured person sued the renter's son, claiming negligence,  
Faulkner said, and her company was named as a co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might wonder how it is that my company was sued for this  
accident,'' she said. ``We rented to a licensed driver. ... It was 
the unauthorized driver -- a person neither I or any of my employees 
had ever met -- that caused the accident that injured this 
pedestrian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of  
America argued against the bill, saying the federal government had 
no business telling states how they should regulate insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicarious liability laws, which apply to other types of  
businesses, also encourage rental companies to maintain adequate 
insurance, said Larry Stewart, a Miami attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to single out one industry,'' Stewart said.  
``Every special interest would like to have immunity from lawsuits. 
But there's no need here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Car rental and car leasing businesses have pulled in billions of  
dollars in revenue in recent years, he said. ``Surely they do not 
need this legislation in order to flourish. They are merely trying 
to limit their financial liability so they may reap additional 
profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1130.

<HEADLINE> Early Sales Strong for Reagan Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Read by few, criticized by many, ``Dutch: A  
Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' finally went on sale Thursday. The book 
had already reached No. 4 on Amazon.com's best-seller list, 
trailing only three ``Harry Potter'' children's stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously a very strong debut,'' said Tim Appelo, a  
senior editor for the Internet superstore's best-seller page. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Edmund Morris, granted extensive access to Reagan when he  
was president, took more than a decade to complete the book and has 
been attacked for inserting himself into the story as a fictional 
character. But ``Dutch'' received some strong reviews Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt praised the  
``force and fascination of Mr. Morris' narrative.'' Deirdre Donahue 
of USA Today called Morris ``a gifted writer'' and said the book 
offers ``penetrating insights and original observations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The author received a reported $3 million from Random House for  
the book, which has a first printing of more than 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Borders bookstore in Washington, D.C., customers crowded  
the table where ``Dutch'' was displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't buy a book about the man who ended the Cold  
War?'' said Steven Scott, a private investigator from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Barnes &AMP; Noble in nearby Georgetown, department manager  
Noelle Sharbaugh said the biography was selling extremely well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every other customer this morning is buying the book,'' she  
said. ``We may have to order new copies from the publisher today.'' 
Barnes and Noble does not release any sales figures, but there were 
400 copies in stock at the Georgetown store. 
</P>
<P>
	While some copies leaked early to stores and the press, not many  
people have gotten to see ``Dutch.'' Historian Arthur Schlesinger 
Jr., who has not yet read the book, said Morris should not be 
expected to offer a definitive account. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no ultimate biography,'' said Schlesinger, a former  
Kennedy aide who has written books on the Kennedy and Jackson 
administrations. ``If someone has access to the president and it 
enriches the evidence, I'm all for it. What Edmund Morris has done 
will be of great benefit to future historians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although his book runs nearly 900 pages, Morris devotes less  
than 300 to Reagan's two terms as president and less than 50 to his 
two terms as governor of California. More space is given to 
Reagan's first wife, actress Jane Wyman, than to his vice 
president, George Bush, or to such longtime political aides as 
Michael Deaver and Edwin Meese. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of  
Theodore Roosevelt, has said he found Reagan a highly difficult man 
to figure out and that making himself a fictional character was the 
best way to approach the book. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday, Morris said he voted for Reagan in  
the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections but that he was 
``emphatically not a political writer.'' He added that he had 
always wanted ``to make literature out of Ronald Reagan.''

<HEADLINE> Former Dolphin Spikes Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Former Miami Dolphins running back Irving  
Spikes has pleaded guilty to federal drug and firearms charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes entered his plea Thursday in U.S. District Court in  
Biloxi in the presence of a judge, attorneys and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes faces at least five years in federal prison when he is  
sentenced Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for his plea, federal prosecutors recommended that  
the court dismiss a charge that Spikes helped others run a cocaine 
business in Alabama and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes also faces two federal cocaine trafficking charges in  
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes admitted that on March 15 he and two friends tried to  
sell a piece of sheetrock disguised as a kilogram of cocaine to 
Gulfport drug dealer Derek Joiner, who has pleaded guilty in a 
related case. 
</P>
<P>
	At Joiner's apartment, one of Spikes' cohorts used Spikes' 9-mm  
pistol to rob Joiner of $17,000. After the robbery, Joiner grabbed 
his gun and traded fire with Spikes' group. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Spikes and his friends on U.S. 49 a short time  
later and he has since been in the Harrison County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Spikes played four seasons with the Dolphins before being  
released in April 1998.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	The York, Pa.-based company expects to report third-quarter

<HEADLINE> Paul McCartney Recalls Grief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Paul McCartney said Friday that he has emerged  
from a long period of grief following the death of his wife and his 
days have finally become brighter. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney, 57, told the British news agency Press Association  
that he did very little in the 12 months immediately following the 
death of Linda McCartney in April 1998 of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just this, that and the other really ... I wasn't really  
taking my mind off it. No, I was putting my mind in it actually,'' 
he said. ``So there was a lot of seeing how it affected me, letting 
it wash over me and just trying to see, honestly, what it was that 
I was feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney said he believed his wife would not have wanted him to  
grieve for her beyond six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did actually take longer than that,'' he said. ``After  
about a year, a year and a few months, it started to get a bit 
brighter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney has made just a handful of brief live appearances  
since his wife died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing it very casually at the moment. I've got no big  
plans because I don't really need to have any,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Peanuts Comic Enters 50th Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- You're an old man, Charlie Brown!  
</P>
<P>
	Peanuts, the comic strip featuring the lovable loser in the  
zigzag shirt, his wacky beagle Snoopy and their unique group of 
neighborhood pals, marks the start of its 50th year on the funny 
pages today. 
</P>
<P>
	Good grief! That's middle-aged!  
</P>
<P>
	Through more than 18,000 strips over the past half-century,  
creator Charles M. Schulz has shared the gang's trials and 
tribulations with the Red Baron and the kite-eating tree and in the 
pumpkin patch and on the pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The strip appears in more than 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries.  
And the Peanuts franchise generates $1 billion in sales each year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't always that way.  
</P>
<P>
	Peanuts made an inauspicious debut in just seven newspapers on  
Oct. 2, 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elvis hadn't even come on the scene yet, never mind the  
Beatles or rap music,'' said Brian Walker, son of Beetle Bailey 
creator Mort Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Walker is the guest curator of an exhibit opening  
today at the International Museum of Cartoon Art which chronicles 
the first five decades of Peanuts and the work of Schulz, who at 
age 76 continues to draw single-handedly the 365 Peanuts strips a 
year at his studio in Santa Rosa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, which runs through Jan. 30, contains hundreds of  
collectibles and original sketches that take visitors through the 
evolution of what has become the most successful comic ever. 
</P>
<P>
	There are larger-than-life character props of Charlie Brown on  
the pitcher's mound, Linus in the pumpkin patch with his security 
blanket, Lucy dispensing advice for 5 cents and Snoopy, as a World 
War I ace, flying overhead on his red dog house proclaiming ``Curse 
you, Red Baron!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulz, who donated some of the most recent originals of his  
strip for the show, is not expected to attend because he prefers 
not to travel, Walker said. The modest cartoonist declined an 
interview to talk about his work. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit offers a chronological view of the development of  
Peanuts, and shows the remarkable yet subtle development the 
characters have made over the years -- from their first $1 book to 
NASA using Snoopy and Charlie Brown's names and images for the 
space program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm on the moon! I did it. I'm the first beagle on the moon!''  
Snoopy proclaimed in a strip than ran at the same time as NASA's 
mission. ``I beat the Russians ... I beat everybody. I even beat 
that stupid cat who lives next door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of the items on display came from the  
collection of Freddi Margolin, known as ``the Snoopy lady.'' She 
has at least 20,000 Peanuts items in her Long Island, N.Y., home, 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reach of the Peanuts gang stretches far beyond the daily  
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Hallmark began using Peanuts on greeting cards;  
now one in every five Hallmark cards has a Peanuts theme. There 
have been thousands of new products bearing Peanuts characters, 
television shows, feature films, even a Tony Award-winning Broadway 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the characters, the personality of Charlie Brown has  
probably remained the most constant through the years. From as far 
back as 1952 and possibly earlier, he has worn his trademark zigzag 
shirt -- though sometimes it's orange and sometimes it's yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's a born loser who never gives up. And that's his appeal,  
said Steve Charla, collections coordinator at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all kind of see ourselves in Charlie,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Other Peanuts characters have undergone dramatic changes over  
the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucy, for example, started off as a sweet little girl. She soon  
evolved into a ``fuss-budget,'' Walker said. And Snoopy, strangely 
enough, used to act like a dog. That was before his flights of 
fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	The years have taken a slight toll on Schulz, who admits  
sometimes having to use one hand to steady the other. His lines are 
a little less firm, but he's given no thought to looking for an 
assistant. In fact, Schulz says when he dies, Peanuts will die with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, though, he's going to enjoy a career that he's never  
seen as work. 
</P>

	``It's just something I always wanted to do,'' he said in a  
recent interview with The Palm Beach Post. ``I'm not obsessed by 
traveling. I'm not obsessed by getting everything done in this

<HEADLINE> Gore Attacks Bradley for Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore accused Democratic rival Bill Bradley  
of trying to ``duck'' his challenge to debate every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Gore challenged Bradley to a series of  
debates leading up to the primaries. His campaign later said Gore 
wanted a series of biweekly debates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has not specifically turned down Gore's proposal, but  
his campaign chairman sent a letter to Gore's campaign outlining 
several previously arranged events in the next several months that 
will give the two candidates an opportunity to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley claims he's a different kind of politician but  
apparently he's the kind that ducks debates -- the very forums that 
offer voters their very best chance to hear what the candidates 
have to offer and lets them go one-on-one,'' Gore spokesman Chris 
Lehane said in response. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser disputed Lehane's assessment.  
``The letter makes it clear that we are happy to debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Douglas Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman,  
pointed to an Oct. 27 joint town hall meeting in Manchester, N.H., 
and several forums next year at which the candidates could debate 
issues. 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth  
Dole wants President Clinton to act quickly to help residents in 
her home state of North Carolina who were hardest hit by Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the president, the former American Red Cross  
president said hurricane damages are expected to exceed $6 billion. 
Thousands of people are without homes and jobs because of flooding 
and many are living in temporary shelters, Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to send to Congress a comprehensive disaster  
assistance package for the ravaged communities caught in the wake 
of Hurricane Floyd,'' Dole wrote in the Sept. 30 letter that her 
campaign made public on Friday. ``To delay would only add to the 
devastation suffered by those affected communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has issued disaster declarations for North Carolina to  
speed the release of federal funds for recovery efforts. On 
Thursday, Vice President Al Gore announced the release of $20.3 
million in funds to help families in low-income areas rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also is expected to send a disaster relief package to  
Congress.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush has removed a Houston Chronicle sports columnist as the 
ghostwriter of his upcoming autobiography in a dispute over how 
many policy details should be included in the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes will complete the book, and her  
name will appear as ghostwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Herskowitz said his initial deal was that the book would  
be ``30 percent biography, 70 percent issues and (campaign) 
platform,'' the Chronicle reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hughes disagreed, saying it was to be a ``broad-strokes book  
on the governor's themes and philosophies and how he arrived at 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herskowitz said he sought detailed policy positions from the  
Bush campaign after completing the biographical portion of the book 
last summer but that he could not glean Bush's stands on the issues 
from a carton of speeches sent over by the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush's staff said the governor's positions were ``still  
evolving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting between Ms. Hughes, Herskowitz and Bush, they  
decided that the veteran spokeswoman would finish the policy 
portion of the book and take the writing credit. Herskowitz will be 
acknowledged for ``getting the project started,'' she said.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Republican Party launched  
a Web site Friday that will track Vice President Al Gore's 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced Wednesday that he will move his campaign  
headquarters from Washington to Nashville next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are happy to welcome Al Gore back to Tennessee with a Web  
page dedicated to highlighting his record as a liberal, Washington 
insider,'' said Chip Saltsman, the state GOP chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site will be used to solicit money to pay for an  
anti-Gore campaign in Tennessee. It includes audio of Gore parodies 
aired on The Rush Limbaugh Show, and parodies created for the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The address is GoreFreeTennessee.com.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All of the candidates seeking federal  
financing to help pay for their presidential campaigns have been 
declared eligible to receive them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission on Thursday certified the  
campaigns of Republicans Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes and Democrats 
Al Gore and Lyndon LaRouche. 
</P>
<P>
	To become eligible for federal matching funds, candidates must  
raise $100,000 by collecting $5,000 in 20 different states in 
amounts of $250 or less from any individual. Other requirements 
include agreeing to overall spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in January, the federal government will match up to  
$250 of an individual's total contributions to qualified 
presidential primary candidates. The maximum amount a candidate 
could receive is about $16.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC previously had certified the campaigns of GOP candidates  
Gary Bauer, Elizabeth Dole, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former 
Vice President Dan Quayle, who withdrew from the race on Monday, as 
well as Democrat Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans George W. Bush and Steve Forbes have declined  
federal matching funds.

<HEADLINE> What Can Bush's $56 Million Buy? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush, no doubt, has been advised not  
to spend it all in one place. 
</P>
<P>
	But if he did, the $56 million the Texas governor has raised to  
run for president could buy a small ``Vote Bush'' sign for the yard 
of every single-family house in America or treat everyone of voting 
age to a 25-cent gumball. 
</P>
<P>
	It's enough to buy a single F-15 fighter jet, which might appeal  
to Bush since he flew in the National Guard during Vietnam. Or how 
about 802 Mercedes Benz E55 sedans? 
</P>
<P>
	The only limit to how much Bush can spend to seek the Republican  
nomination is the number of Americans willing to contribute up to 
$1,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Bush's primary campaign has raised more money than any  
candidate before him ever spent seeking a presidential nomination. 
Predicting just how high he can go has become a political parlor 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cap is about $70 million to $75 million that can be  
raised, just because there aren't that many more folks out there to 
give,'' said Scott Reed, who was 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole's 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard estimates of up to $100 million,'' said Herbert  
Alexander, professor emeritus of political science at the 
University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, at least, $56 million is the jaw-dropping number. So  
just how much is that? 
</P>
<P>
	--More than was earned last year by singers Celine Dion ($55.5  
million) or Garth Brooks ($54 million), according to Forbes 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enough to stockpile 13 million daily food rations for worldwide  
disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than the hit movie ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged  
Me,'' drew during its opening weekend ($54.7 million). 
</P>
<P>
	--Enough to finance 24 weeklong search-and-rescue missions like  
the one carried out by a 90-member U.S. team after the Taiwan 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	--The cost of running 5 1/2 minutes of prime time, major network TV  
advertising every night for one month. 
</P>
<P>
	--A brightly colored gumball for each of the 202.7 million people  
of voting age in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enough to purchase 62.1 million campaign yard signs -- one for  
the yard of every single-family detached home in America -- or 466 
million ``Bush for President'' balloons or 622 million combs from A 
Advertising &AMP; Supply of Omaha, Neb., which prints candidates' names 
on novelty items. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could buy a heckuva lot of wooden nickels for that,''  
suggested company president Kirby Ralston. ``As corny as they are, 
they're still a pretty good seller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One more bit of advice, Gov. Bush: Don't take the wooden  
nickels.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Residents Survey Ruined Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Alice Bell lacked the nerve to peek  
inside her flood-ravaged home, yet she vowed to return to the 
parcel of land where her grandparents established roots more than 
50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm staying,'' she said, unwilling to go inside the brown  
trailer with a water stain from Hurricane Floyd some 8 feet above 
the door sill. ``This is my home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bell and others surveyed their wrecked homes Thursday for  
the first time since floodwaters swallowed the community of 1,900 
founded by ex-slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the banks of the Tar River, Princeville saw the worst of  
the flooding from Floyd, which dumped up 20 inches of rain two 
weeks ago. But more rain -- 8 inches or more fell this week across 
eastern North Carolina -- delayed recovery efforts and kept the Tar 
and Neuse rivers well above flood stage. They won't fall below 
flood stage until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 47 deaths have been blamed on Floyd, which is expected  
to surpass Hurricane Fran's $6 billion cost in 1996 as the state's 
costliest natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have released new housing damage figures of $250  
million. The storm destroyed 3,680 homes, severely damaged 4,282 
others and caused minor damage to 7,890 more. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,250 people remained in 14 American Red Cross shelters.  
</P>
<P>
	Emergency funds totaling $20.3 million will help families in  
low-income areas rebuild. The federal government now will cover 90 
percent of initial Floyd disaster aid, and a House committee 
approved $508 million in direct assistance to farmers who lost 
crops and livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency, and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol 
Browner toured flooded Kinston on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to name the most important environmental lesson  
learned from Floyd, Browner said, ``Stay out of floodplains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State figures show 14 sewage treatment plants and 50 animal  
waste lagoons remain under water following Floyd. Authorities have 
scrambled to recover dozens of caskets unearthed by floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxie Harrison, 37, had to break a bathroom window to get into  
his Princeville home on Thursday: high water had pushed furniture 
and appliances up against the doors. White mold sprouted from door 
frames, a television was upside down in a bedroom, and slippery, 
brown mud covered the floor. In the yard, two roosters lay dead in 
a cage. The stench was horrific. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar, a green parrot that belonged to Harrison's 18-year-old  
son, gave out a screech, still alive after two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, at least we got something. I got Oscar; he's one bad  
bird,'' said Harrison, who is unlikely to return to his house. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be next year before Princeville residents can move back,  
since floodwaters have wiped out the town water system and other 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert and Callie Suggs won't be back in the green-and-white  
home they built 34 years ago, the place where they raised their six 
children. There is an inch-wide crack in the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my life this was a gathering place for the family,'' Mrs.  
Suggs said. ``I would cook something every Sunday, and we would 
come here after church and pray together and eat together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really going to miss that. I guess someday it'll be the  
same, but I don't know where.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks fell Friday over fears of rising  
interest rates as central bankers in the United States and Europe 
prepare to meet next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications shares were the worst performers, with the  
Dow Jones Stoxx Telecoms index down 2.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch, its biggest component by market value, fell  
12 pence to 275 pence, and Deutsche Telekom, the second biggest, 
fell 92 cents to 38.24 euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Stoxx Ltd., the company that compiles the Dow Jones  
Stoxx family of indexes, reported Friday that the telecoms index 
was the best performer in Europe during September. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones Stoxx Index fell 2.42 points, or 0.8%,  
to close at 301.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical stocks also declined, led by Glaxo Wellcome,  
which lost 29 pence to close at 1,555 pence in London after a 
British institute said the company's Relenza flu drug shouldn't yet 
be prescribed in the National Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in London, BAA was the worst performing blue-chip share,  
shedding 17.5 percent, or 107.5 pence, to close at 507.5 pence 
after the airports and duty-free group said the end of duty free 
shopping within Europe would hurt profits by more than had been 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed down 1.79 points 
at 316.90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 27.37 points to 3642.34,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 31.52 points at 3598.09. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, London's FTSE 100 index closed down 1  
percent, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 0.5 percent, the Paris 
CAC-40 index fell 0.9 percent and Amsterdam's AEX index fell 1.6 
percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Afghan Airline Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is close to agreement with  
other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to impose 
sanctions against Afghanistan's state-run airline because of the 
Afghan government's role in harboring suspected terrorist Osama bin 
Laden, U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been holding unannounced talks with the  
four other council members -- Britain, China, France and Russia -- on 
imposing a worldwide freeze on the assets of Afghanistan's 
state-run airline and to bar the carrier from flying outside Afghan 
territory, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sanctions against Ariana Afghan airlines are  
designed to build on measures the United States took unilaterally 
against the carrier in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden is the Saudi exile who is believed by U.S. officials  
to be responsible for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East 
Africa last year. The bombings killed 224 people, including 12 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration believes that bin Laden is planning  
additional attacks against Americans or American interests. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the officials, barring Ariana Afghan's  
international flights could be a punishing blow to Afghanistan, 
given that the country is landlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
has designated bin Laden's organization, al-Qa'ida, a foreign 
terrorist organization, according to the officials. This will give 
the administration more authority to go after the group's funds. It 
is located in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials seemed optimistic that the Security Council will  
agree to sanctions against the Afghan carrier. They said they knew 
of no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, the administration made the airline off-limits  
to Americans and said it planned to seize the company's U.S. 
assets, estimated at $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline once flew to New York, but since the Taliban seized  
power in Afghanistan in 1996, the airline's routes reportedly have 
been reduced to domestic flights, plus service to neighboring 
Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been increasing its pressure on the  
Taliban authorities because it has had no success in winning their 
cooperation in bringing bin Laden to justice. Neighboring Pakistan, 
Afghanistan's chief ally, also has been uncooperative, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons the Taliban cites for keeping bin Laden are the  
absence of both an extradition treaty and of proof that bin Laden 
is involved in terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has placed bin Laden on its 10 most-wanted  
list and has offered a $5 million reward for his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Underwood's Church Called a 'Cult' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A young man found dead last week in a  
cooler in a Michigan State dorm basement attended the same church 
as Dimitrius Underwood, the NFL player who slashed his own neck 
after repeatedly yelling, ``I'm not worthy of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives who spoke this week to friends of Neftali Valdez  
Greene Jr. found that the 23-year-old had attended Immanuel's 
Temple Community Church in Lansing for about a year, said Capt. 
Tony Kleibecker, spokesman for Michigan State University police. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's mother, an ordained minister, earlier this week said  
the church her son attended was a ``cult that's posing as a 
church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Phillip Owens of Immanuel's Temple said Underwood had  
attended his church on and off for about a year. He denied the cult 
accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Owens refused to discuss Greene's affiliation with  
his church. It was not immediately clear if Underwood knew Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no obligation on our side to say anything until I  
find out what's going on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 22-year-old former Michigan State defensive end who  
has wavered between football and his religion in his brief NFL 
career, was found Sunday severely bleeding on a Lansing street 
after slashing his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released from Sparrow Hospital on Thursday and was taken  
to an inpatient mental health clinic, which was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, in a statement released through his agent, said  
Friday he has drawn strength from his family and faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forwward to returning to the Miami Dolphins,'' he  
said. ``I am getting help and looking forward to a full and rapid 
recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Lansing police report said Underwood repeatedly yelled ``I'm  
not worthy of God'' before he used two steak knives to cut his 
throat at the Lansing home of his girlfriend and their 17-month-old 
twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was saying, ``You are Satan and you're going to hell''  
and ``I want to be saved, I want to meet God,'' when officers 
arrived, the police report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was a first-round draft pick by the Minnesota Vikings.  
He left the team without explanation a day after signing a 
five-year, $5.3 million contract, saying later that he was torn 
between his faith in God and his football career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins picked up Underwood on waivers in August. He came  
to Lansing last weekend to visit his family and had spent several 
hours in the Ingham County Jail Saturday night on a warrant 
accusing him of nonpayment of child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene was found Sept. 22 in a 5-foot-long cooler in a dorm  
basement storage room. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleibecker said police think Greene got into the cooler on his  
own, then could not get out when the door closed and locked behind 
him. But they are continuing their investigation and hope to know 
more when toxicology reports are in. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a remote possibility it was a suicide,''  
Kleibecker said. But police think it's more likely the former 
Michigan State student was trying to find a place to stay, although 
they could not explain why he chose the cramped, unused cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Greene's parents' home were not returned.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Race Isn't Pretty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The stylish Mayor Willie Brown appears  
headed for re-election, but it won't be pretty. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-way campaign has been so bitter that at one debate,  
audience members left in disgust after an hour of chaos and 
shouting that ended in the arrest of one candidate and 11 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you like mud, it's been an interesting campaign so far,''  
said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies 
at the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally in the first phase, the candidates present themselves  
to the public in glowing terms. They kiss babies, bring out their 
wives. We've skipped that phase entirely. They've gone for the 
jugular right from the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not only the candidates who don't like each other. The  
voters don't seem to care for them either. A poll of 621 voters 
last week for the San Francisco Examiner and Oakland TV station 
KTVU found that the three main candidates' unfavorable ratings were 
about as high as or even higher than their favorable ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two of the 13 hopefuls challenging Brown are given a real  
shot at success come Nov. 2 -- former Mayor Frank Jordan, who lost 
to Brown in 1995, and political consultant Clint Reilly, who ran 
Jordan's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The charismatic, 65-year-old Brown, who is known for his  
expensive suits and an imperious style, is haunted by his 
4-year-old unfulfilled campaign promise to fix the city's transit 
system. Critics also complain he has added millions of wasted 
dollars to the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the FBI is investigating the awarding of contracts  
to minority companies. Agents have called on several city 
departments in a year-long probe, Brown cronies have been targeted, 
and his opponents have said it is inconceivable he wasn't in the 
know. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, 64, spent his working life in the police department,  
including five years as chief, before his term in City Hall. But 
the image many people see when they think of him is ... a shower. 
In the waning days of the 1995 campaign, he appeared on a radio 
show in a shower with two disc jockeys. A photographer snapped a 
picture, with Jordan appearing to be naked. He opened himself up to 
national ridicule and lost the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly, 51, spent nine years in a seminary before taking up  
politics in the 1970s. In addition to Jordan, he worked for Sens. 
Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
	He is dogged by a nasty temper -- he broke an ankle in a tussle  
with San Francisco Examiner executive editor Phil Bronstein -- a 
domestic violence incident 20 years ago involving a former 
girlfriend, and a drunken driving arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is running ``Jeopardy!''-style TV commercials: ``For $300,  
please!'' -- ``Who has been called famously misogynistic in a 
national magazine and sued for sexual harassment?'' -- ``Who is 
Clint Reilly?'' -- ``Yes!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly has run TV ads admitting past indiscretions and ripping  
Brown for bringing them up. ``I made mistakes I deeply regret,'' he 
says. ``I took responsibility for my actions and I haven't had a 
drink since 1981.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is running the most low-key campaign and hasn't run any  
TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
	At one debate, disgusted audience members left after an hour of  
chaotic shouting. Candidate Lucrecia Bermudez was arrested, along 
with 11 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real clothespin election'' -- one in which voters will  
have to hold their noses and vote, said Richard DeLeon, chairman of 
the political science department at San Francisco State University. 
``How disgusted are the voters? My guess is Brown can win without a 
runoff. But I could be wrong.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Might Call Off U.S. Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
insists the Salt Lake City scandal has no bearing on its plans to 
possibly postpone a high-level meeting in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC still intends to hold its executive board meeting, set  
for Feb. 21-23 in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Feb. 25 in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	But the organization says a ``scheduling conflict'' could force  
a switch. There has been speculation for weeks the meetings would 
be called off. 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members are reluctant to travel to the United States  
because they could be stopped for questioning by FBI agents 
investigating the Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a congressman has threatened to subpoena IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to testify at a hearing into the 
excesses surrounding Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officially, the executive board meeting is still scheduled,''  
IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said Friday. ``There has 
been no decision to move the meeting in time or place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the spokesman said officials retained the option of  
canceling or postponing the meetings because of a possible 
scheduling conflict. He cited the Feb. 10-13 meeting in Sydney, 
Australia, of the IOC coordination commission, the panel overseeing 
preparations for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber denied any correlation between a possible  
switch in the meetings and the U.S. investigations into the bid 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, people can make a link between the two,'' he said.  
``It looks bad, but there is no link.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee said earlier Friday that it had  
received a letter from the IOC indicating that the meetings were 
being postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	But later in the day, the USOC said it had based its statement  
on a ``miscommunication,'' citing a ``poorly written'' letter from 
the IOC that had been ``misinterpreted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney meetings had originally been scheduled for January.  
But they were moved to February to coincide with a meeting of 
national Olympic committees in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said a final decision whether to go ahead with the U.S.  
meetings would be made before the next executive board session in 
December in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said it would be possible, if necessary, for  
the meetings to be moved to Sydney or Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Knight, head of the organizing committee of the  
Sydney Games, said he didn't see any scheduling conflict and was 
unaware the IOC might move the board meeting to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board, which opened four days of meetings in  
Athens on Friday, reached no decision on whether Samaranch should 
appear at the Oct. 14 House hearings into the Atlanta bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need more time for a full discussion,'' Servan-Schreiber  
said. ``It's a complex issue. A decision will be made this 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to Congress last month detailed gifts, travel  
and offers of college scholarships, job assistance and other perks 
to IOC members and their families by Atlanta bid officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at Senate hearings last April into  
the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Arab Groups Want Disney Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- After threatening Disney with a  
boycott over an Israel exhibit they hadn't seen, some Arab and 
Muslim groups toured the display today and decided they wanted an 
exhibit for Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Six members of the delegation said they planned to meet with  
Disney officials and demand that such an exhibit be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Warren, Disney spokesman, responded: ``I'm not going to  
prejudge a decision we haven't had a chance to evaluate. Any day 
we're open to hearing from potential sponsors or exhibitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation was escorted by Disney officials through the  
Israel exhibit at Epcot, which is part of Walt Disney World's 
15-month millennium celebration. The Millennium Village, which 
opened to the public today, covers 24 countries, with the exhibits 
partially paid for by the countries themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the delegation said the exhibit was fair in  
presenting material on Islam and Christianity as well as Judaism. 
But others objected to what they said is the impression that 
Jerusalem is a unified city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent piece of propaganda,'' said Hussein Ibish,  
spokesman for the Washington-based American-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee. ``I expect nothing less from the 
Israeli foreign ministry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, a Jewish group was unhappy the exhibit makes no  
reference to Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were disappointed to see that, according to Disney,  
Jerusalem is the capital of the Millennium, rather than the capital 
of the state of Israel,'' said Abraham Foxman, national director of 
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibish has said the mention of the capital was deleted because of  
Arab and Muslim criticism. Disney would not say whether the 
reference was deleted or had been left out from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War, annexed  
it and claimed the entire city as its capital. The Palestinians 
want the eastern part of the city to be the capital of their future 
state. The United States has never recognized Jerusalem as Israel's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab foreign ministers had considered boycotting Disney over the  
exhibit but ultimately decided against it last week. Walt Disney 
World President Al Weiss met with Arab and Muslim leaders in 
Washington several weeks ago to discuss their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Arab countries are represented at the Millennium Village --  
Morocco and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do here is showcase cultures,'' said  
Linda Warren, Walt Disney World's senior vice president of 
marketing and brand management. ``We're completely trying to stay 
out of politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another group, American Muslims for Jerusalem, didn't take part  
in today's tour but planned to protest and distribute pamphlets 
later today just outside Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	``These signs will tell visitors what the Israel exhibit fails  
to explain,'' said Khalid Turaani, executive director of the 
Washington-based group. He contended the exhibit depicts east 
Jerusalem as part of Israel and marginalizes the roles of Muslims 
and Christians in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' AL East Crown Thrills Torre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The tears in Joe Torre's eyes said it all. No matter how many  
times the New York Yankees spray each other with champagne and beer 
to mark another milestone, none of them take winning for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially Torre.  
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' manager wiped moisture from his eyes as New York  
clinched its second straight AL East title Thursday night with a 
12-5 victory over the Orioles in Baltimore. He has already 
accumulated two World Series rings and three division crowns in New 
York, yet he isn't that far removed from a time when such success 
was only a dream. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees hired him in November 1995, Torre was five  
months removed from his job as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
He owned a very unspectacular 894-1,003 lifetime record and one 
first-place finish over 14 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	So even though the Yankees haven't come close to matching last  
year's 114-48 record, and although the season won't be considered a 
success unless New York successfully defends its World Series 
title, Torre took great delight in donning the hat that proclaimed 
his team 1999 AL East champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking to a 59-year-old guy who was fired at age 55  
and had a little daughter born at the end of that year. Now all of 
a sudden it's the greatest time of my professional life. It 
continues to amaze me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a season in which he missed two months after undergoing  
surgery for prostate cancer, Torre wasn't about to downplay this 
division crown just because New York didn't once again run away 
from the persistent Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still the same result. I get emotional because I know how  
much hard work goes into this thing,'' he said. ``It's not easy 
when you play 162 games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Derek Jeter, who has led the team at the plate and in  
the field, tipped his champagne-soaked hat to Torre when asked if 
this division crown was different than the other two. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been through a lot, but Joe was through the most. He  
is the leader of this team,'' Jeter said. ``I can't imagine playing 
for a better manager. He is an inspiration. What he went through, I 
don't think anybody can relate to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul O'Neill, whose three-run double broke open the clincher,  
said, ``Joe's illness was a shock to everybody. We were stunned. 
But here we are, back again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that New York had to work hard to win the division  
might have made this one more satisfying. By the end of May last 
year, the Yankees knew that the AL East crown was almost assuredly 
theirs. This season, the Red Sox just wouldn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't pretty, but it doesn't always have to be like last  
year when we pretty much won all the games we played,'' Torre said. 
``This year, we had to fight through some things, a tough little 
slump. ... But the guys seemed to pick each other up and I think 
that's the greatest tribute I can pay them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will open the postseason Tuesday against either  
Texas or Cleveland, but still had something to play for as they 
entered a three-game series against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York started the day trailing Cleveland by one game in the  
battle for best record in the AL, a distinction that enables the 
bearer to enjoy homefield advantage through the league championship 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only the beginning,'' said Orlando Hernandez, the  
winning pitcher Thursday night. ``We have a long way to go, some 
important games to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way Torre's Yankees operate: Savor every precious  
victory and celebrate the important ones, but never take your eye 
off the next objective. 
</P>
<P>
	``This feels great,'' a drenched Tino Martinez said. ``We had a  
great team coming out of spring training, but there's nothing 
given. We had to play all year to get where we're at. It's tough, 
but we did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've accomplished our first goal. Now we've got to do the  
rest.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Giles To Scale Back Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Bill Giles, chairman of the Philadelphia  
Phillies and the team's president until 27 months ago, will 
reportedly give up his day-to-day responsibilities with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retirement isn't quite the right word,'' Giles, 65, told The  
Philadelphia Inquirer for Friday editions. ``I've just decided to 
stop working so hard.'' Team officials refused comment on the 
report and said Giles would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles, the son of former NL president Warren Giles, said he will  
remain chairman, a title he assumed in June 1997 when he was 
replaced as president by David Montgomery. He said he will keep his 
15 percent ownership of the team ``as long as I'm alive.''

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Finally Showing Emotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame fullback Joey Goodspeed is  
angry. Left tackle Jordan Black is offended. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame finally is showing some emotion after opening the  
season 1-3, and coach Bob Davie hopes it means the Irish will 
finally play with passion when No. 23 Oklahoma comes to town 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie has gone public in pointing out his team's problems the  
last few weeks, and it looks like his words found their target. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am glad they took that personally. I am glad they have  
enough pulse to see that,'' Davie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than being inspired, his players are fighting among  
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the offensive line knows quarterback Jarious Jackson  
has lost faith in them after allowing him to be sacked nine times 
in four games. Rather than rally around the fifth-year senior and 
lone captain, Black said the offense has been rallying around 
coordinator Kevin Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson isn't the only senior riding his underclass teammates  
hard, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, a sophomore, said the seniors aren't exactly using  
positive reinforcement as a motivating tool in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's kind of more of a, `We're back against the wall,  
we're angry, we're ready to fight' kind of attitude,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners are in a much different situation. Beating the Irish  
would add legitimacy to their ranking and 3-0 record, both firsts 
since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	They still have some questions to answer about how good they  
really are after beating up on the likes of Louisville, Baylor and 
Division I-AA Indiana State in establishing the top-ranked offense 
in the country and a defense that ranks 16th overall. 
</P>
<P>
	They also could use another confidence booster before heading  
into a rough stretch of their schedule that includes the likes of 
Texas, Texas A&AMP;M, Colorado and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	What would it mean to beat a team that has lost three of four?  
</P>
<P>
	A lot, says first-year Sooners coach Bob Stoops, who called  
Notre Dame the best 1-3 team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teams they've lost to are excellent football teams,  
undefeated, and they've been to the wire with every one of them,'' 
Stoops said. ``So they're a strong football team, no question, with 
a great deal of pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish, however, haven't established a consistent running  
game, despite rushing for 363 yards against Kansas in the season 
opener. Also, Jackson has already matched his interception total 
(six) from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie is so desperate for a running game that he's been working  
leading rusher Tony Fisher at the fullback position, in part to 
give promising freshman Julius Jones a shot at tailback to spark 
something -- anything -- in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	That's irked Goodspeed, who's handled most of the snaps at  
fullback so far. He was also upset that Davie doesn't appear to 
have any confidence in the Irish running game. Davie elected to 
throw on third-and-1 in a critical situation against Michigan State 
and then punted on fourth-and-1 with time running out in the 23-13 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be nervous on third-and-1 handing the football  
off or fourth-and-1 punting the football,'' Davie replied. ``I 
think our football team has taken all of this personally. That is 
why I think we have got a chance to get it solved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Irish are finally showing signs of life, it never  
should have come to this, Black insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad sign because Notre Dame is never supposed to be  
1-3, in my opinion,'' he said. ``It irritates me. I can't even tell 
you how mad it makes me when Notre Dame loses a game. But that's 
the fact. We are against the wall and we have to deal with it.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Day Care Operator Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A British woman who ran a day care center in  
her San Diego home was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in 
prison for fatally shaking a 13-month-old boy and slamming his head 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Manjit Basuta, 44, was convicted in June of killing Oliver Smith  
and got the maximum under a new state law covering fatal assaults 
on children. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said she killed the child in 1998 because he didn't  
come when she called him for a diaper change. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never showed remorse for the victim or his family,''  
Superior Court Judge William Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Basuta sobbed and her shoulders heaved as the judge imposed  
the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Audrey Amaral, the boy's mother, carried a photo of the boy with  
her when she addressed the court before sentencing. She said she 
will always mourn her son and the man he will never become. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mrs. Basuta spends a lifetime in prison, it will be a small  
consequence compared to the death sentence that my son, Oliver 
Smith, has been given,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only eyewitness to the killing was Cristina Carillo, Mrs.  
Basuta's housekeeper, who testified that Mrs. Basuta was angry at 
the boy because he kept watching television when she called him. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Mrs. Basuta grabbed the boy by his arms and shook him  
violently. Ms. Carillo testified that Mrs. Basuta then pushed the 
boy down on the floor, striking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. Basuta changed the boy's diaper, his head fell back, his  
eyes fluttered and his skin turned blue, Ms. Carillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he lost consciousness, Ms. Carillo telephoned for emergency  
help. Oliver died the next day in the hospital from a blood clot in 
his skull and swelling of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Carrillo, a Guatemalan living in the United States  
illegally, said she initially told authorities the boy fell because 
Mrs. Basuta threatened to have her deported if she told the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Basuta did not testify but said later that the housekeeper  
had lied. Mrs. Basuta insisted that Oliver was injured when another 
child pushed him and he hit his head on a brick patio. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Basuta is a native of India who holds British citizenship.  
</P>
<P>
	Since Oliver's death, his mother has pushed for the passage of  
Oliver's Law, which calls for stricter state regulations for day 
care centers and better training for child care providers.

<HEADLINE> Court To Reconsider Encryption Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a key ruling involving secrecy and  
electronic commerce, the Justice Department has been granted a new 
hearing over its power to regulate data-scrambling technology known 
as encryption. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' 21 active judges  
issued its decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a three-judge panel ruled encryption programs and the  
mathematical formulas used to write them contain expressions of 
ideas, and cannot be suppressed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said it feared the ruling would prevent  
it from keeping encryption technology out of the hands of 
terrorists and hostile nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is vital to the software industry, which uses  
encryption to protect e-mail and electronic commerce, from credit 
card numbers to company data. The current restrictions, which treat 
high-powered encryption codes like military weapons, require a 
Commerce Department license for either export or Internet posting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has offered some concessions to the  
industry by promising to reduce export restrictions. But it said 
new regulations, due in December, still would require government 
permission to sell scrambling technology to foreign governments and 
would ban sales to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Gretchen Michael said she didn't  
know how the new regulations might affect the case being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was brought by Daniel Bernstein, a professor at the  
University of Illinois at Chicago who developed an encryption 
program in 1990 but found he was unable to get an export license to 
sell it overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Cindy Cohn said the administration's new regulations  
are unlikely to remove the roadblocks Bernstein faced. 
</P>
<P>
	The government still appears to be claiming an absolute right to  
block the export of encryption codes, without defining what can and 
cannot be exported, she said. And it appears to still require a 
case-by-case review of the export or posting of source codes, the 
researchers' mathematical formulas for writing encryption codes, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the May decision, the appeals court panel said the government  
can't block the expression of ideas in encryption codes without 
setting clear standards and timetables and guaranteeing quick 
judicial review. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing regulations ``allow the government to restrain  
speech indefinitely, with no clear criteria for review,'' said 
Judge Betty Fletcher in the 2-1 ruling. That, she wrote, prevents 
professors such as Bernstein from engaging in valuable scientific 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-judge panel of the same appeals court will be chosen to  
rehear the case. No date has been scheduled.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Would Veto Nuclear Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- President Clinton assured Nevada's two senators  
Friday that he will oppose a Republican attempt at compromise over 
disposal of nuclear waste in their state. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the two senators aboard Air Force One en route to  
Las Vegas that he will veto a Senate nuclear waste bill -- should it 
pass Congress -- because it would relax safeguards against radiation 
exposure at a permanent disposal site being considered in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The assurances echoed a statement issued in Washington by the  
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday's nuclear accident in Japan is a tragic reminder  
that we must do everything in our power to ensure safe, responsible 
handling of radioactive material,'' Clinton said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he reviewed the bill in its current form and  
``determined that it would not adequately ensure the protection of 
public health and safety. If this bill is presented to me in its 
current form, I will veto it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was crafted by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, last  
July in an attempt to break a five-year deadlock over what to do 
with thousands of tons of used reactor fuel now kept at power 
plants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would keep waste at the reactor sites temporarily,  
although the government would take title pending a decision on a 
permanent waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to reporters before leaving Washington, Clinton  
brought up the proposed waste site and said he would ``bend over 
backwards'' to assure that the site will be a safe repository for 
used reactor fuel that will be highly radioactive for more than 
10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that ``the majority of members of Congress''  
favor the Senate bill, which is expected to be considered by the 
full Senate in the coming weeks. No House action has been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard Air Force One en route to Las Vegas, Clinton discussed  
the legislation with Nevada Sens. Harry Reid and Richard Bryan. The 
two Democrats have vowed to use any parliamentary tactic to block 
its passage. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Murkowski said the legislation  
represents a compromise because it agrees to Clinton administration 
demands that the waste temporarily be kept at reactor sites. Many 
in the nuclear industry want a temporary storage facility to be 
built in Nevada until Yucca Mountain is available. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's threatening to veto a bill that hasn't even come to the  
Senate yet,'' Murkowski said. ``What's his proposal to address the 
issue of nuclear waste when 20 percent of our power in this country 
comes from nuclear energy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	By law the government must assume responsibility for the waste,  
and several utilities have filed lawsuits claiming breach of 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Murkowski bill also would require that responsibility  
for determining maximum radiation exposure levels at the future 
Yucca Mountain site be shifted from the Environmental Protection 
Agency to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, and most environmentalists as well as  
Nevada's senators, strongly object to such a change, contending 
that it would reduce radiation protection. The EPA indicates it 
wants a much more stringent radiation standard than that acceptable 
to the NRC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department is proceeding with the scientific  
evaluation of the Yucca site for eventual waste burial with a final 
decision on its suitability expected within two years. The 
repository could be completed by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada officials have complained for years that the waste site  
was pushed on the state by Congress in 1987. Potential sites in 
Texas and Washington state were eliminated from consideration, the 
Nevadans say, because other lawmakers wanted to make sure it wasn't 
built in their state. 
</P>
<P>
	About the Yucca site, Clinton said Friday: ``My feeling (is)  
that at the time it was selected there was some science in there, 
but perhaps some politics too, since Nevada was a small state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have wanted not to see this issue politicized, but to bend  
over backwards to do everything we can to deal with the nuclear 
safety issue before we adopt this course.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Pleads Guilty in Rodman Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- An Illinois woman accused of  
stalking former NBA star Dennis Rodman pleaded guilty on Friday to 
10 misdemeanor counts of making annoying phone calls, and more 
serious charges against her were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Felony charges of making terroristic threats and electronic  
stalking were dropped in exchange for the guilty pleas in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Susanne Shaw sentenced Marie Boguszewski, 36, of Bradley,  
Ill., to one year in jail with three years' probation and ordered 
her to stay at least 500 yards away from Rodman, his ex-wife Carmen 
Electra, and three of the athlete's former publicists. 
</P>
<P>
	Boguszewski has already served 325 days in jail awaiting trial  
and will be released in about a month, Orange County Assistant 
District Attorney Tori Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
	The felony charges that were dismissed could have resulted in a  
sentence of up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stemmed from phone calls and e-mails between Sept. 14,  
1998, and March 1 1999, when the Orange County charges were filed. 
At the time Boguszewski was in custody in Illinois in connection 
with another case. 
</P>
<P>
	Boguszewski allegedly e-mailed and called the office of Rodman's  
former agent, Newport Beach-based Dwight Manley Inc., hundreds of 
times to request a date with Rodman. When she learned the messages 
were not forwarded to Rodman, prosecutors say, she threatened to 
kill three agency employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, the prosecutors said, Boguszewski tried  
unsuccessfully to meet Rodman when he played for the Chicago Bulls, 
attending games and a book signing and turning up at a restaurant 
where he was celebrating a birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who was released by the Los Angeles Lakers in April, is  
currently a free agent.

<HEADLINE> Five Found Dead in N. Carolina Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAYNESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Authorities responding to a report of a  
shooting found five people dead in a home, a sheriff's department 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were found late Thursday in a residence near  
Interstate 40, Haywood County Chief Deputy Jimmy Parton said. He 
said he didn't know whether they had died from gunshot wounds and 
provided no other details. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Price, who lives a half-mile away from the crime scene  
north of Waynesville, said she knew the victims and they all were 
members of the same family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a normally quiet area,'' Price said this morning. ``We've  
never had anything like this happen before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waynesville is about 30 miles west of Asheville, near the Great  
Smoky Mountains National Park on the North Carolina-Tennessee line.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opens Russia Computer Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Ending a long-standing conflict over the illegal  
sale of high-performance IBM computers to Russia, visiting U.S. 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Friday inaugurated a computer 
center that would use them for peaceful work instead of weapons 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia bought the 16 computers in 1996 for nuclear weapons  
research, bypassing U.S. export regulations. Under U.S. policy, the 
computers required licenses for export to military and nuclear 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the following years, the United States tried to persuade the  
Russian government either to return the computers or have them 
officially dedicated to civilian research. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow eventually agreed to incorporate the computers into a  
civilian computer center located in Sarov, a city that is home to a 
major nuclear research laboratory and nuclear weapons production 
center. The city, which was called Arzamas-16 during Soviet times, 
is the equivalent to Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer center is intended to help Russian researchers find  
civilian jobs as Sarov converts from weapons research to peaceful 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today in Sarov we inaugurated a computing center, which will  
create a hundred jobs, and, later, up to 1,000 Russian jobs in 
computer software instead of nuclear war,'' Richardson said on Echo 
Moscow radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also said he signed an agreement to safeguard nuclear  
materials with Russian Nuclear Power Minister Yevgeny Adamov and 
again raised U.S. concern about Russia building a nuclear power 
plant in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has long urged Russia to abandon the project,  
warning that it could help Iran develop nuclear weapons, but the 
cash-strapped Russian government shrugged off the U.S. protests.

<HEADLINE> New Honda Tops EPA Mileage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Powered by both gasoline and electricity, a  
two-seat Japanese import is next year's top fuel miser, the 
Environmental Protection Agency said Friday as it released its 
latest fuel economy statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Honda Insight, which arrives at showrooms in December, was  
certified as getting 61 miles per gallon in city driving and 70 mpg 
on the highway, the best among more than 800 vehicles of the 2000 
model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest gas guzzlers were the popular large sport  
utility vehicles, many of which reported about 12 mpg in city 
driving and at best about 16 mpg on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Land Rover's Range Rover got the worst mileage (12 mpg city, 15  
mpg highway) among the SUVs. Another two-seater, the sporty Ferrari 
550 Maranello, was the biggest guzzler of all, getting 8 mpg in 
city driving and 13 on the open road. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty cars, including the Ferrari, were subject to the federal  
gas guzzler tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle available in America,  
Honda has touted the Insight as ``breakthrough engineering'' with 
high mileage and low enough pollution to meet California's toughest 
emission standards outside of an all-electric car. 
</P>
<P>
	Other manufactures are planning to unveil similar ``hybrids'' in  
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	But some auto industry analysts have questioned how many people  
will buy the new Honda offering, which is expected to cost close to 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insight primarily runs on gasoline, but its electric motor,  
which draws power from an onboard battery, kicks in to boost engine 
performance. It acts as a generator when the car slows down, 
recharging the battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Mileage varied widely among categories of cars from small  
two-seaters to large sedans, pickups, minivans and sport utility 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen had the only diesel-engine cars -- versions of the  
subcompact New Beetle and the compact Jetta and Golf -- and the 
three cars reported the best fuel economy (42 mpg city, 49 mpg 
highway) of any cars in their classes. 
</P>
<P>
	As it was a year ago, the Chevrolet Metro (39 mpg city, 46 mpg  
highway) was the most frugal fuel sipper among gasoline-powered 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mazda 626 was the fuel economy winner among midsize cars (26  
mpg city, 32 mpg highway) and the Toyota Avalon among large cars 
(21 mpg city, 29 mpg highway). The Dodge Caravan and its sister 
Plymouth Voyager were the most miserly among the popular minivans 
(20 mpg city, 26 mpg highway). 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, with gasoline prices lower, the EPA's fuel  
economy rankings haven't gained as much attention as in years past. 
Customers began drifting away from smaller gas misers to larger, 
performance cars and particularly to the less fuel-efficient SUVs 
with truck-like chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Today about half of the vehicles sold are SUVs and pickup  
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW models had the worst fuel economy in the compact, midsize,  
large sedan and small station wagon classes. Volkswagen's Eurovan 
had the worst mileage among the minivans, with 15 mpg in the city 
and 20 mpg on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner said while motorists need not  
necessarily buy the most fuel-efficient -- and generally, smallest -- 
cars, they should keep fuel economy in mind when looking within 
classes of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Choosing the most fuel-efficient vehicle within a class can  
save drivers at least $1,500 in fuel costs and avoid more than 15 
tons of greenhouse gas pollution over the life of the vehicle,'' 
Browner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coalition for Vehicle Choice, a group that for years has  
campaigned against government fuel economy requirements, said 
consumers shouldn't be urged to by fuel-efficient cars, which the 
group argues usually are smaller, less convenient and less safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The small gas sippers simply don't meet the needs of most  
consumers,'' said Diane Steed, president of the coalition, whose 
members include auto manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Pat Robertson Chides GOP Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
accused congressional Republicans today of betraying -- by inaction 
and timidity -- the Christian conservatives who helped the GOP take 
control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want leaders who are motivated by love of country, not fear  
of the next opinion poll,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious broadcaster sternly warned Pat Buchanan that  
Christian conservatives will desert him if he ditches the GOP for a 
third-party presidential run with Ross Perot's libertarian Reform 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform supporters are ``180 degrees out in terms of social  
issues. They don't share any of the views that Pat Buchanan claimed 
to espouse so vociferously,'' Robertson told a news conference at 
the coalition's annual ``Road to Victory'' conference. ``I can't 
see him taking many Christian conservatives with him -- not to the 
Reform Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, as he addressing the 3,500 members gathered at a  
downtown Washington hotel picketed by pro-abortion-rights 
supporters, Robertson made a veiled plea to Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time will come when we have to choose between two  
candidates for president of the United States,'' Robertson said. 
``Hopefully it's not going to be three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts believe Buchanan, as a third-party candidate,  
would weaken the eventual GOP nominee by drawing some Republican 
and independent support. 
</P>
<P>
	But in fired-up remarks to his followers, which were accompanied  
by the ``Rocky'' fight song, Robertson said his primary target was 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentleman, I don't know about you but I am filled  
with Clinton fatigue,'' Robertson said with a hint of Southern 
drawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we prepare for a new millennium, I want to start with  
cleansing the highest office of the land from the sleaze and the 
equivocation and the moral rot which has embarrassed us all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson had little good to say about his own party, either.  
``In terms of the Congress, we ask exactly what's been done?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He accused Republican leaders of ``deep ideological problems as  
they have wrestled with the fight against the president who they do 
not care about very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To applause, Robertson continued: ``I speak now to our  
Republican friends in Congress. We helped you to be elected. Now we 
ask for principled leadership. We ask for courage. We ask you to 
remember it is better to lose fighting a noble cause than to live 
in peace as a coward. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the words of Ronald Reagan, we would say, 'Paint in vivid  
hues, not in pale pastels.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview, Robertson singled out a bloated, $215  
highway bill as evidence that congressional Republicans were ``at 
the trough'' as much as Democrats. ``I want them to know we're not 
going to just slavishly do what they want,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, taking his turn in a  
speakers' lineup heavy with GOP presidential candidates, spoke 
generally about the Republican agenda for tax cuts, education and a 
ban on the so-called ``partial birth'' abortion procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republicans' record of accomplishment, Lott, R-Miss.,  
joked in his folksy manner: ``In the Senate, it's like trying to 
herd cats. They won't herd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the refrain, ``It's in your hands,'' Lott asked the  
coalition to help mobilize Republican voters behind conservative 
candidates. ``I've got to have some help,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the eight Republicans running for president in 2000, seven --  
Elizabeth Dole, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
Steve Forbes, Buchanan, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes -- were on the 
Christian Coalition program. Coalition staff said today, however, 
that Buchanan, slated to speak Saturday, was now ``iffy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain was absent.  
</P>
<P>
	Dole followed Robertson to the massive,  
political-convention-styled lectern erected on stage at the 
Washington Hilton. She did not speak to his criticisms of the GOP 
Congress, where her husband, Bob Dole, was Senate majority leader 
until he resigned in 1996 to run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Mrs. Dole stuck with a stump speech on education and  
national defense, but heavily laced with talk of her own religious 
upbringing. ``My commitment is to strive to lean on the lord with 
my whole heart, reading his word daily and earnestly seeking his 
will in my life,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned from the best -- President Reagan -- that you have to  
lead with the convictions of your heart, not with the latest 
polling data,'' she said.

candidates for president of the United States,'' Robertson said. 
``Hopefully it's not going to be three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts believe Buchanan, as a third-party candidate,  
would weaken the eventual GOP nominee by drawing some Republican 
and independent support. 
</P>
<P>
	But in fired-up remarks to his followers, which were accompanied  
by the ``Rocky'' fight song, Robertson said his primary target was 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentleman, I don't know about you but I am filled  
with Clinton fatigue,'' Robertson said with a hint of Southern 
drawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we prepare for a new millennium, I want to start with  
cleansing the highest office of the land from the sleaze and the 
equivocation and the moral rot which has embarrassed us all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson had little good to say about his own party, either.  
``In terms of the Congress, we ask exactly what's been done?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He accused Republican leaders of ``deep ideological problems as  
they have wrestled with the fight against the president who they do 
not care about very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To applause, Robertson continued: ``I speak now to our  
Republican friends in Congress. We helped you to be elected. Now we 
ask for principled leadership. We ask for courage. We ask you to 
remember it is better to lose fighting a noble cause than to live 
in peace as a coward. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the words of Ronald Reagan, we would say, 'Paint in vivid  
hues, not in pale pastels.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate interview, Robertson singled out a $215 billion  
highway bill as evidence that congressional Republicans were ``at 
the trough'' as much as Democrats. ``I want them to know we're not 
going to just slavishly do what they want,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, taking his turn in a  
speakers' lineup heavy with GOP presidential candidates, spoke 
generally about the Republican agenda for tax cuts, education and a 
ban on the so-called ``partial birth'' abortion procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republicans' record of accomplishment, Lott, R-Miss.,  
joked in his folksy manner: ``In the Senate, it's like trying to 
herd cats. They won't herd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the refrain, ``It's in your hands,'' Lott asked the  
coalition to help mobilize Republican voters behind conservative 
candidates. ``I've got to have some help,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the eight Republicans running for president in 2000, seven --  
Elizabeth Dole, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
Steve Forbes, Buchanan, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes -- were on the 
Christian Coalition program. But Buchanan's staff said today he 
would not speak at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain also was absent.  
</P>
<P>
	Dole followed Robertson to the massive,  
political-convention-styled lectern erected on stage at the 
Washington Hilton. She did not speak to his criticisms of the GOP 
Congress, where her husband, Bob Dole, was Senate majority leader 
until he resigned in 1996 to run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Mrs. Dole stuck with a stump speech on education and  
national defense, but heavily laced with talk of her own religious 
upbringing. ``My commitment is to strive to lean on the lord with 
my whole heart, reading his word daily and earnestly seeking his 
will in my life,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned from the best -- President Reagan -- that you have to  
lead with the convictions of your heart, not with the latest 
polling data,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	More on the Reform Party, Robertson disparaged its most  
prominent elected official, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. ``He's an 
ex-Navy SEAL and I hope he doesn't come after me. He's a big tough 
wrestler, but I think he's off his rocker,'' Robertson said.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in University Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- An unemployed white man was arrested  
Friday in two racist bombings at predominantly black Florida A&AMP;M 
University after he was recognized on a hardware store surveillance 
tape buying the pipe used in the blasts, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Michael Lombardi, 41, a licensed embalmer and married  
father of two from Tallahassee, was held on a single count of 
manufacturing a bomb. The FBI said more charges will be filed 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi's attorney, R. Tim Jansen, said, ``He is absolutely  
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first bomb exploded Aug. 31 in the restroom of an  
administration building. The second went off Sept. 22, damaging a 
restroom surrounded by classrooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in either blast, but the explosions spread  
fear across the 12,000-student campus. Dozens of police officers 
searched every campus building each morning, and everyone had to 
show ID to enter. Surveillance cameras were installed at state 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	In both bombings, the FBI said there were anonymous calls filled  
with racial slurs and threats of more violence. 
</P>
<P>
	One said: ``FAMU has seen the beginning of this. ... They got no  
business having a college where there ain't nobody ... smart enough 
to get a degree. ... This is just the beginning, brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another call warned that something else would happen at the  
university Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials wouldn't say whether they believe Lombardi was part of  
a larger group, but they indicated that the campus is now safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``FAMU today does not face the threat that it did yesterday,''  
U.S. Attorney Michael Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they matched bomb fragments with PVC pipe  
that Lombardi bought at a Lowe's home improvement store the day 
before the first explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to state records, Lombardi holds an embalmer's license  
and resigned from a funeral home about a year ago. Investigators 
said three former co-workers identified Lombardi from a store 
surveillance tape and recognized his voice on a recording of the 
threatening phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	One former co-worker told investigators Lombardi had talked  
about finding bomb-making instructions on the Internet, the FBI 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An arrest report from a drunken driving incident in 1991 said  
Lombardi is a former Marine. 
</P>
<P>
	University President Frederick S. Humphries told students at a  
rally Friday afternoon: ``It looks like our nightmare may be 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said some of the increased security will remain at the  
school, including the surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been on edge because you couldn't be sure when  
the next one was going to happen,'' said Charles Slaton, 21, a 
student from Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Denies Shredding Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola officials did not shred potential  
evidence in a discrimination lawsuit, though they did consider 
putting a shredder in a room containing documents in the case, 
attorneys for the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations of document-shredding were raised two weeks ago by  
lawyers for four black current or former employees who maintain the 
company racially discriminates within its ranks. Coca-Cola denies 
the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In their U.S. District Court motion, the plaintiffs' attorneys  
said they had ``substantial evidence'' that the so-called ``war 
room'' where Coca-Cola was working on the suit contained shredders 
that destroyed information. The plaintiffs asked U.S. District 
Judge Richard Story to order additional depositions and to punish 
Coke for any misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	In a response filed yesterday, attorneys for Coke said company  
officials once discussed the possibility of putting shredders in a 
data collection room but the idea was ``immediately vetoed'' and 
never acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the meeting, the group discussed using a shredder or the  
confidential refuse system to dispose of any miscopies and extra 
copies of confidential information,'' the company's attorneys said. 
However, company officials decided that placing the shredder in the 
room would give ``the wrong impression,'' the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola's attorneys said the plaintiffs' lawyers are  
``apparently unrestrained by any obligation even to attempt to 
verify'' facts and suggested they be sanctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plaintiffs' latest motion is at best reckless and  
disingenuous, and at worst a deliberate attempt to mislead the 
court and manipulate public opinion through demonstrably false and 
inflammatory allegations,'' Coca-Cola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyrus Mehri, a plaintiffs' attorney, discounted the company's  
response. 
</P>
<P>
	``This defense is the equivalent of `I smoked pot but didn't  
inhale,''' Mehri said.

<HEADLINE> Funeral Co. Lowers Earnings Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Stock in the world's largest funeral company  
plunged 25 percent Friday after Service Corp. International 
announced that it would report disappointing third-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston-based company blamed everything from ``weakened''  
death rates, bad weather in the Southeast and difficult labor 
negotiations in France for the earnings shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	SCI said its earnings would be about $27 million to $37 million,  
or 10 cents to 13 cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 
30. Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call had expected 
earnings of 22 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, SCI reported net income of $83 million, 32 cents per  
diluted share. The company said it expects to release earnings the 
last week of October. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock plunged $2.68 3/4 to close at $7.82 1/2 in trading  
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Less than a year ago, the 
stock traded for more than $40 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	SCI and other big funeral companies, including Louisiana-based  
Stewart Enterprises Inc., have reported disappointing earnings 
lately. Canada's Loewen Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems have been attributed to the frenetic consolidation  
in the funeral industry, with the major companies buying many 
locally owned, independent homes and cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole group is experiencing problems because companies  
have been paying what appears to be too much for a long time,'' 
said Kevin Silverman, an analyst with ABN-Amro. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman said that companies are now reducing their offers to  
acquisition targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consolidation has basically stopped because nobody wants to  
sell at what has become today's lower prices,'' Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
	SCI said it is looking at ways to improve cash flow, including  
cutting the number of acquisitions, ``significantly'' reducing 
capital expenditures and disposing of some businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive R.L. Waltrip said in a statement that the  
company is still focused on its core funeral and cemetery 
operations and aims to increase market share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not respond to requests for further comment.

<HEADLINE> Beckford, Playgirl Settle Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Playgirl has settled a dispute with model Tyson  
Beckford over the magazine's unauthorized use of his photograph on 
the cover of its September issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Beckford's lawyer,  
Edward Hayes, said the preliminary agreement bars Playgirl and the 
photographer, Timothy White, from using the photo again. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed Wednesday, Beckford said he was ``shocked  
and extremely upset'' with the cover shot. He says the photo -- a 
waist-up shot of a shirtless Beckford glaring at the camera -- was 
cropped to make him appear nude. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethann Hardison, Beckford's manager, had rejected Playgirl's  
offer in February to put him on its cover because she feared any 
association with the magazine would endanger his contract with 
Polo/Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
	Playgirl's lawyer, Caroline Landau, said the magazine did  
nothing wrong. She said Playgirl bought the photo from a reputable 
photographic ``stock house'' and paid for its use.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Draws Interview Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Jesse Ventura's interview with Playboy  
magazine has outraged and disgraced the Reform Party, and the 
Minnesota governor should resign, the outgoing party chairman says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Friday to Ventura, Russ Verney criticized the  
ex-wrestler for his comments about religion, sexual assault, fat 
people, drugs, prostitution and women's undergarments, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have brought shame to yourself and disgrace to the members  
of the Reform Party,'' Verney wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney, a longtime ally of Reform Party founder Ross Perot, said  
Ventura had severely damaged the credibility and integrity of the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ventura, who is not in the Perot camp, dismissed Verney's  
attack. In taped comments for NBC's ``Meet the Press'' to be aired 
Sunday, the governor said the national party did ``virtually 
nothing'' to help him in his upset victory last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who is the highest official in the Reform Party, also  
supported Jack Gargan's successful bid to replace Verney as party 
chairman. Gargan takes over in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney said he has been deluged with calls about the interview,  
especially the governor's comments about organized religion and 
Tailhook. Ventura called organized religion a ``sham,'' then said 
later he was referring to extremists. He also said he understood 
the circumstances that led to the Navy's Tailhook scandal, female 
Navy officers were groped and fondled by aviators at a Las Vegas 
hotel; however, he has said repeatedly since that he doesn't 
condone it. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney said he was shocked by newspaper reports about the  
Playboy interview, but thought the actual interview in the magazine 
was ``even worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody wants to be a leader, they should set the highest  
standard for ethics,'' he said. ``This doesn't stack up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some took particular offense to Ventura's comments on religion,  
which he called a ``a crutch for weak-minded people who need 
strength in numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson said Ventura was ``off  
his rocker.'' Others, including Republican presidential hopeful 
Gary Bauer and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, called Ventura a 
bigot. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lott: ``Can you believe a governor of a state in America  
would say such an insensitive, bigoted thing?''

<HEADLINE> NCAA In Court To Defend Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The NCAA returned to federal court Friday to  
counter charges that its freshman eligibility requirements for 
Division I athletes discriminated against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Buckwalter struck  
down the NCAA's Proposition 16, which dictates minimum eligibility 
guidelines for freshman in the association's 302 Division I 
schools, after ruling ``it had unjustified disparate impact on 
African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals later stayed the decision  
pending a full hearing, which occurred Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Standardized tests are a prime reason for African-Americans  
not qualifying under Proposition 16. There is a disparate impact 
that the NCAA cannot escape,'' Andre Dennis, lead lawyer for the 
four plaintiffs, told the three-judge panel. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA lawyer David Bruton, however, argued that the objectives of  
Proposition 16 -- which include increasing graduation rates -- are 
legitimate, and that test score cutoffs were related to that 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that there is a disparate effect that correlates with  
economic income, and unfortunately in our society, that correlates 
sometimes with race,'' Judge Theodore A. McKee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition 16, the NCAA requires freshmen athletes to  
have a high school diploma and a minimum grade-point average in 13 
core academic courses. The GPA is contingent on an indexed, sliding 
scale with a student's score on either the Scholastic Assessment 
Test or American College Test. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes scoring less than 820 on the SAT, or 16 on the ACT,  
cannot participate, regardless of their other academic credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	During a meeting of its Division I board of directors in August,  
the NCAA said it would make no changes to freshman eligibility 
requirements while the case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here because the full membership ... has concluded that  
they want to see more data before any more tinkering of Proposition 
16 is required,'' Bruton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the hearing revolved around whether the NCAA directly  
received funding from the federal government. If so, Dennis argued, 
then Proposition 16 must be amended to conform with Title VI, the 
section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that forbids discrimination on 
the basis of race, color or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	``By controlling the fund and program that implements the  
federal dollars, that subjects the NCAA to Title VI regulations,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA argued that since it is a nonprofit organization, its  
member schools are responsible for disbursing and using the money, 
not the NCAA itself. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected by next spring.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Designs New Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will focus its  
redesigned Web site on toys and consumer electronics, taking on 
already established Internet merchants Amazon.com and eToys. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest retailer revealed a few details Friday of  
its new site. More information was expected in the coming weeks as 
the company prepares for the start of the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts expect Wal-Mart's push online to change the  
entire retail business on the Internet, given its ability to keep 
prices down and sophisticated method of collecting consumer and 
product information. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart spokeswoman Melissa Brown said the site will offer toys  
and electronics, as well as Christmas decorations and other holiday 
items. Eventually, she said, customers may be able to 
``personalize'' the site, putting in their zip codes to get 
specific information about Wal-Mart stores near them. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will have computer kiosks in its stores so  
shoppers can shop on line for items available elsewhere through 
Wal-Mart, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart has been online since 1996, but hasn't been a major  
player in the Internet marketplace to date. In recent months, it 
has been working to makeover its site, improving both its product 
selection and how it will get merchandise to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart has hired Fingerhut, a direct marketing company, to  
handle all of their orders and ship the good to customers. The 
company also signed a deal with Books-A-Million Inc., the 
third-largest bookstore chain, to supply and deliver books for its 
online store. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart also has plans to redo the site for its Sam's Club  
warehouse stores and is reconsidering holding online auctions 
through Sam's.

<HEADLINE> IOC May Cancel U.S. Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee said  
today it might call off a scheduled high-level meeting in the 
United States but denied the possible shift was linked to FBI and 
Congressional investigations of bidding scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said that, for now, it still was planning to hold  
executive board meetings at Colorado Springs, Colo., and Salt Lake 
City from Feb. 21-25. But it said the meetings could be postponed 
or canceled because of ``scheduling conflicts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber denied a report in the  
Salt Lake Tribune that the meeting already had been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officially, the executive board meeting is still scheduled,''  
he said. ``There will be no discussion on that matter for the time 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Olympic Committee said it understood the IOC had  
decided to reschedule the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have received a letter from the International Olympic  
Committee which would seem to indicate the meeting would be 
postponed,'' USOC spokesman Darryl Seibel said by telephone from 
Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seibel said the letter, dated Sept. 24, was sent by IOC  
secretary general Francoise Zweifel, who is in charge of logistal 
arrangements for the international committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to interpret the letter to mean the meeting would  
need to be rescheduled,'' Seibel said. ``My understanding is it 
will be rescheduled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC cited a possible conflict with a Feb. 10-13 meeting in  
Sydney, Australia, of the IOC panel overseeing preparations for the 
2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC president Bill Hybl approached the IOC in mid-September and  
said the USOC was willing to have the meeting changed, according to 
the IOC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a scheduling problem with Sydney,'' Servan-Schreiber  
said. ``The USOC brought this to our attention and said, `We don't 
need you to be in Salt Lake City at that time. We are ready to 
postpone it if you need to.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Seibel said he was unaware that Hybl had raised the matter with  
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said it would be possible, if necessary, for  
the executive board to meet at Sydney or Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have scheduling issues all the time,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said a final decision whether to go ahead with the  
meetings would be made before the next IOC board meeting in 
December at Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation for weeks that the IOC would call off  
the U.S. meetings for fear that IOC members would be questioned by 
FBI agents investigating the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a U.S. Congressman has threatened to subpoena IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to testify at Oct. 14 hearings 
into excesses surrounding Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, people can make a link between the two,''  
Servan-Schreiber said. ``It looks bad but there is no link.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board, which opened four days of meetings in  
Athens today, discussed whether Samaranch should appear at the 
House hearing, which was called by Michigan Republican Fred Upton. 
No decision was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need more time for a full discussion,'' Servan-Schreiber  
said. ``It's a complex issue. A decision will be made this 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to Congress last month detailed gifts, travel  
and offers of college scholarships, job assistance and other perks 
to IOC members and their families by Atlanta bid officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the report showed ``votes were for sale'' and accused  
the IOC of fostering a ``culture of corruption.'' He threatened to 
use ``all legal means'' to ensure Samaranch testifies at the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at Senate hearings in April into  
the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said today it was exploring the possibility of being  
covered by the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public 
Officials in International Business Transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Congressional leaders have pushed for the IOC to be covered  
in the United States by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IOC has said, as a Swiss-based non-governmental  
organization, it might not come under the U.S. legislation. 
Instead, it has asked the French-based Organization for Economic 
Cooperation whether it would fall under the international 
convention.

<HEADLINE> National Enquirer Gets a Makeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elvis has left the magazine.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Enquirer, the supermarket tabloid best remembered  
for breathless news of Elvis sightings, alien abductions and UFOs, 
has redesigned itself in hopes of boosting its respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, whose weekly circulation has dipped to 2.2 million  
this year from 2.8 million in 1995, has been trying for several 
years to improve the credibility of its stories, editor Steve Coz 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think of the Enquirer as pictures of Elvis  
being alive and aliens, but we're trying to attack that,'' said 
Coz, who became editor of the magazine in 1996. ``We are bold and 
saucy, but the design gives us a bright, credible look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new design, which can be seen in the issue currently on  
newsstands, uses bolder typefaces and more modern-looking 
headlines, which the editors hope will create a more newsy feel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer's new look was created by Roger Black, a respected  
consultant who has given face lifts to several major magazines, 
including TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment firm Evercore Partners bought the Enquirer's  
parent company, American Media Inc., for $300 million last spring. 
Evercore also hired a veteran magazine executive, David Pecker, 
away from Hachette Filipacchi Magazines to head up American Media. 
Hachette publishes Elle, Mirabella and about two dozen other 
titles.

<HEADLINE> Twins Sale Negotiations Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- With a deadline for the sale of the  
Minnesota Twins about to pass, negotiators kept up talks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins owner Carl Pohlad and St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman agreed  
last summer to find a buyer by Oct. 1 in hopes new ownership would 
make a St. Paul stadium proposal more attractive to voters. But the 
deadline wasn't firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohlad, Minnesota Wild owner Robert Naegele Jr. and Minnesota  
Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor have been discussed a deal in which 
the baseball team would become linked with the NBA and NHL 
franchises as part of a $100 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Any agreement would be conditioned to the city and state  
agreeing to build the Twins a new stadium in St. Paul. City voters 
will decide Nov. 2 whether to approve a 0.5 percentage point 
increase in the city sales tax to pay one-third the cost of a $325 
million ballpark.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reports Two Minor Y2K Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The start of the government's new fiscal year  
was marked by minor computer failures at the Energy Department and 
the National Science Foundation that officials blamed on the Year 
2000 technology problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were resolved quickly, said the President's Council  
on the Year 2000 Conversion, which is monitoring agencies through 
the weekend for additional reports of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we might have a handful of issues come up,'' said  
council spokesman Jack Gribben. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department said a purchasing system failed, and the  
science foundation reported problems with a system that provides 
information to grant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The date system for many federal computers Friday rolled to 2000  
to mark the beginning of the government's fiscal year, offering an 
early taste of how the nation's computer systems may fare in the 
early hours of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Y2K problem exists because many older computers  
and software programs recognize only the last two digits of the 
year and could mistakenly interpret 00 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all states and many companies started their fiscal years  
in July. Few problems were reported then. 
</P>
<P>
	While Friday was the first government-wide date challenge  
related to Y2K, there have been other tests in recent months: A 
date change in a satellite navigation system caused some failures, 
including problems in Japan, where thousand of drivers complained 
about the loss of their mapping computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Sept. 9 passed with no reports of serious problems,  
amid concerns that some older computers might interpret ``9999'' as 
a command to stop operating.

<HEADLINE> College To Keep Policy on Admissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- The University of Georgia will continue to  
give some students an edge in admissions because of their race -- a 
policy the state attorney general said will be hard to defend in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that using race as a factor in admissions, but not  
as a sole determining factor, is a legitimate approach in 
Georgia,'' school President Michael Adams said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means the university will fight two pending  
lawsuits that contend the policy discriminates against whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Thurbert Baker, whose office will defend the  
university in court, said its prospects of winning aren't promising 
because courts have grown more hostile to racial preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	``While its chances of prevailing are slim, the university is  
entitled to have its attorneys present its case in court,'' Baker 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge warned in a January ruling that the university  
could not justify giving ``racial bonus points'' to some 
applicants. He did not rule on the policy because the student suing 
the university was not academically qualified for admission. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta attorney Lee Parks, who has filed three lawsuits  
claiming the school's admissions policy discriminates against 
whites, said he will keep the issue alive in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a very politically heated situation and I think  
people in those situations would rather the courts tell them to 
stop doing something rather than for them to decide not to fight 
the fight,'' Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1978 Supreme Court ruling, universities may not use  
racial quotas, but they may consider race as a factor when 
selecting students. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggles to eliminate race from the admissions process have  
played out in other states -- California, Texas and Washington -- 
while experts say a current fight in Michigan could be decisive for 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority admissions and applications have declined in Washington  
and Texas, as they have in California after a voter initiative 
there banned the use of race in admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia policy uses the same academic standards for all  
students. However, borderline applicants, who make up 10 to 20 
percent percent of freshman admissions, get extra points for being 
minorities, as do applicants whose parents are alumni or who live 
in rural or poor areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials have justified the system as a way to  
diversify the campus, where blacks make up 6.2 percent of the 
student body. The state population is 28.4 percent black. 
</P>
<P>
	Men, however, will no longer receive a preference in borderline  
admissions next year. The university adopted the gender preference 
because women on campus outnumber men. Adams decided to scrap the 
policy for next year because of another lawsuit Parks filed for a 
rejected female applicant. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, in a speech to the University Council, recalled  
segregated schools and ``whites only'' water fountains from his 
boyhood in Atlanta, Macon and Albany. He said Georgia colleges were 
under court orders to admit more blacks until 1987, and everyone 
has a responsibility to deal with the ``legacy of segregation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams also said the university is still not doing enough to  
recruit black students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still too many qualified Georgia minorities choosing  
to attend public and private out-of-state schools that they 
perceive to be more prestigious,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Julio Cesar Chavez Seeks Title Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- After taking a beating a year ago from Oscar De  
La Hoya, Julio Cesar Chavez vowed to fight only once more before 
finally retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has a new plan, and retirement comes with a new set of  
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to retire as champion. I want the title,'' Chavez  
said. ``I want to retire with dignity and I think I deserve that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez returns to the ring Saturday night against Willy Wise, a  
loser of three straight fights, to continue a pro career that began 
in 1980 and spans 106 fights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican boxing legend has been given a favorable No. 2 super  
lightweight ranking by the WBC and wants to fight champion Kostya 
Tszyu by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight must take place no later than December because I  
want to retire as world champion,'' Chavez said. ``I want to 
receive the year 2000 as world champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Chavez, who has held titles in three weight  
divisions, hasn't been much of a factor in the ring in recent 
years, as evidenced by his two losses to De La Hoya and some 
mediocre performances in between. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez was once 89-0-1, but his 12-3-1 since 1994, including a  
draw with Miguel Angel Gonzalez that would have been a loss if 
scorecards had been tabulated correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second loss to De La Hoya last September, Chavez fought  
gallantly but took a beating for eight rounds before his corner 
wouldn't let him go out for the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
	He blames a lack of motivation and personal difficulties that  
included financial problems for his performances. And he says those 
are now behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost because I wasn't motivated. I haven't cared about  
winning,'' Chavez said. ``Now I'm training to win, not to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez is back with promoter Don King, who says the fighter  
could either challenge Tszyu or perhaps move up to welterweight and 
fight Felix Trinidad, who beat De La Hoya last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of great matches for Julio,'' King said.  
</P>
<P>
	The fight with Wise (23-6-4) is on the undercard of a title  
defense by IBF junior flyweight champion Will Grigsby (14-1-1) of 
St. Paul, Minn. against undefeated former WBC and WBA 105-pound 
champion Ricardo Lopez of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez (47-0-1) has held the WBC title since 1990 and is moving  
up in weight for the first time to challenge Grigsby, who captured 
the vacant IBF 108-pound title with a decision over Ratanapol 
Vorapin on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure I kind of made a name for myself (with that  
victory),'' Grigsby said. ``One of the things is I want to be known 
as the best fighter out there at 108 pounds. Once I beat Lopez, I 
believe I will be the best out there.''

<HEADLINE> Launch of Service Module Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- U.S. and Russian space officials  
have delayed the launch of the next component of the international 
space station by several weeks so additional tests can be 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-built service module, which will serve as the  
station's living quarters, was supposed to blast off from Kazakstan 
in mid-November. NASA and the Russian Space Agency are now aiming 
for a launch anywhere from Dec. 26 to Jan. 16. A precise date will 
be announced in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest in a long series of service-module delays, most  
of them caused by Russia's money crunch. This time, however, the 
slip will not impact subsequent assembly flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides decided to take advantage of delays created by NASA's  
decision to virtually ground its space shuttle fleet after wiring 
defects surfaced during Columbia's launch in July, NASA spokesman 
Kyle Herring said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offered us the opportunity to do some duplicate testing we  
wouldn't otherwise have done'' on the space station service module, 
Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whenever the service module does lift off, the Russian rocket  
carrying it will bear a giant advertisement from Pizza Hut. The 
restaurant chain announced the deal Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's jobless rate fell to 4.7 percent in August  
from the previous month's record high 4.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A sharp decline in the percentage of unemployed men avvounted  
for the overall decline, the government's Management and 
Coordination Agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate for men stood at 4.7 percent in August,  
down from July's record 5.1 percent. The rate for women was 
unchanged at 4.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the total number of jobholders fell by 350,000 to 65.11  
million in August from the year-earlier month, it was up from 
July's 64.97 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate has risen in recent months, increasing  
pessimism about the nation's economy, which is struggling to emerge 
from its worst downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires in Tokyo had forecast  
the overall jobless rate would stay at 4.9 percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at the raw numbers from the latest report, there is  
brightness in the movements of the labor market,'' said Shinya 
Iijima, an agency official who briefed reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Iijima said that the labor situation is still severe and the  
outlook remains uncertain. ``We can't tell what the trend is just 
by looking at the August figures,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iijima said that the flow of jobholders into temporary positions  
continued, suggesting that companies are still trying to cuts costs 
by scaling back their permanent work forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of permanent jobholders in August fell by 0.8 percent  
on year, for the 20th straight month of falls, while the number of 
temporary workers climbed by 6.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend toward an increasing number of part-timers has been in  
place for nearly three years. The pace of growth picked up in 
August compared with July's 1.0 percent growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Labor Ministry said that the ratio of job offers  
to job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, was unchanged in 
August at 0.46 from July. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure shows that there were 46 jobs offered for every 100  
people seeking employment in August.

<HEADLINE> Bill Urged on Animal-Torture Videos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --Federal lawmakers and activists are advocating  
criminal penalties for people who sell videos depicting cruelty to 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution under local animal cruelty laws is rare because of  
the difficulties identifying individuals who make and appear in 
such videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., has proposed legislation that  
would enable federal prosecutors to target people who market the 
films by making it illegal to create, sell or possess any depiction 
of animals being treated cruelly for commercial purposes. Violators 
could get up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond horror, it's evil,'' actress Loretta Swit, who  
represented Actors and Others for Animals and the Humane Society, 
told the House Judiciary Committee's crime panel on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel viewed a ``crush video'' -- part of what witnesses  
called a multimillion-dollar, worldwide industry -- that showed a 
woman stomping a guinea pig to death. A half-dozen people walked 
out of the hearing as it played, while others blocked their ears 
from the animal's squeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my years of pushing legislation to protect animals,  
this is clearly one of the sickest forms of animal cruelty I have 
ever heard of,'' Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 titles of ``crush videos'' are available,  
selling for $30 to $100 each, Gallegly said, adding: ``This 
windfall must end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend the bill would violate the First Amendment's  
guarantee of free speech. They say it is so broad it could allow 
prosecution of those who make legitimate animal documentaries and 
even distributors of news magazines that contain pictures of 
bullfights. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallegly said he would offer amendments to exempt educational or  
artistic works such as films of bullfights. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., questioned how local authorities would  
know to enforce the law if the videos were shot in other states or 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Connors, deputy district attorney in Ventura County, Calif.,  
said the bill would work the same as prohibitions against the 
possession or sale of child pornography.

	So it was perhaps no shock that it took the retired Georgetown  
coach three tries to make the Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind saying what I don't want and what I don't like,''  
Thompson said today at a news conference. ``And I don't mind saying 
what I want and what I like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he was pleased to be entering the Hall of Fame  
tonight with Boston Celtics star Kevin McHale, Cleveland Cavaliers 
executive Wayne Embry, women's college coach Billie Moore, and the 
late NBA pioneer and owner Fred Zollner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear all these things: Hard guy, tough guy,'' McHale said,  
gesturing toward Thompson. ``Not the guy I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought that he was arrogant. I never thought that he  
was difficult. He challenged you,'' said Georgetown coach Craig 
Esherick, who played for Thompson and later served as his 
assistant. Then he added, ``There were some days I left the court 
as a player not thinking good thoughts about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big man with a husky voice and booming laugh, Thompson turned  
into a national fixture in his 27 seasons at Georgetown. Stalking 
courtside with a towel habitually draped over his shoulder, he 
watched his teams make 24 straight postseason appearances and three 
NCAA Final Fours. When his team won the national championship in 
1984, he became the first black coach with that title. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet colleagues say Thompson always demanded that his players be  
their best both on court and in class. ``He was a tremendously 
demanding educator,'' said Bill Shapland, a 15-year staffer. ``He 
was not interested in giving you a lot of excuses or wiggle room 
for not being the best you can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also made demands of the basketball world, pushing for  
more and better chances for minorities. He endured racial taunts 
when he first fielded a predominantly black team at Georgetown. He 
later boycotted two games in 1989 to protest NCAA Proposition 42, 
saying its financial limits hurt minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale, who formed a formidable frontcourt with Larry Bird and  
Robert Parish, also set high standards, but mainly for himself. In 
the 1987 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, McHale's right 
foot was so badly hurt that he was said to use a patio chair as a 
walker when he was off court. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that pain, we don't want you to play,'' his coach,  
K.C. Jones, recalls telling him. ``He said, `I'm doing this!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics lost in six games anyway, and McHale underwent  
surgery. He was hobbled by foot and ankle injuries until retiring 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But during 13 seasons with Boston, McHale played on championship  
teams in 1981, 1984 and 1986. ``He was a winner. We both had the 
same desire to win,'' said Bird, who now coaches the Indiana 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Minnesota boy with an easygoing exterior, McHale grew to a  
long-limbed 6-foot-10. He came to Boston in 1980 as the sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
	``McHale was a big, gangly kid who looked like a stand-in for  
the Frankenstein monster when he first showed up. But he had this 
indomitable will to win,'' said Tom Heinsohn, a former Celtics 
player and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale added a jump hook and fadeaway jumper to his expanding  
offensive repertoire. ``Those two shots were almost unstoppable,'' 
Parish said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale eventually transformed himself into one of the league's  
most feared offensive threats, averaging 55 percent from the floor 
during his career.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Releases Playoff Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees will play their first two  
playoff games in prime time, the Atlanta Braves will start in the 
daytime and the Arizona Diamondbacks will play after much of the 
country has gone to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will play Cleveland or Texas on Tuesday and  
Thursday, the commissioner's office said Friday, with the opener to 
be broadcast by NBC and the second game by Fox. Games are scheduled 
to start at around 8:07 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other first-round series, the Boston Red Sox and Pedro  
Martinez will open Wednesday at Cleveland or Texas in prime time on 
Fox at 8:07 p.m. EDT, then play the following afternoon at 4:09 
p.m. on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's first two games, most likely against Cincinnati or  
Houston, will be Tuesday and Wednesday at 4:09 p.m., both on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's first two games, also likely to be against Cincinnati  
or Houston, will be Tuesday and Wednesday at 11:09 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball used to fix the sites of all postseason games in  
advance, but decided after the 1997 season to use regular-season 
records to determine the home-field advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the top teams were tightly bunched going into the final  
three days of the regular season, only Atlanta was assured of 
playing the first two games at home when the schedule was released 
early Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, Cleveland, the Yankees and Texas were assured of playoff  
spots in the AL, and Arizona and Atlanta had clinched in the NL. 
Cincinnati, Houston and the New York Mets were competing for the 
final two berths. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL championship series starts Oct. 12 and the AL  
championship series the following day. The World Series begins Oct. 
23 at the NL champion and Game 7 would be at the NL ballpark on 
Oct. 31 -- the latest date ever for a Series game.

<HEADLINE> Mazda To Pay $5.25 Million Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mazda will pay the Federal Trade Commission  
the largest civil penalty ever imposed by the FTC for allegedly 
failing to clearly disclose important car leasing terms in its 
advertising, federal regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil penalties include a $4.05 million fine for what the  
FTC said was a failure to abide by a February 1997 agency order 
about Mazda's advertising. The car company also agreed to pay a 
total of $1.2 million in fines and costs to 24 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint and consent decree were filed Thursday in U.S.  
District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Mazda Motor of America Inc. agreed to pay a $900,000  
penalty and to modify its reporting of emission control defects in 
order to settle allegations it violated the Clean Air Act, the 
Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department and the Environmental Protection Agency filed the  
settlement in U.S. District Court here to resolve civil claims that 
Mazda failed to promptly report defective emission control devices 
in its MPV minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda, based in Irvine, Calif., said it has sought to comply  
with lease disclosure requirements and has put into practice new 
procedures to ensure full compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier FTC order prohibited Mazda's television ads from  
misrepresenting the total due at lease inception and from 
highlighting only the most attractive terms of the lease -- such as 
low monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also required Mazda to make a number of  
disclosures before it could state the amount of any payment. They 
included a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the transaction 
advertised is a lease, the total amount due at lease inception and 
whether a security deposit is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Mazda continued to run ads in violation of the  
order until early 1998. For example, the disclosures were in small 
and unreadable print, offset by distracting images or sounds, or 
appeared on the screen for too short a time, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Motor of America Inc., doing business as Mazda North  
American Operations, is a subsidiary of Mazda Motor Corp. of 
Hiroshima, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Mazda said consumers who leased cars between  
February 1997 and early 1998 were informed of the complete terms 
and conditions before signing any deal.

<HEADLINE> VA Secretary Accused of Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West Jr.  
violated government regulations and cost taxpayers thousands of 
dollars by using military aircraft for two trips to Louisiana and 
Alaska in 1998, the agency's inspector general concludes in a 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	West, also ``fueled the perception of waste'' with a  
$283-per-person dinner at his home on Oct. 7, 1998, to honor 
then-Navy Secretary John Dalton and his wife. While the party, 
which featured the U.S. Army Band, did not itself violate 
government rules, the report found that a $375 plaque for Mrs. 
Dalton should not have been paid for by the government. West was 
told to reimburse the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, said West  
concurred with the findings. Agency spokesman Terry Jemison 
commented, ``The report speaks for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West has said he would leave his post before the Clinton  
presidency ends. He has been criticized by veterans groups, who 
contended he has not fought hard enough to increase the budget for 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report said West should not have used  
government aircraft unless no commercial flights were ``reasonably 
available'' and the cost of using the government plane would not 
exceed the cost of flying commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	West and a party of five left on an Air Force plane for Alaska  
on Oct. 14, 1998, with the secretary planning to speak to a native 
Alaskan convention, and visit a VA medical center, a VA regional 
office, a national cemetery and a joint facility built with the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The VA originally planned to pay the Air Force $60,000 for a  
round trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the travel of Secretary West and the other five VA  
employees had ... been booked on available commercial aircraft at 
the same government rate, their total scheduled airfare would have 
been $4,302,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving in Alaska, West was asked by the White House to  
travel to Casper Wyo., to represent President Clinton at the 
funeral of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student 
beaten and left to die in a well-publicized killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force flew the party to Wyoming on Oct. 15 and returned  
to Washington. A separate Air Force plane was dispatched to Wyoming 
on Oct. 16 to take the group home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We checked commercial flight schedules in force at the time  
and found there was a commercial flight leaving Casper'' within an 
hour of the Air Force plane's departure, the report said. ``Had the 
secretary and his party traveled on this flight or another flight 
the following morning the use of round-trip military aircraft from 
Andrews AFB to Casper ... and back could have been avoided,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department billed the Veterans Affairs department  
$29,600 for a one-way trip to Alaska -- the portion not requested by 
the White House. The report did not list the cost of the 
Casper-Washington commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Louisiana trip on Oct. 24, 1998, West and three others  
traveled on an Air Force aircraft to Baton Rouge to speak at a 
banquet for former prisoners of war. The four returned the same day 
on an Army plane. The Pentagon billed the VA $3,396 for the 
Washington-to-Louisiana leg, but no bill had arrived for the return 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the four individuals who traveled on the military aircraft  
had planned their travel on commercial aircraft at the government 
rate, the total cost would have been $944,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that no documentation on cost comparisons was  
provided to the inspector general. ``We were told that it had been 
destroyed during the normal course of business,'' the report said, 
pointing out that the records should have been retained for a 
minimum of two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary's office did not abide by applicable ...  
regulations governing use of government aircraft nor did the 
circumstances of the travel justify the use of government 
aircraft,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the party for Dalton and his wife cost $9,340 in  
government funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said a ``common social courtesy gift'' such as  
flowers would have been appropriate for Margaret Dalton. 
</P>
<P>
	VA offices could not provide documentation ``of what  
contributions she made'' to receive the $375 plaque, the report 
said.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Takes 'High Road' on Pippen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley won't get into a ``war of words''  
with teammate Scottie Pippen, who earlier this week called him 
``selfish,'' ``fat'' and lacking in dedication. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Pippen (talk) is an annoying distraction to me, but I'll  
take the high road and not respond,'' Barkley told the Houston 
Chronicle in a phone interview Thursday from Phoenix. ``It takes 
some control, but I have to do it. Why get into a war of words?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen blasted Barkley Wednesday in an ESPN interview, saying he  
``doesn't show the desire to want to win.'' The attack responded to 
Barkley's August criticism of Pippen's efforts to be traded to the 
Los Angeles Lakers, where he would be reunited with former Chicago 
Bulls coach Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley complained then that he had sacrificed greatly to make  
salary-cap room on the Rockets for Pippen, who signed a five-year, 
$67.2 million contract before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's creating all this controversy just to get traded,''  
Barkley said Thursday. ``He wants to get traded so bad that he'll 
just say anything to make it happen. He should have just called me 
and said that he didn't want to play here anymore. That's all it 
would have taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers reportedly are discussing  
a trade that would send Pippen to Portland for Kelvin Cato, Stacey 
Augmon, Walt Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers. But 
Barkley said the deal might not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have to play together,'' Barkley said of himself and  
Pippen. ``If they don't trade him, we may have some problems.''

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A fan who sneaked on the field and stole bats  
from Sammy Sosa and Mark Grace in the Chicago Cubs' dugout was 
arrested before Friday night's Cardinals-Cubs game. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Stangler, 33, of Naperville, Ill., took the bats from  
the Cubs' bat rack in the dugout, police Major Lt. Bob Zambo said. 
He will be charged with trespassing and theft under $750.

	``Getting my bat stolen didn't bother me,'' Sosa said. ``If he  
would have asked me for it, I would have given it to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zambo said the fan told him someone wearing a Cubs batting  
practice jersey had told him it was OK to take the bats. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IOC May Cancel U.S. Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee said  
today it might call off a scheduled high-level meeting in the 
United States but denied the possible shift was linked to FBI and 
Congressional investigations of bidding scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said that, for now, it still was planning to hold  
executive board meetings at Colorado Springs, Colo., and Salt Lake 
from Feb. 21-25. But it said the meetings could be postponed or 
canceled because of ``scheduling conflicts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber denied a report in the  
Salt Lake Tribune that the meeting already had been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officially, the executive board meeting is still scheduled,''  
he said. ``There will be no discussion on that matter for the time 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl approached the IOC in  
mid-September and said the USOC was willing to have the meeting 
changed, according to the spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber cited a possible conflict with a Feb. 10-13  
meeting in Sydney, Australia, of the IOC panel overseeing 
preparations for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a scheduling problem with Sydney,'' he said. ``The  
USOC brought this to our attention and said, `We don't need you to 
be in Salt Lake City at that time. We are ready to postpone it if 
you need to.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said it would be possible, if necessary, for  
the executive board to meet at Sydney or Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have scheduling issues all the time,'' he said. ``This  
happens a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said a final decision whether to go ahead with the  
meetings would be made before the next IOC board meeting in 
December at Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation for weeks that the IOC would call off  
the U.S. meetings for fear that IOC members would be questioned by 
FBI agents investigating the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a U.S. Congressman has threatened to subpoena IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to testify at Oct. 14 hearings 
into excesses surrounding Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, people can make a link between the two,''  
Servan-Schreiber said. ``It looks bad but there is no link.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board, which opened four days of meetings in  
Athens today, discussed whether Samaranch should appear at the 
House hearing, which was called by Michigan Republican Fred Upton. 
No decision was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need more time for a full discussion,'' Servan-Schreiber  
said. ``It's a complex issue. A decision will be made this 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to Congress last month detailed gifts, travel  
and offers of college scholarships, job assistance and other perks 
to IOC members and their families by Atlanta bid officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the report showed ``votes were for sale'' and accused  
the IOC of fostering a ``culture of corruption.'' He threatened to 
use ``all legal means'' to ensure Samaranch testifies at the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at Senate hearings in April into  
the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has not traveled to the United States since the Salt  
Lake case broke late last year. Some IOC members were questioned by 
the FBI when they visited Salt Lake earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said today it was exploring the possibility of being  
covered by the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public 
Officials in International Business Transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Congressional leaders have pushed for the IOC to be covered  
in the United States by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IOC has said, as a Swiss-based non-governmental  
organization, it might not come under the U.S. legislation. 
Instead, it has asked the French-based Organization for Economic 
Cooperation whether it would fall under the international 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the pro-active stance of the IOC in reforming  
itself,'' Franklin-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	On another issue, the executive board gave final approval for  
Australia's prime minister to open next year's Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the head of state -- in this case Britain's Queen  
Elizabeth II -- would open the games. But the queen has said she 
will not be in Australia at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The policy of the IOC is when the head of state cannot be  
present for the opening ceremony, it will rely on the advice of the 
local government on who should be present,'' Servan-Schreiber said.

<HEADLINE> La. Judge Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A former judge pleaded guilty Friday to  
helping the owner of an insurance company negotiate a favorable 
settlement with the state after the company collapsed. The case has 
led to the indictments of a former governor and two state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Judge Foxy Sanders pleaded guilty to witness tampering  
and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. He faces up to six months in 
prison, a $25,000 fine and loss of his law license. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, former Gov. Edwin Edwards and Insurance Commissioner  
Jim Brown were indicted Sept. 24, along with Cascade Insurance 
owner David Disiere, his lawyer and the state official who handles 
insurance company liquidations. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cascade failed in 1993, a court-appointed investigator  
looking into allegations that Disiere had illegally siphoned off $8 
million from the company had recommended the state pursue a $4.4 
million settlement with Cascade. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement Sanders approved was worth $2.5 million -- far  
short of what the state should have gotten, federal prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors said Edwards, Brown and Disiere had intimidated  
and threatened the judge and even sued to have him dismissed from 
the case. When that didn't work, the former governor allegedly 
offered to help quell an unrelated investigation into Sanders if 
the judge agreed to assist them. Disiere allegedly paid Edwards 
$100,000 to arrange the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	After pleading guilty Friday, Sanders told reporters, ``I take  
full responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards said the $100,000 was a legitimate legal fee.  
</P>
<P>
	Another case stemming from the investigation goes to trial in  
January -- Edwards is accused of rigging state riverboat licenses.

<HEADLINE> Party Chair Asks Ventura To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party chairman Russell Verney demanded  
Friday that Gov. Jesse Ventura resign from the party, saying the 
former wrestler ``brought shame'' to himself with a bombastic 
interview in Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney's letter to the Minnesota governor reflects rising  
bitterness inside the Reform Party as its fractious members seek a 
2000 presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of potential candidates is long and colorful, including  
Republican Pat Buchanan, New York tycoon Donald Trump, former 
Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker, Reform Party founder Ross Perot 
and Ventura himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was released as a splinter group, American Reform  
Party, gathered in Washington. Their tiny convention attracted 
Trump and Weicker, as Ventura's political operatives scoured the 
landscape for any candidate who could block Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, whose frank talk got him elected in a November  
upset, told Playboy that organized religious ``is a sham,'' the 
Navy Tailhook scandal was ``much ado about nothing'' and fat people 
``can't push away from the table'' 
</P>
<P>
	On being governor, he said: ``It's good to be king.''  
</P>
<P>
	In taped comments for NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday,  
Ventura dismissed Verney's request because the national party ``did 
virtually nothing to help me to win the election here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, John Wodele, said the governor would have no  
other comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney is outgoing party chairman, soon to be replaced by a  
Ventura ally. 
</P>
<P>
	``In just one interview you have managed to severely damage the  
credibility and integrity of thousands of Reform Party members,'' 
Verney's letter said. ``You have brought shame to yourself and 
disgrace to the members of the Reform Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the American Reform Party convention, many of the 100  
delegates jumped to Ventura's defense. ``He's a straight-talker,'' 
said Louise Downing. 
</P>
<P>
	The former wrestler has promised to finish his term, which  
expires in 2003, but the delegates said they held out hope for a 
change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura is trying to head off the possible candidacy of  
Buchanan, who may leave the GOP for a Reform Party bid. Ventura 
says Buchanan's staunch anti-abortion views are a poor fit for the 
Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has urged Trump to run. His aides met Friday with  
Weicker, who addresses the American Reform Party on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent candidates could run under the ARP banner or seek  
the Reform Party nomination and elicit the ARP's aid. Leaders of 
the splinter group said Friday they would be willing to rejoin the 
Reform Party to help the right candidate; they mentioned Weicker 
and Trump as possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura and his allies defeated Perot's backers at the Reform  
Party's summer convention and installed Jack Gargan as chairman. 
They fear that Perot's backers are using Buchanan to regain control 
of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Madsen, director of Ventura's political operation, said  
Perot may be luring Buchanan in the race to create turmoil -- 
allowing the Texas billionaire to jump into the race and call 
himself a unifying candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overtures to the Buchanan camp could turn out to be a  
ruse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot has not ruled out a third presidential race. He and  
Buchanan are expected to talk soon by telephone about the 
conservative commentator's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan plans to announce his intentions by mid-October. He  
must decide whether he has the stomach for a major fight that would 
not guarantee him the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The millionaire Trump has no political experience and is given  
little chance of winning, but he's looking more like a candidate 
every day. He is rushing to finish a new book to release it in time 
for a December announcement of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am seriously considering making a bid for the Reform Party  
presidential nomination,'' Trump told the American Reform Party in 
a draft of his remarks for Friday night. He promised to cut taxes 
for working Americans, negotiate better trade deals and reform 
campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have gone too far to the right. The Democrats  
have gone too far to the left. I don't hear anyone speaking for the 
working men and women in the center,' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump's political operatives roamed the convention seeking  
support.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Trade Modin to Tampa Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Left wing Fredrik Modin was traded by the Toronto  
Maple Leafs to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Friday for defenseman 
Cory Cross and a 2001 seventh-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Modin, 24, is beginning his fourth NHL season. The 6-foot-4  
Swede had 16 goals and 15 assists in 67 games last season, playing 
mostly with leading scorer Mats Sundin. He was dropped from the top 
line late last season, and was scoreless in eight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross, 28, who re-signed Thursday with Tampa Bay, had two goals  
and 16 assists in 67 games last season, his sixth with the 
Lightning. Tampa Bay had the league's worst record last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about going to a contender,'' Cross said. ``It'll  
be good to get into a progressive, winning environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cross flew to Montreal to join the Leafs for their season opener  
Saturday night against the Canadiens.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Raise Campaign Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- President Clinton went to Paris on Friday and  
raised money for Democrats at the Eiffel Tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris is a hotel and casino in this resort town, with a  
spiraling replica of the famous tower on top. Inside the tower was 
a restaurant where Clinton addressed about 40 supporters at a 
luncheon that brought in $300,000 for the Democratic Senatorial 
Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've already had more dreams fulfilled than I could have asked  
for in 10 lifetimes, but I never dreamed I'd actually get to give a 
speech in the Eiffel Tower,'' Clinton joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's luncheon began a weekend of fund-raisers that were  
expected to raise $2.5 million for Democrats. Afterward, the 
president headed to Palo Alto, Calif., for a reception and dinner 
raising $625,000 for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In Palo Alto, Clinton decried resistance in Congress to his  
education proposal and accused Republicans of trying to kill it to 
prevent his Democratic administration from having ``any achievement 
that is demonstrable and tangible, that changes the lives of 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the smallest kind of politics, and who cares what  
happens to the kids?'' Clinton said. ``There is a difference 
between where we stand and where they stand. You stand with us, and 
stand with us all the way to November 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The largest take, $850,000, was coming from a Saturday night  
dinner in Los Angeles organized by ANGLE, Action Now for Gay and 
Lesbian Equality, to benefit the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. More than 600 people are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the biggest events we've ever done outside of  
Washington,'' said DCCC spokesman John Del Cecato. ``This will be 
the most successful event that the DCCC has done with the gay and 
lesbian community, ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Friday fund-raiser's host was Arthur Goldberg, chief  
executive officer of Park Place Entertainment, which owns Paris. 
Goldberg credited Clinton with making the United States ``the 
greatest country in the world'' -- and gave the president a 
political title he's never held. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I met the distinguished gentleman with the grayish hair  
on my left, he was a senator who really gave long speeches for his 
convention,'' Goldberg said, referring to Clinton's long-winded 
address at the 1988 Democratic convention. ``We knew what would lay 
ahead. He has continued that friendship and has never forgotten the 
people who were with him early on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg's role Friday is indicative of a trend in the casino  
industry toward lobbying and contributing to campaigns. Harrah's 
has contributed more than $1 million since 1995. Mirage boosted its 
giving from $159,800 in 1995-96 to $528,846 in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt flew to Las  
Vegas to pick up a $250,000 check from Mirage. In August, House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert raised $600,000 at a Las Vegas lunch with 
casino executives, calling their business ``a great industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the luncheon, Clinton gave a long, affectionate  
hug to Dr. Elias Ghanem, chairman of the Nevada Athletic Commission 
and formerly Elvis Presley's physician. Clinton seemed surprised to 
see Ghanem, who has been battling cancer. They chatted briefly and 
Clinton hugged Ghanem tightly again before moving on. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said those at Friday's reception had ``a sense of  
enlightened self-interest'' in their political choices. ``You're 
intelligent enough to support Democrats so you can continue to live 
like Republicans,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the $56 million that Texas Gov. George W. Bush has  
raised for his GOP presidential bid and said he was thinking of 
counting Bush's fund-raising success ``as one of the economic 
achievements of my tenure in office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't discriminate. We allowed the Republicans to make  
money too in this economy,'' Clinton said. ``It's not our fault if 
they decide to spend it in a way different than we would like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that while he can't run for the White House again  
he'd like to choose the theme song for the 2000 election -- ``Don't 
Stop Thinking About Tomorrow,'' the same Fleetwood Mac tune he used 
for his 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every country must always have its eyes pointed toward  
tomorrow,'' Clinton said. ``The question is not whether America 
will change, it is how America will change, and whether we will 
build on what we have done that is working ... or whether we will 
basically veer off and go back to an approach that got us into an 
awful lot of trouble before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of fund-raising, the president also planned to spend  
time with daughter Chelsea, who is beginning her junior year at 
Stanford University, and do some preparation work for his 
presidential library. He returns to Washington on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Clinch AL East Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The lockers were covered with plastic, there  
was plenty of beer on ice and almost all the players were soaked in 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Just another celebration for the New York Yankees, who never  
seem to tire of such merriment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning never gets old. That's what you play for,'' said Derek  
Jeter, who had two hits Thursday night as the Yankees clinched 
their second straight AL East title with a 12-5 victory over the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore won the first game of the day-night doubleheader 5-0,  
but that only served to delay the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you do it, the better it gets,'' said Yankees manager  
Joe Torre, who has guided New York to three division crowns in four 
years. ``I feel fortunate to be here. I still get emotional, for I 
know how much work it takes to get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration occurred three weeks later than last year, yet  
the champagne tasted just as sweet and the music in the clubhouse 
was just as loud. 
</P>
<P>
	``A division title is a division title. It doesn't matter how  
you do it,'' said Scott Brosius, who hit two homers in the 
nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory eliminated the Boston Red Sox, who will enter the  
playoffs as the wild-card team. Allen Watson got the final out 
moments before the Red Sox lost to Chicago 5-2, enabling the 
Yankees to truly savor the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying so hard to get that last out before that `F'  
went up there in Chicago because we didn't want to be backing into 
it, so to speak,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have spent much of the year trying to come up with a  
sufficient encore to their amazing 1998 season, when they went 
114-48 and won the World Series. That team clinched the AL East 
crown on Sept. 9 and finished 22 games ahead of second-place 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Red Sox made the Yankees work a lot harder. But  
New York will once again enter the postseason as division 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a matter of us having a bad year as much as the team  
chasing us was having a pretty good year. There's a bunch of teams 
that want to be standing where we are right now,'' Brosius said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Williams got two hits to reach 200 for the first time in  
his career. He and Jeter are the first Yankee teammates to have 200 
hits in the same season since Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio did it in 
1937. Williams scored the go-ahead run in the fifth inning of the 
nightcap after hit No. 199, and drove in a run in the sixth with 
No. 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez (17-9) allowed three runs on eight hits in  
seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	New York went up 4-3 in the fifth when Williams, Tino Martinez  
and Chili Davis hit successive singles off Jim Corsi (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Run-scoring singles by Williams and Davis made it 6-3 in the  
sixth. New York pulled away with a six-run eighth that featured a 
three-run double by Paul O'Neill and a three-run homer by Brosius. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Spencer also homered for the Yankees, who are a game  
behind Cleveland in the battle for best record in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we've clinched, I think we can go to Tampa and play a  
little more relaxed,'' reliever Jeff Nelson said. ``We still have 
something big to play for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who was born in Baltimore, savored the irony of the  
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up loving the Orioles and hating the Yankees,'' he  
said. ``Not in a million years did I ever expect to be in this 
position. And yes, I love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Hairston Jr. had four hits, including a homer, for the  
Orioles. Derrick May and Jesse Garcia also homered and B.J. Surhoff 
had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
	New York got to celebrate its eighth AL East title after the  
nightcap, but Mike Mussina made sure the Yankees wouldn't pop any 
champagne corks at his expense in the day game. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander struck out 10 -- nine looking -- and walked one.  
Mussina (18-7) retired 13 straight during one stretch and improved 
to 5-0 in seven starts since Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles took advantage Roger Clemens' control problems to  
build a 4-0 lead after three innings. That was more than enough 
offense for Mussina, whose 18 wins is tied for second in the AL 
behind Boston's Pedro Martinez (23). 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens (14-10) hit three batters and four of his five walks  
turned into runs. He struck out nine and allowed only four hits in 
six innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not happy with the first game, but that's over,'' said  
Clemens, who last pitched in a World Series in 1986. ``It's 
exciting here, a great, great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Surhoff, with 206 hits, is just five short of Cal Ripken's 
club record. ... It was Brosius' 11th career multihomer game. ... 
Hernandez is 4-0 lifetime against Baltimore, 2-0 this season.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Underwood To Get Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood, who cut his neck with  
steak knives in an apparent suicide attempt, was released from a 
hospital and will get psychological care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Dolphins rookie was in good spirits and ``very  
peaceful,'' Underwood's agent, Craig Domann, said Thursday. He did 
not identify his client's new treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's mother, Eileen Underwood, did not return messages to  
her Philadelphia home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood had been at Sparrow Hospital since slashing his neck  
Sunday. The hospital said he was released Thursday, but declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A police report said Underwood chanted, ``I'm not worthy of  
God'' before he used two steak knives to cut his throat at the 
Lansing home of his girlfriend and their 17-month-old twins. His 
girlfriend told police Underwood was confused and crying shortly 
before he cut himself. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her stepfather were trying to drive a severely bleeding  
Underwood to the hospital when he jumped from the car about a half 
dozen blocks from her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was saying, ``You are Satan and you're going to hell''  
and ``I want to be saved, I want to meet God,'' when officers 
arrived to help him. Underwood had to be sedated at the hospital 
before doctors could repair his neck wound, according to the police 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	A day before the stabbing, Underwood was arrested on a warrant  
accusing him of nonpayment of child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found him with the knife wound 13 hours after a woman  
posted his bond and Underwood left the jail. 
</P>
<P>
	His friend and former Michigan State teammate, Sedrick Irvin of  
the Detroit Lions, told the Detroit Free Press he visited Underwood 
at the hospital Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had tubes and machines all around him, but he said, `This  
ain't nothing. The Man upstairs is real,' '' Irvin said. ``He's 
confused right now and he did what a person who's confused does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was a first-round draft pick by the Minnesota Vikings.  
But he left the team in August without explanation a day after 
signing a five-year, $5.3 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter later found him in a Philadelphia hotel, where  
Underwood said he was torn between his religious faith and his 
football career. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood returned to football to support his family, and the  
Dolphins picked him up on waivers. He played one exhibition game 
Sept. 2, then injured a shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins said they are placing Underwood on the  
reserved-nonfootball injury list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed that as his coach, there wasn't something  
that I could do to help this guy accomplish what he wants to 
accomplish,'' Michigan State's Nick Saban told Detroit TV station 
WJBK.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Demote Capt. Primeau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Keith Primeau rejected the latest contract  
offer from the Carolina Hurricanes Friday, meaning that last 
season's leading scorer would miss the season opener this weekend 
at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes also turned up the heat in the negotiations,  
stripping the all-star center of his captain's title. Ron Francis 
will be Carolina's captain for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't view this as leverage or boiling point,'' Todd  
Reynolds, one of Primeau's agents, said. ``Keith wants to be the 
captain of the Carolina Hurricanes, but if they are going to take 
the `C' from him and give it to somebody else that is their 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau, who scored 30 goals last season for the Southeast  
Division champions, turned down a two-year deal worth $7 million 
plus incentives. The club previously had a five-year, $20 million 
deal on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina general manager Jim Rutherford had set a Friday noon  
deadline on the club's latest offer, made Wednesday. After the 
offer was declined, Rutherford and coach Paul Maurice made Francis 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, a bad decision has been made here that cost the  
player money, and as time goes on it's going to cost more,'' 
Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau and his agents are asking for $5 million per season.  
</P>
<P>
	The restricted free agent balked at the five-year deal because  
it would have taken him one year past when he could have filed for 
unrestricted free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams can match offers given to unrestricted free agents or  
receive draft picks as compensation, while unrestricted free agents 
can shop on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very strong support from owner (Peter Karmanos) and  
this is about making a franchise viable,'' Rutherford said. ``It's 
not about winning a few extra games because you have one more 
player in the lineup. That will not change (the offer)'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said Primeau was miffed at the team's last-ditch offer  
to sign him before the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is probably a good description,'' Reynolds said. ``We  
told (Keith) the numbers and he didn't have any chance to get 
excited. It's something we still want to get done ... just not at 
these figures.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Unarmed Suspect's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The FBI is investigating the slaying of a black  
carjacking suspect by a Hispanic officer who has shot and killed 
three other people in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Sgt. Juan Mendez fired seven shots at Antonio  
Butler, hitting him twice, as the unarmed 19-year-old tried to 
climb a fence to get away Sept. 20. Mendez, 39, had spotted Butler 
driving a car that had been stolen at gunpoint the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials have backed Mendez, saying the officer feared  
Butler might take a hostage and thought the teen was reaching for a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Mendez, who has been reassigned to a desk job while the  
department investigates, killed three Hispanic suspects in the line 
of duty. All were armed. Internal investigators determined the 
shootings were justified. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's office said Thursday the FBI was brought  
into the investigation after Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Fla., wrote a 
letter to Attorney General Janet Reno expressing concern about 
Mendez's record and racial profiling by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain that you are aware of the long history of worry  
and concern in Miami's African American community that police 
officers are more likely and particularly quick to use lethal force 
against black suspects compared to white or Hispanic suspects,'' 
Meek wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, more than 300 demonstrators snarled traffic outside  
the police department as they demanded Mendez be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami branch of the NAACP has also denounced the shooting.

<HEADLINE> New York Mayor Endorses Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani endorsed George W. Bush  
for president Friday, saying the Texas governor could provide the 
same kind of ``focused leadership'' exhibited during the 
Reagan-Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that Governor Bush is the best candidate --  
Republican, Democrat, independent or anything else -- to be our next 
president,'' said Giuliani, a Republican. ``The record that he's 
achieved in Texas alone is enough to demonstrate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, speaking to Giuliani and a City Hall audience by  
speakerphone, complimented the mayor on his work in New York and 
joked about his likely run for Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, senator -- I mean mayor,'' said the front-runner for the  
Republican presidential nomination. ``We're a winning ticket in 
your great state. ... I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have 
your endorsement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who served as a U.S. attorney under President Reagan,  
said his visit Thursday to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library 
and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif., gave him a chance to reflect on 
the importance of having a Republican in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's focused me on just how much this country is in need of  
the kind of leadership that we had during the Reagan-Bush 
administration, the kind of focus in our foreign policy, the kind 
of support of our military that we had then, the kind of sense of 
unified purpose that Americans had,'' Giuliani said. ``Americans 
could agree or disagree with President Reagan or President Bush, 
but they knew where they stood, and they knew what to react to, 
even. And I think we need that kind of focused leadership again.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices fell today in early  
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, despite an estimate from a 
closely watched private analyst that production was lower than the 
government's September estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders already expected the government to lower soybean  
production in its Oct. 8 report. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell to a new two-month low after the analyst  
Sparks Cos. estimated production was 100 million bushels higher 
than the U.S. Agriculture Department's estimate. Wheat futures also 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters are calling for a relatively dry weekend throughout  
most of the soybean belt, allowing the harvest to continue. 
Scattered showers are forecast for the Midwest into Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for December delivery fell 2 3/4  
cents to $2.73 a bushel; December corn fell 1 1/2 cents to 2.06 3/4 a 
bushel; December oats fell 1 3/4 cents to $1.12 1/2 a bushel; and 
November soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $4.87 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, meat and livestock futures prices rose in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 0.08 cent to 68.35 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose 0.23 cent to 81.30 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs rose 0.78 cent to 49.75 cents a pound; and 
February frozen pork bellies rose 0.90 cent to 64.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> NYC Pays $40M To Resolve Cop Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City paid out a record $40 million in  
the last fiscal year to resolve claims and lawsuits against police 
officers charged with brutality, up 40 percent from the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of brutality claims seeking damages increased by 10  
percent, to 2,324, the highest number in a decade, the city 
comptroller said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials dismissed the suggestion that the increases were  
a measure of more misconduct being committed by police officers. 
Instead, city lawyers pointed to a new policy that calls for more 
cases to be settled quickly to avoid the long-term costs of an 
extended court fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The $40 million includes cases that were settled and those  
decided with a court judgment. The city paid $405 million to 
resolve other lawsuits and claims, most of them personal injury 
claims stemming from accidents like sidewalk slips.

<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- The University of Georgia said damages might  
total $100,000 after vandals broke into Sanford Stadium with bolt 
cutters and drove across the football field Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The school estimates it will cost $10,000 for a quick fix to  
make the field playable for Saturday's game against LSU. Restoring 
the field to its original condition might cost up to $100,000, 
school spokesman Pete Konenkamp said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an extensive turf restoration problem,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two donut-shaped rings 20 to 25 feet in diameter were  
embroidered into the field. Workers began resodding areas where 
2-inch deep ruts marked the skidding vehicle's tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Konenkamp said university groundkeepers were concerned about  
possible damage to the field's liner beneath the turf.

<HEADLINE> Colo., Utah, Await IOC Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Just days after a congressman asked  
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch to 
testify about bid excesses, the IOC has said it might call off a 
scheduled high-level meeting in the United States, 
</P>
<P>
	It denied the possible shift was linked to investigations of  
bidding scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has been asked to testify Oct. 14 before Rep. Fred  
Upton's House commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigation, 
and the matter is expected to be discussed at this week's executive 
board meetings in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said today that, for now, it still was planning to hold  
executive board meetings in Colorado Springs and Salt Lake from 
Feb. 21-25. But it said the meetings could be postponed or canceled 
because of ``scheduling conflicts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune said in today's edition that a letter  
faxed to U.S. Olympic Committee officials this week said the 
February meeting plans were being changed because of an apparent 
scheduling conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	However, IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber denied that the  
meeting already had been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officially, the executive board meeting is still scheduled,''  
he said. ``There will be no discussion on that matter for the time 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl approached the IOC in  
mid-September and said the USOC was willing to have the meeting 
changed, according to the spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber cited a possible conflict with a Feb. 10-13  
meeting in Sydney, Australia, of the IOC panel overseeing 
preparations for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a scheduling problem with Sydney,'' he said. ``The  
USOC brought this to our attention and said, `We don't need you to 
be in Salt Lake City at that time. We are ready to postpone it if 
you need to.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said it would be possible, if necessary, for  
the executive board to meet at Sydney or Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have scheduling issues all the time,'' he said. ``This  
happens a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said a final decision whether to go ahead with the  
meetings would be made before the next IOC board meeting in 
December in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton, R-Mich., has said that if Samaranch does not appear  
voluntarily at hearings next month investigating the ``culture of 
corruption'' surrounding Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Summer 
Games, he would be subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	That could occur any time Samaranch entered the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	Upton wants to question Samaranch about how the IOC chooses  
cities to host the Olympics. Salt Lake City has admitted to using 
expensive gifts, cash and offers of scholarships to influence the 
voting process. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by Upton's subcommittee found that Atlanta bid  
officials also offered lavish gifts and favors, 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to learn more about Atlanta's bid, Upton has  
invited to his Oct. 14 hearing former Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger and former Sen. Howard Baker, both members of the IOC 
2000 reform team; former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young; Atlanta 
Olympic Committee president Billy Payne; and U.S. Olympic Committee 
leaders Bill Hybl and Scott Blackman -- and Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Justice Department is probing the legality of the  
$1 million in cash and goods Salt Lake City supplied to IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostility between federal officials and the IOC has put the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee in a delicate position, trying not 
to alienate either side. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney has tried to stay away from the  
battle. ``One of the great challenges of my office is separation,'' 
he said. ``Separation from the past, separation from people with 
varying views we may or may not agree with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, it was announced that Gordon Kane is leaving his USOC  
post to join Ignite Sports Media, a Chicago-based Internet company 
that will produce Web sites for professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane is the second USOC marketing official to leave. John  
Krimsky quit in June for a position with American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane, director of marketing and brand development, said his  
leaving had nothing to do with the bribery scandal, slumping sales 
or the reshuffling of USOC management. Kane said the new job offer 
was just too good to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane also served as vice president of OPUS (Olympic Properties  
of the United States), USOC's joint marketing venture with SLOC.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on Fears of Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against other currencies Friday  
after several indications of strength in the U.S. economy renewed 
concerns that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates when it 
meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.96  
Japanese yen, down from 106.27 late Thursday. The euro was quoted 
at $1.0728, up from $1.0684. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks swooned on Wall Street after a report by the National  
Association of Purchasing Management showed that U.S. manufacturing 
activity grew faster than expected in September, confirming that 
the economy is rebounding from a slow second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM also reported that prices of raw materials soared to  
the highest level in more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department said the personal income of  
Americans climbed in August for the eighth consecutive month. But 
their spending rose faster, leaving the nation's savings rate 
matching a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had been hoping that the Fed would stand pat on rates  
when it meets next Tuesday, and the new reports Friday showing 
strength in the economy got financial markets worried again. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in stocks and Treasury bonds put downward pressure  
on the dollar as demand for the currency was weakened by the 
decline in major dollar-denominated assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4820 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4969, and 1.4769 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4674. The British 
pound rose to $1.6548 from $1.6464. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8229 German 
marks, down from 1.8308; 6.1139 French francs, down from 6.1403; 
and 1,804.71 Italian lire, down from 1,812.39.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Day Care Operator Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A day care center operator convicted of fatally  
shaking a 13-month-old boy and slamming his head on the floor 
received the maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison under a 
new state law covering fatal assaults on children. 
</P>
<P>
	Manjit Basuta, 44, was sentenced Friday in the death of Oliver  
Smith. She was convicted in June of killing the boy because he 
wanted to watch television rather than get a diaper change. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Basuta will serve at least 25 years before she is eligible  
for parole. Under the new law, Judge William Kennedy's only other 
option was probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This defendant, even though she doesn't like to hear it, has a  
dark side to her,'' Kennedy said. ``She never showed remorse for 
the victim or his family. ... She has tried to lay blame of this 
tragedy on everyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Basuta's shoulders heaved in grief and she sometimes sobbed  
loudly as the judge imposed the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Audrey Amaral, the boy's mother, carried a photo of the boy with  
her when she addressed the court before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mrs. Basuta spends a lifetime in prison, it will be a small  
consequence compared to the death sentence that my son, Oliver 
Smith, has been given,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Basuto, a native of India who holds British citizenship,  
ran the day care center out of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	The only eyewitness to the killing was Cristina Carillo, Mrs.  
Basuta's housekeeper, who testified that Mrs. Basuta was angry at 
the boy because he kept watching television when she called him. 
She said Mrs. Basuto shook the boy, pushed him to the floor, then 
banged his head while changing the diaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Basuta insisted that Oliver was injured when another child  
pushed him and he hit his head on a brick patio. She did not 
testify but said later that the housekeeper had lied. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Oliver's death, his mother has pushed for the passage of  
Oliver's Law, which calls for stricter state regulations for day 
care centers and better training for child care providers.

<HEADLINE> Laser Pointer Mishap Brings Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- When police officer Bernard Anderson saw a  
red dot appear on his chest as he worked special duty outside a 
nightclub, he panicked, thinking it was from a laser gun sight. 
</P>
<P>
	He took cover and called for help. A police helicopter and  
patrol cars were dispatched, and soon the culprit was found: a man 
with a laser pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick O'Connor, 42, of London, Ohio, was charged with inducing  
panic and aggravated menacing for the incident in July. 
</P>
<P>
	After a preliminary hearing this week, a Nov. 10 trial date was  
set. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor was in a parking lot across the street from the  
nightclub and said he was just trying to get the attention of some 
friends when he accidentally aimed the laser at the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Kathleen Duchak, said there was no intent to harm  
or startle the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	But Anderson said: ``I can't lie. It scared the heck out of  
me.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Court: Student Can Sue School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Saying a campus disciplinary hearing had serious  
flaws, a state appeals court has ruled that a former Brandeis 
University student accused of rape should be allowed to sue the 
school for suspending him. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could have ramifications for private colleges  
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	A female student accused David A. Schaer of raping her in her  
dorm room in 1996; Schaer said they engaged in consensual sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaer, then a 20-year-old junior, was never charged criminally,  
but a school disciplinary board of six students and two faculty 
members found he was responsible for the alleged violations. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended from campus between May and August of 1996,  
preventing him from working on a biomedical research project at a 
university lab. Schaer tried to sue the school for damages, but a 
Middlesex Superior Court judge dismissed the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In overturning the lower court's ruling, the state Appeals Court  
questioned the validity of the campus disciplinary hearing, saying 
some of the testimony would never have been allowed in a court of 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the three-judge panel cited the testimony of a  
campus police officer. The female student, who reported the alleged 
rape a month after the encounter, ``looked like a rape victim,'' 
the officer testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``On what possible basis a police officer could know such a  
thing does not appear,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness testified that Schaer was a ``self-motivated  
egotistical bastard who had no respect for women,'' something the 
court said was without foundation and ``unfairly prejudicial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Lipton, Schaer's attorney, said school disciplinary panels  
are akin to kangaroo courts, and added that private colleges need 
to take a closer look at the way they discipline students. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should understand the gravity, the really serious impact  
this kind of process has on people, and how it can ruin their 
lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaer graduated from Brandeis in 1997 and is now pursuing  
graduate work in biology. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandeis officials declined comment because the case is still  
pending in court, but spokesman Dennis Nealon said Brandeis does 
not take disciplinary cases lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officials here go to great lengths to let students know from  
the very first day what is and what is not acceptable behavior,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on  
Education, said university disciplinary proceedings and conduct 
codes are ``reasonably sophisticated'' and serve an important 
purpose on American campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, Thursday's decision should be a reminder to  
schools to ``take a careful look at their internal processes to 
ensure that elementary fairness is available to both the accused 
and the accuser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Appeals Court decision could have widespread effects, said  
Harvey Silverglate, a defense attorney and co-author of ``The 
Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many instances, Silverglate said, students accused of a crime  
on campus would be better off if they were prosecuted in a courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Private colleges have generally gone on the assumption that  
they can do whatever they want,'' Silverglate said. ``Courts look 
at these on a case-by-case basis and usually private colleges get 
away with all kinds of outrageous conduct.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Benefit Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A big batch of personalized benefit statements  
went out Friday to workers who pay into the Social Security system 
but may not know how much they will get back when they retire, 
President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the Social Security Administration plans to send the  
annual contribution and benefit statements to 125 million workers. 
They are being mailed in batches of 500,000 a day, timed so that 
every worker over age 25 will receive an update once a year about 
three months before his or her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted in 1989 to require the mailings, which at 56  
cents a letter will cost about $70 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new Social Security statement will help more Americans  
understand what Social Security means to them,'' Clinton said 
before leaving the White House for a weekend fund-raising trip to 
Nevada and California. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will form a vital part of any family's financial planning  
and help more Americans chart a course to retirement that is clear 
and secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal administrators hope the statements will encourage more  
workers to see Social Security payments as only one part of a 
broader retirement income plan they must organize before they stop 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	Progress reports are already provided routinely to people  
participating in pension plans and private retirement savings and 
investment programs. Until now, workers had to ask for the 
equivalent statement detailing their Social Security standing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's hard to fully plan for tomorrow when you don't  
know where you stand today,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Race Has Powerful Role in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Race continues to play a powerful role in the  
chances for success in America, from job opportunities to education 
to housing, according to a sweeping five-year study of Boston, 
Atlanta, Detroit and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, released Friday, found  
that racial stereotypes and attitudes heavily influence the labor 
market, with blacks landing at the very bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	The mammoth, seven-volume survey was sponsored by the Russell  
Sage Foundation, a private center that researches social policy, 
and the Harvard University Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality 
and Social Policy. It looked at 9,000 households and 3,500 
employers in the four cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 researchers found that race is deeply entrenched in the  
country's cultural landscape -- perhaps even more than many 
Americans realize or are willing to admit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this study tells you not only that some of these  
perceptions are true, but it tells us in more detail where 
inequality is being generated,'' said Alice O'Connor, a historian 
at the University of California at Berkeley who wrote the 
introduction to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Initiated in the early 1990s, the project attempted to  
understand the patterns of racial inequality in modern, 
metropolitan areas and how race has been affected by economic 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, race has a pervasive influence at many  
levels, manifesting itself in everything from highly segregated 
housing to labor markets that prefer hiring some racial groups over 
others. Stereotyping is often at play, particularly when it comes 
to where people want to live and whom they will hire, Ms. O'Connor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks ``continually end up at the bottom in terms of  
preferences for neighbors as well as when employers talk about 
hiring preferences,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the study found that minorities are doing better in the  
strong economy of the 1990s, it found that they are making less 
money and working fewer hours than their white counterparts. It 
also found that they had a significantly harder time landing a job. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, for example, it took unskilled, unemployed whites an  
average of 91 hours to generate a job offer. It took blacks 167 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there is a heavy burden that minorities face in the  
job market,'' said Katherine Newman, an urban studies professor at 
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``Minorities are working, 
but they're diverging in their good fortune from whites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the household surveys, conducted by telephone between 1992  
and 1994, and the employer interviews identified pervasive 
stereotypes, particularly regarding blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks, many of those surveyed said, are more likely to be on  
welfare, more likely to commit crimes and harder to get along with 
than other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In the work force, where native-born blacks are losing jobs to  
recent immigrants, employers indicated blacks rank low on their 
hiring preference charts.

	``We didn't get a whole lot of employers coming out and saying,  
`Blacks are worthless,'' Ms. O'Connor said. Instead, she said, 
employers used certain phrases or code words. For example, they 
would talk about ``inner-city'' employees or neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers also were fearful of relocating to areas that were  
perceived as heavily minority.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders Reattachment of Penis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- A man who cut off his penis in an apparent  
suicide attempt was ordered by a judge to have it reattached. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's ruling came at the request of Norwalk Hospital,  
after the 42-year-old man refused the surgery for his 
self-inflicted injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they received a call early Wednesday that said a man  
was running along a street holding a towel to his bleeding groin. 
Officers tracked the blood to a house and found the man inside. 
</P>
<P>
	He told authorities that someone had told him if he cut off his  
penis he would bleed to death, police said. A paramedic found the 
severed penis on the apartment floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the court ruling, the man was taken to Yale-New Haven  
hospital for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear Friday if the surgery was successful.

<HEADLINE> Video Producer Admits Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A video producer pleaded guilty Friday to  
using a Cayman Islands bank to evade taxes, the first of a 
potential flood of such cases since a massive breach of the British 
colony's vaunted bank secrecy was exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle A. Pruyn admitted she concealed $240,000 at the  
now-defunct Guardian Bank &AMP; Trust Ltd. of Grand Cayman by working 
with its chairman, John M. Mathewson. As a result, Ms. Pruyn evaded 
about $40,000 in taxes from 1991 through 1993, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson opened an account for her in the name of Cogan Corp.  
about 1991, and she deposited income from her video production 
companies. No evidence exists that Cogan conducted any business, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pruyn, 45, admitted that with funds from the Cogan account,  
she bought a building and had the property held in trust for her 
children. She filed for bankruptcy in 1996, but did not disclose 
her interest in the building or the offshore Cogan account, she 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pruyn, who pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud and tax  
evasion, faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines, as 
well as an order to pay back taxes and penalties, at sentencing 
Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing Mathewson's ``unparalleled'' cooperation, a federal judge  
in August sentenced him to six months under house arrest, a $30,000 
fine and 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentencing revealed that Mathewson had pleaded guilty in  
March 1997 to charges including conspiracy, money laundering and 
aiding income tax evasions as part of plea bargains with federal 
prosecutors in Florida, New Jersey and New York. He could have 
faced nearly five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Mathewson's help, the U.S. government has recouped  
$50 million in back taxes and penalties, and can expect to get a 
total of $300 million, his lawyer has said. Authorities have not 
confirmed those figures. 
</P>
<P>
	His case, and all that may follow, developed through a stroke of  
luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson was arrested in 1996 as part of a nationwide  
investigation into cable piracy. FBI agents did not know he had 
more than a year's worth of records from Guardian Bank, including 
computer backup tapes and a list of names linking 2,000 depositors 
to the bogus corporate names on the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson immediately offered the records, leading to a  
continuing investigation that has brought 1,500 cases in about 20 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caymans, with just 40,000 residents, are home to 580 banks,  
whose deposits make it the world's fifth-largest banking center. 
Its secrecy laws make it a haven for shelter money, whether 
legitimate income or ill-gotten gains, U.S. officials maintain.

<HEADLINE> Banks Moving Against Cybercrime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's banking industry has quietly  
wired itself a $1.5 million private computer network to share 
information anonymously about electronic threats from rogue 
employees, software bugs, viruses and hackers, the Treasury 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center  
is the result of orders from President Clinton to better protect 
America's most important industries from cyber attacks. It's in a 
secret location known to only about a half-dozen people, but it's 
believed to be nestled among a corridor of high-tech firms in 
northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar centers are planned in the coming months for seven other  
industries, including telecommunications, oil and gas, electrical 
power, transportation and America's water supply system. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the White House announced its plan to create a  
government-wide security network to protect its most important 
nonmilitary computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``New threats call for new types of solutions,'' said Treasury  
Secretary Lawrence Summers, adding that banking officials need to 
learn about viruses and malicious software that disguises itself as 
innocuous code. 
</P>
<P>
	Only licensed banks and other government-regulated financial  
firms that become subscribers will be able to exchange information 
or tap into this network's details of known security threats. 
Urgent alerts will be sent by e-mail, pager and cellular phones to 
a bank's experts -- who will pay $13,000 to $125,000, depending on 
how many employees are using it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day, everywhere, people are trying to break into  
financial institutions -- and sometimes from within financial 
institutions -- trying to take money they're not authorized to 
have,'' said Kawika Daguio, vice president of the Washington-based 
Financial Information Protection Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Names and other identifying details will be stripped from  
submissions to ensure anonymity and encourage honesty -- and partly 
so rival banks don't misuse the information and regulators can 
never know a specific financial institution was having problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we demonstrated that you could have an anonymous  
capability so you can't trace it, most institutions stood up 
immediately and said, `Let's go do this,''' said Bill Marlow, 
executive vice president for Global Integrity, the consulting 
company in Reston, Va., that built the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said 16 financial institutions -- with a total of $4.5  
trillion in assets among them -- have so far joined the network, 
with 500 to 1,000 more expected to join in the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the center's greatest strengths, say organizers, will be  
its ability to notice trends: A report by one bank of a hacker 
sniffing around its network becomes more onerous if dozens of other 
banks also report noticing exactly the same technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a day goes by without seeing alerts about security,  
vulnerabilities in the products we use or news stories about 
Internet sites being compromised,'' said Steve Katz of Citigroup 
Inc., the center's coordinator. ``What might appear to any one 
company as a random event might be more significant if looked at in 
the aggregate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Treasury Department helped organize the center,  
government leaders said U.S. agencies won't eavesdrop on the threat 
information disclosed by banks. However, the government will 
volunteer details about security problems through the FBI's 
National Infrastructure Protection Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they choose to give information to the government, that's  
nice,'' said Richard Clarke of the National Security Council. ``The 
government, however, will share information with them ... both 
classified and non-classified information.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Probes Deal on Cheap Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal antitrust officials are investigating  
whether a multimillion-dollar agreement between a brand-name drug 
maker and a generic drug manufacturer kept cheaper heart medicine 
off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission is contemplating legal action  
against the companies Hoechst Marion Roussel and Andrx over a deal 
under which Andrx agreed not to sell its generic version of 
Cardizem CD, a heart medication made by Hoechst, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are aware that the staff of the Federal Trade Commission  
has recommended that some form of action be taken,'' Charles Rouse, 
spokesman for Warren, N.J.-based Hoechst, said in a telephone 
interview. ``We are confident that we have acted in an appropriate 
manner and we are confident that we have not violated any laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliot Hahn, president of the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Andrx,  
said attorneys from his company are cooperating with FTC officials, 
and he knew of no government plan to take legal action, saying the 
agreement violated no antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC spokeswoman Victoria Streitfeld would not comment on the  
case, but confirmed that officials are examining the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are conducting a number of investigations concerning the  
relationship between brand name pharmaceuticals and their potential 
generic competitors,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal between Hoechst and Andrx is one of several  
patent-related agreements between brand-name and generic drug 
makers being investigated by FTC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand-name drug manufacturers possess 20-year patents on their  
products. A generic version of the drug may be sold before the 
patent expires only if its maker can prove the patent is invalid or 
that the generic drug does not violate the patent's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	A generic drug firm that tries to sell its drug before a patent  
expires often finds itself slapped with a patent-infringement 
lawsuit. Most such cases are settled with an agreement that lets 
the generic company market its drug as long as it pays a royalty to 
the brand-name firm. 
</P>
<P>
	After six months, however, any other company can sell the drug.  
</P>
<P>
	Government officials fear that some brand-name companies are  
paying off generic companies after suing them for patent 
infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoechst had filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Andrx,  
but later agreed to a payment while the lawsuit dragged through 
court. Eventually, Hoechst dropped the lawsuit when Andrx 
reformulated its drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very, very strong basis for entering into the  
agreement (with Hoechst) and it did not violate any antitrust 
laws,'' said Andrx chief Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Any lawsuit against Hoechst and Andrx would have to be approved  
by all FTC commissioners before it was filed.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall Sharply; Gold Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices fell sharply in trading  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, as forecasters called for 
relatively dry weekend weather that will allow continued 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	In other commodities markets, gold finished higher and natural  
gas futures rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices slumped despite an estimate from a  
closely watched private analyst that production was lower than the 
government's September estimate. Many traders already expected the 
government to lower soybean production in its Oct. 8 report. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell to a 10-week low after an analyst estimated  
production was 100 million bushels higher than the U.S. Agriculture 
Department's estimate. Wheat futures prices also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday, wheat for December delivery fell 8 3/4 cents to  
$2.67 a bushel; December corn fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.05 a bushel; 
December oats fell 1 cent to $1.12 1/4 a bushel; and November soybeans 
fell 10 1/4 cent to $4.81 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lean hog futures prices rose in trading Friday on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, amid continued strong demand and expectations 
that exports will strengthen this fall. Live cattle and pork 
bellies futures also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 0.50 cent to 68.77 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose 0.78 cent to 81.85 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs rose 1.40 cents to 50.37 cents a pound; and 
February pork bellies rose 1.70 cents to 65.60 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold regained some of its value Friday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, finished up $5.80 at $305.30 per ounce, buoyed 
by the dollar's continued decline against the yen, as well as the 
slump in bonds and stocks. Prices had retreated Thursday, reversing 
a frenzied price rally earlier in the week that saw prices as high 
as $329 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum and palladium also rose.  
</P>
<P>
	December palladium rose $7.35 to $376.75 per ounce and January  
platinum rose $2.90 to $393.80 per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures rose 4.6 cents to $2.90 per 1,000 cubic feet  
in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the season's 
first cold snap prompted Midwest storage buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures dipped into the teens across Canada's prairie  
provinces and slipped in the upper 20s and 30s across the northern 
U.S. plains states. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a real tug-o-war going on in this market,''  
said analyst Tim Evans of Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. 
``We have had buying on the theory that natural gas is somehow 
undervalued relative to the crude oil market, and a little buying 
on the forward market in anticipation that the coming winter is 
going to be colder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rally, natural gas futures prices still have not  
reached the August high of $3.24, during hurricane season.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed their slide today after new  
reports showed the economy's surging growth has not slowed in 
recent months. The data renewed concerns that hints of inflation 
will prompt the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates next week. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 63.95 at 10,273.00, 
having recovered back from a loss of as much as 135 points. The 
blue-chip index ended a fairly volatile week just 6.33 points below 
last Friday's close. Broader stock indicators were mostly lower.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers presented tentative  
contracts with General Motors Corp. and its former parts unit to 
its local union leaders today, while negotiations at Ford Motor Co. 
intensified. About 500 union officials gathered here to hear 
details of the contracts covering 185,000 workers at GM and Delphi 
Automotive Systems. The union said the deal gives the average 
assembly worker $29,900 in wage increases, bonuses and holidays 
over the next four years. The union's executive council recommended 
the contract to the local unions, where ratification votes are 
expected to be completed by Oct. 10.

	Manufacturing Sector Grew in Sept.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector grew in  
September for the eighth consecutive month, while prices of raw 
materials spurted to the highest level since May 1995. The gain 
reported in the survey released today by the National Association 
of Purchasing Management was much stronger than analysts had 
predicted. It was further evidence that the economy grew strongly 
in the third quarter after a lackluster second quarter. The index 
reading for September was 57.8 percent, compared with 54.2 percent 
in August.

August but spending climbed much faster, leaving the nation's 
savings rate matching a record low. Personal income -- which 
includes wages, interest and government benefits -- rose 0.5 percent 
in August, the Commerce Department said today. The gain followed a 
0.2 percent increase in July. The Federal Reserve, seeking to slow 
the economy and keep inflation at bay, bumped up interest rates 
twice this summer, making borrowing more expensive. Fed 
policy-makers meet again on Tuesday.

projections after an earthquake last month in Taiwan slowed 
production of parts that power its computers and other machines. 
Taiwan is one of the world's top producers of the semiconductor 
chips used to run computers. Hewlett-Packard said that the 
company's revenue would grow about 10 percent in the fiscal fourth 
quarter, which ends Oct 30. Wall Street had expected 
Hewlett-Packard to report sales growth ranging from 10 percent to

nation's biggest retailer said more information is expected in the 
coming weeks as it prepares for the start of the holiday shopping

the entire retail business on the Internet, given its ability to

	Supervision of Big U.S. Banks Urged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though the U.S. banking system performed well  
during the past two years of global turmoil, the Asian financial 
crisis still pointed up a need for increased supervision of the 
country's 30 largest banks, a Federal Reserve official said today. 
Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Fed's board of governors, said 
the central bank had begun to overhaul its regulatory processes to 
provide closer supervision of these huge financial institutions 
even before the Asian crisis struck in 1997. But he said that Fed 
officials realize that ``further modifications are required in both 
that approach and capital regulations'' for these institutions.

airplane that will replace noisier US Airways jets shuttling 
between New York and Washington. The 9 a.m. shuttle between 
Washington and New York, as well as the 11 a.m. return trip, were 
flown on one of US Airways' new Airbus A-320s. Thanks to their 
high-bypass jet engines, the twin-engine planes leave noise

<HEADLINE> VA Secretary Accused of Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West Jr. cost  
taxpayers thousands of dollars by shunning commercial flights as 
required by federal rules and instead traveled on military aircraft 
on two trips, to Alaska and Louisiana, in 1998, the agency's 
inspector general says. 
</P>
<P>
	In another instance, the report said a 1998 dinner West gave at  
his home for then-Navy Secretary John Dalton and his wife was 
permissible but ``fueled the perception of waste,'' because it cost 
$283 a person for 31 guests -- a total of $9,340. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the report concluded it was improper to charge  
taxpayers $375 for a plaque awarded to Mrs. Dalton at the dinner, 
which featured the U.S. Army Band. The inspector general told West 
to reimburse the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, said West  
concurred with the findings. Agency spokesman Terry Jemison 
commented, ``The report speaks for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West has said he would leave his post before the Clinton  
presidency ends. He has been criticized by veterans groups, who 
contend he has not fought hard enough to increase the budget for 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report said West should not have used  
government aircraft unless no commercial flights were ``reasonably 
available'' and the cost of using the government plane would not 
exceed the cost of flying commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	West and a party of five left on an Air Force plane for Alaska  
on Oct. 14, 1998, with the secretary planning to speak to a native 
Alaskan convention, and visit a VA medical center, a VA regional 
office, a national cemetery and a joint facility built with the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The VA originally planned to pay the Air Force $60,000 for a  
round trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the travel of Secretary West and the other five VA  
employees had ... been booked on available commercial aircraft at 
the same government rate, their total scheduled airfare would have 
been $4,302,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving in Alaska, West was asked by the White House to  
travel to Casper, Wyo., to represent President Clinton at the 
funeral of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student 
beaten and left to die in a well-publicized killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force flew the party to Wyoming on Oct. 15 and returned  
to Washington. A separate Air Force plane was dispatched to Wyoming 
on Oct. 16 to take the group home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We checked commercial flight schedules in force at the time  
and found there was a commercial flight leaving Casper'' within an 
hour of the Air Force plane's departure, the report said. ``Had the 
secretary and his party traveled on this flight or another flight 
the following morning the use of round-trip military aircraft from 
Andrews AFB to Casper ... and back could have been avoided,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department billed the Veterans Affairs department  
$29,600 for a one-way trip to Alaska -- the portion not requested by 
the White House. The report did not list the cost of the 
Casper-Washington commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Louisiana trip on Oct. 24, 1998, West and three others  
traveled on an Air Force aircraft to Baton Rouge to speak at a 
banquet for former prisoners of war. The four returned the same day 
on an Army plane. The Pentagon billed the VA $3,396 for the 
Washington-to-Louisiana leg, but no bill had arrived for the return 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the four individuals who traveled on the military aircraft  
had planned their travel on commercial aircraft at the government 
rate, the total cost would have been $944,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that no documentation on cost comparisons was  
provided to the inspector general. ``We were told that it had been 
destroyed during the normal course of business,'' the report said, 
pointing out that the records should have been retained for a 
minimum of two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary's office did not abide by applicable ...  
regulations governing use of government aircraft nor did the 
circumstances of the travel justify the use of government 
aircraft,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grain Fall on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices fell sharply in trading on  
the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, as forecasters called for 
relatively dry weekend weather that will allow continued 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	The slump came despite an estimate from a closely watched  
private analyst that production was lower than the government's 
September estimate. Many traders already expected the government to 
lower soybean production in its Oct. 8 report. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell to a 10-week low after the analyst Sparks Cos.  
estimated production was 100 million bushels higher than the U.S. 
Agriculture Department's estimate. Wheat futures prices also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 8 3/4 cents to $2.67 a bushel;  
December corn fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.05 a bushel; December oats fell 1 
cent to $1.12 1/4 a bushel; and November soybeans fell 10 1/4 cent to 
$4.81 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lean hog futures prices rose in trading Friday on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, amid continued strong demand and expectations 
that exports will strengthen this fall. Live cattle and pork 
bellies futures also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 0.50 cent to 68.77 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose 0.78 cent to 81.85 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs rose 1.40 cents to 50.37 cents a pound; and 
February pork bellies rose 1.70 cents to 65.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Fires Thrive in Dry Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORONA, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters began to surround a blaze  
that had destroyed a home and threatened 200 others, while dozens 
of other wildfires burned out of control Friday in California and 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corona fire, 40 miles east of Los Angeles, was expected to  
be completely under control this weekend. It caused some anxious 
moments for George Valdez when it came within 50 feet of his house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was traumatic,'' he said. ``It was a matter of those  
firefighters saving it or me watching it burn. Fortunately they 
saved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, some of the dozens of wildfires that have scorched  
more than 115,000 acres in California and Oregon over the past 
month were burning in such remote, nearly inaccessible areas that 
simply getting in to fight them was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	In the California's Los Padres National Forest, two  
lightning-sparked wildfires have scorched 69,364 acres of trees and 
brush this month. Pack mules have been used to bring food, water, 
batteries and other equipment to firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, a fire that started Tuesday in the  
Sierra foothills had doubled in size to 41,111 acres. Fire crews 
protected about 50 canyon homes that were evacuated in remote 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Trinity Alps Wilderness, two large wildfires sparked by  
lightning had spread across 88,723 acres. Calmer winds and cooler 
temperatures were aiding firefighters, but creating much smokier 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Westley, about 35 miles southeast of San Francisco Bay, a  
hotshot Texas outfit that made its name putting out refinery fires 
during the Gulf War was called in to fight a huge oil fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50,000 gallons of flaming oil melted off a pile of 7 million  
cast-off tires that caught fire Sept. 22 after being hit by 
lightning.

<HEADLINE> Reno Chides Media on Waco Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno, the daughter of  
two journalists, chided reporters Thursday for stories suggesting 
she and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh have serious disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been looking at all your reports about how we are  
fighting, and I just don't see it,'' Reno told her weekly news 
conference. ``I see ... the best possible circumstance: an FBI 
director that I trust to speak out on what he believes to be right 
and tell me things as he sees it. We may disagree, but I know that 
I can count on him to give me the best advice he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of conflict between Reno and Freeh emerged two years ago  
when she rejected his recommendation that an independent counsel be 
named to investigate President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
	They reappeared recently after the FBI admitted, after six years  
of denials, that it had fired some incendiary tear gas canisters 
during the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian complex near Waco, 
Texas. Reno and the FBI both say the incendiary canisters were 
fired at a concrete bunker 40 yards away from the wood complex that 
burned hours later. Cult leader David Koresh and about 80 followers 
perished during the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering an explanation of the origin for dispute stories, Reno  
said, ``Sources love to run to you all, and you all like to 
cultivate your sources, and sometimes you hear echoes of 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she has said before, Reno argued it is common for  
investigators eager to pursue a case to disagree with prosecutors 
trying to ensure any case withstands appeals. She put disputes 
between FBI agents and Justice lawyers over when to do searches in 
a Chinese espionage case and in a campaign finance investigation 
into this category. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want a Department of Justice that rubber-stamps  
everything the FBI does, and you don't want an FBI that agrees 100 
percent with the prosecutors,'' Reno said. ``You want a healthy 
tension of people who are able to frankly and candidly express 
their opinion of the evidence and the law. And that's what I think 
we've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to accept a reporter's characterization of her  
relation to Freeh as a natural rivalry. ``And when you disagree 
with your city editor, I don't think it's a rivalry,'' she said, 
recalling city editors and reporters she has known. Reno's father 
and mother worked for The Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she and Freeh ``talk about so many different issues:  
encryption ..., how we prepare the FBI for the age of cyber-crime, 
how we deal with international issues, how we put together a 
massive investigation and prosecution in Oklahoma City, how we 
addressed the issue of the Unabomber, how we focus on hate crimes, 
how we prepare for terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cover so many extraordinarily complex issues, and sometimes  
we disagree. But we have worked together under very difficult 
circumstances in a way that I have been very happy with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reported in that context, public disagreements would not  
undermine the public's confidence in the criminal justice system, 
Reno said. ``I don't think you all do it the right way. ... You 
pick fights.''

<HEADLINE> CBS To Bring Back '$64,000 Question' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- And now for the $64,000 Question: Which network  
plans to revive TV's first big-money quiz show? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer: CBS. The network's production arm has acquired  
rights to ``The $64,000 Question'' and soon will develop a pilot. 
It will be a candidate for prime-time later this season or next 
summer, CBS spokesman Chris Ender said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may adjust the amount of prize money for inflation,'' Ender  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what an earlier revival did when it aired in syndication  
from 1976-78: It was called ``The $128,000 Question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No host has been named for this latest remake, which will be  
produced in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	TV's big-money quiz craze began on CBS in June 1956 with the  
premiere of the original ``$64,000 Question.'' Other quiz shows 
quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the nation was shocked by the revelation that some  
contestants had been given answers beforehand. Within a few years, 
all the shows had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's renewed interest could come from the success in August of  
ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', which became the summer's 
most popular series. ABC has announced it will bring 
``Millionaire'' back in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millionaire'' calls for a contestant to choose among four  
answers to each question. ``The $64,000 Question'' format allows 
two competing contestants to double their money with each correct 
response to a question drawn from their particular field of 
expertise.

<HEADLINE> Schott Hands Over Control of Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott called it a sad day Friday as she  
formally transferred control of her beloved Cincinnati Reds to 
three partners who had been limited owners of the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day, yes it is, honey,'' she said. ``I don't like  
to sell things. I'm a keeper, not a seller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The feisty businesswoman couldn't resist a swipe at the men who  
control baseball, who suspended and scolded her for remarks 
offensive to minorities and women during her 15 years as 
controlling owner of baseball's oldest professional team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I would have done differently -- except for  
stood up and fought with the boys a little more,'' Schott said. She 
made her comments in a telephone interview after completing the $67 
million deal to pass control of the Reds to Carl Lindner, whose 
role is changing from limited partner to chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	During her tenure, Schott managed to offend some Reds players  
and employees, including a former team controller who sued her. But 
she said they are all part of fond memories now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always cared about my people who work for me,'' she said.  
``The Reds have been a very dear thing to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati auto dealer became a limited partner of the team  
in 1981, bought the controlling share in 1984 and watched the team 
win the 1990 World Series. Schott, 72, said selling the Reds as 
they contend for the playoffs is particularly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very much hands-on. I did try and bring some good  
players in and everything,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she plans to do next, she replied: ``I don't know,  
honey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's owners approved the sale on Sept. 15, clearing the  
way for Friday's closing of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner, who has known Schott for years, noted her  
accomplishments as managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has always kept the fans first in her mind. For that, all  
of Cincinnati should thank her and join me in wishing her the very 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schott remains as a limited partner, holding one of the 13  
shares in the Reds' new partnership. The other partners are 
Cincinnati businessman George L. Strike; Wall Street money manager 
William Reik Jr.; Multimedia of Cincinnati Inc., a subsidiary of 
Gannett Co. Inc.; Louise Nippert Trust, Carl A. Kroch Trust and the 
Lindner-controlled Great American Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	John Allen, installed by baseball to run the Reds' daily  
operations while Schott was suspended, remains the team's managing 
executive.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test-Ban Vote Set for Oct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democratic and Republican leaders  
agreed Friday to vote Oct. 12 on a long-stalled treaty to ban 
nuclear tests worldwide. Both sides suggested rejection was likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement on the date came after Democrats reluctantly went  
along with a GOP move to force a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty with little advance debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have no choice,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D. ``This may be the best that we can get. ... We'll 
take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives have blocked a vote on the treaty for two years.  
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders now want the vote to occur -- both to  
silence increasing complaints from the Clinton administration and 
Senate Democrats and because they're sure they can defeat it. The 
treaty needs 67 votes -- two-thirds of the Senate. All 45 Democratic 
senators are expected to support it, but only two Republicans -- 
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James Jeffords of Vermont -- have 
endorsed it, and even optimistic supporters count only seven 
potential GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think this is a good treaty. We think it would put us  
in a weakened position internationally,'' Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Friday. ``But since there have been all 
these calls and demands for a vote, we have offered to vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they (Democrats) want to vote, let's vote,'' Lott added.  
``If there's not two-thirds to vote for it, it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which calls for an outright ban on all nuclear  
testing, has been signed by 152 nations, including the United 
States. But it has been ratified by only 18 of the 44 countries 
with nuclear capabilities that must ratify it for it to take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives contend the pact -- which also has not yet been  
ratified by Russia or China -- could threaten the U.S. ability to 
modernize its arsenal if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the United States already has a vast superiority  
in nuclear weapons, thanks to more than 1,000 nuclear tests during 
the Cold War, and the treaty would lock in that advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott proposed Thursday that the Senate take up the treaty next  
Wednesday, debate it for 10 hours, and then vote. Daschle objected 
at first, claiming the timing was too short and that no hearings 
had been held on it. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Daschle said he could go along if Democrats got  
more time to organize. He proposed the treaty be taken up Oct. 8, 
with a final vote Oct. 12, with 18 hours of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott agreed to the Democratic timetable.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were bleak about their hopes of mustering the needed  
votes by Oct. 12, with Daschle telling reporters he didn't know 
where the additional votes would come from. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the treaty fails, the vote would at least force senators  
to go on the record, said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior 
Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: If you are going to die, do you want to die  
with no one knowing who shot you or do you want to go at least with 
the world knowing who killed you?'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin stressed the  
importance of ratification, saying, ``The eyes of the world are on 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be in a far stronger position to insist that other  
countries do not go down the nuclear testing road if we ratify the 
treaty, '' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the treaty's case is made in ``a serious, sustained, and  
analytical way,'' there will be enough support to ratify it, he 
said, adding that three or four days would not be long enough to 
make that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the Armed Services Committee,  
which he chairs, will hold hearings on it next week. Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has refused to do 
so.
