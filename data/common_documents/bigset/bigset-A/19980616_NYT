   HONG KONG _ Now that Hong Kong has confirmed its economy is in
reverse, the bad news is coming thick and fast. Unemployment here
reached 4.2 percent from March through May, the highest rate in 15
years. And the stock market plunged 5.7 percent Monday to its
lowest closing level since Jan. 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As they have been for three weeks, Hong Kong stocks were
battered by the falling Japanese yen. Analysts also said the
unemployment figures, announced Monday by the government, eroded
the confidence of investors, since Hong Kong offers little
protection to people who lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to 1 percent or 2 percent unemployment,'' said Ian
Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce. ``People are starting to get very angry and uncertain
about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The plunge here in the benchmark Hang Seng stock index led a
steep Asian share decline. In Thailand, stocks tumbled 6 percent;
in South Korea, 4.8 percent; in the Philippines, 4.5 percent; in
Malaysia, 4.3 percent; in Singapore, 3.5 percent; in Japan, 1.3
percent, and in Indonesia, half of 1 percent. Only Taiwan, which
rose 2.3 percent, was spared.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hong Kong's market is entering its third consecutive
week of heavy losses, analysts said the worst might be yet to come.
Japan and the United States have shown no signs of intervening to
arrest the fall of the yen. And Hong Kong's property market, which
drives the broader Hang Seng index, is undergoing a huge drop in
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Hang Seng dropped 452.94 points Monday, to 7,462.50. Some
analysts said it could slide to 6,900, its lowest point in 1995. In
a report on the Hong Kong economy, Salomon Smith Barney said the
index could fall as low as 5,500.
</P>
<P>
   [The Heng Seng index rose just under 2 percent early Tuesday.
Other Asian markets were little changed; Australian and New Zealand
shares were lower.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We can shift the deck chairs, but we're not going to improve
the overall weight of the ship,'' said Jan Lee, chief economist
here at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. ``We've got to go through this
pain before we can begin to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee predicted unemployment would rise to 5.5 percent by the end
of 1998. And he said that the overall economy, which shrank at a 2
percent annual rate in the first quarter, would probably finish
1998 with a 1 percent decline _ the first full year of recession
since Hong Kong began tracking its growth in 1961.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milestones like these are fanning political tensions in this
normally apolitical territory. Several recently elected legislators
recently formed a coalition to press the government to ease the
economic pain. Coalition members, who include pro-democracy and
pro-Beijing representatives, have harshly criticized what they call
the government's aloofness and insensitivity to the plight of
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to put some money back into people's pockets,''
said Emily Lau, an outspoken pro-democracy leader who was recently
elected to the Legislative Council here. ``Hong Kong is sitting on
this huge mountain of reserves, yet the government just tells
people they have to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Lee, the head of the Liberal Party, who is leading the
coalition, said the government should inject some cash into the
economy by cutting taxes and accelerating several large public
works projects. ``We all feel that Hong Kong is facing a crisis,
but it seems that the government is unmoved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had already moved up five such projects,
worth $168 million for jobs. The government also announced a
package of more modest measures, such as expanding the civil
service and improving job-training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joseph W.P. Wong, Hong Kong's education and manpower
secretary, acknowledged that unemployment would probably rise
further before the economic crisis abated. He said retail,
restaurant and transportation industries had been hardest hit by
the recent surge in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts noted that because Hong Kong's currency is
linked to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate, the territory
had little room to maneuver in responding to external economic
pressures like the declining yen. The government has defended the
currency, the Hong Kong dollar, by raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The slumping stock market, rising unemployment and soaring
interest rates are bad enough. But for this city of inveterate
gamblers, there was no more telling sign of economic distress than
the Hong Kong Jockey Club's announcement on Sunday that the amount
of money bet on horse racing fell for the first time since it
started keeping records in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare us to the stock market or the property
market, we're not doing that badly,'' said Wilson Cheng, a
spokesman for the Jockey Club, noting that $11.9 billion had been
bet at the races in the 1998 season, a decline of eight-tenths of a
percent from the previous season. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Renewed fears that Asia's economic crisis will stall
growth in the profits of American companies sent U.S. stocks
plunging on Monday, the worst in a string of recent sell-offs that
has now erased the gains of the last three months for the Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Since crossing the 9,000 mark in April _ a level almost 1,100
points above where the blue-chip average began the year _ the Dow
has faced trouble sustaining that height.
</P>
<P>
   The widely followed barometer of the nation's top industrial
companies fell 207.01 points on Monday, to 8,627.93, a 2.3 percent
drop that left it down 6.3 percent from its record high. Some other
market gauges have fallen even more, suggesting that a stock market
correction _ a drop of 10 percent or more _ is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are increasingly concerned that Asia has yet to reach
the bottom of its economic cycle. Signs of distress there are not
only persistent, but deepening.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which many hoped would be the region's rescuer, announced
last week that its economy shrank sharply in the quarter that ended
in March, amounting to its steepest annualized decline since World
War II. The yen, a barometer of Japan's economic weakness, fell to
an eight-year low against the dollar Monday, further elevating
fears throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on the Japanese stock market and at other exchanges
across Asia fell sharply in response, setting the stage for a
decline when trading began on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're really seeing is a truly global market,'' said
Anthony Conroy, a managing director at Bankers Trust Global
Investment Management. ``If you catch a cold in Asia, it really
becomes a flu almost everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   For American companies that do business in Japan and throughout
Asia, the prospects are growing dimmer for a recovery anytime soon.
Monday, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, the maker of Post-it
notes and Scotchguard fabric protector, became the latest American
company to warn investors that earnings would be disappointing this
quarter because of Asian problems.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, analysts predicted that global companies
would be hurt in the first half of the year by Asia's troubles, but
that earnings would pick up in the second half. Now, more and more
analysts are pushing back their estimates of a recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Although companies have been reluctant to say much about how
Asia will lower earnings, Boeing, National Semiconductor, Ford,
Callaway Golf, and Analog Devices have all hinted that their
profits will continue to be pinched in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, 64 percent of the companies that have warned
analysts to revise their profit projections for the second quarter
have suggested that the estimates be lowered, according to First
Call Corp., a Boston-based firm that tracks analysts' earnings
estimates. In an average quarter, only 57 percent of companies give
such negative outlooks, First Call said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, analysts now expect profits at the companies in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 to rise 9.2 percent, down from a 13.9
percent estimate at the beginning of the year, according to a
survey by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Those projections may still prove optimistic. Profits in the S&AMP;P
500 actually rose 3.8 percent in the first quarter and are now
expected to climb 4.7 percent in the second quarter, First Call
said. That estimate is down considerably since the first of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   A flight to quality has helped the American financial markets
all year, but only the Treasury market benefitted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, the Nikkei 225 average of Japanese stocks fell 1.3
percent Monday. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index was off 5.72
percent to its lowest level since Jan. 30, 1995. European stock
markets fell as well. In early trading on Tuesday, Japanese stocks
fell slightly and Hong Kong stocks were up a bit. Other Asian
markets were little changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia is a double-edged sword,'' said Charles Johnson, head
equity trader at Blaylock &AMP; Partners in Baltimore. The problems
have dimmed the possibility that the Federal Reserve would soon
raise interest rates _ a rise is considered negative for the market
_ but ``the other edge is corporate profits,'' which may be lower
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   In uncertain times, U.S. Treasuries are seen as a haven, and
Monday a surge in demand for bonds sent the yield on the bellwether
30-year Treasury to record lows. Price increases also pushed down
the yields on most other bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, bargain hunters moved in at midday, but
sellers swamped the buyers at the end of the day. The 207-point
fall was the fifth-biggest ever for the Dow average, but in
percentage terms, the 2.3 percent decline was not among even its 20
worst days. The average is still up 9.1 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some stock analysts said that the blue-chip stock gauge was
merely beginning to reflect the declines already evident in the
broader market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology stocks, fell
29.30 points Monday to 1,715.75, a 1.68 percent decline for the
day. It is now off 10.5 percent from its April 22 high.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, another broad stock market gauge, fell
7.73 points Monday and is now off 11.7 percent from its high on
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall stock market is acting much more poorly than the
blue chip indexes,'' said Steve Shobin, chief technical analyst at
Lehman Brothers. ``Yes, there's really a correction going on.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Salomon Smith Barney study, through June 2, more
than 43 percent of the stocks in the Nasdaq composite index had
declined 30 percent or more from their 52-week highs. That compares
with 10.2 percent of stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 and almost 18 percent of
the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. During the same period,
the average decline in a Nasdaq stock has been 30.1 percent from
their 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   When looking at stocks with price declines of at least 10
percent _ the usual measure of a correction _ the percentages are
even higher. Eighty four percent of Nasdaq stocks are off that
amount, as are more than 58 percent of S&AMP;P stocks and almost 69
percent of those traded on the New York Stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Shobin of Lehman Bros. said his indicators point to more trouble
ahead. Fewer stocks are posting new highs now than in mid-April, he
said, and trading volume has been declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most corrections do not end until volume rises sharply,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps you noticed that a soccer tournament started in France
this week. Never mind the riots, never mind the strikes, say the
organizers, prepare to enjoy one of the world's great festivals of
sport.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few weeks men all over the planet will regress
to traditional patterns of behavior, slumping in front of their
television sets, neglecting their household duties.
</P>
<P>
   True aficionados will abandon their families and travel to
France, perhaps with tickets to games, but probably not, thanks to
the French authorities _ and preferably not, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   The mark of a true fan is to travel to a stadium without means
of admission, hand over the next year's housekeeping payments to a
scalper and receive in return a forged ticket that will be rejected
at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   That's devotion to the game. We admire it as much as the next
man.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: we said ``man.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful studies, albeit controversial in some quarters, suggest
that most football fans are male. Increasingly these days, women
may affect an interest in the game, but on closer examination they
turn out to be mainly interested in men, either off the field or
on, not in the sport itself.
</P>
<P>
   That is as it should be. But what is only now coming to be
understood, thanks to new scientific research, is the terrible
price that men pay for their devotion, and the shocking biological
advantage that women derive from indulging it.
</P>
<P>
   Men are literally killing themselves for love of the game _ and
women are cheering them on.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-known fact that women live longer than men. But
scientists have long puzzled over why this should be. Biologically
speaking, childbirth makes perceptibly greater demands on women
than on men: you might expect female life expectancy to be lower,
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't it? The answer is shocking, even scandalous. According
to the new research, it is because mothers spend more time than
fathers looking after their children.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tested this theory by examining various kinds
of monkey. They found a strong correlation between the time females
spend caring for their offspring and the longevity of females
relative to males.
</P>
<P>
   Where females do all the caring, their advantage in life
expectancy is greatest; where males share more of the burden, the
female advantage in life span is less.
</P>
<P>
   In about 99 percent of cases, females do more caring than males,
but the clincher is that the researchers also examined two species
_ the owl monkey and the titi monkey _ where males are the main
carers. In both these species, males live longer than females.
</P>
<P>
   The less time males spend looking after their offspring, it
seems, the more time they spend competing with each other for
status, either by fighting each other or pursuing an irrational
dedication to ball games.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, such struggles make greater demands on one's physical
resources than giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it will be argued that it is premature to base moral
guidance on these results. We disagree. Yes, questions will be
raised about the researchers' findings, or about the Darwinian
rationale that appears to validate them, but these and other
details need not detain us.
</P>
<P>
   The point is clear. Women, deplorably, have been monopolizing
the raising of children and encouraging men to put their very lives
in jeopardy by watching lots of football.
</P>
<P>
   Men, turn off that television and cancel that trip to France. Be
a new man and, this time, mean it. Change a diaper, by God, and put
years on your life. &QL;

   Why isn't it? The answer is shocking, even scandalous. According
to the new research, it is because mothers spend more time than
fathers looking after their children.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tested this theory by examining various kinds
of monkey. They found a strong correlation between the time females
spend caring for their offspring and the longevity of females
relative to males.
</P>
<P>
   Where females do all the caring, their advantage in life
expectancy is greatest; where males share more of the burden, the
female advantage in life span is less.
</P>
<P>
   In about 99 percent of cases, females do more caring than males,
but the clincher is that the researchers also examined two species
_ the owl monkey and the titi monkey _ where males are the main
carers. In both these species, males live longer than females.
</P>
<P>
   The less time males spend looking after their offspring, it
seems, the more time they spend competing with each other for
status, either by fighting each other or pursuing an irrational
dedication to ball games.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, such struggles make greater demands on one's physical
resources than giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it will be argued that it is premature to base moral
guidance on these results. We disagree. Yes, questions will be
raised about the researchers' findings, or about the Darwinian
rationale that appears to validate them, but these and other
details need not detain us.
</P>
<P>
   The point is clear. Women, deplorably, have been monopolizing
the raising of children and encouraging men to put their very lives
in jeopardy by watching lots of football.
</P>
<P>
   Men, turn off that television and cancel that trip to France. Be
a new man and, this time, mean it. Change a diaper, by God, and put
years on your life. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When viewed from above, the debate now raging in Europe over
genetically modified organisms looks rather like a crop circle.
Those for and against the release of such species are cutting
complex patterns into deep fields of scientific and social opinion.
</P>
<P>
   To the public, the meaning of these patterns is unclear _ except
that dangerous and mysterious forces are plainly at work.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, an American agricultural and biotechnology company,
has just launched a K1 million ($1.6 million) campaign to convince
Europeans they have nothing to fear, ecologically or
physiologically, from such products as herbicide-resistant soybeans
or vitamin-enhanced oils.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including most recently the Prince of Wales, accuse the
biotechnology industry of being more interested in plundering the
crop than splendor in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are left confused. Those who oppose genetically
modified foods have not always been honest about their possible
benefits. Those who favor them have not always been honest about
their possible costs.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Europeans are more skeptical of genetic
engineering than Americans. But they are willing to make
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic modification of animals for medical research or drug
development is seen as a necessary evil. And so long as such
animals are kept inside the laboratory, public concerns are largely
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically engineered plants are seen as a different matter:
does it make sense to meddle with nature for the sake of a sweeter
beet or a brighter tomato?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike transgenic animals, such plants are designed to live in
the open, where they may crossbreed with wild relatives _ and
products made with them will end up on the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   It is right to be extremely cautious about messing with the food
supply. Even so, much of the public fear about genetics comes from
poor understanding.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is the idea that genetic modification in the
laboratory is more dangerous than genetic modification in the
field, which is long-established. Laboratory modification
introduces alien and unnatural genes into crops, it is argued,
where their eventual effects are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of, say, strawberries engineered to produce the natural
antifreeze that occurs in flounder or beetles add to the sense of
strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most plants that have been genetically modified contain
genes from related plant species or some of their natural microbial
neighbors. And the genes and proteins (especially the ones that
scientists are keenest to swap) of bacteria and plants are very
similar in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Another misunderstanding leads to the fear that antibiotic
resistance could be transferred from plants to bacteria in the
human gut, creating dangerous pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   This risk is no greater for engineered foods than for
conventional ones _ and no such risk has yet been demonstrated in
either instance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is untrue that planting seeds modified to resist
herbicides will lead to fields being stripped of all other life, as
Prince Charles alleged this week in Britain's Daily Telegraph.
Microorganisms and animal life will be no more affected than
before.
</P>
<P>
   Although these answers may go some way to placating the public,
they fail to address some trickier questions.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if a new gene is introduced into the wrong section
of the plant's own DNA, leading to subtle changes in its chemistry?
What if a new gene moves from a modified plant to an unmodified
bystander? If something goes wrong, how can it be put right?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, nobody knows. There have been isolated reports of
such ``what if'' cases arising in practice, but scientists have
made no systematic assessment of their frequency or significance.
</P>
<P>
   Trials to date have been too short or too small to shed much
light. And like some drug complications, ecological side-effects
may take years to appear. It proves little that there is no
evidence of harm so far.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of plant modification often argue that the new
techniques are really no different from traditional plant-breeding.
Why all the fuss now?, they ask, puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   They are right _ but they also miss the point, which is the need
to win the public's trust. The fiasco of mad-cow disease (BSE) has
dented the credibility of scientists and politicians when it comes
to food.
</P>
<P>
   Although BSE has nothing to do with genetic modification, that
sorry tale has added to fears that the same commercial pressures
which forced unsafe feed into animals are pushing unproven crops
into people.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech industry is also vulnerable to the charge that it
tried to force-feed the market by flooding Europe with so much
modified soya as to make regulating it impossible. That evoked a
reaction. Now, no one can blithely ignore the opposition to the new
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and industry must accept that the BSE crisis has put
the burden of proof in food safety firmly on to the innovator,
where it belonged in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Greater public disclosure (in the form of labelling) and tighter
regulation (through more systematic testing both before and after
release) are desirable in themselves _ and have become politically
inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   This need not stifle innovation, as some companies may fear.
Strict regulation is hardly a novelty for biotechnology firms. If,
as seems likely, the greatest benefit of genetic modifications is
in their potential as ``functional foods'' or even as therapeutic
drugs, then a new regime will anyway be needed to regulate these
novel properties.
</P>
<P>
   And the task of educating the public is not as hopeless as some
companies appear to think. Consider the results of Switzerland's
recent referendum on genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Although voters were divided on the issue just weeks ago,
Switzerland's scientists opened their laboratories and expressed
their views. The result was a two-thirds majority against a ban on
genetic modification of plants and animals and their release into
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   If other scientists follow the Swiss and open a public
conversation, the public must be willing to listen politely.
</P>
<P>
   It is profoundly unhelpful to storm off in a huff _ destroying
transgenic seeds and pulling up field trials, as has happened in
France, Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The need is for good information: destroying the fields that are
the best means of supplying it is simply perverse.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically modified crops have great potential to improve plant
and human health. If the first product on the market had been a
nutritionally enhanced rice rather than a high-tech tomato,
consumer response might now be very different.
</P>
<P>
   Today's debate offers scientists another chance to engage the
public and assuage their fears. For the future of biotechnology,
these are seeds worth sowing. &QL;

QUIXOTIC JOHN MCCAIN: TILTING AT WINDMILLS _ AND THE WHITE HOUSE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   At times it is hard to keep up: a flurry of farewells to a
visitor who just happens to be Bill Gates; a quick ride to the
Senate on Capitol Hill's own subway system; a 10-minute confab with
the Senate leader, Trent Lott, in an attempt to save a tobacco bill
that will force the cigarette-makers to discourage their own
customers and pay the government some $516 billion over the next 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, marching past the gawking tourists and the
statues of politicians long since forgotten, the thoughts of
Chairman McCain: ``You do it because it's right...You do the best
you can.'' Does that make John McCain, senior Republican senator
from Arizona and chairman of the Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, a driven man?
</P>
<P>
   It is a tempting notion. After all, there is no other senator
with quite the same experience of the tricks of fate: shot down
over Vietnam; horribly tortured during more than five years'
captivity in the ``Hanoi Hilton,'' half of them in solitary
confinement; financed in his early political career by a man who
turned out to be a crook.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the deep-brown eyes have a piercing quality to them;
no wonder the energy level is almost frenetic, as though there is
too much to do and not enough time to do it in.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain himself says: ``I learned a long time ago that things
are transient around here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tone is of fatalistic humor, not anguished exasperation.
Perhaps the senator is driven, but surely not in a partisan or
self-promoting way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you take McCain at his word _ ``You do it because it's
right'' _ and you believe him. Why else would he have sponsored
last year's abortive attempt to reform a system of campaign finance
that so obviously benefits his party more than the Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would he be pushing for a tobacco bill that will
penalize some of his party's biggest corporate donors _ and, if the
tobacco industry's advertisements work, alienate a working class of
chain-smoking Americans by forcing them to cough up another $1.10 a
pack in taxes over the next five years (they already pay around
$2.85 a pack to enjoy what is still, just, a legal vice).
</P>
<P>
   There is a quixotic quality to the war-hero's legislative jousts
that can leave his party colleagues seething: they know they can
foil his ambitions but they fear being publicly embarrassed in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   All of which endears McCain both to the Democrats and to the
media. The Democrats would warm to any opponent who dares to ruffle
the smooth Lott (last weekend the Senate leader had prematurely
declared the tobacco bill ``dead'').
</P>
<P>
   The media love the idea, indeed the reality, of a politician of
principle and independence, especially one who cracks
self-deprecating jokes and will defy any number of time zones to
appear on the TV talk shows. As Esquire magazine headlined an
article last month, ``John McCain Walks on Water.''
</P>
<P>
   So will he walk, as some predict and many hope, out of the
Senate and into the White House in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself skirts the issue; after all, he still has to be
elected (easily, one would think) to a third Senate term in this
November's election.
</P>
<P>
   But the pundits are happy to speculate on the senator's behalf.
He looks good on television (better, in fact, than in real life,
where he looks every one of his 60 years and where his arms _
broken in his Vietnam crash and distorted by his captors _ are
bowed in stiff curves).
</P>
<P>
   His personal skeletons are no longer hidden: rampant infidelity
to the disabled first wife who waited for his return from war, and
his membership of the ``Keating Five,'' senators who interceded
with regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, the savings-and-loan
fraudster who had helped finance McCain's political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   For some politicians, such failings would be electorally fatal;
but part of McCain's charm is that he readily admits his mistakes.
Even though the senator was exonerated in the Keating case, he
nonetheless still feels he betrayed his sense of honor.
</P>
<P>
   He has, too, the electorally useful knack of reducing the
complex issue to the comprehensible sound bite. The tobacco bill,
for example, is needed because ``3,000 kids will start smoking
every day, and 1,000 of them will die from smoking-related
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for all the tilting at windmills, he has a certain mastery
of the political process: campaign-finance reform, for example, was
sustained as an issue long beyond the patience of Lott and the
House Speaker, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The same will be true, one suspects, of the tobacco bill (this
week's kiss-of-life involves buying off Republican opponents by
lessening the tax-penalty on some married couples and by giving
extra money to anti-drugs programs, including a provision allowing
student victims of drug-related violence to transfer to private
schools).
</P>
<P>
   But there is one obvious pitfall on McCain's path to 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue. The senator may be a good conservative in the
Republican tradition, but he pays scant attention to Republican
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, for example, he was the sole Republican senator
to vote against the Telecommunications Act, on the ground that it
did not go far enough in the cause of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he compounds his maverick reputation with his present
Democrat-friendly desires to mop up excessive money and to penalize
a whole industry.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, why on earth should the Republicans want to
nominate him when they have the loyal George W. Bush, governor of
Texas, as an attractive alternative, let alone a queue of other
hopefuls from Steve Forbes to Dan Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   How will McCain amass the war chest to force his candidacy upon
them? And besides, what exactly would the senator's message be?
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, none of this seems to worry the senator. As one
Republican insider says, ``Being a POW seems to give a guy a
different focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as McCain, musing on the tobacco bill, says, ``One of these

<TEXT>
<P>
   At times it is hard to keep up: a flurry of farewells to a
visitor who just happens to be Bill Gates; a quick ride to the
Senate on Capitol Hill's own subway system; a 10-minute confab with
the Senate leader, Trent Lott, in an attempt to save a tobacco bill
that will force the cigarette-makers to discourage their own
customers and pay the government some $516 billion over the next 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, marching past the gawking tourists and the
statues of politicians long since forgotten, the thoughts of
Chairman McCain: ``You do it because it's right...You do the best
you can.'' Does that make John McCain, senior Republican senator
from Arizona and chairman of the Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, a driven man?
</P>
<P>
   It is a tempting notion. After all, there is no other senator
with quite the same experience of the tricks of fate: shot down
over Vietnam; horribly tortured during more than five years'
captivity in the ``Hanoi Hilton,'' half of them in solitary
confinement; financed in his early political career by a man who
turned out to be a crook.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the deep-brown eyes have a piercing quality to them;
no wonder the energy level is almost frenetic, as though there is
too much to do and not enough time to do it in.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain himself says: ``I learned a long time ago that things
are transient around here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tone is of fatalistic humor, not anguished exasperation.
Perhaps the senator is driven, but surely not in a partisan or
self-promoting way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you take McCain at his word _ ``You do it because it's
right'' _ and you believe him. Why else would he have sponsored
last year's abortive attempt to reform a system of campaign finance
that so obviously benefits his party more than the Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would he be pushing for a tobacco bill that will
penalize some of his party's biggest corporate donors _ and, if the
tobacco industry's advertisements work, alienate a working class of
chain-smoking Americans by forcing them to cough up another $1.10 a
pack in taxes over the next five years (they already pay around
$2.85 a pack to enjoy what is still, just, a legal vice).
</P>
<P>
   There is a quixotic quality to the war-hero's legislative jousts
that can leave his party colleagues seething: they know they can
foil his ambitions but they fear being publicly embarrassed in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   All of which endears McCain both to the Democrats and to the
media. The Democrats would warm to any opponent who dares to ruffle
the smooth Lott (last weekend the Senate leader had prematurely
declared the tobacco bill ``dead'').
</P>
<P>
   The media love the idea, indeed the reality, of a politician of
principle and independence, especially one who cracks
self-deprecating jokes and will defy any number of time zones to
appear on the TV talk shows. As Esquire magazine headlined an
article last month, ``John McCain Walks on Water.''
</P>
<P>
   So will he walk, as some predict and many hope, out of the
Senate and into the White House in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself skirts the issue; after all, he still has to be
elected (easily, one would think) to a third Senate term in this
November's election.
</P>
<P>
   But the pundits are happy to speculate on the senator's behalf.
He looks good on television (better, in fact, than in real life,
where he looks every one of his 60 years and where his arms _
broken in his Vietnam crash and distorted by his captors _ are
bowed in stiff curves).
</P>
<P>
   His personal skeletons are no longer hidden: rampant infidelity
to the disabled first wife who waited for his return from war, and
his membership of the ``Keating Five,'' senators who interceded
with regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, the savings-and-loan
fraudster who had helped finance McCain's political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   For some politicians, such failings would be electorally fatal;
but part of McCain's charm is that he readily admits his mistakes.
Even though the senator was exonerated in the Keating case, he
nonetheless still feels he betrayed his sense of honor.
</P>
<P>
   He has, too, the electorally useful knack of reducing the
complex issue to the comprehensible sound bite. The tobacco bill,
for example, is needed because ``3,000 kids will start smoking
every day, and 1,000 of them will die from smoking-related
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for all the tilting at windmills, he has a certain mastery
of the political process: campaign-finance reform, for example, was
sustained as an issue long beyond the patience of Lott and the
House Speaker, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The same will be true, one suspects, of the tobacco bill (this
week's kiss-of-life involves buying off Republican opponents by
lessening the tax-penalty on some married couples and by giving
extra money to anti-drugs programs, including a provision allowing
student victims of drug-related violence to transfer to private
schools).
</P>
<P>
   But there is one obvious pitfall on McCain's path to 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue. The senator may be a good conservative in the
Republican tradition, but he pays scant attention to Republican
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, for example, he was the sole Republican senator
to vote against the Telecommunications Act, on the ground that it
did not go far enough in the cause of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he compounds his maverick reputation with his present
Democrat-friendly desires to mop up excessive money and to penalize
a whole industry.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, why on earth should the Republicans want to
nominate him when they have the loyal George W. Bush, governor of
Texas, as an attractive alternative, let alone a queue of other
hopefuls from Steve Forbes to Dan Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   How will McCain amass the war chest to force his candidacy upon
them? And besides, what exactly would the senator's message be?
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, none of this seems to worry the senator. As one
Republican insider says, ``Being a POW seems to give a guy a
different focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as McCain, musing on the tobacco bill, says, ``One of these
days I'll be in the old soldiers' home with my feet up, and I'll
ask myself: `Did I try my best?' If it fails, it fails...Someone
else will try.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW LONDON, CONN. _ Along the coast of Connecticut lies a group
of port cities, all of which have been battered by the loss of jobs
in the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven (in spite of the presence of Yale University) and
Bridgeport (surrounded by one of the richest communities in
America) are both down-at-heel.
</P>
<P>
   Further north is New London, once the heart of the world's
nuclear submarine industry and now a windswept clutter of vacant
sites and boarded-up buildings along the appropriately named Thames
River.
</P>
<P>
   But New London has been luckier than its Connecticut neighbors:
and its luck may carry a lesson for the way universities can
influence urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In New London, the most renowned university is not (as Yale is)
right in the desolate center of town. Instead, Connecticut College
perches on a hill high above the river, its granite campus cut off
by a highway from the rest of the town.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it has been resented: ``We thought of the college as
those monied folks on the hill who don't pay property tax,'' says
one New London businessman.
</P>
<P>
   As in many American towns, when industry went, it left behind
the bodies that pay little or no local tax _ hospitals, schools,
universities _ and a lot of people on lower wages, or on none at
all.
</P>
<P>
   New London was a victim of the peace dividend of the early
1990s. A decade ago, its corner of America was more dependent on
defense jobs than almost any other.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s the largest employer in the region, a submarine
builder called Electric Boat, owned by General Dynamics, which had
once employed 23,000 people, began to cut its labor force to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500 professional jobs in a naval underwater research
center also went last year. In a labor market which today has
around 150,000 jobs, these were heavy blows.
</P>
<P>
   The job losses have been largely offset by the opening, a few
miles away, of two vast casinos on Indian land. Between them, these
now directly employ about 17,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The more lasting damage has come from the loss of buoyancy in
property tax. Connecticut is a state of 169 urban fiefs, each keen
to tax and spend; and New London is a high-tax city.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because it has few taxpayers and many demands:
``With 33 houses of worship, two colleges and a hospital, almost
half our six square miles is not taxable,'' says Richard Brown, the
city manager.
</P>
<P>
   But the town also has higher poverty and lower incomes than its
neighbors. Unusually for this largely white corner of Connecticut,
a third of its people are black.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, the Republican state government has been
trying to breathe life into New London. So, not always
harmoniously, have the town's governing Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, at the state's initiative, Claire Gaudiani, the
glamorous and energetic 53-year-old president of Connecticut
College, was recruited to revive the town's moribund development
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from bringing together New London's businesses to think
about their town's future, she offered something else the
politicians could not match: connections.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, in Groton, is the main American research base
of Pfizer, a large pharmaceutical company. Ms. Gaudiani dropped in
on its boss, George Milne, and persuaded him to take charge of
corporate development for the new body.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, she recalls, ``He changed from a director to
a client'': he put to his board the idea of expanding on the town's
largest empty site, a stretch of riverbank where an old linoleum
mill once stood.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Pfizer announced that it would go ahead, eventually
bringing 2,000 top-notch jobs to the city center.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the town has been dramatic. Some officials resent
this coup de theatre by an academic (French literature) and a woman
at that, but they admit that the housing market has perked up and
that other companies are suddenly showing an interest in moving in.
</P>
<P>
   In time, they expect the new Pfizer plant to bring in 12-15
percent of the town's property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Pfizer fall for Ms. Gaudiani's charm? In fact, says
ilne, Pfizer's first plant was in Brooklyn, and the company sees
being a socially concerned employer as part of a culture that will
attract bright young scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The new center will look exciting, with a ferry to skim across
to the Groton office for lunch. ``I believe very much that the
nature of a company's buildings can be a competitive advantage,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   But there were drawbacks, too, of the kind that matter to
upmarket companies: a site that might turn out to be contaminated,
bringing an expensive liability to clean up; a lack of employment
opportunities for the spouses of employees; and no decent airport.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as happens increasingly in such situations, the state
and city between them have removed or underwritten most worries
about liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   They have also removed most of the property-tax burden that
would fall on the company in the first decade. As a result, the new
site may not cost Pfizer any more, at least at first, than a
greenfield site would have done.
</P>
<P>
   As for transport, the train links with New York and Boston are
being electrified, and next year that will make New London about 1
hours from each city.
</P>
<P>
   Having pulled off her coup, Ms. Gaudiani is now keen to pull off
more _ one a quarter, she hopes. She is working her contacts,
artistic and corporate, and dreams of turning New London into ``a
hip little town.''
</P>
<P>
   She took on the task partly, she says, because she felt the
college owed something to the town: in the early years of the
century, when colleges for women were still rare, the citizens of
New London collected money and donated the land for Connecticut
College, which is now co-ed.
</P>
<P>
   The town's press and businesses did not initially return the
compliment. The Pfizer deal has changed all that. Now, says Ms.
Gaudiani, she is startled to see the effect of the college's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had wildly underestimated the impact that a college
president had to convene and request and engage and inspire,'' she
says effusively. ``All over our country, we in higher education
could do a lot more if we used the moral juice that comes in our
food basket and let others have a sip.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that other college presidents might take on
board. Just along the coast, the larger town of New Haven is
wrestling with some of the same difficulties as New London. But
Yale, which is starting to feel the impact, has been slow to use
its academic prestige on the city's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd encourage the president of Yale to say to his board, `I'm
going to spend a third of my time on New Haven' _ it's that
important,'' says Ms. Gaudiani. &QL;

   ``Two bald men fighting over a comb'' was how one observer
described the sudden eruption of war between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   They are, per head of population, the two poorest countries in
the world, bar Mozambique. Yet they are fighting for a few square
miles of barren mountain where a few thousand souls barely scratch
a living. The whole border is now a battle zone, and the two
countries are on war footing.
</P>
<P>
   Minor tank and artillery battles broke out in early May. The
ostensible reason was that each government accused the other of
incursions across the poorly marked common border.
</P>
<P>
   A joint American and Rwandan peacemaking team shuttled between
the capitals, coming up with a four-point plan: both sides should
withdraw their troops from the border, which would then be observed
by international monitors, civilian authority would be restored to
the disputed areas, and an investigation held into the root causes
of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, announced
that he had accepted the plan. But, at the same time, he said that
his defense forces had been instructed ``to take all steps needed
to foil the Eritrean invasion,'' and that the Eritreans must
withdraw from areas they had occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea also agreed to the plan but said it would withdraw its
troops only if the border area were demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Eritrean aircraft were reported to have bombed the
airport at Mekele, a small town in northern Ethiopia. Eritrea,
however, denies that it was the first to attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the early afternoon, four Ethiopian MiGs bombed the airport
at Asmara, Eritrea's capital. Mekele was bombed again in the
evening but on this occasion the bombs fell on residential areas
including a primary school, killing 47 people, according to the
Ethiopians. The peace plan was blown to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Meles and Issaias Afwerki, Eritrea's president, appear to be as
surprised as everybody else to find they are at war. Neither are
military buffoons in search of glory or empires.
</P>
<P>
   They hold similar views, face similar problems, have common
allies and the same enemies. They were once brothers-in-arms in the
struggle against the Soviet-backed dictatorship of Mengistu Haile
Mariam.
</P>
<P>
   So why are they fighting?
</P>
<P>
   A popular theory is that geography is reasserting itself. The
Eritreans supported the Ethiopian rebels in the fight against the
Mengistu regime on condition that, when they came to power, Eritrea
would be allowed to secede. This happened, but Eritrea's secession
left Ethiopia landlocked, dependent on Eritrean goodwill for its
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Various irritations may have stirred Ethiopia's fear of being
cut off from the sea, and Eritrea's fear that its new independence
might be infringed by a resentful Ethiopia. The border, according
to this theory, was just a pretext for fighting over more serious
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But, even in private, neither side admits to any serious
disagreement beyond the border dispute. The Ethiopians cite the
agreements the two countries have signed on free trade,
environmental protection and even military cooperation as evidence
of how well they had been getting on.
</P>
<P>
   Their explanation for the conflict puts the blame on Afwerki:
since he has failed to make life better for most of his people, he
needs a war to distract and unify them.
</P>
<P>
   The Eritreans say that the problems had been festering for a
long time. They claim to have offered Ethiopia cooperation, even
integration, leading to the ending of all barriers between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Eritrea, militiamen from the border province
of Tigray persistently encroached on Eritrean territory, ignoring
polite requests to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Eritreans recently found a new map issued in
Tigray which showed parts of Eritrea as Ethiopia. So they decided
to hold on to disputed ground, and this led to further clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, in its five years of independence, has been quick to
pick fights: it has had shooting wars with both Yemen and Djibouti
and vows to overthrow the Sudan government.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it had 100,000 men under arms (with only 4
million people) and demobilization has been slow, with little
employment at the end. Yet an ill-marked border is seldom a cause
for war between friends _ and it is still uncertain who fired
first. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is no secret that fathers _ even ``new age''
fathers _ tend to spend less time than mothers caring for their
children. It is equally well known that men tend to have shorter
lives than women.
</P>
<P>
   In America, for instance, the average male life span is 73
years, whereas women on average live to be 79.
</P>
<P>
   That the two facts might be connected, however, is surprising.
But research just published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences by John Allman of the California Institute of
Technology and his colleagues suggests that they are.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in longevity between the sexes, at least in
primates, seem to depend on which parent looks after the kids and
how much effort she (or he) puts into it.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the relationship between child-care and
longevity, if any, would work against the chief carers. Bringing up
children is a grind. But evolution does not work like that.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been established that animals which have evolved to
produce lots of offspring tend to do their breeding early.
Producing offspring uses up resources that might otherwise be
devoted to self-preservation _ so, as you would expect, animals
that have many offspring tend to have short lives.
</P>
<P>
   Animals which have evolved to produce fewer children live longer
_ and are able to invest more in caring for those children that
they do have.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests a link between caring and life span, an idea that
might be extended to differences between the sexes. If so, it
predicts that the care-giving sex (the females, in people and most
other mammals) would live longer than the non-care-giving one.
</P>
<P>
   To see if this was true, Dr. Allman and his colleagues gathered
data on the life spans of ten primates, including man. In all of
these species, the mothers usually have their babies one at a time,
and those offspring are dependent on at least one of their parents
for several years after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Who does what with baby, though, varies a lot from species to
species, depending to a large extent on how sure a male is that the
baby in question is really his.
</P>
<P>
   Male chimpanzees take no interest in any infants who might be
around. Female chimps are extremely promiscuous and males,
therefore, have little idea who their children are.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allman's group found that female chimpanzees live, on
average, about 40 percent longer than males.
</P>
<P>
   Male gorillas, like men, form stronger bonds with particular
females, and thus have more confidence that those females' children
are also their own. Males of both species frequently play with
their infants and protect them from threats, but they still have a
lesser role than females in rearing their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Female gorillas live 12.5 percent longer than males, and women
about 8 percent longer than men.
</P>
<P>
   The acid test, however, was to gather data from species where
the main burden of parental care falls on the male. There are such
animals, in fact, but not many (only about 1 percent of mammals
show any male parental care at all).
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers managed to find two monkeys where the
father is very new age _ the titi monkey and the owl monkey. Not
surprisingly, the bonds between males and females are unusually
strong in these species, so the male's confidence in his fatherhood
is high.
</P>
<P>
   In both titi and owl monkeys, the father assumes the critical
duty of carrying his children around until they are able to move
safely and independently through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Infant titi and owl monkeys spend much of their time clinging
tenaciously to their fathers' fur. They are transferred to their
mothers only during brief nursing periods. If the father dies, the
mother will refuse to carry the infant, leaving it to die too.
</P>
<P>
   Gratifyingly for Dr. Allman's theory, in both owl monkeys and
titi monkeys, males live about 20 percent longer than females.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the argument _ that the non-care-giving sex is
trading a shorter life for some evolutionary advantage earlier on _
also makes some sense, at least for males. The more ``available''
that females are, due to lack of a permanent pair bond, the more
they are worth competing for.
</P>
<P>
   Such competition, whether it involves direct conflict between
males, or showing off to females, is not cost-free. But if it
results in extra offspring (or, at least, if not competing
guarantees no offspring), then it is worth it, evolutionarily
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, suggests that female titi and owl monkeys must be
involved in a life-shortening trade-off of their own. Just what
this is remains unknown. But it is at least heartening to discover
that natural selection, despite its pitiless motivations, has found
a way to reward nurturing parents. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is no secret that fathers _ even ``new age''
fathers _ tend to spend less time than mothers caring for their
children. It is equally well known that men tend to have shorter
lives than women.
</P>
<P>
   In America, for instance, the average male life span is 73
years, whereas women on average live to be 79.
</P>
<P>
   That the two facts might be connected, however, is surprising.
But research just published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences by John Allman of the California Institute of
Technology and his colleagues suggests that they are.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in longevity between the sexes, at least in
primates, seem to depend on which parent looks after the kids and
how much effort she (or he) puts into it.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the relationship between child-care and
longevity, if any, would work against the chief carers. Bringing up
children is a grind. But evolution does not work like that.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been established that animals which have evolved to
produce lots of offspring tend to do their breeding early.
Producing offspring uses up resources that might otherwise be
devoted to self-preservation _ so, as you would expect, animals
that have many offspring tend to have short lives.
</P>
<P>
   Animals which have evolved to produce fewer children live longer
_ and are able to invest more in caring for those children that
they do have.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests a link between caring and life span, an idea that
might be extended to differences between the sexes. If so, it
predicts that the care-giving sex (the females, in people and most
other mammals) would live longer than the non-care-giving one.
</P>
<P>
   To see if this was true, Dr. Allman and his colleagues gathered
data on the life spans of ten primates, including man. In all of
these species, the mothers usually have their babies one at a time,
and those offspring are dependent on at least one of their parents
for several years after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Who does what with baby, though, varies a lot from species to
species, depending to a large extent on how sure a male is that the
baby in question is really his.
</P>
<P>
   Male chimpanzees take no interest in any infants who might be
around. Female chimps are extremely promiscuous and males,
therefore, have little idea who their children are.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allman's group found that female chimpanzees live, on
average, about 40 percent longer than males.
</P>
<P>
   Male gorillas, like men, form stronger bonds with particular
females, and thus have more confidence that those females' children
are also their own. Males of both species frequently play with
their infants and protect them from threats, but they still have a
lesser role than females in rearing their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Female gorillas live 12.5 percent longer than males, and women
about 8 percent longer than men.
</P>
<P>
   The acid test, however, was to gather data from species where
the main burden of parental care falls on the male. There are such
animals, in fact, but not many (only about 1 percent of mammals
show any male parental care at all).
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers managed to find two monkeys where the
father is very new age _ the titi monkey and the owl monkey. Not
surprisingly, the bonds between males and females are unusually
strong in these species, so the male's confidence in his fatherhood
is high.
</P>
<P>
   In both titi and owl monkeys, the father assumes the critical
duty of carrying his children around until they are able to move
safely and independently through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Infant titi and owl monkeys spend much of their time clinging
tenaciously to their fathers' fur. They are transferred to their
mothers only during brief nursing periods. If the father dies, the
mother will refuse to carry the infant, leaving it to die too.
</P>
<P>
   Gratifyingly for Dr. Allman's theory, in both owl monkeys and
titi monkeys, males live about 20 percent longer than females.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the argument _ that the non-care-giving sex is
trading a shorter life for some evolutionary advantage earlier on _
also makes some sense, at least for males. The more ``available''
that females are, due to lack of a permanent pair bond, the more
they are worth competing for.
</P>
<P>
   Such competition, whether it involves direct conflict between
males, or showing off to females, is not cost-free. But if it
results in extra offspring (or, at least, if not competing
guarantees no offspring), then it is worth it, evolutionarily
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, suggests that female titi and owl monkeys must be
involved in a life-shortening trade-off of their own. Just what
this is remains unknown. But it is at least heartening to discover
that natural selection, despite its pitiless motivations, has found
a way to reward nurturing parents. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Declare independence on Independence Day
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, June 17, 1998
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If they already have not done so, advertising types all over the
nation are preparing the copy for their giant Fourth of July sales.
Soon, we will be inundated with newspaper inserts and television
commercials telling us to rush down to this department store or
that appliance store on the Fourth to buy, purportedly on sale,
anything from washing machines and television sets to brassieres
and blue denim jeans.
</P>
<P>
   I don't recall that John Adams said anything about that type of
observance when he read the Declaration of Independence to the
people gathered in Philadelphia in 1776. He talked about pomp and
parades, picnics and games.
</P>
<P>
   When I place my American flag in its holder on Sunday _ it was
Flag Day, in case you didn't know _ I looked down my street and saw
no flags other than those that represent no country, no thought _
just a pretty design like a pineapple, a sailboat, a doll . . .
</P>
<P>
   So Flag Day is old, forgotten stuff, and the observance of the
Fourth of July centers mainly on giant sales of nothing having to
do with patriotism and everything having to do with the filling of
cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unpatriotic statement when businesses cannot take time
away from those cash registers to observe the most significant of
American holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, half the nation's work force is on the job on the
Fourth of July. Most factories are closed; certainly government
closes down. But not the supermarkets, department and discount
stores and other retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And, like fools, most of the half that isn't working goes to
those stores to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, businesses shut tight on the Fourth and usually
helped sponsor the celebration picnics and fireworks shows for
their employees and families. That spirit somehow gave way to the
craving for money.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, dollar-greedy corporations and merchants are much
like flag burners. They have a constitutional right to be
jackasses.
</P>
<P>
   In my own form of protest, I have avoided shopping at any store
on July 4. I would hope that all of America would boycott
businesses open that day and spend it as it was intended.
</P>
<P>
   The true celebrating of the Fourth takes place in small-town
America where nearly everyone joins in on the observance. In larger
cities, however, it is a different story. Competition is the ruling
factor. If one supermarket opens, than the other feels it needs to
open.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are caught in the middle, faced with irritating their
bosses and perhaps losing their jobs by refusing to work on the
holiday. Union workers probably are in a better position since
holidays and workdays are negotiated, but too many opt for holiday
double time and figuratively trash their flag.
</P>
<P>
   If we're going to be patriotic, or at the very least observant
of what our Founding Fathers intended, then Americans ought to
proclaim their independence from business-as-usual on Independence
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Call the stores that are going to be open and tell them that
unless they begin to free their employees to celebrate the Fourth,
you are going to tear up your credit card, or never patronize them
again.
</P>
<P>
   If you're scheduled to work in a non-essential job, call in sick
or take the day as a vacation day. If you have to go to an open
business, go there as a picketing protester.
</P>
<P>
   American workers should be free to spend the day celebrating
this country with their families. And American shoppers can afford
to take a day off for the same reason.

 &HT;    Plug the leaks and run the country
 &HT;    EDS: A bonus column from Tom Teepen for immediate release
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By TOM TEEPEN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only in obsessive Washington D. C., endlessly stewing in
half-scandals and faux scandals, could the admission by Kenneth
Starr that he and his staff have leaked be heard as some sort of
thunderclap.
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of the country, this is a revelation on the order of
a breathless announcement that the sun comes up in the east. Well,
OF COURSE, the independent counsel and his staff leak. Everybody in
Washington leaks. It is an infantile city and there isn't a Pampers
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the counsel's office have been leaking at
each other. They are in a leaking match. The rest of us are just
trying to stay out of the cross-squirt.
</P>
<P>
   Now the White House is pretending shock, shock at the
confirmation of the obvious. Indignation abounds. Clinton spinners
have gone dervish for TV news programs, performing paroxysms of
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage is phony and calculated. The White House senses a
major opportunity to further discredit Starr, though his own,
previous indiscretions and untoward political blunders already had
gone a long ways toward calling his operation into broad question.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming increasingly difficult to pretend that huge
issues of ethical principle and of legal righteousness are aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has closed down his Little Rock shop, reportedly without
establishing that one or another Clinton nicked the law in the
legalistic comings and goings over a minor land deal about a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel seems still to be investigating
``travelgate'' even though the White House travel staff works for
the president and can be fired for dumb reasons, the case in this
Clinton rookie mistake. The issue, if you can call it one, appears
to be whether Hillary Clinton had a bigger hand in the foul-up than
she has said. If so, will Starr try to turn political
damage-control into perjury?
</P>
<P>
   Starr at last report was still also looking into all those
Republican names that turned up in a White House computer list. But
what on Earth does it matter? No one on the list has ever suffered
for his or her temporary passage on it.
</P>
<P>
   All of which would appear to reduce Starr's four years and $40
million to a question of whether or not Clinton had extramarital
sex and lied about it in a lawsuit that turned out to have no legal
merit and was pushed partly in hopes of setting up just such a
gotcha. (The latest: a book claims Clinton had left the hotel hours
before Paula Jones says he came on to her there, reportedly the
defense's ace in the hole if the case had gone to trial.)
</P>
<P>
   Now the Clintonians want Starr himself investigated by an
independent counsel to decide whether he vented grand jury dope
despite a statutory obligation to keep a lid on it. Please, no.
This cycle of charge and countercharge doesn't need another whack
that will keep it going around and around even longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr investigation has become an endless attempt to get
something, anything, on one or another Clinton. The president in
turn has been trying to de-pants Starr as if he were the designated
nerd of the dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone in Washington remember that we've got a real country
here and somebody damn well ought to be running it?

   BEIJING _ This is the city central to your China trip.
</P>
<P>
   From the chaotic alleys called hutongs to the grace of the
Forbidden City built for the emperor and his entourage, China's
capital can keep you happily occupied for five days. After that, it
gets to be work.
</P>
<P>
   An aimless stroll or float across the lake in Beihai Park will
put you in the company of Chinese relaxing away an afternoon. Or
try hunting down the Niujie Mosque, where tranquil gardens date
back to the 15th Century, and the nearby Fayuansi Buddhist temple
to see an ancient spiritual dimension of modern Chinese life.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations specific to Beijing touring:
</P>
<P>
   Take care if attracted by the colorful, fun-looking pedi-cabs
whose drivers will drive you crazy with their constant pitch to
ride. They're safe enough, but at the end of the trip the peddlers
will find some reason to charge you more than the promised price.
It's unpleasant and worth avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   You will want a day trip to climb the Great Wall and can choose
one of three places to do it. Pass up Badaling if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mutianyu is a site half an hour further from the center of
Beijing, but is much less crowded and more majestic. Even further
from downtown is Simatai, which we find most impressive. Both
Mutianyu and Simatai run cable cars up the steep ridges to the
wall, but Simatai still requires a taxing half-hour climb up stone
stairs from the top of the cable. The wall itself has not been
repaired for the last couple of centuries, so walking the entire
open section is real exercise and not recommended on a wet day. Yet
the isolation of the place, small numbers of tourists, and
unspoiled mountain vistas are magnificent. Plus, the ride out gives
an intriguing glimpse of village and farm life.
</P>
<P>
   Our most important advice is to get a hotel as close to the
center as possible, which means the environs of the Forbidden City
and Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of luxury hotels string out toward the airport in the
northeast, but they are best reserved for business travelers whose
duties take them to the new high-rise office buildings also located
there. Most are a 40-minute to one-hour drive from the center, and
offer little to visit unless the Hard Rock Cafe is your top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Hotel and Palace Hotel are in the lively Wangfujing
shopping district about a 15- to 20-minute walk from the entry of
the Forbidden City. The Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (the chain's only
hotel in the center) is in the same area, and all three are well
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   However, our favorite is the place we're living, the Beijing
Hotel. Although a Chinese government hotel, it used to be the only
place foreigners could stay. It isn't a five-star luxury hotel, but
has nearly all the amenities you could need. It is surrounded by
shops and restaurants and is within two blocks of Tiananmen Square.
The hotel's gift shops are reasonable and have a huge selection,
should you chose not to spend hours digging through Beijing's
eclectic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Its selection of foreign-language television is limited mostly
to CNN, but the view from your balcony will be much more beguiling
than any television program. When making a reservation, have your
travel agent request a room on a high floor ending in the numbers
36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43 or 44, which all face the western hills.
</P>
<P>
   From these rooms, you will directly overlook the red and yellow
pitched roofs of the Forbidden City, and with binoculars can see
details of the morning flag-raising on Tiananmen Square. The scene
is unmatched.

   An aimless stroll or float across the lake in Beihai Park will
put you in the company of Chinese relaxing away an afternoon. Or
try hunting down the Niujie Mosque, where tranquil gardens date
back to the 15th Century, and the nearby Fayuansi Buddhist temple
to see an ancient spiritual dimension of modern Chinese life.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations specific to Beijing touring:
</P>
<P>
   Take care if attracted by the colorful, fun-looking pedi-cabs
whose drivers will drive you crazy with their constant pitch to
ride. They're safe enough, but at the end of the trip the peddlers
will find some reason to charge you more than the promised price.
It's unpleasant and worth avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   You will want a day trip to climb the Great Wall and can choose
one of three places to do it. Pass up Badaling if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mutianyu is a site half an hour further from the center of
Beijing, but is much less crowded and more majestic. Even further
from downtown is Simatai, which we find most impressive. Both
Mutianyu and Simatai run cable cars up the steep ridges to the
wall, but Simatai still requires a taxing half-hour climb up stone
stairs from the top of the cable. The wall itself has not been
repaired for the last couple of centuries, so walking the entire
open section is real exercise and not recommended on a wet day. Yet
the isolation of the place, small numbers of tourists, and
unspoiled mountain vistas are magnificent. Plus, the ride out gives
an intriguing glimpse of village and farm life.
</P>
<P>
   Our most important advice is to get a hotel as close to the
center as possible, which means the environs of the Forbidden City
and Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of luxury hotels string out toward the airport in the
northeast, but they are best reserved for business travelers whose
duties take them to the new high-rise office buildings also located
there. Most are a 40-minute to one-hour drive from the center, and
offer little to visit unless the Hard Rock Cafe is your top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Hotel and Palace Hotel are in the lively Wangfujing
shopping district about a 15- to 20-minute walk from the entry of
the Forbidden City. The Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (the chain's only
hotel in the center) is in the same area, and all three are well
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   However, our favorite is the place we're living, the Beijing
Hotel. Although a Chinese government hotel, it used to be the only
place foreigners could stay. It isn't a five-star luxury hotel, but
has nearly all the amenities you could need. It is surrounded by
shops and restaurants and is within two blocks of Tiananmen Square.
The hotel's gift shops are reasonable and have a huge selection,
should you chose not to spend hours digging through Beijing's
eclectic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Its selection of foreign-language television is limited mostly
to CNN, but the view from your balcony will be much more beguiling
than any television program. When making a reservation, have your
travel agent request a room on a high floor ending in the numbers
36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43 or 44, which all face the western hills.
</P>
<P>
   From these rooms, you will directly overlook the red and yellow
pitched roofs of the Forbidden City, and with binoculars can see
details of the morning flag-raising on Tiananmen Square. The scene
is unmatched.

<P>
   BEIJING _ If you know China, don't bother reading this. You are
already convinced that from megalopolis to mist-shrouded
mountaintop, China is an engaging place.
</P>
<P>
   This is written for the couple of hundred million other
Americans who may love to knock about in bizarre places but haven't
yet made it to the Middle Kingdom. You'll find that China offers
spectacular travel _ riveting vistas, exotic cultures embracing
thousands of years and enticing food on almost every corner of
every city.
</P>
<P>
   If the news coverage surrounding President Clinton's trip to
China June 25-July 3 intrigues you _ whether it's an aged peasant's
creased smile or the serenity of a Guilin lagoon that sinks the
hook in your wanderlust _ make a plan and go for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months we've been living and working in China,
we've managed a sampling of some not-to-miss places. China is more
tourist-friendly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But you should also recognize that this still isn't a country
for the haphazard traveler _ except one who is very experienced,
very patient, or well-versed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist infrastructure is still building, which means the
Chinese working the taxis, trains and hotels often aren't equipped
to meet the needs of the traveler without a group or a guide.
</P>
<P>
   You will be hard-pressed to find an English speaker even at a
place as cosmopolitan as the Beijing train station. (Our lessons in
Mandarin proved critical the first night we arrived in Beijing. Our
train was two hours late, and the travel agent who was supposed to
meet us at the train station had deserted, leaving us to track down
luggage in an unmarked back room, then negotiate a little-used
customs office and find a midnight taxi at a remote corner of the
station.)
</P>
<P>
   And few cities outside Beijing and Shanghai bother to
transliterate street signs into pinyin, the Latin equivalent of
Chinese characters that enables westerners to follow a map.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even the most inexperienced tourist can select from
the huge palette of sites available in China and create a wonderful
vacation. It requires some groundwork, but then so does most
foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
   In our wanderings here, we've come up with a few tips that may
help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most relaxing aspects of touring China _ and one of
the most essential _ is reading the guidebooks. Compared to the
travel books on many parts of the world, those about China are
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   These are good reads even if you're not planning a trip, but
just interested in the world's most populous nation with one of the
world's oldest cultures.
</P>
<P>
   We have four recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   -- The newly updated ``Fodor's China'' may be the best
all-around book for an American tourist, giving evocative history
and cultural notes along with hotel and restaurant listings that
you can count on to meet U.S. comfort standards.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Lonely Planet'' includes lower-budget listings and
information that may appeal more to the younger traveler.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Rough Guide'' presents a breezier British style, and in
addition to the typical sites and accommodations, it covers places
slightly off the well-trod western tourist track. It also has a
good section on Chinese phrases.
</P>
<P>
   -- The ``Blue Guide'' is useful for its typically exhaustive
descriptions of every tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever book you choose, you can believe their descriptions
that defy the stories travelers brought home just 10 or 15 years
ago about austere Chinese hotels and lousy restaurants. That isn't
true today.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a package tour or travelling independently may be a
harder decision in China than elsewhere. You will almost certainly
run into glitches if you go it alone. The question is how easily
you can adjust to complications.
</P>
<P>
   Your American travel agent can make bookings if you opt out of a
group trip, but normally cannot hand over to you in advance the
tickets for internal China transportation. Foreign travel agencies
must rely on the government's China International Travel Services
(CITS), which tries hard but may fall a dab short of success.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before flight time, we have been handed tickets with the
wrong return flight. We've also encountered other travelers who
either got incorrect tickets or were missing tickets when CITS
delivered them to the hotel. One obstacle is that CITS insists on
parcelling out tickets as you travel through your itinerary, rather
than issue a full set when you arrive. That leaves scant time for
fixing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is arranging transportation as you go along.
It sounds daunting, but is remarkably easy. Travel agencies have
offices in most major hotels and can write air and train tickets on
the spot, though making such late reservations carries a small
chance of your chosen flight being fully booked. One pitfall: you
will probably find the departure city and the destination written
in Chinese characters. To get around this, ask the travel agent to
give you a computer printout of the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a guide to walk you through major airports, since
signs and announcements are in both Chinese and English. Flight
attendants also use both languages, but communication much beyond
``coffee'' or ``beer'' might strain the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is a confidence-building experience. Many airlines
use Boeing jets on internal routes, and all follow international
standards _ no goats on board or passengers sitting on suitcases in
the aisles, as happens in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is whether you can handle a flight that
gets diverted. We ran into a Canadian couple who related the
harrowing experience of making an unscheduled landing at a small
regional airport near Chongqing due to weather. No one spoke
English, and local Chinese verged on a brawl because even they
could get no information for hours on when flights might resume.
</P>
<P>
   But these chance complications are minimal and normally can be
overcome with patience. Many travelers _ us among them _ much
prefer such risks to the homogenization of group travel. We would
rather spend time harassing a CITS agent than waiting for 200
people to get on and off the buses. Travelers choose their own
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're travelling outside a tour group, you may
well find it worth the cost to stay at an internationally
recognized hotel. The guidebooks list plenty, and your travel agent
can add hundreds more now that good hotels are proliferating across
China. Outside Beijing and Shanghai, a nice room costs about $120 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   One easy pick is the Holiday Inn, which is not the priciest and
offers fully two dozen hotels in China. These are true havens when
you come back exhausted from crowded, dusty streets, having seen
one fried chicken foot too many, and find yourself longing for a
chef's salad in front of an in-house movie in English. Yet the Inns
carry a local flavor, including their Chinese restaurants that are
as savory as those on the street and have more reliable sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn is so attuned to western needs that it is the
only hotel we've seen with conspicuous signs in every room warning
not to drink the tap water. Our advice: never drink tap water
anywhere, unless your hotel tells you water has been safely
purified in its own plant.
</P>
<P>
   A western hotel also can help arrange a city or museum tour,
whether they have such excursions scheduled or must ring an agent
to find you a personal guide. For the latter you may have to pout a
bit, but there usually is an English-speaking concierge who can be
convinced to help.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that staff are always willing to assist you
getting around their city. They gladly give directions. More
importantly, they will write in Chinese the address you are
seeking, so you can simply hand the paper to the taxi driver _ who
likely won't speak English _ or to a passer-by if you're lost on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   As for restaurants, 100 flowers are blooming. They're
everywhere. And we have yet to stumble across a truly bad one. Ten
years ago, tourists complained that they had to stop in Hong Kong
or San Francisco to eat good Chinese food. Not so today.
</P>
<P>
   You do, however, want to take care in ordering. Chinese cuisine
in China isn't necessarily the same as what appears on the table in
Austin, West Palm Beach, or Atlanta. (EDITORS: YOU MIGHT SUBSTITUTE
THE NAME OF YOUR CITY.) At one of our favorite places in Beijing,
the waitress jokes about bringing us snake _ and she wouldn't have
to go far because they're sitting in the window tank next to the
eels.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you read Chinese, you ought to ask if a restaurant has an
English-language menu before you sit down to dine. What you want is
a ``ying-wen de cai dan'' (pronounced ``ying wen de tsai dan'').
Otherwise you may end up with pig ears or the ubiquitous chicken
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood restaurants are usually much better, as well as
much cheaper than most hotel eateries with dumbed-down cuisines. We
usually dine out for less than $10 for two of us.
</P>
<P>
   One other tip on water: most Chinese will use a kleenex to wipe
off the little plates, rice bowls, glasses and even chopsticks set
out on restaurant tables, to sop up any rogue drops of tap water
left from washing. We do, too.
</P>
<P>
   We also try to bring along an extra paper napkin or tissue,
since the only napkins supplied at most restaurants are single-ply
paper sheets measuring about four inches square.
</P>
<P>
   We also strongly advise that you consider at least one leg of
travel by boat or train. Either will give you a close-up view of
the countryside where two-thirds of China's 1.2 billion people
live.
</P>
<P>
   Chugging through rice paddies by rail you sense the solidity and
longevity of China, watching scenes impossible to imagine from the
cityscapes of Beijing or Shanghai or Xian. Straw-hatted peasants
squat in water-logged fields or urge a water buffalo to lumber
home. How different could it have looked 1,000 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The best tourist cruise is down the Yangtze River, passing the
mystical sheer cliffs of the Three Gorges and the terraced farm
lands that generations of Chinese painstakingly built up the
mountainsides. A new dam will alter the character of this famous
landscape after the year 2003, raising the river the height of a
60-story building. The beauty will not be fully erased, but the
drama will be gone. Go soon.

new diabetes cases in recent years, and if the rest of the country
is following suit, the result could be a reversal of a 30-year
decline in heart disease deaths, a researcher said. By DON FINLEY.

   BOMB-HUNTER (San Francisco) _ A computerized canine is
``sniffing'' for explosives inside luggage at San Francisco
International Airport. The ``explosive trace detector'' doesn't
look like the robotic pooches of science-fiction films. By KEAY
DAVIDSON.

   SNOW-PARKS (San Francisco) _ Many areas of the high country are
accessible only by skis, snowshoes or snowmobile. Some campgrounds
remain snowbound. From Crater Lake, Ore., to Mammoth Mountain, the
story's the same _ warm skies over snow, snow, snow. El Nino is to
blame, of course. By ERIC BRAZIL.

   GAY-PARTNERS (San Francisco) _ All rental car agencies, health

   TRAVEL-BRYSON (San Francisco) _ ``A Walk in the Woods,'' a book
by travel writer Bill Bryson, is about his attempt to walk the
Appalachian Trail, which runs 2,100 miles from Georgia to Maine.
Part of book's charm comes from the fact that Bryson was
breathtakingly ill-suited to the task. By JOHN FLINN.

   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The weather experts say the El

fish. The continuing saga of the biggest ocean temperature tantrum
in history has created a fishing paradise. By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-JORDAN (Albany, N.Y.) _ There is no glory in success if it
comes without the risk of failure. Michael Jordan failed on Friday,
failed to deliver the sort of miracle that he and all earthlings
have come to expect, and this is the first four-letter word that
came to his mind: Cute. By STEVE CAMPBELL.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)

<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ School choice is scary stuff.
Critics say it would destroy the public school system, and they're
probably right. But unless politicians give public schools the
power to expel troublemakers, school choice will become a more
attractive proposition to more people. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ What is happening now in more
and more news media, unnamed sources are taking an ever larger role
in articles that should not require them. Editors should bear down
hard on limiting unnamed sources and on insisting that their
reporters strive to get on-the-record information. By HARRY
ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   STAR-TREK (San Francisco) _ ``Star Trek'' is now shown in more
than 100 countries, finding a far wider audience than the original
cultish Trekkers (don't call them Trekkies) of old-time fandom.
Travel writer Jeff Greenwald made it his mission to find out why.
By SAM HURWITT.

 By JUDITH ANDERSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Santa Fe, the city of Holy Faith, this year celebrates the 400th
anniversary of Spanish settlement in New Mexico. But Santa Fe was
already old when the Spaniards arrived, and central to nearly
100,000 native people living in 70 nearby adobe pueblos.
 &HT;    This summer, the activities of the Hispanic Cuatro Centenario
blend with the calendar of Native American feast days and the flux
of all-American tourism that characterizes the City Different.
 &HT;    The streets may be crammed with trendy boutiques in faux-pueblo
architecture, but there is usually a balancing glimpse of history
nearby or a salutary view of the surrounding Jemez or Sangre de
Cristo mountains. The clear air at 7,000 feet is permeated with
sage and pinon.
 &HT;    But what really sets this city apart, besides its tripartite
Hispanic-Indian-Anglo world view, is art. All the arts.
 &HT;    Santa Fe isn't a big town _ just 67,000 residents _ yet with the
help of some 1.4 million tourists a year it supports 7 art museums,
about 250 galleries, an eight-week opera season and 10 performance
stages.
 &HT;    Within a single square mile, centered on downtown and Canyon
Road, more than a million pieces of art are concentrated, and that
doesn't include 400 years of sacred images in the churches and
missions.
 &HT;    Summer is high season, marked by abundant music, dance and
theater, by art festivals, wine festivals, mountain-men festivals,
by dozens of feast days in the pueblos, and by the annual markets
in the Plaza.
 &HT;    At Spanish Market, July 25 and 26, more than 100 vendors sell
santos and retablos, weavings and carvings _ the folk art of their
ancestors.
 &HT;    Indian Market, Aug. 22 and 23, a juried competition of more than
500 artists and craftspersons, is one of Santa Fe's most famous
events.
 &HT;    It has often been noted that in a city so steeped in history and
culture, what one most indelibly remembers is the shopping.
Certainly there are stupefying opportunities for buying, in shops
and souvenir stands and directly from the artist who made the
piece.
 &HT;    And yet, holding its own under that commercial veneer, the core
of Santa Fe is still esthetic.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The 20th annual Santa Fe Arts and Crafts Festival will fill the
Plaza with more than 200 vendors on June 20 and 21. Open 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. each day. Call (505) 988-7621.
 &HT;    On June 23 and 24, San Juan Pueblo, site of the first capital of
New Mexico in 1598, will celebrate the feast of St. John the
Baptist. Foot races and Comanche and Buffalo dances will last from
late morning to midafternoon. About 45 minutes north of town off
Route 68; (505) 852-4400. Check at the Governor's office at the
pueblo to see if photography is permitted.
 &HT;    When the Santa Fe Opera opens its 1998 season on July 3,

a roof over all the seats, but it will keep its open-air
atmosphere.
 &HT;    ``Madame Butterfly,'' which opened the first season in 1957,
will inaugurate the renovated house, then alternate with Mozart's
``Magic Flute'' and three other operas. Tickets for the grand
opening are $50 to $200; for the rest of the season, $20 to $118.

 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The heart of Santa Fe is the Plaza, built in 1610 by Don Pedro
de Peralta. One side is formed by the Palace of the Governors, 105
West Palace Avenue. Built in 1610, it is the oldest public building
in the United States.
 &HT;    For decades, the portal, or front porch, has been reserved for
the Indians of New Mexico, who set out blankets and sell their
wares (pottery, jewelry and golf ball markers are in this year).
 &HT;    The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, 217 Johnson St., (505) 995-0785,
boasts a self-consciously hip gift shop and about 100 works by the
artist, who moved to New Mexico permanently in the 1940's. Open 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday, until 8 on Friday.
Admission: $5 for one day, $10 for four-day pass to all branches of
the Museum of New Mexico. Free Friday 5 to 8.

inauguration of the much-anticipated Neutrogena Wing of textiles
and folk art, with displays from a 3,000-piece collection ranging
from Peruvian leather to Indonesian silks.
 &HT;    One of the most delightfully unexpected museums anywhere, it has
a vast and exuberant collection, ingeniously displayed. Part of the
museum plaza at 706 Camino Lejo, (505) 827-6350. Open 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission: $5 or Museum of New Mexico

of contemporary Native American art. A sculpture garden and
welcoming circle (a meditation chamber with piped-in music) invite
contemplation. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission: $4.
 &HT;    Canyon Road is two winding miles of galleries, cafes and private
homes in lovely adobes and haciendas. If you walk up it early, you
can catch the opening of most galleries, around 10 a.m., on your
way down. Or drive to a parking lot near the top of the road, just
past Camino del Monte Sol.
 &HT;    In the dust at the roadside beyond the opera house, Trader
Jack's Flea Market is an event every Friday, Saturday and Sunday
from spring through fall. Squash-blossom necklaces may be sold
right next to pickled pig's feet.
 &HT;    It's good entertainment, especially combined with lunch at the
Tesuque Village Market, (505) 988-8848, a few miles up the road.
The flea market usually runs 9 a.m. to dusk. Turn left off Highway
84 just past the opera house.
 &HT;    One way to learn about the regional cuisine _ then eat it _ is
to take a three-hour class ($35 to $57) at the Santa Fe School of
Cooking, 116 West San Francisco Street, on the upper level of the
Plaza Mercado, (505) 983-4511.
 &HT;    At a recent class on Mexican cuisine, Maurice Zeck, executive
chef at La Fonda Hotel, whipped up four courses including pork loin
with peanut mole.
 &HT;    On a mountain less than four miles north of town, Ten Thousand
Waves offers relaxation according to ancient Japanese tradition.
Spa treatments range from a half-hour massage ($35) to a Half-Day
Indulgence: an hour in a private hot tub, an herbal wrap, 90-minute
massage, facial, and a salt-glow treatment _ five hours for $296.
Open from 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 a.m. other days; closes at
midnight Friday and Saturday, 10:30 p.m. otherwise. Appointments
and directions: (505) 982-9304.

 &HT;    The Grant Corner Inn Bed and Breakfast, 122 Grant Ave., (505)

bath. Doubles, $95 to $155. Children over 8 are welcome.
 &HT;    Budget: Bare-bones bed and breakfast accommodations are

the Ancient Ones with its massive hand-carved doors and sculptured
stairways, but the 59 rooms, all with fireplaces and four-poster
beds, acknowledge every modern creature comfort. Doubles, $239 to
$419.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    For visitors who are out late, casual Il Vicino, off the Plaza
at 321 West San Francisco St., (505) 986-8700, offers a selection
of crispy individual pizzas ($4.75 to about $7) and select ales,

 &HT;    In the charming dining room of the Inn of the Anasazi, 113

apple and spinach and served with chili-peach coulis. A
three-course dinner for two, with wine, runs about $90. Dinner

two with wine starts at about $70. Lunch and dinner daily.
 &HT;    The six romantic dining rooms at La Tertulia, 416 Agua Fria,
(505) 988-2769, graced by Colonial art, once were part of the
Dominican convent at the Guadalupe Mission. A steak dinner for two,
either straight up or smothered in green chilies, accompanied by
the house sangria, costs around $55. Open for lunch and dinner
every day but Monday.

burrito: bacon and potatoes rolled in a tortilla with chili and
cheese ($5.50). Lunch specialties such as blue corn enchiladas
($5.75) are equally popular today. No alcohol. Open 7 a.m. to 2

 By JUDITH ANDERSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Santa Fe, the city of Holy Faith, this year celebrates the 400th
anniversary of Spanish settlement in New Mexico. But Santa Fe was
already old when the Spaniards arrived, and central to nearly
100,000 native people living in 70 nearby adobe pueblos.
 &HT;    This summer, the activities of the Hispanic Cuatro Centenario
blend with the calendar of Native American feast days and the flux
of all-American tourism that characterizes the City Different.
 &HT;    The streets may be crammed with trendy boutiques in faux-pueblo
architecture, but there is usually a balancing glimpse of history
nearby or a salutary view of the surrounding Jemez or Sangre de
Cristo mountains. The clear air at 7,000 feet is permeated with
sage and pinon.
 &HT;    But what really sets this city apart, besides its tripartite
Hispanic-Indian-Anglo world view, is art. All the arts.
 &HT;    Santa Fe isn't a big town _ just 67,000 residents _ yet with the
help of some 1.4 million tourists a year it supports 7 art museums,
about 250 galleries, an eight-week opera season and 10 performance
stages.
 &HT;    Within a single square mile, centered on downtown and Canyon
Road, more than a million pieces of art are concentrated, and that
doesn't include 400 years of sacred images in the churches and
missions.
 &HT;    Summer is high season, marked by abundant music, dance and
theater, by art festivals, wine festivals, mountain-men festivals,
by dozens of feast days in the pueblos, and by the annual markets
in the Plaza.
 &HT;    At Spanish Market, July 25 and 26, more than 100 vendors sell
santos and retablos, weavings and carvings _ the folk art of their
ancestors.
 &HT;    Indian Market, Aug. 22 and 23, a juried competition of more than
500 artists and craftspersons, is one of Santa Fe's most famous
events.
 &HT;    It has often been noted that in a city so steeped in history and
culture, what one most indelibly remembers is the shopping.
Certainly there are stupefying opportunities for buying, in shops
and souvenir stands and directly from the artist who made the
piece.
 &HT;    And yet, holding its own under that commercial veneer, the core
of Santa Fe is still esthetic.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The 20th annual Santa Fe Arts and Crafts Festival will fill the
Plaza with more than 200 vendors on June 20 and 21. Open 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. each day. Call (505) 988-7621.

pueblo to see if photography is permitted.
 &HT;    When the Santa Fe Opera opens its 1998 season on July 3,

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The Montana Daylight excursion train rambles across the
mountainous portion of Montana and upper Idaho, giving passengers
what may be their only look at the present-day American West.
 &HT;    What they see is rarely observed from the interstate: deep
gorges where autos can't go, punctuated with scenic tunnels dug by
railroad workers before the turn of the century; children returning
from school on horses waving at the train _ even some real cowboys;
cattle grazing lazily on ranges; and a network of rivers, fed by
the Bitterroots, Cabinets and other nearby mountain ranges, many of
which capped by snow, even in midsummer.
 &HT;    In fact, the view from the Montana Daylight is not that
different from printed scenes of the old American West.
 &HT;    Passengers on this rail jaunt see little-known towns defined by
white churches on one end and saloons on the other _ like bookends.
A feed store might be stuck in the middle, where ranchers sit on
rockers and debate the issues of the day.
 &HT;    This part of the country is so remote that during our train ride
a mechanic, totally unaware of the our prying eyes, tried to combat
the midday heat by working in the nude in his garage, which is
alongside the train's tracks. We and our fellow passengers laughed
and cheered as we rolled by.
 &HT;    Indeed, the Montana Daylight is touted as the only overnight
excursion train that shows off the American West, the rugged
country where Lewis and Clark _ and later the Nez Perce and Teddy
Roosevelt _ came through.
 OLD-TIME JOURNEYS  
 &HT;    Our 455-mile journey on the Daylight began at the historic depot
in Livingston, Mont., with an overnight in Missoula, and ended in
Sandpoint, Idaho, on the edge of breathtaking Lake Pend Oreille.
The ride was part of a six-day tour that took us from Salt Lake
City to Spokane.
 &HT;    Aboard the Montana Daylight, a railfan can relive many an
old-time rail journey across America. Diesel engines pull three to
five coaches, much like Santa Fe's El Capitan and the Chiefs; dome
cars like those that once served passengers on the North Coast
Limited and Great Northern's Empire Builder; a rear-end observation
car like the one from the Chesapeake &AMP; Ohio; a rebuilt diner car
from the Nickel Plate Railroad; and private cars from the Chicago &AMP;
Northwestern, outfitted for sleeping and separate dining for
high-paying passengers.
 &HT;    There are three classes of service. Most passengers choose the
``Explore'' class, which features comfortable coaches, continental
breakfasts and box lunches. Those in the ``Big Sky'' class ride in
dome cars and have sit-down lunches in the dining car.
 &HT;    A handful of ``Gold Nugget''-class passengers ride like rail
barons of old, in their wood-paneled private cars with gourmet
meals prepared in separate galleys. At night, Gold Nuggets have
their own elegant sleeping compartments aboard the train.
 &HT;    On the first day, the train crosses the Bozeman Pass (on the
return route of Lewis and Clark), enters the Missouri River
headwaters (the confluence of the Gallatin, the Jefferson and the
Madison rivers) and crosses the Continental Divide at 5,500 feet
through the Mullan Tunnel. This is tunnel-and-trestle railroading,
with steep grades and sharp curves _ great for photography buffs
riding in the open vestibules.
 &HT;    While on the observation deck, we overheard other passengers'
conversations, which were filled with typical railfan questions:
What are the origin of the cars? Why don't most trains go
``clickety-clack'' anymore?
 &HT;    The on-board narrator graciously answered peoples' queries and
talked about the gorges and wildlife we had sighted.
 CAROUSEL AT TWILIGHT  
 &HT;    We arrived in Missoula for our overnight hotel stay just as the
sun was setting and the town's famous carousel was about to close.
It's a new, full-size carousel, which was created by local
volunteers, and we had looked forward to taking a spin on it all
day.
 &HT;    About 30 of us trouped to the ride, explaining our plight _ and
stretching the truth just a bit: We had come all the way from
places like Chicago and Texas just to ride their famous
merry-go-round.
 &HT;    Fortunately, the understanding Missoulans kept it open a little
longer and charged us all the senior-discounted rate of 50 cents a
ride.
 &HT;    For the next half-hour we whirled around like kids on the 38
hand-painted horses, amid bright, blinking lights and loud
pipe-organ tunes.
 &HT;    The next day the Montana Daylight meandered along the Flathead
and Clark Fork rivers, in the rolling valley between the Cabinets
and Bitterroots, leaving the original Lewis and Clark route far to
the south.
 &HT;    Our last night was in Sandpoint, Idaho, and then we traveled by
motorcoach to Spokane, Wash.
 PACKAGED TRIPS  
 &HT;    The two-day train ride is just one part of this Montana Rockies
Rail Tour.
 &HT;    The most popular package among mature travelers begins in Salt
Lake City and includes the Tetons, Yellowstone National Park and _
new this year _ an additional few days in Glacier National Park.
 &HT;    The westbound trip begins every Thursday in Salt Lake City, so
tour-goers can visit Mormon Square and other sites by daylight and
enjoy the free Thursday-evening rehearsals of the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir.
 &HT;    The next two days are spent in a motorcoach, traveling to
Jackson Hole, Wyo., through the Tetons. Tour-goers then spend a
night in Yellowstone Park.
 &HT;    We visited the park's steamy geyser basins and watched the
beautiful wildlife _ bison, elk, moose and mule deer _ leaving the
park at Mammoth Hot Springs.
 &HT;    Those who can't handle Yellowstone's 8,500 altitude or who
choose not to walk the long, wooden pathways to the geysers or take
the mile-long walk down Mammoth's steep terraces are given other
options.
 &HT;    The itinerary is reversed for eastbound tour-goers.
 &HT;    The cost ranges from $799 in Explorer class (double occupancy)
to $1,399 in Gold Nugget. A four-day, train-only tour from Spokane
to Livingston and back costs $629 to $1,799 a person, and a two-day
sampler rail tour from Livingston to Sandpoint is $399 to $999.
 &HT;    A great add-on is the four-day extension to Glacier National
Park for an additional $540 a person.
 &HT;    This year, journeys of the Montana Daylight and its accompanying
tours run from July 9 to the end of August. Get more information

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's full steam ahead in the cruise business. While some
industry pundits point to the film ``Titanic'' as an ironic booster
of sales, that's open to debate.
 &HT;    But icebergs or not, the fact is that travel agents and
cruise-only agents report record bookings, sold-out sailings and
inquiries many months in advance of embarkation.
 &HT;    ``In Europe, it's boom, boom, boom,'' says Elaine Lerner.
 &HT;    Lerner, president of National Discount Cruise Co./American
Express (1409 N. Cedar Crest Blvd., Allentown, Pa. 18104;
800-788-8108), says ``This summer, it's been difficult to get to
Europe. Hot new ships like Princess' 'Grand Princess,' Holland
America's 'Rotterdam VI' and Royal Caribbean's 'Splendor of the
seas' are sold out.''
 &HT;    That's in keeping with a classic piece of cruise wisdom: New
sells. In this business, any vessel over 18 months is considered
old. And there exists a band of well-heeled salts who will only
sail on new vessels, in some cases regardless of itinerary.
 &HT;    For those devotees, a new ship and all its marvels are the
destination.
 &HT;    Even so, there may still be some good deals for Europe in
shoulder season, which is now longer than ever.
 &HT;    In the past, the major cruise lines would move their ships
across from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean sometime in October.
 &HT;    ``This year, for the first time, we're seeing more ships in the
Mediterranean from October to December,'' says Don Lansky, vice
president of public relations for The Cruise Line (150 NW 168th
St., North Miami Beach, Fla. 33169; 800-777-0707). ``That's the
latest we've ever seen it.''
 &HT;    But while Europe has been hot, Alaska is not _ or not as hot,
anyway, according to some agents. Two-for-one deals on Alaska
sailings may not be quite as prolific as they were last summer, but
they're still around.
 &HT;    ``Alaska has been soft,'' Lerner concedes. ``There are just too
many ships up there. Next summer, there may be fewer.''
 &HT;    For those travelers looking toward the Caribbean next winter,
it's already shaping up as a boom season.
 &HT;    ``There are strong bookings and a lot of the new ships will be
there,'' Lerner says.
 &HT;    And the Caribbean season is growing as well, according to
Lansky, who adds that ``fall has traditionally been off-season, but
a lot of ships are pretty packed this year.''
 &HT;    Other destinations in South America and Asia are attracting
cruise-goers who may have done the Alaska, the Caribbean and
Europe.
 &HT;    ``I'm selling more cruises to the Orient than ever before,''
says Linda Schuller, president of Travel in Style (160 S.
Livingston Ave., Livingston, N.J. 07039; 800-255-2999).
 &HT;    Schuller, who works with such upscale cruise lines as Crystal,
Seabourn and Silversea, claims that business is brisk ``because my
clients really want to visit a destination like Vietnam but they
don't necessarily want to stay in the country. The infrastructure
isn't there yet for deluxe clients.''
 &HT;    Deluxe or not, the perennial question for consumers looking to
save money on a cruise is when to book. No one pays sticker price
for a cruise, but what a traveler ends up paying can vary
considerably depending on when they book. Even three or four months
out it can still be difficult to get a particular type of cabin.
 &HT;    ``My best clients are booking at least six to eight months
before a sailing right now,'' Schuller explains. ``The cruise lines
all offer early-booking discounts. I can't think of one cruise line
that doesn't do it. Everybody had a deal, some with discounts as
high as 30 percent.''
 &HT;    These discounts vary according to destination, cruise line, time
of sailing and cabin category.
 &HT;    Elaine Lerner voices an oft-heard equation when she says,
''There's less discounting in Europe. And on every sailing in every
destination, it's the higher-priced cabins that go fast and
first.''
 &HT;    On the West Coast, Anne Halsey-Smith, president of Halsey Tours
and Cruises (P.O. Box 2650, La Jolla, Calif. 92037; 800-459-3395),
agrees, saying ``I work harder than I did 10 years ago. My clients
are demanding and know more than ever before. If they want a
veranda and I can't get one, I can't change their mind. If it's the
same itinerary but a different ship, they're not interested.
They're booking a year to six months out at a minimum. If they're
looking for suites or hoping to sail at Christmas or New Year's,
they're booking at least one year in advance.''
 &HT;    As for the last-minute cruise market, things have changed there
too.
 &HT;    Last-minute in the cruise business has traditionally meant 30
days from sailing. But now, last-minute can mean getting space on a
cruise that sails two or even three months later.
 &HT;    Lansky admits that ``last-minute has dried up,'' with the
exception of Alaska.
 &HT;    But Schuller of Travel in Style is more optimistic, adding
``there are always cancellations. You can do three to four weeks
out occasionally. That's the minimum, especially if you need a visa
or need to make other arrangements. And there's always something in
the Caribbean.''
 &HT;    As Elaine Lerner says, ``There is a cruise for every taste and
every pocket. But they've got to invent a few more destinations.''

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's full steam ahead in the cruise business. While some
industry pundits point to the film ``Titanic'' as an ironic booster
of sales, that's open to debate.
 &HT;    But icebergs or not, the fact is that travel agents and
cruise-only agents report record bookings, sold-out sailings and
inquiries many months in advance of embarkation.
 &HT;    ``In Europe, it's boom, boom, boom,'' says Elaine Lerner.
 &HT;    Lerner, president of National Discount Cruise Co./American
Express (1409 N. Cedar Crest Blvd., Allentown, Pa. 18104;
800-788-8108), says ``This summer, it's been difficult to get to
Europe. Hot new ships like Princess' 'Grand Princess,' Holland
America's 'Rotterdam VI' and Royal Caribbean's 'Splendor of the
seas' are sold out.''
 &HT;    That's in keeping with a classic piece of cruise wisdom: New
sells. In this business, any vessel over 18 months is considered
old. And there exists a band of well-heeled salts who will only
sail on new vessels, in some cases regardless of itinerary.
 &HT;    For those devotees, a new ship and all its marvels are the
destination.
 &HT;    Even so, there may still be some good deals for Europe in
shoulder season, which is now longer than ever.
 &HT;    In the past, the major cruise lines would move their ships
across from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean sometime in October.
 &HT;    ``This year, for the first time, we're seeing more ships in the
Mediterranean from October to December,'' says Don Lansky, vice
president of public relations for The Cruise Line (150 NW 168th
St., North Miami Beach, Fla. 33169; 800-777-0707). ``That's the
latest we've ever seen it.''
 &HT;    But while Europe has been hot, Alaska is not _ or not as hot,
anyway, according to some agents. Two-for-one deals on Alaska
sailings may not be quite as prolific as they were last summer, but
they're still around.
 &HT;    ``Alaska has been soft,'' Lerner concedes. ``There are just too
many ships up there. Next summer, there may be fewer.''
 &HT;    For those travelers looking toward the Caribbean next winter,
it's already shaping up as a boom season.
 &HT;    ``There are strong bookings and a lot of the new ships will be
there,'' Lerner says.
 &HT;    And the Caribbean season is growing as well, according to
Lansky, who adds that ``fall has traditionally been off-season, but
a lot of ships are pretty packed this year.''
 &HT;    Other destinations in South America and Asia are attracting
cruise-goers who may have done the Alaska, the Caribbean and
Europe.
 &HT;    ``I'm selling more cruises to the Orient than ever before,''
says Linda Schuller, president of Travel in Style (160 S.
Livingston Ave., Livingston, N.J. 07039; 800-255-2999).
 &HT;    Schuller, who works with such upscale cruise lines as Crystal,
Seabourn and Silversea, claims that business is brisk ``because my
clients really want to visit a destination like Vietnam but they
don't necessarily want to stay in the country. The infrastructure
isn't there yet for deluxe clients.''
 &HT;    Deluxe or not, the perennial question for consumers looking to
save money on a cruise is when to book. No one pays sticker price
for a cruise, but what a traveler ends up paying can vary
considerably depending on when they book. Even three or four months
out it can still be difficult to get a particular type of cabin.
 &HT;    ``My best clients are booking at least six to eight months
before a sailing right now,'' Schuller explains. ``The cruise lines
all offer early-booking discounts. I can't think of one cruise line
that doesn't do it. Everybody had a deal, some with discounts as
high as 30 percent.''
 &HT;    These discounts vary according to destination, cruise line, time
of sailing and cabin category.
 &HT;    Elaine Lerner voices an oft-heard equation when she says,
''There's less discounting in Europe. And on every sailing in every
destination, it's the higher-priced cabins that go fast and
first.''
 &HT;    On the West Coast, Anne Halsey-Smith, president of Halsey Tours
and Cruises (P.O. Box 2650, La Jolla, Calif. 92037; 800-459-3395),
agrees, saying ``I work harder than I did 10 years ago. My clients
are demanding and know more than ever before. If they want a
veranda and I can't get one, I can't change their mind. If it's the
same itinerary but a different ship, they're not interested.
They're booking a year to six months out at a minimum. If they're
looking for suites or hoping to sail at Christmas or New Year's,
they're booking at least one year in advance.''
 &HT;    As for the last-minute cruise market, things have changed there
too.
 &HT;    Last-minute in the cruise business has traditionally meant 30
days from sailing. But now, last-minute can mean getting space on a
cruise that sails two or even three months later.
 &HT;    Lansky admits that ``last-minute has dried up,'' with the
exception of Alaska.
 &HT;    But Schuller of Travel in Style is more optimistic, adding
``there are always cancellations. You can do three to four weeks
out occasionally. That's the minimum, especially if you need a visa
or need to make other arrangements. And there's always something in
the Caribbean.''
 &HT;    As Elaine Lerner says, ``There is a cruise for every taste and
every pocket. But they've got to invent a few more destinations.''

   HONG KONG, China _ The company that has called itself the ``900
pound gorilla'' of American electric utilities is finding Asia a
cruel and trackless jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thorns in the form of generator glitches continue to torment the
reliability of Southern Co.'s giant Shajiao C power plant here in
China's booming southern industrial strip.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere throughout the continent, nettles from the Asian
financial crisis have stung the prospects of four of the five
largest future power projects that Southern took on when it bought
control of its Asian subsidiary two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been out here in times of turmoil, and if you're
sitting back in the United States, you would probably look out here
and say, `Asia is not the place where you would like to be,''' said
F.D. ``Rick'' Kuester, who was sent out from Mississippi Power to
become a top executive in Southern's Hong Kong-based Asian
subsidiary, Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA).
</P>
<P>
   Yet dreams about electrifying the Orient still drum loud in
Southern's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the per-capita consumption of electricity
compared to anywhere else in the world,'' Kuester said, ``you can
see tremendous opportunities for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern's fire-breathing optimism about Asia is
not without reason.
</P>
<P>
   Its shareholders have just tasted their first Asian profits,
less than two years after Southern invested $2.1 billion to buy
into a Hong Kong billionaire's Asian power enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The initial payback on one of the biggest investments in
Southern's 75-year history was something short of gargantuan. An
earnings report for January through March showed Southern collected
$15 million in Asian profits, or about one-twentieth of Southern's
worldwide earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Southern says this is a felicitous omen because its
Asian venture wasn't expected to turn profitable until the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the happiest tidings have come from the Philippines.
CEPA's mid-sized Philippines plant, the 735 megawatt coal-fired
Pagbilao Power Station, has been churning out virtually all of the
Asian profits that Southern has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Shajiao C plant in China that is still hampered by
startup glitches, the Philippines' Pagbilao plant ran smoothly
enough to generate 100 percent of its contracted electrical
generating capacity from January through March.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern's much bigger 1,200 megawatt Sual coal-fired power
station in the Philippines, now under construction, is on schedule
and nearing completion on Luzon Island. Its first unit will enter
commercial operation in June 1999, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, the most painful aspect of its journey to Asia has
been its inability to expand beyond the footprint of power plant
investments that it bought from Hong Kong entrepreneur Gordon Wu in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Especially frustrating has been China, which Southern viewed as
its most promising patch for building new power plants because of
the country's explosive growth and its 1.2 billion potential
electricity-users.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong office now acknowledges that the
five-year-old joint venture it inherited from Wu to build a
coal-fired plant in China's Jiangsu Province ``has been shelved for
the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly two years, no new Southern Co. power plant deals
in China have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``China obviously needs power _ a lot of it,'' mused Kuester.
``Why then is the China market so difficult to crack?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kuester and the rest of Southern's 16-member Asian
executive corps may be nearing an answer. After rattling the bamboo
in China for more than a year, Southern is reportedly close to
announcing one or two breakthrough deals _ perhaps as early as
during the June 25-July 3 visit to China by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One deal close to blossoming is for a Southern Co. investment in
a mid-sized Chinese 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant near the
mouth of a coal mine in the northern province of Shanxi, 150 miles
west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For about six months Southern has been pursuing this Shanxi
contract in partnership with former U.S. Senator J. Bennett
Johnston's Washington-based energy company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically in a joint venture with him on that one,''
said Kuester, referring to the former chairman of the U.S. Senate
Energy Committee who went into the energy business after retiring
from the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kuester declined to predict when the Shanxi negotiations might
conclude, saying ``it is premature to announce anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Southern's Hong Kong-based go-getters have been
rushing to complete a significantly larger deal in China, this time
apparently without Johnston's participation and clout.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Southern dispatched a technical team to investigate
a possible investment in two existing 1200-megawatt Chinese
coal-fired power plants in coastal Shandong province, a fast-growth
region between Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, a report on China's official Xinhua news agency
appeared to boost Southern's chances. It disclosed that Shanxi
Province has budgeted $8.4 billion to expand 10 coal-fired power
plants and make the province a major electricity exporter over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coal is expected to continue to provide 70 percent of the
country's energy needs well into the next century as China has few
alternatives to satisfy fast-expanding demand for power,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of cheery intelligence that first attracted
Southern to open a small business development office in Hong Kong
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first three years of Southern's Asia business prospecting
yielded meager results. So in October 1996, Southern chairman A.W.
Dalhberg decided to risk a quantum leap by concluding a $2.7
billion contract to buy 80 percent of Wu's CEPA.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year Southern's profits were so robust that
Dahlberg could tell shareholders that Southern was the ``900-pound
gorilla'' of the American power business, and was intent on
becoming a global ``1,800-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, who needed cash to pare down debts from other heavily
leveraged ventures, received $2.1 billion from Southern, plus a
$600 million one-time cash dividend from CEPA's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Southern expected to operate CEPA indefinitely in
partnership with Wu, who was counted on to add his vision and his
Rolodex of power industry contacts to Southern's base of technical
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian financial crisis, starting with a tsunami wave of
Asian currency devaluations last summer, pressured Southern and Wu
to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full story of their breakup remains tightly held, one
seed of tension was their diverging appraisals about the future
profitability of CEPA'S Tanjung Jati B power project in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Wu _ contending that Tanjung Jati B would ultimately yield $20
billion in income _ had pressed Southern to deliver a $138 million
contingency payment that had been part of the original $2.7 billion
CEPA price tag.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern said no, on grounds that the Indonesians had not
made a binding commitment on how much they would pay for Tanjung
Jati B's electricity once the plant was built.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Asian currency crisis was starting to explode last
July, Southern bought out Wu's remaining 20 percent of CEPA for
$115 million in cash, plus Southern's share of the CEPA rights to
develop the disputed Indonesian Tanjung Jati plant.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, this second deal with Wu came in the nick of time.
Within weeks, Indonesia's economy was sucked into a whirlpool that
would squeeze out three-quarters of the value of the Indonesian
currency and help cause this spring's ouster of President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanjung Jati B plant, now back in Wu's portfolio, is on
indefinite hold, and Southern is one of the few international
electric power companies that emerged from the Indonesia debacle
unscathed. Indonesia's state-owned electricity distributor declared
this month that it ``has no money'' to pay foreign-based power
companies for contracted generating plants in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Wu has congratulated himself on getting the
better of the deal in the two-stage takeover by Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sold CEPA, it was based on this principle: we already
had completed contracts and there was a whole bag of receivables on
hand,'' Wu told the South China Morning Post last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comment at the time was that I had sold the family jewels.
At $18.50 (the price per share Southern paid for CEPA), I was a
happy seller. I'd be lucky to get half that price today.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong executives prefer not to publicly dispute
Wu's judgment about what CEPA was really worth.
</P>
<P>
   However, a footnote in Southern's 1997 annual report informs
stockholders that Southern's $2.1 billion net cost for acquiring
100 percent of CEPA ``exceeded the fair market value of net assets
by approximately $1.6 billion.'' The annual report explained that
the excess over market value in buying the Asian subsidiary _
$1.649 billion _ was entered onto Southern Co. books as an
``increase in goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia's changing economic fortunes accounted for much of the gap
in valuations. Chances have increased that Southern may never
receive a payback on four out of the five biggest future Asian
power plant projects that were on Wu's drawing boards when he sold
his company to Southern.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the shelved plant in China's Jiangsu Province and
Indonesia's Tanjung Jati B that Wu reclaimed, the potential
non-performers are:
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $1.6 billion Keti Bandar coal-fired power plant in
Pakistan. This Wu-initiated plant ``is basically at a standstill,''
Kuester acknowledged in an interview. ``They (the Pakistanis) don't
need any more power, they don't want any more power, and we are not
pushing ahead on that because it doesn't make sense for the country
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $5.5 billion electricity mega-plant in India.
Kuester said the new Indian government has signaled a willingness
to proceed with some electricity mega-plants. But the India
``memorandum of agreement'' that Southern inherited from Wu was not
a fully negotiated deal. ``We still have to stand back and assess
the situation _ is that a project that makes sense for us,
economically?'' said Kuester.
</P>
<P>
   Prickly though Southern's path has been, Kuester believes the
American utility giant is gradually becoming more comfortable in
its new Asian habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so different in Alabama or Mississippi or Georgia,''
Kuester said. ``You don't walk into somebody's office and all of a
sudden do a business deal and make friends. It takes a while to
develop a relationship ... The fact that they didn't know who we
were and didn't trust us when we walked in the door, and that it
took some time, that didn't surprise me.''

Dahlberg could tell shareholders that Southern was the ``900-pound
gorilla'' of the American power business, and was intent on
becoming a global ``1,800-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, who needed cash to pare down debts from other heavily
leveraged ventures, received $2.1 billion from Southern, plus a
$600 million one-time cash dividend from CEPA's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Southern expected to operate CEPA indefinitely in
partnership with Wu, who was counted on to add his vision and his
Rolodex of power industry contacts to Southern's base of technical
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian financial crisis, starting with a tsunami wave of
Asian currency devaluations last summer, pressured Southern and Wu
to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full story of their breakup remains tightly held, one
seed of tension was their diverging appraisals about the future
profitability of CEPA'S Tanjung Jati B power project in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Wu _ contending that Tanjung Jati B would ultimately yield $20
billion in income _ had pressed Southern to deliver a $138 million
contingency payment that had been part of the original $2.7 billion
CEPA price tag.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern said no, on grounds that the Indonesians had not
made a binding commitment on how much they would pay for Tanjung
Jati B's electricity once the plant was built.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Asian currency crisis was starting to explode last
July, Southern bought out Wu's remaining 20 percent of CEPA for
$115 million in cash, plus Southern's share of the CEPA rights to
develop the disputed Indonesian Tanjung Jati plant.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, this second deal with Wu came in the nick of time.
Within weeks, Indonesia's economy was sucked into a whirlpool that
would squeeze out three-quarters of the value of the Indonesian
currency and help cause this spring's ouster of President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanjung Jati B plant, now back in Wu's portfolio, is on
indefinite hold, and Southern is one of the few international
electric power companies that emerged from the Indonesia debacle
unscathed. Indonesia's state-owned electricity distributor declared
this month that it ``has no money'' to pay foreign-based power
companies for contracted generating plants in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Wu has congratulated himself on getting the
better of the deal in the two-stage takeover by Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sold CEPA, it was based on this principle: we already
had completed contracts and there was a whole bag of receivables on
hand,'' Wu told the South China Morning Post last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comment at the time was that I had sold the family jewels.
At $18.50 (the price per share Southern paid for CEPA), I was a
happy seller. I'd be lucky to get half that price today.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong executives prefer not to publicly dispute
Wu's judgment about what CEPA was really worth.
</P>
<P>
   However, a footnote in Southern's 1997 annual report informs
stockholders that Southern's $2.1 billion net cost for acquiring
100 percent of CEPA ``exceeded the fair market value of net assets
by approximately $1.6 billion.'' The annual report explained that
the excess over market value in buying the Asian subsidiary _
$1.649 billion _ was entered onto Southern Co. books as an
``increase in goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia's changing economic fortunes accounted for much of the gap
in valuations. Chances have increased that Southern may never
receive a payback on four out of the five biggest future Asian
power plant projects that were on Wu's drawing boards when he sold
his company to Southern.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the shelved plant in China's Jiangsu Province and
Indonesia's Tanjung Jati B that Wu reclaimed, the potential
non-performers are:
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $1.6 billion Keti Bandar coal-fired power plant in
Pakistan. This Wu-initiated plant ``is basically at a standstill,''
Kuester acknowledged in an interview. ``They (the Pakistanis) don't
need any more power, they don't want any more power, and we are not
pushing ahead on that because it doesn't make sense for the country
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $5.5 billion electricity mega-plant in India.
Kuester said the new Indian government has signaled a willingness
to proceed with some electricity mega-plants. But the India
``memorandum of agreement'' that Southern inherited from Wu was not
a fully negotiated deal. ``We still have to stand back and assess
the situation _ is that a project that makes sense for us,
economically?'' said Kuester.
</P>
<P>
   Prickly though Southern's path has been, Kuester believes the
American utility giant is gradually becoming more comfortable in
its new Asian habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so different in Alabama or Mississippi or Georgia,''
Kuester said. ``You don't walk into somebody's office and all of a
sudden do a business deal and make friends. It takes a while to
develop a relationship ... The fact that they didn't know who we
were and didn't trust us when we walked in the door, and that it
took some time, that didn't surprise me.''

   GUANGDONG PROVINCE, China _ ``The people who run power plants
are exactly alike all over the world,'' says Jim Webber, a 39-year
Southern Co. veteran who left retirement to help knock the kinks
out of Atlanta-based utility giant's first power plant in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the same, they have the same hobbies, they are all
engineers,'' Webber said. ``China is very much like Turkey. Turkey
was very much like Italy. Italy is very much like the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk into any plant in the world. I know the equipment.
And if I know a guy's position in the plant, I basically know how
he thinks. It's basically the way I think. This is all a very large
family, if you will. We all have the same purpose in life, and that
is to produce power.''
</P>
<P>
   At 57, Webber is one of five Southern Co. engineers and
technicians assigned to monitor operations in the new Shajiao C
coal-fired power plant in Guangdong Province, about 50 miles north
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern bought the controlling share of Hong Kong
entrepreneur Gordon Wu's Asian power venture, it inherited a
32-percent interest in this 1,980-megawatt coal-fired power plant.
So far, it is Southern's only beachhead in China.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's company had built the plant for the Guangdong Province
Power Bureau, and it became Southern's contractual duty to its
Chinese joint venture partner to make sure the enormous mechanism
is tuned to deliver power at peak efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Shajiao C plant functions. But not yet at 100-percent
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   When Wu sold out to Southern, he left behind a plant still in
the start-up phase which had more than 120 mechanical,
environmental and structural shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   As of early this month, Southern engineers had managed to trim
Shajiao C's ``punch list'' to 107 flaws that needed fixing before
the Chinese would accept the plant as fully operational.
</P>
<P>
   One recurring problem has involved the three pairs of huge air
fans that blow powdered coal into the three 80-foot-tall combustion
chambers called boilers.
</P>
<P>
   Variation in the demand for power occasionally causes one the
fans to shut down. When that happens, an automatic control box is
supposed to stop some of the unit's coal pulverizing equipment so
that the unit can ``stabilize'' at a 50-percent power output.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons Southern hasn't fully diagnosed, the pulverizing
units sometimes fail to shut down. This causes one of the remaining
fans to heat up and get overloaded, until it shuts down and knocks
one of Shajiao C's three power-producing units out of production.
</P>
<P>
   Except for trying to remedy the defects, Southern has no role in
the day-by-day operations of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The control room is run by Chinese plant operators employed by
the Guangdong Province Power Bureau, who earn about 17 yuan (about
$2.10) per hour, compared to $20 an hour for a coal-fired power
plant operator in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese engineer in charge of operating Shajiao C, Zheng
Linfu, said he's pleased with Southern's progress in addressing the
plant's defects, even though the remaining problems are ``not a
few.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time Southern took over, the relationship on the
technical level has improved greatly,'' Zheng said.

 &HT;    Publishers clueless about nurturing mystery writers
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   National book sales are mostly flat, but the mystery field
continues to explode. Mystery bookstores are increasing in number
by 15 percent every year, and today number nearly 150.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, success brings changes, some of them bad. American
Bookseller reports that publisher's expectations have grown, and
they're no longer interested in supporting mystery writers who
amass only modest sales, or in sticking with a writer while he
builds up name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a new mystery that could sell 3,500 copies got by,
but now publishers want to see as many as 25,000 copies sold before
they make a serious commitment to a writer. This means, in turn,
that smaller presses are getting more mystery submissions.
</P>
<P>
   THE RICH GET RICHER . . . Clive Cussler, along with Mary Higgins
Clark, one of Simon &AMP; Schuster's most popular writers, has re-upped
with a new deal that pays him less up-front but with a higher
percentage of the profits. He'll continue to write his Dirk Pitt
adventures, and he's going to start a new series called The NUMA
Files that will user other writers as well as Cussler.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's going into the franchise business.
</P>
<P>
   HIBERNIAN LITERATURE. . . Roberts Rinehart publishers has issued
``The Quiet Man and Other Stories'' ($12.95), by Maurice Walsh, a
popular Irish author of mid-century. ``The Quiet Man'' was, of
course, the basis for the beloved John Ford film, even though the
only real similarity is the central premise.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's story was originally published in the Saturday Evening
Post in 1936, and Ford bought it almost immediately, although it
took him 15 years to find the money to make it.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was an Irish civil servant by trade _ he died in 1964 _
but ``The Quiet Man'' is typical of his stories _ rough little
character vignettes; Ford gave the story the poetry that's made it
last.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE . . . ``Do you suppose the world is finished, at
any certain time _ like a contract for paving a street? Do you
suppose because the American government has been formed, and public
school established, we have nothing more to do but take our ease,
and make money, and sleep the rest of the time?'' _ Walt Whitman

 &HT;    Florida meteorologists hope for rain
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida temperatures continued to break records with nary a drop
of water in the sky, leaving some farmers, ranchers and water
managers thinking about the dreaded ``D'' word:
</P>
<P>
   Drought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just in time, meteorologists at the South Florida Water
Management District say they hope for rain.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know how much it will rain or how long, or if it will
augur a normal summer of daily thunderstorms. But they hope it will
cool things off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we aren't in any danger right now,'' said district
Executive Director Sam Poole. But, he added, ``If we have a
below-average summer and go into a dry (winter) season, drought is
a very serious possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Winters, director of the Lake Worth Drainage District,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have rain in the next month to a month-and-a-half,
we're going to go into a drought period,'' said Winters, whose
agency's canals replenish the wells that serve coastal communities
from West Palm Beach to Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``One to two weeks of slow, steady rain would really help,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the lack of rain, high temperature records are
falling like heat-stroked tourists. Monday's high in West Palm
Beach was 98 degrees, breaking the old record for that date: 97
degrees on June 15, 1958. It was the third record-setting day in a
row and the fourth so far this month.
</P>
<P>
   A new wave of scattered brush fires broke out Monday from near
Fort Myers to near Jacksonville, destroying at least 11 homes.
Smoke closed parts of Interstate 95 and U.S. 1 in St. Johns and
Nassau counties, and authorities south of St. Augustine called for
evacuation of an entire subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of moisture also threatens to cause $100 million in
losses of soybeans, cotton and other North Florida and Panhandle
crops, state Department of Agriculture spokesman Terence McElroy
said. Agriculture officials aren't expecting big losses in citrus,
vegetables or sugar cane _ although some farmers are wary of the
dry spell persisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it continues too much longer, it will have a major impact
on next year's crop,'' said Indian River Citrus League Chairman
John Luther. Some citrus growers around the state are reporting
wilting leaves and prematurely dropped fruit, Florida Citrus Mutual
spokeswoman Lisa Backman said.
</P>
<P>
   And some ranchers worry about their cattle's pastures.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Florida cattle are bred for hot weather,'' said Mike
Adams, president of Fort Pierce's Bud Adams Ranch, the rancher
still hopes for rain within the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, water district meteorologist Eric Swartz said, a
typical rainy-season weather pattern appears to be forming in the
eastern Gulf of Mexico: a low-pressure trough that should finally
steer some moist weather our way this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   June so far is the third dry month in a row _ not counting the
few rain-filled days that washed out West Palm Beach's so-called
SunFest.
</P>
<P>
   The first week of June also set four new highs for summer
electricity demand as customers cranked their air conditioning,
Florida Power &AMP; Light spokesman Dale Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason it's so hot is it's not raining,'' Swartz
said. And it's so dry that the heat can't draw enough moisture into
the air to get the rain cycle rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, an unusual zone of high pressure is squatting more than
10,000 feet above the state, National Weather Service forecaster
Wayne Colin said. That suppresses the formation of the towering
thunder clouds needed to begin the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Poole said some at the district suspect that El Nino, the
Pacific warm-weather phenomenon that caused this winter's unusually
heavy rains, is giving way to its opposite, La Nina. In strong La
Nina years earlier this century, the result was a dry May and June
in South Florida, according to federal meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the fancy explanations, anyway. Poole offered a
simpler one: Florida's weather tends to swing in extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's normal in Florida,'' he said. ``You can get all your
rain in the dry season and then have a dry wet season.''

   AUS-HEAT Texas swelters as heat wave sticks close
</P>
<P>
   By Leigh Hopper
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Unless you've been hiding in a meat locker, you've
noticed it's steamin', fry-an-egg-on-the-sidewalk hot. Time to find
a cool spot under the front porch and let your tongue hang out.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures reaching scorching, record levels, air
conditioners are running without pause while sprinklers and hoses
are spewing millions of gallons of water. Recent highs in Central
Texas were between 103 and 107 degrees. In Austin, the official
high was 104, a record for the date, which came a day after the
temperature at Bergstrom tied the hottest day ever recorded in
Austin in June, possibly the hottest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Today's temperatures will be only slightly more tolerable, with
an expected high of 100, and weather service officials say not to
expect real relief for months.
</P>
<P>
   Ortencia Briones, whose window unit air conditioner has been out
for a year, has resorted to taking cold showers twice a day.
Occasionally she sleeps on a wet towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get up in the middle of the night and take a
shower because it's too hot,'' said Briones, 68, a resident of
Chalmers Court, a public housing complex. Those using air
conditioners are taking a toll on electrical power companies.
Several area cities are setting daily records for power
consumption, and the strain is showing.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, high demand for electricity caused transformers
inTexas Utilities Electric Company's Round Rock district to
overload, leaving about 400 homes without air conditioning and
lights for about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everyone I knew was standing in their front
yards,'' said John Hurt of Round Rock. ``It was too hot to stay
inside without air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst of it was, the power went out just as the NBA
Championship game was ending, he said. ``Everyone was sitting in
their cars trying to listen to the end of the game on their
radio.''
</P>
<P>
   TU officials said periodic problems could continue this week.
</P>
<P>
   The intense heat had emergency medical workers braced for a
spate of heat-related health problems, but so far none has been
serious.
</P>
<P>
   The unseasonable heat is forcing social service agencies to
scramble to keep up with its relief programs for Austin's elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Meals on Wheels and More is seeking donations of bottled water
to give away to clients. Two years ago, the agency gave out 1,500
bottles of water when the August heat made temperatures soar.
Spokeswoman Lisa Polette said the agency also plans to hand out
pamphlets with detailed information about dehydration. So far a few
clients have complained about discomfort from the heat, but no
serious incidents have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Family Eldercare has given out more than 600 fans to the elderly
after only two weeks of its eighth annual Summer Fan Drive,
officials there said. That is half of what the agency gave out
during the whole summer last year, Family Eldercare spokeswoman
Cathy Marable said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of fans,'' said Marable. ``We're counting on the
generosity of the community to get the help we need for the elderly
who are out there sweltering.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the agency plans to give away 1,600 fans. If people
want to volunteer to deliver fans, want to donate or need a fan
they can call 459-4326.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly, along with small children and people with diseases
such as diabetes and kidney problems, are at greater risk for
heat-related health problems because their bodies don't regulate
their own temperature as well as healthy adults, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin officials said they are taking the heat into account when
planning children's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Dittmar Recreation Center Director Danny Castro said outdoor
games that require a lot of running around have been confined to
the early hours of the morning, when temperatures are at their
lowest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make sure that the kids who come here get plenty of water,
which is a lot better for you than sodas on a day like this,''
Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters see no marked improvement in the heat wave, which is
not good news for providers of electric power. Electricity demand
in Austin has on some days this summer been 50 percent higher than
last year. TU has seen 20 percent jumps, while customers of
Pedernales Electric Cooperative are using about 25 percent more
electricity since the start of May than they did a year ago. In
Georgetown, residents are using 25 percent more electricity per
capita than they were last June.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Fuelberg, general manager of the Pedernales co-op, said,
``People may try to sleep with the windows open even when it gets
up to 90 degrees, but they use an air conditioner when it gets to
109.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters say some relief for broiled Central Texans could
occur over the next few weeks as sporadic weather systems
containing some rain work their way into the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Ward said any
long-term relief is not likely until of August. ``It's not until
after the first part of August that storm systems are able to push
their way into Central Texas from the Gulf Coast and Caribbean.''

 &HT;    Publishers clueless about nurturing mystery writers
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   National book sales are mostly flat, but the mystery field
continues to explode. Mystery bookstores are increasing in number
by 15 percent every year, and today number nearly 150.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, success brings changes, some of them bad. American
Bookseller reports that publisher's expectations have grown, and
they're no longer interested in supporting mystery writers who
amass only modest sales, or in sticking with a writer while he
builds up name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a new mystery that could sell 3,500 copies got by,
but now publishers want to see as many as 25,000 copies sold before
they make a serious commitment to a writer. This means, in turn,
that smaller presses are getting more mystery submissions.
</P>
<P>
   THE RICH GET RICHER . . . Clive Cussler, along with Mary Higgins
Clark, one of Simon &AMP; Schuster's most popular writers, has re-upped
with a new deal that pays him less up-front but with a higher
percentage of the profits. He'll continue to write his Dirk Pitt
adventures, and he's going to start a new series called The NUMA
Files that will user other writers as well as Cussler.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's going into the franchise business.
</P>
<P>
   HIBERNIAN LITERATURE. . . Roberts Rinehart publishers has issued
``The Quiet Man and Other Stories'' ($12.95), by Maurice Walsh, a
popular Irish author of mid-century. ``The Quiet Man'' was, of
course, the basis for the beloved John Ford film, even though the
only real similarity is the central premise.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's story was originally published in the Saturday Evening
Post in 1936, and Ford bought it almost immediately, although it
took him 15 years to find the money to make it.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was an Irish civil servant by trade _ he died in 1964 _
but ``The Quiet Man'' is typical of his stories _ rough little
character vignettes; Ford gave the story the poetry that's made it
last.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE . . . ``Do you suppose the world is finished, at
any certain time _ like a contract for paving a street? Do you
suppose because the American government has been formed, and public
school established, we have nothing more to do but take our ease,
and make money, and sleep the rest of the time?'' _ Walt Whitman

 &HT;    Cats got her in trouble
 &HT;    By Scott Cech
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ To Johnette Lothrop's way of thinking,
the city of Port St. Lucie is telling her to suddenly quit her
abiding hobby and kick 20 of her closest friends out of her house.
Or else.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her husband Robert, Lothrop lives with about 20 Maine
Coon cats, which she said she breeds, shows and occasionally sells
to help recoup the costs of keeping the cats.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has told her that anyone housing more than three
adult cats is running a de facto kennel, and no kennels are allowed
in residential districts.
</P>
<P>
   So Lothrop has been reluctantly giving away her pride of cats,
all of which have names.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it politely, I'm pissed,'' she said. ``But I can't
fight city hall on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   When she and her husband moved into their suburban home off
Thornhill Drive two years ago, she said, she consulted the city's
animal control officers about local regulations and has kept the
animals clean and well-fed. They have to be, she said, to compete
in hobbyists' cat shows she enters more than once a month. Ribbons
from the shows decorate a wall in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, city code enforcement officials said, Lothrop's
feline stewardship is more than just a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hobby is not something you get compensated for,'' said Mary
Mastro, an administrative assistant in the occupational licensing
division of the city's Building Department. She said
advertisements, such as those Lothrop has placed to sell the
occasional cat as a pet, put Lothrop in a category different than
the average cat owner.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the scale of sales, Mastro said, ``If you put a
product or a service out there and you get compensated for it,
you're no different from Wal-mart.''
</P>
<P>
   But that argument cuts no ice with Lothrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a business,'' she said. ``If it was a business I'd
be making money.'' Even with the cats' value _ up to $1,000 for a
good purebred breeding cat, she said _ Lothrop estimates she loses
$5,000 to $10,000 per year keeping up with the cats' needs. That
includes food, vaccination, veterinary and insurance costs, as well
as cat-show entrance fees and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Even giving the cats away is expensive, she said, pointing to
the $170-per-cat air fare she's paying to ship them to breeders she
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Lothrop said the city told her to write a letter promising to
get rid of the cats or face the judgment of the city's code board
at its July 8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Ridsdale, the city's neighborhood services coordinator,
said the board could impose fines of $10 to $250 per day.
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing compared to the emotional cost of losing her
cats, Lothrop said. She wiped away a tear as she recalled having to
give up a 4-month-old kitten she had to give up recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now it still bothers me that he's gone,'' she said,
surrounded on her couch by stretching, sleeping and frolicking
cats. ``You get attached to these guys.''

   THE MONKEES
</P>
<P>
   HOW THEY WERE MANUFACTURED: Taking a cue from the success of a
certain mop-top quartet, television producers Bert Schneider and
Bob Rafelson put this foursome together in 1965 for a weekly series
_ and the hit records soon followed. Stephen Stills (of Crosby,
Stills and Nash) was among the 400 would-be Monkees rejected during
the auditions.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR STYLE: Goofball rock a la The Beatles in ``A Hard Day's
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   SIGNATURE SONGS: ``Last Train to Clarksville,'' ``Daydream
Believer,'' ``I'm a Believer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Village People
</P>
<P>
   HOW THEY WERE MANUFACTURED: Record producer Jacques Morali
wanted a group he could sell to the gay audience, so in 1977 he
recruited a cast of characters: The G.I., The Construction Worker,
The Biker, The Cowboy, The Indian and The Cop.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR STYLE: Gay culture gone mainstream _ with a disco beat.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNATURE SONGS: ``Y.M.C.A.,'' ``Macho Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Menudo
</P>
<P>
   HOW THEY WERE MANUFACTURED: In 1977, Puerto Rican promoter
Edgardo Diaz conceived of this teen group as the ultimate
expression of pre-fab pop: When a band member's voice matured, he
was replaced. The formula still works _ 21 years and 31 albums
later.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR STYLE: Menudo has always followed the latest musical
trend, be it rock or hip hop, but they're basically Spanish
bubblegum.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNATURE SONGS: ``Quiero Ser,'' ``Si Tu No Estas,'' ``Por
Amor,'' ``Donde Esta Tu Amor.''
</P>
<P>
   New Kids on the Block
</P>
<P>
   HOW THEY WERE MANUFACTURED: After losing control of his first
manufactured group, the all-black New Edition, composer/producer
Maurice Starr hit upon a new idea for an R&AMP;B outfit: The all-white
New Kids was created in 1984 after Starr auditioned kids in the
Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR STYLE: In Starr's words, ``the Osmonds with soul.''
</P>
<P>
   SIGNATURE SONGS: ``Please Don't Go Girl,'' ``You Got It (The
Right Stuff),'' ``Hangin' Tough,'' ``Step by Step.''

 &HT;    Make your own prefab pop supergroup
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In ``Spice World,'' that cinematic
celebration of all things Spice Girls, there's a scene that could
come only from the fantasy-filled mind of a Hollywood producer. No,
it's not when the girls discover a bomb on their bus. And it's not
when they wander into the woods and encounter a group of aliens.
</P>
<P>
   It's a flashback sequence that shows a younger, more innocent
Spice Girls putting together their act, determined to make a run on
the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   As the group launches its first American tour and as ``Spice
World'' makes its way to video stores, it's increasingly obvious
that determination is the only true factor in the Spice Girls'
remarkable success story.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else about the quintet-turned-quartet is
manufactured, from their formation through a classified ad to their
cleverly conceived personas: Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria
Adams), Scary (Melanie Brown) and Sporty (Melanie Chisolm). A cynic
might even suggest that the recent departure of Ginger (Geri
Haliwell) was also planned _ a way to stimulate interest in a
musical franchise that's dangerously close to its 15th minute on
the Warholian yardstick of fame.
</P>
<P>
   But Spice Girls fans, all gazillion of them, should take heart:
They're hardly the first to fall under the spell of assembly-line
pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one for every generation. The Monkees were the '60s
and the Spice Girls are the '90s,'' says Rhino Records Media
Director David Dorn, whose label owns the Monkees' catalog. ``Some
of them have real staying power and some don't. The Monkees
continue to make money for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the annals of popular music are filled with manufactured
groups. For every embarrassment like Milli Vanilli _ the duo so
contrived it didn't even sing on its records _ there's Menudo, the
Spanish boy band that's still going strong. Whenever one of its
member gets too old, he's replaced.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the phenomenon is a shrewd lesson in marketing,
of tapping an audience and delivering a product. Having a few good
tunes doesn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing new. Natural-born pop talents of yesteryear _ the
Frank Sinatras and Bing Crosbys _ were ``manufactured'' in a sense,
their images and music shaped for mass consumption. ``You could get
somebody to say Colonel Tom Parker fabricated the phenomenon that
was Elvis,'' says Rhino's Dorn.
</P>
<P>
   But by the '60s, the nature of the business changed. Prefab was
out, soul searching, singer-songwriting was in. Still, not everyone
ached for such wisdom. A lot of folks just wanted to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born the manufactured group: If the industry couldn't
find bubble-brained musicians with telegenic appeal, it would
create them. The Monkees, put together for a weekly TV series in
1966, were the first to tap into this idea.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every band has followed a similar path. It begins with a
timely concept. In The Monkees' case, a pair of TV executives, Bert
Schneider and Bob Rafelson, wanted to cash in on Beatlemania by
giving the craze a goofy, American slant. With the New Kids on the
Block, a late '80s success, talent-show impresario Maurice Starr
was convinced the time was right to sell R&AMP;B and rap to young white
audiences with a white group.
</P>
<P>
   The target market is typically preteen girls. ``They're good
little consumers,'' says Gary Graff, supervising editor of
MusicHound, a series of record guides. That is, not only do they
buy records, but also T-shirts, lunch boxes, breakfast cereals and
anything else you can slap a picture of a band on.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gow, a communications professor at Alfred University and
advisory editor to Popular Music and Society, also suggests they
have the right naive attitude: ``They don't have the concept of
guilt . . . They can unabashedly embrace something the rest of the
world is calling garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that groups can't be manufactured to suit other markets. The
Village People, brainchild of the late French record producer
Jacques Morali, was targeted at gays when it first broke in the
mid-'70s. It was only when ``Macho Man'' became a surprise AM hit
that the rest of America caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Once the idea and audience are in place, the real work begins.
Auditions are usually held to recruit members. But calling these
talent searches would be a misnomer. Since the groups are largely
conceptual, image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted kids who had a raw look, not who looked like
models,'' said New Kids promoter Starr in a 1990 interview. ``As
for ability, I was looking for kids who could catch on and learn
real quick. The kids weren't singers, and they weren't dancers . .
. See, a person doesn't have to have talent. I can give them
talent. It's like a doctor doing a heart transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Diaz, the promoter behind Menudo, prefers to think of
the band members as only one part. ``They sing very well and dance
very well, but they don't have the talent to write songs,'' he
explains from a tour date in Mexico. ``And there are people who
have the talent to write songs . . . It's a team working
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at The Monkees, and Diaz's argument makes sense: Sure, Davy
Jones was cute and Peter Tork was silly, but they were also singing
songs by such brilliant pop stylists as Neil Diamond and Carole
King.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you can't ignore the power of the diverse array of
personalities that make up most manufactured groups. Gow says it's
like casting a TV sitcom. ``You take how in `Cheers,' each
character is a part of our personality, and you can identify in
different degrees with Norm or Sam or Carla,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   The final ingredient is promotion. To a great extent,
``organic'' groups _ the term Graff uses _ are influenced by how
they're sold to the public. But at least they control the product.
A record label may advise the Smashing Pumpkins when to deliver
their next album, but it's up to the band to write the songs. With
manufactured groups, everything is controlled, from the timing of
releases to sponsor tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a band like this, it's all about marketing,'' said Johnny
Wright, the manager of the Backstreet Boys, another current
manufactured group. ``That's why we went to all those schools,
performed at school assemblies, and signed autographs for 16- and
17-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   But today's best example of manufactured pop is the Spice Girls.
Here is a melding of concept, audience, image and marketing that
has translated into sales of 20 million copies of their first album
(``Spice'') alone.
</P>
<P>
   The group actually claims it is not pre-fabbed. ``We've had so
many people try to say they managed us, but we've all been in the
music industry for years and we've done it ourselves,'' said Mel
Brown (aka Scary Spice) in a 1996 interview with London's Guardian
newspaper. ``We do everything ourselves; we're completely into girl
power and there's nothing (our) lot can't handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. For starters, the Spice Girls were recruited
through an ad placed by promoter Bob Herbert in 1993. They quickly
dumped him, but then hired another manager, Simon Fuller, the
brains behind Annie Lennox's career. Dubbed ``Svengali Spice'' by
the British press, he's been credited with shaping the group's
``girl power'' aesthetic _ call it Wonderbra feminism wedded to a
dance-pop beat.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who's really in charge, The Spice Girls were an
idea waiting to happen. After years of grungy rock from
male-dominated bands, audiences were ready for something lighter in
tone and feminine in perspective. ``We're in the get-happy half of
the '90s,'' says Graff.
</P>
<P>
   The Spices also took the cult of personality to the max,
compensating for their less-than-amazing voices and dancing
abilities by creating characters with brand identities. The Monkees
simply played the part; the Girls gave them names.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Spices mastered the art of salesmanship. Their
first recording broke in Japan before England to immediately
establish the group's international presence. Their second album,
``Spice World,'' was tied to the film of the same name. And do you
think it's by accident the video comes out just when they're
kicking off their first, all-important American tour?
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance, says Winslow Farrell, author of ``How Hits
Happen,'' an analytical look at popular culture. Such strategizing
is ``absolutely critical to keeping it (the phenomenon) controlled,
but going for a long period of time,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   But Farrell says the key difference between The Monkees and the
Spice Girls is the advent of the Internet. While marketing may play
a big role in a group's success, nothing can replace what he calls
``the conversation'' among fans _ the buzz of excitement that's
created when an act is breaking big. Three decades ago, ``the
conversation'' might have taken place in the schoolyard. With the
Internet, the schoolyard becomes the world.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it? Just check out the umpteen Spice Girls Web
sites, where the departure of Ginger is being greeted with the
hysteria normally reserved for the death of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Spice Girls do, however, share one key element with The
Monkees: a burning need for respect. The Monkees rebelled against
their handlers and went on to play their own instruments and write
much of their own material (not that it was any good).
</P>
<P>
   The Spice Girls already take some songwriting credit (and let
the critics be damned, they're fine tunes). But their real stab at
independence came late last year when they fired Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   But will that be enough to sustain them? Rhino's Dorn is not
sure. ``The Spice Girls were a perfect move for somebody interested
in creating a marketing opportunity. It's not about music.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not. It's about fun, the packaged entertainment that
only a child can fully appreciate. Which begs a question: Why don't
they make a Spice Girls for adults?
</P>
<P>
   ``They do,'' says Graff. ``It's called `Seinfeld'.''

 &HT;    Alienated by the ``X-Files''? Our guide can help.
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The truth is out there, but you'll have to pay about $7 to find
out what it is.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, ``The X-Files'' has been TV's most dense drama.
NASA flight manuals are easier to decipher than the show's
tough-to-follow mythology.
</P>
<P>
   But series creator Chris Carter promises that answers to many of
the show's long-held alien/government conspiracy theories will be
revealed in ``The X-Files: Fight the Future.'' The $60 million
film, which opens Friday, picks up where May's season finale left
off.
</P>
<P>
   In case you forgot, FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and
Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) learn that an odd-looking,
12-year-old boy possessing psychic powers may hold the key to
unlocking the mysteries of the X-Files. And in a stunning ending,
the dastardly Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) snuck into
Mulder's office, stole his sister's file and calmly burned down the
cabinet containing all the cherished X-Files.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Fight the Future'' is one of the summer's most
anticipated movies, there are risks involved. Will people who don't
watch ``The X-Files'' go see the movie? If they do go, will they
get it?
</P>
<P>
   If Carter makes the film too simplistic, the hard-core fans will
gripe. If ``Fight the Future'' is neck-deep in confusing history
and mythology, non X-Philes are likely to throw their popcorn at
the screen. (It's been reported that scenes explaining the
abduction of Mulder's sister were cut because it was considered too
confusing for nonfans.) Somehow Carter must please two very
distinct groups.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're one of those casual viewers or a confused
die-hard fan, we're going to tell you everything you need to know
to get you through the movie.
</P>
<P>
   1) What are ``The X-Files''?
</P>
<P>
   The files are a batch of unsolved FBI cases on paranormal or
unexplained phenomena. Some of them involved vampires, a spooky
serial killer who emerged every 30 years to eat human livers, and
deadly alien parasites. But our alien-battling duo's chief goal is
to determine the truth about extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   2) How did Scully and Mulder get together?
</P>
<P>
   Mulder was a star FBI profiler who helped nab a notorious serial
killer. But instead of pursuing a stellar career in the Bureau,
Mulder chose ``the basement office with no heat,'' where the FBI
stashes the X-Files. Scully has an impeccable medical background
and once taught at the FBI's training academy. She was partnered
with Mulder to spy on him and discredit his controversial work.
</P>
<P>
   3) Why does Mulder care so much about aliens?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to hypnotic regression, Mulder is convinced that his
sister, Samantha, was abducted by aliens when they were kids.
</P>
<P>
   4) Why is Mulder so skeptical now?
</P>
<P>
   After killing a Department of Defense operative who was spying
on him, Mulder is told that the whole alien conspiracy is a hoax
that dates back to the days just after World War II. At the time,
generals were desperate to continue fueling the nation's economy
via a military build-up. So the government used the Roswell
incident as an elaborate cover story to distract the public from a
top-secret program involving DNA and bioweapons.
</P>
<P>
   5) But if there is a big alien conspiracy, what is it?
</P>
<P>
   That's the $64,000 question. Apparently we haven't been alone
for a long time. According to ``Fight the Future,'' aliens are the
Earth's original inhabitants. Now, as insurgent agent Alex Krycek
(Nicholas Lea) noted, there's an alien ``war raging.'' There's a
nasty batch of shape-shifting aliens hellbent on colonizing Earth.
But, wait . . . there's also a band of faceless alien rebels
attempting to foil the colonist's plans. But those shape-shifting
aliens have help. They're working with The Syndicate, a group of
middle-aged men who wield more power than the president or any
known government. For helping the aliens populate Earth with
alien/human hybrid clones, The Syndicate is promised it'll become
an even bigger power broker after the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   6) What is the black oil?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the key to the alien's colonization plans. It's lethal
to humans. But is the black oil just an icky, out-of-this-world
virus or the real alien life forms who just use the shape-shifters
to carry out their evil plot?
</P>
<P>
   7) Why are the faceless aliens burning up humans with chip
implants?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against the humans, of course. But the faceless aliens
quite possibly don't want the colonizing aliens getting information
from them.
</P>
<P>
   8) Have Scully and Mulder ever been romantically involved?
</P>
<P>
   No _ although they both want to. The pouty-mouthed Scully is
prone to serious catty looks whenever another woman dares to look
at her partner. If you looked closely, you could see steam coming
out of Scully's ears when Mulder recently met up with a former
partner (Mimi Rogers). We hear Scully and Mulder almost kiss in the
movie, but a buzzing bee kills the moment. If Carter is smart _ and
we know he is _ Mulder and Scully will never take a quick romp in
the sack. The sexual tension between the two is part of the series'
enduring appeal.
</P>
<P>
   OK, got all that? Now, you can handle the truth.

 &HT;    Here's some background on the ``X-Files'' players
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you're going to see ``The X-Files: Fight the Future.''
There's only one problem. You've never seen ``The X-Files.'' Don't
sweat it. Here's a handy guide to all the key players:
</P>
<P>
   FOX MULDER
</P>
<P>
   (David Duchovny)
</P>
<P>
   This Oxford graduate was on the FBI fast-track until he started
chasing aliens and paranormal phenomena. Until recently, he was
steadfastly convinced that extraterrestrials existed. Now he's not
so sure what the truth is. Sometimes referred to as ``Spooky''
Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   DANA SCULLY
</P>
<P>
   (Gillian Anderson)
</P>
<P>
   Was paired with Mulder to debunk his ``the truth is out there''
theories. A no-nonsense medical doctor who once believed there was
a scientific explanation behind every X-file. Now she knows there
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   WALTER SKINNER
</P>
<P>
   (Mitch Pileggi)
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's hunky assistant director. Is often at odds over
Mulder's unorthodox methods. Although Skinner cares about his best
agents, it's never explained where he gets his orders. Looks good
in briefs.
</P>
<P>
   CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN
</P>
<P>
   (William B. Davis)
</P>
<P>
   A chain-smoking devil who once sinisterly bragged, ``I've seen
presidents die.'' Works for a shadowy international organization
and could be Mulder's father.
</P>
<P>
   THE LONE GUNMEN
</P>
<P>
   Three geeky-looking guys Mulder often goes to for help. There's
the long-haired Langly (Dean Haglund), the combat boot-wearing
Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and the bearded systems expert Byers (Bruce
Harwood).
</P>
<P>
   WELL-MANICURED MAN
</P>
<P>
   (John Neville)
</P>
<P>
   The one man who can intimidate Cigarette Smoking Man. Always
nattily dressed, Well-Manicured Man is often seen barking icy
orders to his syndicate underlings in a smoke-filled room.
</P>
<P>
   SAMANTHA MULDER
</P>
<P>
   (Megan Leitch)
</P>
<P>
   Mulder's sister, who may or may not have been kidnapped by
aliens when she was 8 years old. Might be Cigarette Smoking Man's
daughter.

of Barton Springs for the summer, just as temperatures are soaring
over the century mark. (Wear, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

 &HT;    Salamander lawsuit arouses suspicion
 &HT;    By Ben Wear
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Back in 1946, when biologists first scooped up and
identified what would become known as the Barton Springs
salamander, they couldn't have known the huge role their discovery
would come to have on the local scene or the potential havoc that
two other amphibian enthusiasts would visit on Austin 52 years
later in defense of the salamander.
</P>
<P>
   The salamander, with considerable help from Alan Hamilton and
Robert Barnhart and a ruling from a federal judge, could cause the
closure of all or most of Barton Springs for the summer, just as
temperatures are soaring over the century mark.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton and Barnhart, who filed a lawsuit last month alleging
that the city is violating the Endangered Species Act by causing
incidental harm to salamanders with its pool cleanings at Barton
Springs, have been identified in various press reports and court
filings as scientists, biologists, herpetologists, as an
environmental consultant (Hamilton) and a sanitation inspector
(Barnhart).
</P>
<P>
   Because their lawyer and a college buddy who has helped them
with the lawsuit work for developers, they've also been identified
_ accused, really _ of being fronts or dupes for developers seeking
to hoist environmentalists on their own legal petard.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where the salamander has assumed the role of aquatic
canary in the coal mine, everyone from Austin's mayor to everyday
lap swimmers have questioned whether Hamilton and Barnhart care
about either the canary or the coal mine. ''I'm as sincere as I can
be, because I'm a nobody, a working stiff,'' Barnhart, a sanitation
inspector for the City of West Lake Hills, said Monday afternoon.
``I think what the city is doing with these things is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart and Hamilton are credentialed salamander experts, both
having written master's theses in the mid-1970s at Southwest Texas
State University requiring them to capture, preserve and
meticulously measure every possible body dimension of hundreds of
salamanders.
</P>
<P>
   At least one established Austin environmental activist vouches
for the motives of Hamilton, whom he calls a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reassured that Alan is not trying to do this for some
monetary or sinister motive,'' says Wayne Gronquist, one of the
founders of the Save Barton Creek Association and a current member
of its board.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bunch, a lawyer for the Save Our Springs Alliance,
discounted Gronquist's endorsement, saying Gronquist had also
developed in the watershed and, with Hamilton's help, built a dam
on Barton Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``His brand of environmentalism is not consistent with most of
our views,'' Bunch said. Gronquist countered that his development
activities don't disqualify him as an environmentalist or as a
judge of his friend's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton and Barnhart's close association with Phil Savoy, an
engineer who works for developers over the Barton Springs
watershed, fuels suspicion that they may be serving an agenda other
than the salamander's preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart said he and Hamilton and Savoy have been friends since
graduate school, when Savoy helped him with the math portions of
his thesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just sort of a consensus of opinion among us that we
ought to do something,'' Barnhart said. They hooked up with lawyer
Robert Kleeman, who filed the lawsuit on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart, acknowledging that he cannot afford to pay the legal
fees if they lose, said, ``We thought it is such an open-and-shut
case, such a flagrant violation of the law that there's no way we
can lose and not recover attorney s fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton told a KLBJ-AM radio reporter in early February that he
would like to see a series of dams upstream on Barton Creek. The
pools behind the dam, in theory, would catch silt before it reaches
the pool. Fewer cleanings with high-pressure hoses and bobcat
tractors _ and thus fewer disturbed or killed salamanders, the
thinking goes _ would be the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pool is nothing more than a silt trap the way the
situation in the creek is now,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the relationship between the purity of Barton Springs
and the salamander's survival is overrated. Salamanders actually
feed on plant life that flourishes in what most people would
consider bad water, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can live in somewhat of a sewer,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 15-minute interview, Hamilton maintained that the
city has not sufficiently studied the Barton Springs salamander's
habits and needs and that the invasive pool cleaning methods are
evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who got an undergraduate degree from Texas A&AMP;M,
received a master's from the Southwest Texas aquatic biology
department in 1973. His 66-page thesis focuses on salamanders from
the Blanco River system but not on their survival or eating habits.
His study, as did Barnhart's two years later, is almost exclusively
of the salamander's physique i Barnhart, 56, knew Hamilton at
Southwest Texas State University and even borrowed some of his
salamander samples for his thesis.
</P>
<P>
   Although he works for West Lake Hills as a septic tank and
restaurant inspector, Barnhart lives in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart, according to his resume, got his undergraduate and
graduate degrees at Southwest Texas. He was a building contractor
for 13 years and, from 1978 to 1985, was a sanitarian and then
project director with the San Marcos-Hays County Migrant Project.
In 1995, he was hired by West Lake Hills.
</P>
<P>
   William K. Davis, a retired Southwest Texas biology professor,
advised both Hamilton and Barnhart on their thesis work. He says
Barnhart approached him earlier this year to be an expert witness.
He declined. The lawsuit, he said, is ``frivolous. . . . I don't
approve of what they're doing. ``I'm a great believer that human
beings are the most important animals on this earth,'' Davis said.
``And I don't believe we should put salamanders above human beings.
So I woul Without cleaning, the limestone in the shallow end gets
slick from algae. If Hamilton and Barnhart prevail, there would be
no more cleanings until the city gets a federal permit for
``incidental takings'' of the salamander. That might not happen
until August or September. The city, in a legal brief filed last
week, said that aside from two large areas already closed, no
cleanings this summer would force it to also rope off the shallow
end where young children and families hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson and Watterson said the rock wasn't all that slippery last
week. Then, almost on cue, Watterson's boy Colin executed a
pratfall, landing on the back of his head. He got up a little
dazed, rubbing his elbow, but otherwise OK.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Ginger i
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a while Monday night, I felt what it was like to hold the
answer to the question gripping not only a nation, but perhaps the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Ginger Spice here?'' they repeatedly asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answered sagely, knowing for the first time what it
must feel like to be Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   For I had seen the Spice Girls hours before the recent sold out
show at Coral Sky Amphiteatre in Florida, the opening concert of
their world tour, and I had only counted four girls ... Baby Spice,
Scary Spice, Sneezy and Zeppo.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'll admit it, despite having an 8-year-old daughter, I'm
tragically behind the power curve when it comes to my Spice Girls
knowledge. But I know this. Ginger Spice wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   And neither was Dolly Parton (Spice Rack?).
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry to report that I wasn't able to find the official
story on Ginger Spice's recent defection from the band. The various
Spices (shouldn't there be one named Rosemary?) came out before the
show and posed for photos for the press. But we were repeatedly
asked not to dare ask them any questions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they were still formulating a unified stance on the
India-Pakistan nuclear proliferation question.
</P>
<P>
   To find out about why Ginger quit the band, I had to rely on the
screaming horde of pre-teen girls in the audience to fill me in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Spice kept yelling at her,'' explained Samantha Galvis,
12, of Sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to tell her how much her fans are missing her,''
said her cousin, Jana Grounds, 10, of Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should all just invite her out to dinner,'' said Jana's
sister, Alyssa.
</P>
<P>
   On another blanket in the lawn area, the Ginger Question was
being discussed by three soon-to-be third graders from Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will be as cool as Ginger,'' said Katherine Ronan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear she's getting her own act,'' her friend Samantha Shoup
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should get her back by apologizing and stuff,'' Kylie
Bellisari said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, I was told that Ginger wanted to get spicier than the
other girls would allow. Then there was another girl that pinned it
on Posh Spice, who apparently is getting married. Or is that Sporty
Spice?
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend said that if you're sitting in the front row, you
can take Ginger's part in the show,'' Cara Axelrod, 8, of Davie
told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I heard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the straight story on the Spice Girls is about as tough
as ... well ... about as tough as getting the straight story out of
a group of young girls.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-hour before the show, hundreds of them were
streaming to the edge of the grassy lawn, screaming as they saw a
limousine full of what appeared to be Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fake Spice Girls,'' announced Andi Wandt, 10, of Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know they're fake?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell,'' she said. ``I know everything about the Spice
Girls. I even know their heights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, ``and did you know that Baby Spice went to
jail?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. She was naked in front of the Prince. Or the Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I heard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to finally hear the Spice Girls, the thousands
of little girls who had waited and sweated, and waited and sweated
some more, let out the screams they had been saving for what seemed
like an eternity.
</P>
<P>
   If Ginger was missed, it was hard to tell at first. But by
intermission, the little girls gathered in clusters, discussing the
enormity of being the first group in the world to evaluate the
Gingerless Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very pretty,'' Jamie Young, 11, of Delray Beach said.
``It's just different without her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The concert sounds different, but in in a good way,'' her
friend, Madeline Mowery, 11, said. ``But I don't really care what
they sound like, I just miss Ginger not being in the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginger still appeared in the video images of the group that were
displayed as a backdrop to the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't miss her,'' Jamie and Madeline's friend, Brittany
Westbrook, 11, boldly announced. ``She's probably getting married,
or living off her riches.''
</P>
<P>
   I have my own theory. I believe the former Spice Girl is not
really angry at Scary Spice. And, although I'm not really qualified
to opine about the marriage prospects of Sporty, or whether or not
Baby Spice mooned a member of the Royal Family, I do have an answer
for the Ginger Question.
</P>
<P>
   She's getting out of the music business to fly the Space Shuttle
for NASA. Yep, that's right.
</P>
<P>
   She's even getting her own astronaut name.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Space.
</P>
<P>
   Really?
</P>
<P>
   Um... well, that's what I heard.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Only in obsessive Washington D. C., endlessly
stewing in half-scandals and faux scandals, could the admission by
Kenneth Starr that he and his staff have leaked be heard as some
sort of thunderclap. (Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED. Eds: A bonus
column from Tom Teepen.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Flag Day is old, forgotten stuff, and the
observance of the Fourth of July centers mainly on giant sales of
nothing having to do with patriotism and everything having to do
with the filling of cash registers. Howard Kleinberg is a former
editor of the Miami News. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JASPER-COMMENTARY _ There was a time _ just a few days ago _
that when asked of my hometown, the talk took a long, explanatory
path. No longer, however, is such a long detailed description
needed of my hometown. For my hometown is Jasper, Texas, and most
have formed their own mental image of that little town buried deep
in the dark, brooding woods of East Texas. (Reetz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED 6/15.
</P>
<P>
   SKUBE-COLUMN _ Both white and black are at impasse, like spouses
who have had a falling out, neither wanting to give up the
marriage, both hoping the other will come forward in
reconciliation. Two people can live in the same house without
making a home together. Pulitzer winner Michael Skube's weekly
lifestyle commentary. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED
6/15.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ Imagine, a bright and dedicated woman leading a
congregation. The next thing you know, Texas will have a governor
with the forbidden chromosomes. When that happens, Baylor
University will obviously be at fault. Mark these words. (Young,
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In a recent column I had the
temerity to candidly notify Vice President Gore that he was full of
baloney. ``Hooking kids up to the Internet is not the universal

   CERABINO-COLUMN _ For a while that night, I felt what it was
like to hold the answer to the question gripping not only a nation,
but perhaps the entire world. ``Is Ginger Spice here?'' they
repeatedly asked. ``No,'' I answered sagely, knowing for the first
time what it must feel like to be Kenneth Starr. For I had seen the
Spice Girls hours before the recent sold out show at Coral Sky
Amphiteatre in Florida, the opening concert of their world tour,
and I had only counted four girls ... Baby Spice, Scary Spice,
Sneezy and Zeppo. (Cerabino, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FLORIDA-HEAT _ Florida temperatures continued to break records
with nary a drop of water in the sky, leaving some farmers,
ranchers and water managers thinking about the dreaded ``D'' word:
Drought. Perhaps just in time, meteorologists at the South Florida
Water Management District say they hope for rain. They don't know

potential havoc that two other amphibian enthusiasts would visit on
Austin 52 years later in defense of the salamander. The salamander,
with considerable help from Alan Hamilton and Robert Barnhart and a
ruling from a federal judge, could cause the closure of all or most
of Barton Springs for the summer, just as temperatures are soaring
over the century mark. (Wear, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Human contact might be the answer, not computers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Elizabeth Schuett
</P>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. In a recent column I had the temerity to
candidly notify Vice President Gore that he was full of baloney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooking kids up to the Internet is not the universal remedy
for what ails education,'' I wrote. Then I sat back and waited for
Bill Gates,
</P>
<P>
   AOL, or at least the CIA to put a tap on my e-mail and maybe
even set up surveillance on my snail-mailbox. But that's not what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mail both ``e'' and ``snail,'' brought yea-sayers
with their own take on the problem. A reader in Spokane writes:
``'Gore hyping
</P>
<P>
   a general protection fault' appearing in our local Spokesman
Review was excellent. I hope a copy went to Gore. I'll send mine.
The 'E-Rate' (the
</P>
<P>
   hidden levy) is what Gore instigated on our phone bills.''
</P>
<P>
   A school board member in Vermont pleads for perspective. ``I
just finished reading your commentary titled `Computers are not
teachers' in
</P>
<P>
   the Rutland Herald. I am a school board member and chairman of
our district school board. I applaud your commentary and only wish
that more
</P>
<P>
   board members, teachers, politicians, parents and taxpayers felt
the way you do. I am fighting a losing battle here in Vermont in
trying to keep
</P>
<P>
   computers in perspective. Whenever I voice my concerns I am
labeled a reactionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reassuring to find out that I am not alone in thinking
that computers are not going to `fix what's broke' in our schools.
Even
</P>
<P>
   though, I am afraid the train is moving and nothing will stop
it, it is comforting to know that others are as concerned as I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Eaton, a teacher in Snohomish, Wash. e-mails: ``Right on.
After thirty years in the classroom at junior high I learned the
value of
</P>
<P>
   human contact. Computers are a great editing tool and number
organizer, but they offer no `hands in the soil' satisfaction. Who
values the
</P>
<P>
   garden more? Is it the gardener or the person who hires the
gardener?
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught math for sixteen years and came to realize the memory
destroying power of the calculator in a young student's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Calculators are great work savers for those who understand the
math, but they cannot enhance any understanding. Far too many of my
students
</P>
<P>
   became `math crippled' when faced with doing their own
calculations. The students' attitudes became a `let's just get (it)
done' mind set....
</P>
<P>
   Many students cry out for personal interaction and educators
give them a machine. It is no wonder so many students lack the
interpersonal skills
</P>
<P>
   needed for working in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   In a postscript, Mel admits: ``Spell checkers sure help
borderline spellers like me. I appreciate them because of my
struggle to learn to
</P>
<P>
   spell.'' But he wisely asks, ``Is the real learning in the
struggle as well as the accomplishments?''
</P>
<P>
   Karlheinz Halter in Torrance, Calif. writes thanking me for my
``thoughtful article'' in the Long Beach Press-Telegram. ``Most of
our
</P>
<P>
   so-called leaders are not yet really aware that `The Internet
can't replace a good teacher'. Parents,'' he states, ``have given
up on their
</P>
<P>
   duties (and rights) by using television as a replacement for
nourishing care, and now...educators are replacing `manual labor'
and dedicated
</P>
<P>
   personal attention with yet another electronic gimmick to pacify
curious youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense,'' he warns, ``tells us (and Paine did too) to
think, and to be careful, what we accept as truth, and also to be
sure we
</P>
<P>
   understand its meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   From Manhattan, Kan., John Morrill responds to excerpts from a
teacher's letter I quoted in an earlier column on the built-in
</P>
<P>
   shortcomings of a school system ``teaching to the test
(proficiency).''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the teachers you quote reflect your views,'' he writes,
``then we share in common concerns such as empowering teachers,
(about) raising
</P>
<P>
   standards while avoiding competency testing, (about) teaching to
the tests, and (about) feel-good stuff that administrators and
school
</P>
<P>
   shrinks like to boast of that has turned teaching into a
farce.''
</P>
<P>
   There we have it folks. We're concerned, we care, but too many
of us, I'm thinking, keep quiet about it. That's no way to change
things.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Lucy's advice to Charlie Brown: ``It's the squeaky
wheel that gets the grease.''
</P>
<P>
   So get in there and NAG! Demand your very own squirt of WD-40.

   Commentary: A woman pastor, heaven forbid
</P>
<P>
   By John Young
</P>
<P>
   C.1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I'd never thought of it before, but I should have
worried about Baylor University's influence on this city when I
first noticed that it had street lights.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that most cities have them, even though there's no
biblical mandate for street lights. But most cities are dens of
wickedness and beyond saving. Waco _ surely Waco could have been
spared these forces of the night.
</P>
<P>
   There are references to ``light'' and ``lamps'' in the Good
Book, but nothing literal and electrified like street lights. And
for good reason. Light streets at night and someone will walk on
them. It is foretold.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the telephone and electric lines that link our
despoiled city. Link homes with phone lines and you'll have gossip
and plotting. Share electricity and people will be up all night
doing who-knows-what in Waco. And the fact is, gossip aside, we
don't know what. And it's Baylor's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's unfair to blame Baylor for every corrupting influence
in our city. But reading the words of a Southern Baptist Conference
official, to some conclusions we are impelled to jump.
</P>
<P>
   The official is Dr. Richard Land, president of the SBC's Ethics
and Religious Liberty Commission. He was sharing with a (IT)Dallas
Morning News(RO) reporter recently his disappointment that Waco,
specifically Waco's Calvary Baptist Church, was where the first
woman in Texas had been appointed senior pastor _ Julie
Pennington-Russell.
</P>
<P>
   With apparent sadness, Land acknowledged that Waco is a lost
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised that if it's going to happen, it happens in
Waco, because of the influence of Baylor, which I don't think is a
good influence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but Land may have something
there. Even I wrote at the time that Baylor's flirtation with its
first-ever campus dance _ temptation to which it would later cave _
was emblematic of creeping Presbyterianization, a condition that
clearly had befallen all of Texas. After all, I'd just paid to see
the Rolling Stones in the Cotton Bowl and, well, who'd have thought
such seepage would ever exceed Austin city limits?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it happened. And so we are wilderness-cast.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, a bright and dedicated woman leading a congregation.
The next thing you know, Texas will have a governor with the
forbidden chromosomes. When that happens, Baylor will be at fault.
Mark these words.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor will try to deflect blame _ try to claim it's a
university with a scriptural soul. But its refusal to be held by
fundamentalist keepers like Dr. Land, and its treating of
moderation as some kind of virtue, will haunt it, and Waco with it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want further evidence of hard-and-fast rules broken in
this city, look no further than another Baptist church _ Spring
Street Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was an all-white church which died out. Then it became
an all-black church. Now heirs of the all-white flock and members
of the all-black flock are talking about a relationship that would
include both colors.
</P>
<P>
   As flocks go, there would go the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is wrong to pin any of these developments on Baylor.
Maybe Baylor, like Dr. Land, is standing back with jawbone low as
incessant tolerance and deviation have their way on the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Land should rest assured, however, that not all of Waco is
so ravaged. There's still rigidity in this city we call home.
There's still inerrancy. There are still backs bowed against that
which man must fear above all: change.
</P>
<P>
   But with light posts and phone lines strung everywhere,
vigilance is costing us some sleep.

CARDINALS ADD MORE TIGHT ENDS TO ROSTER

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Tight end suddenly has become a crowded position
for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-round draft pick  &UR; Terry Hardy signed a one-year deal
Monday, the same day former Cardinal  &UR; Jarius Hayes, who had been
playing in the NFL Europe League, returned to the team.
</P>
<P>
   The signings of Hardy and Hayes give the Cardinals five tight
ends going into next month's training camp. They join veterans
 &UR; Chris Gedney and
 &UR; Johnny McWilliams and rookie  &UR; Eli Workman, an undrafted free agent
from Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are expected to have three tight ends on their
active roster at the start of the regular season, with Gedney and
McWilliams expected to fill two of the spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wide open, all the way,'' tight ends coach  &UR; Hank
Kuhlmann said. &QL; 
Hardy is the fifth draft pick to sign, joining fourth-round
choice &UR; Michael Pittman, Fresno State running back; sixth-round pick
 &UR; Zack Walz, Dartmouth linebacker; and seventh-round picks  &UR; Jomo
Cousins, Florida A&AMP;M defensive end, and  &UR; Ron Janes, Missouri
fullback. &QL; 
No longer a spectator
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, who played at Southern Mississippi, participated in his
first rookie camp workout Monday and then acknowledged he will have
to have surgery on his injured left shoulder after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the season, I plan on having it operated on, but I'm not
worried about playing on it because I've done it,'' said Hardy, who
first injured the shoulder against Florida State two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials wouldn't let Hardy practice last week while he
was unsigned because of the risk of him reinjuring his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals doctors discovered Hardy had a slightly torn rotator
cuff when he had a physical examination at last month's minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's healthy enough to practice,'' Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said.
``Whether he has a chance to reinjure (the shoulder) remains to be
seen. Eventually we will have to do something about the shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual for a draft pick to sign only a one-year contract.
Both sides realized they couldn't agree on a multiyear deal because
of Hardy's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a one-year deal,'' said Hardy's agent,  &UR; Ivory
Chandler. ``We were going back and forth on a two-year deal, and
then I left it totally up to Terry. He felt at this time this was
the best thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed, but those close to the negotiations
said Hardy received a smaller signing bonus because of the contract
being for only one year.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy isn't disappointed that he signed only a one-year deal and
will have to reopen negotiations next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel blessed just to be part of this, participating in an
NFL camp,'' he said. ``I feel bad about standing around last week,
not working. I need to get in shape. I feel I have a chance to
contribute.'' &QL; 
Seeing the world
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, a 1996 seventh-round draft pick of the Cardinals, was
supposed to play in the World League last year for Barcelona, but
the team sent him home because he suffered a left foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   He was healthy in time for training camp but was released by the
Cardinals in late August.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Amsterdam Admirals of the Europe League in the
spring and was used primarily as a blocking tight end. He had five
catches for 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I've gotten better,'' he said. ``I improved as a
blocker and a receiver. I needed experience and playing time and
got both.''
</P>
<P>
   He also saw enough of the Dutch lifestyle to know it isn't for
him. Prostitution is legal and pornography is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very wild place,'' he said. ``You have to watch
yourself and keep yourself out of trouble.'' &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Former Oregon defensive tackle  &UR; Desmond Byrd (6-3, 300) signed
Monday after a tryout earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a scheduling conflict, wide receiver  &UR; Rob
 &UR; Moore will replace  &UR; Frank Sanders at Saturday's Minicamp for Kids.
The free clinic will be held from 9 a.m. until noon at the team's
Tempe training complex. &QL;

`X' MARKS THE PLOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Resending for Santa Barbara)  
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Strange. Alarming. Like nothing they could have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the guys responsible for TV's hit supernatural drama ``The
X-Files'' sure wandered into an unknown universe when they decided
to make a movie based on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Set somewhere between the recently completed fifth season and
the new episodes that start airing in the fall, ``The X-Files''
movie is a $70 million, two-hour version of the misadventures of
Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, the FBI agents charged with
investigating all things paranormal and paranoiac.
</P>
<P>
   Starring series regulars David Duchovny as the
I-want-to-believer and Gillian Anderson as the
objectivity-challenged skeptic, the movie was co-written and
produced by series creator Chris Carter and directed by Rob Bowman,
who has helmed 25 ``X'' TV episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick was not to make it too different from the show, but
to also make a movie that was accessible to people who didn't watch
the show every week,'' explains Carter, a tanned, sun-blond
41-year-old who looks like he worked 13 years for Surfing magazine.
``We had to avoid alienating the hard-core fan, not bore him by
reillustrating the world in which Mulder and Scully exist. I hope
we've been successful at that; it was the trickiest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true ... writer-producer. According to Bowman, who
made his feature directing debut with the forgotten teen picture
``Airborne,'' making the comparatively cinematic TV show fit for
movie theaters required wholesale rethinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take the essence of what we had done on TV and
just put it on the big screen,'' Bowman explains. ``But there are
requirements for those two media that just innately mean that you
do different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the size of the image matters; you cannot shoot two
hours of close-ups and expect to get away with it. The pacing of
the editing can be slower _ cuts have more impact, since it's not
just the little box that changes, but the whole wall that jumps.
Your locations become much more important because they're huge now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for characterizations, we just took what we built and tried
to make 'em look like movie stars, make them fill the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   For Duchovny, who's enjoyed a steady if not quite stellar film
career (``Beethoven,'' ``Kalifornia,'' ``Playing God'') alongside
TV superstardom, adjusting Mulder was a matter of fine calibrations
_ and some good liquor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really approach the movie as being different from the
show,'' Duchovny says. ``You know, it is the same character, and I
wanted to do justice to that. It wasn't like it was my Vegas
routine, like, `OK, here's the big stage, so I'm gonna show you
some real interesting tricks.' In fact, I wanted it, if anything,
less on a bigger screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a good percentage of the 20 million to 30 million
people who tune in the Fox network series on Sunday nights can be
counted on to show up for the movie, the unfamiliar still have to
be oriented as to what was going on with the complex mythology
that's built up over the course of 117 episodes. They also need to
be clued in on Mulder's obsession with extraterrestrials and the
powerful conspiracy that seems to be hiding their existence.
</P>
<P>
   But do true X-philes want to hear all that again? Probably not,
unless it's funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to do this fun scene in a bar where I've had too much to
drink and am pouring out my troubles to the bartender,'' Duchovny
says. ``That way, I got to introduce the character to people who
didn't know him _ without insulting those who did. It's good that
the character was drunk, and I put a burp in there at the end; I
don't know if they used it.''
</P>
<P>
   We're not going to tell. And even if we did, it might not be the
same when you see the movie. Carter and company have a way of
disinforming both casual viewers and ardent investigators. To keep
the revelations of ``The X-Files'' movie secret, script pages were
printed on noncopyable red paper, a key scene was not written and
filmed until this spring (most of the movie was shot during the
series' summer hiatus last year), and dummy scenes that were never
meant to be filmed were disseminated over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real paranoid about plot leaks,'' Carter admits. ``I
provided lots of opportunities for misinformation; if you put
enough bogus information out there, it starts to work for you and
against itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Isn't this what the government/international
creeps/interplanetary weirdos do in most episodes of ``X-Files,''
and the kind of deviousness our heroes Mulder and Scully are
forever crusading against?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there are some things that should be kept secret,'' says
Carter, refusing to acknowledge the irony. ``I'm not devious.
You've just got to be clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we think we can tell you about the movie: It starts
in 35,000 B.C. Texas, when it was very cold there. It climaxes in
modern-day Antarctica, which looks a lot like Texas did 37,000
years ago. A building gets bombed, Scully gets abducted and
experimented with for the umpteenth time, the Black Oil is sort of
explained, a semi-recurring character seems to actually die, and
the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) has something to do
with everything.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Mulder and Scully finally ... Well, like most things
``X-Files,'' what Mulder and Scully do remains inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   There was more, at one time, for devoted followers to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, there was mention of Mulder's sister, Samantha,
in the movie,'' Carter reveals. (As a child, Mulder saw her
abducted by what appeared to be aliens, and his need to know what
became of her drives both the character and the series' mythology.)
``But we decided to take that information out. We felt that that
was less important to the movie than the series, and it tripped you
up if you didn't quite understand all its implications. It was one
morsel of information too many to digest in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another thing I learned about making movies,'' Carter
continues. ``You try to take out any inessential ingredients as you
go through and put it together. As a viewer, you don't want
anything that is not perfectly integral to the whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Some big questions are still out there. Like, will enough
nonfans come to theaters to make a series of ``X-Files'' movies
viable?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just don't watch television, and a lot of those
people do go to the movies on Friday or Saturday night,'' Carter
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to tell,'' a more skeptical Duchovny admits.
``I don't think you need to know the characters or the history of
the show to enjoy this. I would say it's a big, smart, thrilling
movie that's fun to watch _ if you like smart, thrilling movies,
which apparently some people do hate.''
</P>
<P>
   If the film does enough business to justify sequels, then wither
the series? Duchovny, Anderson and Carter are each signed up for at
least two more seasons, but the actors, at least, would prefer to
reopen ``The X-Files'' on a less strenuous,
feature-every-couple-of-years timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked playing Scully, and making the show has
always been fun,'' Anderson confirms. But the Emmy-winning actress
would also like to be able to spend more time with her young
daughter and take more advantage of the many movie offers that are
coming her way. ``From the writing to the cinematography to the
co-stars, just as a whole, the show works so tightly and so well.
But I like the scenario of being involved in a movie franchise that
gets us together every few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny has been more vocal about his problems with series TV's
demands. He's complained about the punishing schedule and
threatened to leave the show last season unless its production
location was moved from more cost-effective Vancouver to L.A. so he
could be closer to his wife, actress Tea Leoni.
</P>
<P>
   The ``X-Files'' movie was shot here, and the show relocates to
Southern California beginning with the sixth season. But that won't
solve the basic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really the show, or Mulder,'' Duchovny says. ``It's
just the bare fact of doing the same part. It's been five years. If
you were in a series called `Hamlet' for five years, it would be
the same thing. I would be tired of getting my mother to admit that
she had slept with my uncle, just as I'm tired of shaking the
Cigarette-Smoking Man and telling him to admit he slept with my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, maybe it is `Hamlet'!'' the actor cracks. ``Maybe I'm
happy to be on the show! The show will go on. The movies will go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter seems the most optimistic about the show and the film
franchise's future _ which, by some logic, you can afford to be
when you're the world's most successful marketer of paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some apprehension about the move to Los Angeles, but
I'm happy about it because it provides me with interesting problems
to solve and creates opportunities to shoot things I couldn't have
in Vancouver,'' Carter says. ``And, coming on the tail of the
movie, it's going to be a fresh start for the series. I will always
be interested in television, because there are things you can do
there that you can't do in feature films, stories that don't take a
big-screen approach. But it is a matter of stamina. It's such
grueling, grinding, hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a point when you go into features because you
just don't have the energy for TV anymore,'' Carter reckons. ``And
I have been working in a vacuum of sorts, just doing television
shows. I get the Nielsen ratings, I know how many people appreciate
the show. But there's nothing like walking into a theater and
seeing the instant reaction of people.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As of early January, Mike Nick was an unknown, just a stocky
21-year-old who could do crazy tricks like aerial spins and flips
on short, fat planks that resemble miniature snowboards. Then he
won the first-ever skiboarding contest at the winter X Games in
Crested Butte, Colo., and he was mobbed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen ringed him slopeside, and the announcer for ESPN _ which
produces the X Games and broadcasts the alternative-sports Olympics
on its two cable TV channels _ informed a million-plus viewers that
Nick, a junior at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,
was now ``the sensation of rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear the cash registers going ka-ching.
</P>
<P>
   Skiboarding, a sport that didn't even exist until 1995, had
suddenly become legitimate. A six-stop professional skiboarding
tour has been organized for next year; Nick's sponsor, Line
Skiboards of Albany, N.Y., instantly doubled its production staff.
And now a host of entrepreneurs are slouching toward San Diego, in
hopes of emulating Line's smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth annual Summer X Games will open at San Diego's
Mariner's Point Friday, June 19, offering 10 days of manic
athleticism and unceasing commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   In-line skaters and barefoot water-ski jumpers will flail
beneath the banners of Taco Bell and the U.S. Marine Corps, each of
which paid more than a million dollars to become an X Games ``gold
sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators will sip free Mountain Dew (thanks to its maker's
gold status) and promoters of fledging sports like mountainboarding
(think skateboarding on dirt) will work the sidelines, trying to
garner inclusion in next summer's X.
</P>
<P>
   While high-risk, attitude-laden extreme sports like
skateboarding might have once been about having fun and busting
free of the confining rules of traditional sports, they are now
increasingly about money.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-industries sprout up around each nascent sport the moment
it's born, and the manufacturers, tour promoters and impresarios of
Web sites like www.snakeboarding.com all desperately need ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The summer and winter X Games, begun in 1995 and 1997, are by
far the world's best-known alternative-sports festivals. And
because the people tuning in to ingest the games' smorgasbord of
street lugeing to bicycle stunt riding are, quite often, young men
willing to risk their own necks, ESPN holds the power to make a
sport chic.
</P>
<P>
   Consider snowmobiling. When snowmobiling made its debut at this
year's winter X, Men's Journal magazine rhapsodized, ``Forget the
old stereotype of dirty-fingered, chain-smoking rural gearheads.
Snowmobiling has gone sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed quite possible that top snowmobilers would soon be
negotiating million-dollar endorsement contracts. After all, Shaun
White, the nation's foremost 11-year-old snowboarder, has a
publicist _ a fact that is emblematic of how far extreme has
strayed.
</P>
<P>
   The genre of extreme sports takes its cues from early 1980s
California skate punk culture, which proved that you could still be
a gnarly athlete even if you had spiky green hair.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a progenitor of extreme, it is Jay Adams, an almost
mythic Venice Beach skate god who had a shaved head and a tattoo
that read ``Team Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said in a magazine article that he smoked marijuana
voraciously, reveled in fistfighting and hopped fences to ride
empty swimming pools. But he rose to prominence at roughly the same
time as MTV, and it was inevitable that the rebel spirit he
exemplified would be co-opted.
</P>
<P>
   It happened finally in 1993, when Ron Semiao, the program
director for ESPN's hipper offshoot, ESPN2, stepped into a
stationery store looking for, as he described it, ``the Sports
Illustrated of extreme sports.'' To his surprise, there was no such
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But there were scores of specialty magazines catering to
everyone from health-conscious rock climbers to corn-dog-eating
skate rats.
</P>
<P>
   Semiao bought every one of the magazines, and then reflected
that AT&AMP;T, Old Spice deodorant and Ricoh copiers were all using
extreme sports images to advertise to twentysomething consumers. If
he could unify the magazines' myriad subcultures ``from the top
down,'' he thought he would strike gold. So he envisioned the X
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Semiao said he favors sports that ``have a whole culture
attached to them, a specific attitude and a group of people who
live and die for that sport.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose skiboarding, he said, because its 20,000 or so American
practitioners are strong rivals of snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ESPN's treatment that made the sport sing to viewers.
The network's coverage in January was wonderful eye candy, a
spectacle replete with splashy graphics, lightning-quick interviews
and even stage direction: ESPN's producers had Mike Nick make his
first-ever attempt at a 1440, a quadruple aerial spin, on his last
run. The announcer crowed, ``Expect the spectacular!'' Nick whirled
and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   It was ESPN at its best. Even more than the Olympics, the X
Games are ultimately about theatrics and bathos. And in the spirit
of the best TV dramas, they deliver poignant moments.
</P>
<P>
   The X moment, as it might be called, is soul stirring yet
somehow subversive. At last summer's games, for instance, we saw
skateboarders thumping their boards axelike on a ramp as the fading
skate legend Tony Hawk twisted through what the announcers deemed
``the greatest run of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all enough to make skeptics like Kevin Thatcher feel sick.
Thatcher is the publisher of Thrasher, a San Francisco-based
skateboard magazine founded in 1981, and a friend of Jay Adams (who
has now retreated to Hawaii, where he repairs surfboards for a
living). He was invited to oversee the skateboarding contests at
the first X Games, but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV flattens skateboarding into one big ad,'' he said. ``You
can't truly capture it unless you take the TV cameras away, close
off a street and just let the kids go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher might be right, but he's not about to stop Semiao.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these insider magazines feel a moral obligation to
trash the X Games because ESPN is a large corporation,'' Semiao
said. ``But when I see more kids buying skateboards, and more
skaters doing ads for Pepsi and AT&AMP;T, I think, that's a good thing.
There's nothing wrong with it.''

</P>
<P>
   It's all enough to make skeptics like Kevin Thatcher feel sick.
Thatcher is the publisher of Thrasher, a San Francisco-based
skateboard magazine founded in 1981, and a friend of Jay Adams (who
has now retreated to Hawaii, where he repairs surfboards for a
living). He was invited to oversee the skateboarding contests at
the first X Games, but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV flattens skateboarding into one big ad,'' he said. ``You
can't truly capture it unless you take the TV cameras away, close
off a street and just let the kids go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher might be right, but he's not about to stop Semiao.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these insider magazines feel a moral obligation to
trash the X Games because ESPN is a large corporation,'' Semiao
said. ``But when I see more kids buying skateboards, and more
skaters doing ads for Pepsi and AT&AMP;T, I think, that's a good thing.
There's nothing wrong with it.''

   As of early January, Mike Nick was an unknown, just a stocky
21-year-old who could do crazy tricks like aerial spins and flips
on short, fat planks that resemble miniature snowboards. Then he
won the first-ever skiboarding contest at the winter X Games in
Crested Butte, Colo., and he was mobbed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen ringed him slopeside, and the announcer for ESPN _ which
produces the X Games and broadcasts the alternative-sports Olympics
on its two cable TV channels _ informed a million-plus viewers that
Nick, a junior at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,
was now ``the sensation of rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear the cash registers going ka-ching.
</P>
<P>
   Skiboarding, a sport that didn't even exist until 1995, had
suddenly become legitimate. A six-stop professional skiboarding
tour has been organized for next year; Nick's sponsor, Line
Skiboards of Albany, N.Y., instantly doubled its production staff.
And now a host of entrepreneurs are slouching toward San Diego, in
hopes of emulating Line's smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth annual Summer X Games will open at San Diego's
Mariner's Point Friday, June 19, offering 10 days of manic
athleticism and unceasing commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   In-line skaters and barefoot water-ski jumpers will flail
beneath the banners of Taco Bell and the U.S. Marine Corps, each of
which paid more than a million dollars to become an X Games ``gold
sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators will sip free Mountain Dew (thanks to its maker's
gold status) and promoters of fledging sports like mountainboarding
(think skateboarding on dirt) will work the sidelines, trying to
garner inclusion in next summer's X.
</P>
<P>
   While high-risk, attitude-laden extreme sports like
skateboarding might have once been about having fun and busting
free of the confining rules of traditional sports, they are now
increasingly about money.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-industries sprout up around each nascent sport the moment
it's born, and the manufacturers, tour promoters and impresarios of
Web sites like www.snakeboarding.com all desperately need ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The summer and winter X Games, begun in 1995 and 1997, are by
far the world's best-known alternative-sports festivals. And
because the people tuning in to ingest the games' smorgasbord of
street lugeing to bicycle stunt riding are, quite often, young men
willing to risk their own necks, ESPN holds the power to make a
sport chic.
</P>
<P>
   Consider snowmobiling. When snowmobiling made its debut at this
year's winter X, Men's Journal magazine rhapsodized, ``Forget the
old stereotype of dirty-fingered, chain-smoking rural gearheads.
Snowmobiling has gone sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed quite possible that top snowmobilers would soon be
negotiating million-dollar endorsement contracts. After all, Shaun
White, the nation's foremost 11-year-old snowboarder, has a
publicist _ a fact that is emblematic of how far extreme has
strayed.
</P>
<P>
   The genre of extreme sports takes its cues from early 1980s
California skate punk culture, which proved that you could still be
a gnarly athlete even if you had spiky green hair.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a progenitor of extreme, it is Jay Adams, an almost
mythic Venice Beach skate god who had a shaved head and a tattoo
that read ``Team Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said in a magazine article that he smoked marijuana
voraciously, reveled in fistfighting and hopped fences to ride
empty swimming pools. But he rose to prominence at roughly the same
time as MTV, and it was inevitable that the rebel spirit he
exemplified would be co-opted.
</P>
<P>
   It happened finally in 1993, when Ron Semiao, the program
director for ESPN's hipper offshoot, ESPN2, stepped into a
stationery store looking for, as he described it, ``the Sports
Illustrated of extreme sports.'' To his surprise, there was no such
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But there were scores of specialty magazines catering to
everyone from health-conscious rock climbers to corn-dog-eating
skate rats.
</P>
<P>
   Semiao bought every one of the magazines, and then reflected
that AT&AMP;T, Old Spice deodorant and Ricoh copiers were all using
extreme sports images to advertise to twentysomething consumers. If
he could unify the magazines' myriad subcultures ``from the top
down,'' he thought he would strike gold. So he envisioned the X
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Semiao said he favors sports that ``have a whole culture
attached to them, a specific attitude and a group of people who
live and die for that sport.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose skiboarding, he said, because its 20,000 or so American
practitioners are strong rivals of snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ESPN's treatment that made the sport sing to viewers.
The network's coverage in January was wonderful eye candy, a
spectacle replete with splashy graphics, lightning-quick interviews
and even stage direction: ESPN's producers had Mike Nick make his
first-ever attempt at a 1440, a quadruple aerial spin, on his last
run. The announcer crowed, ``Expect the spectacular!'' Nick whirled
and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   It was ESPN at its best. Even more than the Olympics, the X
Games are ultimately about theatrics and bathos. And in the spirit
of the best TV dramas, they deliver poignant moments.
</P>
<P>
   The X moment, as it might be called, is soul stirring yet
somehow subversive. At last summer's games, for instance, we saw
skateboarders thumping their boards axelike on a ramp as the fading
skate legend Tony Hawk twisted through what the announcers deemed
``the greatest run of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all enough to make skeptics like Kevin Thatcher feel sick.
Thatcher is the publisher of Thrasher, a San Francisco-based
skateboard magazine founded in 1981, and a friend of Jay Adams (who
has now retreated to Hawaii, where he repairs surfboards for a
living). He was invited to oversee the skateboarding contests at
the first X Games, but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV flattens skateboarding into one big ad,'' he said. ``You
can't truly capture it unless you take the TV cameras away, close
off a street and just let the kids go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher might be right, but he's not about to stop Semiao.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these insider magazines feel a moral obligation to
trash the X Games because ESPN is a large corporation,'' Semiao
said. ``But when I see more kids buying skateboards, and more
skaters doing ads for Pepsi and AT&AMP;T, I think, that's a good thing.
There's nothing wrong with it.''

MAN OFF HOOK FOR KILLING WOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A camper who shot and killed an endangered Mexican gray wolf was
within his rights because he believed his family was in danger,
federal authorities announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service not to
prosecute left environmentalists fearing more wolves will be
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The camper, who authorities refused to identify, shot the wolf
April 28 in the Apache National Forest, north of Clifton, where he
had camped the night before with his wife, two children and two
dogs, said Hans Stuart, spokesman for Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   After twice either seeing the wolves or hearing them howl, and
after once scaring the wolves away with yells of his own, the
camper heard yipping and thrashing in some nearby brush, Stuart
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the man went to investigate, the camper saw one wolf run
off and another wolf standing about 50 feet away from him, Stuart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, fearing that the wolf would attack him or his family,
shot the animal, tracked it down and shot it again, though
subsequent tests showed the first shot would have been fatal,
Stuart said.
</P>
<P>
   After killing the wolf, the camper found that one of his dogs
had been bitten and one of its legs broken, injuries later
determined to be inflicted by a wolf, Stuart said.
</P>
<P>
   Though it would have been illegal for the camper to kill the
wolf to protect his dogs, it is legal to kill any animal if it
might harm someone, Stuart said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the camper will not be prosecuted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart said he could not say what kind of rifle the camper used
to kill the wolf, nor what, if anything, the wolf did to make the
camper believe it might attack.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were outraged by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the camper used poor judgment, that he should not
have taken dogs into wolf country and that he should have moved his
family after the first encounter if he was worried.
</P>
<P>
   There is no documented case of a wild, healthy wolf ever
attacking a person this century in North America, they said. And,
no wolf has ever been shot by people fearing they would be attacked
at reintroduction sites in Wyoming, Idaho and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence that a century's worth of history was even
remotely close to being rewritten,'' said Robin Silver, a Phoenix
doctor and endangered-species activist.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists predicted that other wolves will be killed and
other people will give the same reason to avoid prosecution, which
could mean up to a year in prison and a fine of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Miller of Defenders of Wildlife said out-of-season deer
killed by hunters receive more protection than that afforded the
wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear from the facts that the wolf was not
attacking him, and the individual was reacting to his fear of what
the wolf might do,'' said Miller, whose national environmental
group has pledged to compensate ranchers for the loss of cattle. So
far, there have been no cattle lost in Arizona, though one dog has
been replaced by Miller's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this project is going to succeed, eventually we need to get
over what we fear wolves might do and start treating them according
to what their real behavior is, which is extremely different than
what our myths and legends have taught us,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People and wolves can coexist, but that's going to require
tolerance and respect for the law. People who break that public
trust should be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart said federal officials take the killing of wolves
seriously, will thoroughly investigate any wolf killing and will
prosecute anyone who illegally kills a wolf.
</P>
<P>
   The wolf killed by the camper was one of 11 wolves returned to
the wilds of Arizona earlier this year for the first time in nearly
three decades. After he was killed, the wolf's mate was captured
and taken to a caged federal wildlife sanctuary in New Mexico. She
gave birth to one pup, which was found dead of unknown causes
Monday, Stuart said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other wolves who wandered from their packs also have been
recaptured, leaving only seven wolves still in the wild. &QL;

 YOUTH TO REJUVENATE OUR AILING NATIONAL PARKS  (EDITOR'S NOTE:

<P>
   National Park Service Director Robert Stanton promised to
involve more young people in the park system when he accepted the
top parks job last year. This month, he took a giant step toward
keeping that promise.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last August, Stanton said, `I believe it's
critically important that we work with youth-serving organizations
... to give our youth the opportunity to experience their own
national parks ... It helps them to become better citizens in terms
of greater appreciation of their own natural and cultural
heritage.`
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, the NPS kicked off a Public Land Corps Youth Program
with restoration work on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National
Historic Park in Maryland. Fifty young people from the Student
Conservation Association and the Montgomery County Conservation
Corps began clearing out the woody vegetation from culverts and
locks of the canal. And this is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In this first year, more than $3 million has been committed for
much needed maintenance projects in our national parks. This year
nearly 100 national parks will be involved in the program that will
rebuild trails, restore campgrounds and cabins, and remove
non-native vegetation and trash from campsites.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Stanton commented on the new program:
`This is a tremendous opportunity to expand the involvement of
young people in conservation, resource preservation, and
maintenance work in our parks.`
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money for the program comes from the recreational
fee demonstration program that allows the National Park Service to
retain revenues generated _ to be used for repairs and maintenance
projects. The recreational fee program, according to Stanton, will
generate an estimated $135 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   `We wanted to actively engage other youth-serving organizations
in a partnership, in which they could bring their expertise, their
leadership skills, as well as some of their resources to the park
programs,` Stanton said. `For each park there is a partnership
organization involved. For example, in Yellowstone National Park
(Wyo.) we will have young people working on projects and they will
be recruited by and supervised by the Montana Conservation Corps.
</P>
<P>
   `We envision this as long term _ to continue to involve the
young people in the Public Land Corps ... work that is commensurate
with the capabilities of the young people _ doing trail
rehabilitation, sign rehabilitation, and other maintenance work
that is critically important, but lends itself to a day-to-day
staff as opposed to a major contract. The program gives us an
opportunity to match up the need with the capability of the young
people.`
</P>
<P>
   In Yellowstone, one Public Land Corps project will restore and
reroute DeLacy Creek Trail, one of the most heavily used hiking
trails in the park. The condition of the trail has seriously
deteriorated over the years. Hikers using the trail in the spring
when parts of it are under creek water end up tramping and
destroying sensitive wetlands areas.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of June, an eight person crew from the Montana
Conservation Corps will be working alongside and supervised by a
NPS trail crew to relocate the trail away from DeLacy Creek and
important riparian areas. The project is scheduled to take no more
than six weeks to complete.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of other PLC projects scheduled for
Yellowstone _ restoration and stabilization of campgrounds and
other trails and repairing or removing fences _ in partnership with
the Student Conservation Association and the Youth Conservation
Corps.
</P>
<P>
   PLC projects in 40 states and the District of Columbia will
begin this month _ including restoration and repair projects in
Redwood National Park (Calif.), Grand Canyon National Park (Ariz.),
Dinosaur National Monument (Colo.), Craters of the Moon National
Monument (Idaho), Glacier National Park (Mont.), Bryce Canyon
National Park (Utah), Blue Ridge Parkway (Va.), and Mount Rainier
National Park (Wash.).
</P>
<P>
   Youth from the Sitka Tribe will repair eroded trails in the
Sitka National Historic Park in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Eight students from the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps will work to
reconstruct eroded trails in the Rocky Mountain National Park in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   A community service group called the Juvenile Diversion Program,
aimed at preventing youth crime and violence in small Colorado
towns, will help fight the spread of non-native vegetation in the
Great Sand Dunes National Monument by pulling the exotic plants out
by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from the Youth Conservation Corps will assist in
restoring an historic cabin in Yosemite National Park's back
country in California.
</P>
<P>
   Youth corps query national parks nearby to find out what backlog
maintenance or restoration needs to be done. Corps officials write
grant requests for PLC funding for a particular work project in the
national park. If the request is authorized, the youth corps then
accepts volunteers and supervises them under the direction of park
rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Each youth group in the PLC partnership pays its student workers
differently _ some only pay living expenses, then after the work is
completed, an educational stipend of nearly $5,000 for a year
commitment or half that for a six-month commitment. But there are
youth programs that pay minimum wage for participating in
conservation projects that last only four to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand young people from the ages of 16 to 20 will
participate in helping restore our national parks this year. While
that number is relatively small, it is only the beginning of a new
kind of investment in our youth and in our national parks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bold move that highlights the best spirit of our youth
and entrusts the future of one of the great heritages of this
nation to their willing and able hands.

`STAR TREK' BOLDLY INSPIRES GENERATIONS OF TERRANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Also filed in ``e'' category)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAM HURWITT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's quite possibly the most famous split
infinitive in the English language: ``to boldly go where no man has
gone before.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice-over mandate that introduces the original ``Star
Trek'' television series _ and, with a slight political correction,
``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' as well _ has proven resonant
enough to support four television series, eight feature films, and
tons of tie-in literature and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek'' is now shown in more than 100 countries, finding a
far wider audience than the original cultish Trekkers (don't call
them Trekkies) of old-time fandom. Travel writer Jeff Greenwald of
Oakland, Calif., made it his mission to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald, whose quests have led him through the spiritual
twists and turns of ``Shopping for Buddhas'' and to circumnavigate
the globe in ``The Size of the World,'' has tired of making the
personal the global, and has turned his eyes to the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said everything I have to say about travel in `The Size of
the World,''' Greenwald says, ``so I'm moving now to writing
science. And it seemed like it would be a wonderful transition to
write a book about `Star Trek' _ which is about traveling to begin
with _ and to go around the world talking to people who are
obsessed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Future Perfect: How Star Trek Conquered Planet Earth,''
Greenwald talks to fans as well as Trek writers and actors, rocket
scientists and terran luminaries like Kurt Vonnegut, Arthur C.
Clarke and the Dalai Lama, about the show's appeal. He lurks on the
set of ``Star Trek: First Contact'' and attends a Klingon wedding
in Germany, following the warp signature of the Starship Enterprise
to the ends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked people, `What is it about this American vision that's
so compelling for you?' And what I heard from people in Hungary,
Italy, and even in India, is that this is not an American vision,''
Greenwald reports. ``Now, it's certainly true that the original
`Star Trek,' which was born out of the Cold War Kennedy years, had
a very specific agenda in promoting truth, justice and the American
way. But with `The Next Generation' and later forms of `Star Trek,'
the idea of a global consciousness really took hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that over the last 10 years, the presence of
nonthreatening technologies _ like the Internet, like personal
computers _ have really done a lot to create a global culture. And
everybody began to get this sort of vision of the possibility of
peace on a more global scale. `Star Trek' may have its roots in a
very American vision of the future, but I think that it's a
seductive vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald experienced firsthand the draw of the ``Star Trek''
myth during the filming of ``First Contact,'' when he got to stand
on the ship of his boyhood dreams. ``There's no way to really
convey the emotional rush of being on this mythical ship hich
you've grown up with. I thought it would really deconstruct the
experience to stand in the transporter, to walk onto the main
bridge _ and show me it was all just plywood and plastic _ but it
didn't have that effect. And I think that's a tribute to the depth
to which this show has gotten under our skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transporter has been around for 32 years. The idea of warp
drive, of a phaser _ these things have been around longer than many
of the people watching the story have been alive. They grew up with
them as a part of their culture, and they're no more or less real
than the pyramids, in terms of people having actually seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I was more disappointed visiting the actual
pyramids, and seeing them surrounded by Coca-Cola stands, than I
was visiting the deck of the Starship Enterprise, which was every
bit as fantastic and otherworldly as I'd ever dreamed it would be.
It resonated with me much more deeply. It was my mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons so many people look to _ or at least look at
_ ``Star Trek'' is the shows' relentless optimism; late Trek
creator Gene Roddenberry posited an idyllic future in which
humankind has eradicated war, crime and poverty at home, and has
set off to explore ``space, the final frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few television shows that cultivates people's
nobility instead of their flaws,'' Greenwald affirms. ``You're
bringing out the whole quest of sentient beings as a noble quest,
and one in many respects that we're all on together.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that's why `Star Trek' has lasted so long: It
somehow convinced people that this trip is real, that it's not just
positing a possible future. It's a possible future that's in our
reach if we get over certain hurdles in society. And many see it as
a goal: Loads of engineers who now work in NASA are there because
they watched `Star Trek' as kids and want to build these things
they saw on TV. They want to be part of that process of making this

   The connection between the space program and ``Star Trek'' is
one that Greenwald makes much of; he sees the series as a kind of
surrogate space program _ which may explain its ho-hum reception
and early demise in 1969. ``At that point we're in the middle of
the Apollo program, Neil Armstrong is about to walk on the moon,''
Greenwald explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had the real thing; they didn't need this fanciful
macho vision of this captain in this spaceship. The American space
program was one of the most compelling visions that's ever been
given the human race. Like the Crusades, it just captured the
imagination of a whole civilization; but it wasn't about killing
people or converting them, it was about getting out there and
exploring. That stopped short in 1972, after Apollo 17. We left the
moon. We still haven't been back. No one thought that was going to
happen. So `Star Trek' picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing is that I think that's coming back. There are
all these companies now that are gearing up to launch tourist
flights in orbit, and even translunar flights. So I think there's
going to be a tremendous surge of interest in getting people into
outer space. I think that was reawakened very, very strongly by the
Mars Rover, Pathfinder.''
</P>
<P>
   Might ``Star Trek,'' then, soon be outliving its use as a
surrogate? ``I would like to see that happen,'' Greenwald says. ``I
would like to see our own space program become so exciting and so
inclusive and so international that `Star Trek' seems a pale
imitation, a silly imitation. But I think that `Star Trek' has a
few good years left.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald points to the remarkable longevity of ``Star Trek,''
which lives on in its two current television incarnations _
``Voyager'' and ``Deep Space Nine'' _ with a ninth feature film on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 32 years they've managed to stick to an essential formula,
invented by Gene Roddenberry, that is so durable that nothing seems
able to abrade it or wear it down. And the basic premise, of the
ship and the crew boldly going, continues to capture people's
imagination. Go figure.''

`STAR TREK' BOLDLY INSPIRES GENERATIONS OF TERRANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Also filed in ``k'' category)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAM HURWITT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's quite possibly the most famous split
infinitive in the English language: ``to boldly go where no man has
gone before.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice-over mandate that introduces the original ``Star
Trek'' television series _ and, with a slight political correction,
``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' as well _ has proven resonant
enough to support four television series, eight feature films, and
tons of tie-in literature and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek'' is now shown in more than 100 countries, finding a
far wider audience than the original cultish Trekkers (don't call
them Trekkies) of old-time fandom. Travel writer Jeff Greenwald of
Oakland, Calif., made it his mission to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald, whose quests have led him through the spiritual
twists and turns of ``Shopping for Buddhas'' and to circumnavigate
the globe in ``The Size of the World,'' has tired of making the
personal the global, and has turned his eyes to the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said everything I have to say about travel in `The Size of
the World,''' Greenwald says, ``so I'm moving now to writing
science. And it seemed like it would be a wonderful transition to
write a book about `Star Trek' _ which is about traveling to begin
with _ and to go around the world talking to people who are
obsessed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Future Perfect: How Star Trek Conquered Planet Earth,''
Greenwald talks to fans as well as Trek writers and actors, rocket
scientists and terran luminaries like Kurt Vonnegut, Arthur C.
Clarke and the Dalai Lama, about the show's appeal. He lurks on the
set of ``Star Trek: First Contact'' and attends a Klingon wedding
in Germany, following the warp signature of the Starship Enterprise
to the ends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked people, `What is it about this American vision that's
so compelling for you?' And what I heard from people in Hungary,
Italy, and even in India, is that this is not an American vision,''
Greenwald reports. ``Now, it's certainly true that the original
`Star Trek,' which was born out of the Cold War Kennedy years, had
a very specific agenda in promoting truth, justice and the American
way. But with `The Next Generation' and later forms of `Star Trek,'
the idea of a global consciousness really took hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that over the last 10 years, the presence of
nonthreatening technologies _ like the Internet, like personal
computers _ have really done a lot to create a global culture. And
everybody began to get this sort of vision of the possibility of
peace on a more global scale. `Star Trek' may have its roots in a
very American vision of the future, but I think that it's a
seductive vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald experienced firsthand the draw of the ``Star Trek''
myth during the filming of ``First Contact,'' when he got to stand
on the ship of his boyhood dreams. ``There's no way to really
convey the emotional rush of being on this mythical ship which
you've grown up with. I thought it would really deconstruct the
experience to stand in the transporter, to walk onto the main
bridge _ and show me it was all just plywood and plastic _ but it
didn't have that effect. And I think that's a tribute to the depth
to which this show has gotten under our skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transporter has been around for 32 years. The idea of warp
drive, of a phaser _ these things have been around longer than many
of the people watching the story have been alive. They grew up with
them as a part of their culture, and they're no more or less real
than the pyramids, in terms of people having actually seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I was more disappointed visiting the actual
pyramids, and seeing them surrounded by Coca-Cola stands, than I
was visiting the deck of the Starship Enterprise, which was every
bit as fantastic and otherworldly as I'd ever dreamed it would be.
It resonated with me much more deeply. It was my mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons so many people look to _ or at least look at
_ ``Star Trek'' is the shows' relentless optimism; late Trek
creator Gene Roddenberry posited an idyllic future in which
humankind has eradicated war, crime and poverty at home, and has
set off to explore ``space, the final frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few television shows that cultivates people's
nobility instead of their flaws,'' Greenwald affirms. ``You're
bringing out the whole quest of sentient beings as a noble quest,
and one in many respects that we're all on together.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that's why `Star Trek' has lasted so long: It
somehow convinced people that this trip is real, that it's not just
positing a possible future. It's a possible future that's in our
reach if we get over certain hurdles in society. And many see it as
a goal: Loads of engineers who now work in NASA are there because
they watched `Star Trek' as kids and want to build these things
they saw on TV. They want to be part of that process of making this
thing come true.''

WHY SOME PARENTS PREFER SCHOOL CHOICE OVER BEDLAM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>

   COLONIE, N.Y. _ ``If we could throw them out,'' the teacher was
telling me, ``if they knew we could actually do something to them,
then maybe we could impose some real control in the classroom. But
those kids know that we have to put up with them, and they behave
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   That was only one of more than two dozen calls I received a few
days ago after a column about a kid at Shaker High School who'd
pulled a particularly vile stunt. He'd taken photos of girls in his
suburban Albany school, apparently from the yearbook, used his
computer to graft their faces on shots of naked women in
pornographic poses and put the whole thing on the Internet as a Web
site entitled, ``Shaker Girls at their Best.''
</P>
<P>
   He included false and salacious ``autobiographies'' by the girls
and their e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The school suspended him for five days and probably will end up
suspending him for the rest of the year. He might also be barred
from extracurricular activities, including graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out in that column that the school can't expel him. By
law, every New Yorker is entitled to a free public education until
age 21. The most any school can do in the face of any offense is
keep the kid out of school for the balance of that school year and
supply the kid with private tutoring at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   If a kid does something criminal, he can be shipped off to state
prison from age 16 on. But, even if a kid commits a felony on
school property and somehow manages to evade the slammer, he can't
be thrown out of school.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason so many people are so much in favor of school
choice. They want tax dollars spent to support their kids in
private schools that do have the authority to throw out
troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's certainly true that a good many people in the school
choice movement have specific and unrelated political agendas _
inflicting pain on teachers unions, for example, or founding
religious schools where other taxpayers would have to pay for the
promulgation of somebody else's personal views concerning God.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that a good many people in the school choice
movement _ especially in poorer neighborhoods _ are simply
concerned parents fed up with a system that has as its guiding
principle the proposition that every kid, no matter how disruptive
or resistant to learning, is entitled to a spot in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   That principle is especially repugnant to parents in minority
neighborhoods where education represents a kid's best chance of
escaping poverty and entering the middle class. A poll last year by
the Joint Center for Political Studies, a generally liberal outfit,
shows that African Americans favor school choice by a margin of 56
to 38 percent and that 87 percent of black parents of school-age
children favor it. Latinos favor school choice by 65 to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Clark, the former high school principal in Paterson, N.J.,
who dealt with disruption simply by ejecting 300 teen-age
troublemakers, told me that he became a hero with the parents of
the other kids _ and a national hero as well _ by flatly rejecting
the idea that the system must save every kid regardless of whatever
damage that kid might inflict on the learning environment.
</P>
<P>
   School choice is scary stuff. Critics say it would destroy the
public school system, and they're probably right. But unless
politicians give public schools the power to expel troublemakers,
school choice will become a more attractive proposition to more
people _ especially the ones who saw ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   And who understand that overloading the lifeboat guarantees that
everybody goes under.

EDITING OUT DISHONESTY IN JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: Resending for all needing)   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The perils of the unidentified source made a
splash again last week to the embarrassment of afflicted
publications. Those news media not directly affected should
nevertheless bathe themselves in self-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Glass, a writer for The New Republic, stood publicly
revealed as one who not only made up salient quotes, but entire
persons and even organizations. Fired last month because one of his
articles was run down as fiction by the magazine after an
interested reader probed and complained, Mr. Glass now is said to
have faked wholly or partially more than half of the articles he
wrote for The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he free-lanced for other magazines, all of
which have now severed their connection with him, some having also
found fictive handiwork in what he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Even a news organization, so perfect it could only exist
hypothetically, one where stringent standards were rigidly enforced
without exception, would not be able to protect itself entirely
against a determined fabricator who also has some writing talent.
However, news organizations in real life are not paragons of ideal
thoroughness. Practically speaking, no journalism is error-free
because the system of checking is flawless.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, editing or fact-checking is done on the run and
the result is that a myriad of errors creep into the pages of the
newspapers and magazines, most of them careless, unintentional and
without malice. These don't necessarily wreak lasting harm, unless
sloppiness becomes so pervasive in an organization that consumers
of the work it produces come to doubt its reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of trust. In the real life of a
newspaper, trust frequently hangs in the air, implicitly part of
the dialogue as reporters discuss their reporting with their
supervising editors. So, for example, you would not hire an
applicant for a newspaper job who was not apparently trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is important in getting you in the door. But while trust
is base of the relationship between reporter and editor, it cannot
be permitted to stand in the way of confirming the validity of an
article-in-the-making. It is through this system of check and
balances, that reporters tell their editors and most desirably
their readers, how they came to learn what they write, who their
sources are, and what their sources' self-interest in the
information provided by them might be.
</P>
<P>
   It is at this juncture that journalistic standards most often
don't measure up to the principles that editors fondly offer in
their own defense when enduring public criticism. If editors can't
totally protect their publications against an ambitious liar, we
should do a much better job upholding the rules that are
self-evidently desirable and enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   However, such attention to detail is complicated when the
sources of information are anonymous, as they were in Stephen
Glass's work. Confidentiality of sources is utterly essential to
good journalism. Without it, much of the most serious revelations
that impinge on the public welfare would never see the light of
day. Whistleblowers can suffer great punishment from wrongdoers
they expose.
</P>
<P>
   But sources who are not identified for readers in articles need
to be known by the editors, so that a system of checking can exist
at the point where it is most needed: to determine the plausibility
of assertions made by people, who for apparently good reasons,
decline to have their names associated with the information they
are supplying.
</P>
<P>
   The essentiality of confidential sources does not argue for
their wide use.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons just argued, they should be restricted to those
situations when the issue is serious and there is no other way to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening now in more and more news media, unnamed
sources are taking an ever larger role in articles that, on their
face, should not require them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we confront the real problem facing journalism. Even men
and women who are spokesmen for a personage or organization now
appear unnamed in the public prints because they seek to guard
their privacy, an incongruous consideration for a person paid to
take public positions.
</P>
<P>
   Others are permitted to comment on people or their motives
without risking their identity with the public in political and
financial articles especially. Editors should bear down hard on
limiting unnamed sources and on insisting that their reporters
strive to get on-the-record information.
</P>
<P>
   Such insistence would have immediate payback. On-the-record
information, of course, is another important way to check on
information. A named person could attract a response contradicting
an assertion, which may be why some people insist on anonymity. It
is much harder to challenge an account when who said what is not
precisely known.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY &QL; 
 &UR; Helen Fielding (Viking, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Poor Bridget. Her diary is a rip-roaring success in Great
Britain, but no sooner does it arrive in America than the critics
declare a blood bath. Is it because she's so, like, (begin itals)
shallow? (end itals) Just remember, it's not as if there aren't
lots of women out there just like her. She's thirtyish,
self-absorbed and unlucky in love. This mildly funny novel comes in
the form of a diary (each entry begins with Bridget's weight and
caloric consumption for the day, and proceeds to discuss the length
of her skirts, her family, her vapid social life and her
oft-expressed determination to turn her life around). It got its
start as a weekly newspaper column, became a bestselling book in
England and is soon to be a movie from the makers of ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral.'' A foothold in America has not been so
easy to make, but don't count Bridget out. It's about time
something went her way. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; PARK CITY &QL; 
 &UR; Ann Beattie (Knopf, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Alison Woodruff is caught in an emotional tornado, with pieces
of her life swirling around her, too dizzying and dangerous for
comfort. There's her boyfriend, who clutches his beer bottles as if
they were grenades and wants her to marry him even though his
fidelity is already in question. There's his 8-year-old son, a
fierce boy whose vulnerability, when it finally surfaces, is a
heart-wrenching thing to see. There's Alison's young student,
Moriko, who starts a fire that forces Alison into a laughable
struggle with Moriko's distressed Japanese uncle. All of this comes
fast and furious in ``Cosmos,'' the first of eight new stories from
Beattie, whose message is that order can and does emerge from
chaos, if only because it has no choice. This book also includes 28
stories selected from Beattie's five earlier collections, many of
them examinations of the precarious and how people learn to live
with it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A BEAUTIFUL MIND &QL; 
 &UR; Sylvia Nasar (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25)
</P>
<P>
   This is a biography of John Forbes Nash Jr., the handsome, aloof
and highly eccentric mathematical genius who went mad at 30,
suffered for three decades with paranoid schizophrenia, then began
a remarkable ``spontaneous recovery'' from his illness and at the
age of 66 won the 1994 Nobel Prize for economics. In the throes of
his illness he had abandoned mathematics and embraced numerology,
religious prophecy and a belief in extraterrestrials. He underwent
drug and shock treatment, dressed oddly, had extramarital
relationships and an illegitimate son and was known to wander the
campus of Princeton University, scribbling bizarre messages on the
blackboards. A bewildered colleague once asked him how he, a man of
reason and logic, could stray so far. ``Because,'' Nash replied,
``the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way
that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.'' This is
a wonderful book about brilliance that endured through years of
torment. Nasar, an economics correspondent for The New York Times,
calls it ``a story about the mystery of the human mind, in three
acts: genius, madness, reawakening.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; PASS THE BUTTERWORMS: Remote Journeys Oddly Rendered &QL; 
 &UR; Tim Cahill (Vintage, $13)
</P>
<P>
   Tim Cahill once contracted malaria after spending the night in a
stilt house in the swamps of New Guinea among people so primitive
that they used stone tools and were said to practice cannibalism.
He did not get much rest that evening _ sleep does not come easy
when you know your hosts have recently eaten human flesh. Cahill
makes a living doing things like this, and what's more, people
(begin itals) envy (end itals) him. They want his job. They write
and tell him that all the time, but he won't give it up because the
discomfort, the inconvenience and the oddness of it all appeal to
him. Many of the travel essays in this collection (new in
paperback) were written for ``Outside'' magazine, of which Cahill
was a founding editor. They are funny because Cahill passes himself
off as an Everyman, stumbling into exotic places, coming face to
face with cannibals and living to tell the tale. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; G.I. JOE &QL; 
 &UR; John Michlig (Chronicle, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   Don't call him a doll. Even in the beginning, developers of G.I.
Joe found other labels for him because they knew that the president
of Hasbro Toys did (begin itals) not (end itals) want to be in the
doll business. And so the ``d'' word was banished from their
language, even though they used Barbie's boyfriend, Ken, as a model
(he was too soft for a heroic man of action, so they carved baby
fat from his face and beefed up his shoulders and chest until he
looked like a body builder who had seen a bad plastic surgeon). And
the accessories! Ah, the accessories, enough to give even Barbie a
run for her money. But (begin itals) don't call him a doll. (end
itals) Here is the story of the ``action figure'' that would take
hold of the imaginations of a generation of boys and never let go.
With lots of great illustrations and a preface by Don Levine,
former creative director of Hasbro Toys, whose idea the whole thing
was. &QL;

HIKERS SUFFER, READERS LAUGH: MISFITS TREK APPALACHIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ On March 9, 1996, Bill Bryson and his friend,
Stephen Katz, set out to hike the length of the Appalachian Trail,
roughly 2,150 miles through 14 states, from Springer Mountain in
northern Georgia to Mount Katahdin in northern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson decided to do this for several reasons. For one thing,
the trail went through the town in which he lived, so the idea was
always there, beckoning with deceptive charm. Also, there were
personal advantages to be gained. The trail would make him fit
after years of sloth. He would learn survival skills. He would
become as one with the wilderness. He would be like Daniel Boone,
who, Bryson knew, not only wrestled bears but tried to date their
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he would be manly when he finished, no longer a
cupcake among guys with muscles and Bowie knives. After the trail
he would be able to gaze upon any mountain in the distance and know
with deep satisfaction that it was his for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, none of these things came to pass,'' Bryson says
today from Hanover, N.H., his home since he returned to the United
States after nearly 20 years in England. He was born in Iowa but
traveled in Europe during college and met and married an
Englishwoman. He has been back for three years but still speaks
with a deep British accent, the better to convey the enormity of
the task he and Katz faced together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, we really thought we were just going out for a
pleasant sort of (begin itals) walk,'' (end itals) he says.
``Neither of us had done anything like it before and we had no idea
what we were letting ourselves in for. Everyone else on the trail
was just so much (begin itals) fitter (end itals) than we were.
They didn't seem to have anything like the adjustment that we had
to make, physically or mentally. But I've always suspected that
maybe, deep down, they were feeling the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryson's book, ``A Walk in the Woods,'' is a hilarious account
of his adventures on the Appalachian Trail. It's worth repeating
that salient point: This book is so very funny, and one reason for
it is Stephen Katz. He signed on as Bryson's hiking companion after
the author's solicitations among other friends produced no
volunteers. Bryson and Katz had grown up together in Iowa, but had
pretty much lost touch over the ensuing 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did he come?'' says Bryson. ``There were a number of
reasons. He had just broken up with a long-term girlfriend. He had
been laid off of a job, so he was at loose ends. He was, and is, a
recovering alcoholic, and he thought getting away from temptation
would be a good thing. And then there is the reason anyone goes to
hike the trail. The adventure of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz, however, was singularly unprepared for the enterprise. He
had traveled with Bryson in Europe one summer when Bryson was in
college (their adventures appear in Bryson's first travel book,
``Neither Here Nor There''), but had returned to Iowa and immersed
himself in drink and drugs, even spending 18 months in prison once
for possession of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   To all appearances he had reformed, but there was still the
little matter of his weight. Like Bryson, he was hopelessly out of
shape, but unlike Bryson he had developed a girth for which all
realistic comparisons were ominous. Zero Mostel, perhaps. Or, as
Bryson suggested to his wife after seeing Katz for the first time,
``Orson Welles after a bad night.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz had never carried a backpack. He had never seen a hiking
trail. And with that, he and Bryson stepped into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   It was hell. It was hell all the way through. At first they
treated each other with a precarious balance of tolerance and
testiness, but later they came to feel mutual affection as they
ventured deeper and deeper into a love-hate relationship with the
Appalachian Trail. Katz displayed a quick, vulgar wit and a
disarming if cantankerous willingness to forge on, hilariously,
through deep adversity. His exploits made great material for
Bryson's book, as Bryson had known from the start that they would.
</P>
<P>
   People ask him all the time if Katz is real, or if he just made
him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to tell you that he's real and I didn't begin to do
him justice,'' Bryson says. ``He truly is one of those
larger-than-life characters. I wrote about him as accurately as I
could but still captured only about 10 percent of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life and mine had gone in different directions, almost as
opposite as two guys who grew up in the same town can go. I became
a husband and father and wrote books and lived a life of rectitude
and all that. And he led this sort of dissolute life. By the time
we met up again we were, on the face of it, very incompatible. But
he never let me down. That's the finest thing about him. He knew if
he quit he would be abandoning me. We looked out for each other.
The friendship you form with the person you're hiking with,
especially if you have some affection for that person at the start,
deepens in a way that's really quite incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Katz and Bryson walked less than half of the
Appalachian Trail, but came away with strong legs and a deep sense
of what they were capable of doing. Bryson lost 28 pounds, and
while he's not wrestling bears like Daniel Boone, he has enough
confidence to take on one of the celebrities of wilderness lore,
the great Henry David Thoreau himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson calls Thoreau ``inestimably priggish and tiresome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's true, I think he gets way too much credit, both for
original thought and for having any particular devotion to the
woods,`` he says. ``I mean, his cabin was just like on the edge of
town. He was no closer to the wilderness than I am now, in a town
of 5,000 people. Yes, I think he was a prig. I stand by that.''
</P>
<P>
   He says this with the authority of a manly woodsman, but that is
not the only result of his time on the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a really good friend,'' he says, ``and I learned a lot
about being a friend, which is important to me. I learned a real
appreciation for the woods and the scale of wilderness, and a lot
about myself and how much I'm capable of doing. I learned how to do
things that really make you feel grown-up. And I can now look at a
big hill or a small mountain, size it up with eyes of chipped
granite, and say, `I can do that.' '' &QL;

NEW YORKERS PONDER GIULIANI'S BUNKER MENTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has Rudolph Giuliani gone a bridge too far?
</P>
<P>
   During his first term as mayor, Giuliani went after squeegie
men, drug gangs, graffiti vandals, and disorderly criminals
generally _ and the people loved it.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year of his second term, he has, with the same
passion, gone after taxi drivers, jaywalkers, hot dog vendors, and
disorderly behavior generally, and, in New York, where such things
form the fabric of everyday life, that's a different deal
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   With these recent battles in mind, New Yorkers reacted with
mirth or outrage to reports over the weekend that Giuliani has
budgeted $15 million for a 40,000-square-foot, bulletproof,
blast-hardened crisis bunker, stocked with enough food and water to
last a week, and equipped with a secure videophone line between the
mayor and the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bunker strikes many people as funny because it's the
perfect metaphor for Giuliani,'' observed Fred Siegel, professor of
urban studies at Cooper Union. ``He's in a crisis mode for all
situations, whether it's a crisis or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel is a conservative thinker and, in the past, a strong
supporter of Giuliani and his policies. Now, he is having second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani is one of these politicians, like Clemenceau or
Churchill, who had such outsized personalities that their approach
is inappropriate for ordinary situations,'' Siegel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among many of Giuliani's allies, Siegel added, ``There's a sense
that his personality is no longer appropriate to the current
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, the mayor has treated every political
dispute as if it constituted a threat to the city _ and has fired
off the rhetorical equivalent of A-bombs in response.
</P>
<P>
   When 1,000 cabdrivers planned to protest new regulations,
Giuliani called them ``taxi terrorists'' and blocked their
demonstration with a police mobilization massive enough to contain
a large riot.
</P>
<P>
   When the speaker of the City Council, Peter Vallone, introduced
an alternative to the mayor's budget, Giuliani didn't just
criticize it _ he mailed a letter to the city's 900,000 homeowners,
warning that if Vallone's budget passes, their property taxes will
go up.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's critics have greeted these tactics with glee. ``I
think he's nuts, or going in that direction,'' chortled former
mayor Edward Koch. ``If he wants to build a bunker only for the
people he trusts, all he needs is a phone booth,'' jabbed Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and his loyalists view the latest attacks as a
political charade. ``It's a shabby attempt by a group of weak
Democratic candidates to get publicity,'' charged Joseph Mercurio,
a leading Republican consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Giuliani's critics concede the point, to a degree.
Vallone, who is running for governor, is grandstanding way beyond
the norm for a City Council speaker. At least one participant in
the taxi protest did threaten to turn the city into a gigantic
parking lot. And a secure high-tech emergency control center of
some sort might be a good idea for a big city where terrible things
can happen.
</P>
<P>
   However, not just the usual political snipers are raising their
eyebrows. Siegel is one case in point. On a pop-culture level,
Curtis Sliwa, head of the Guardian Angels and normally a
Giuliani-booster, joined his talk-radio co-host, radical lawyer Ron
Kuby, in poking fun at the mayor's bunker for all four hours of
their show last Saturday. They even invited listeners to phone in
ideas for a name-that-shelter contest. (The winner: ``The Nut
Shell.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a combative, activist guy,'' said Myron
Magnet, editor of City Journal, a conservative magazine that
Giuliani frequently cites. ``Sometimes that's good. But we do have
problems with his plan to shut down a lot of hot-dog vendors. We're
big fans of order in public spaces, but we also think the vendors
fill an economic need, for the customers and the entrepreneurs. Any
way that poor, legal immigrants can find a route to the American
dream while filling a necessary economic function _ we ought to
help them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Magnet added, Giuliani has often turned out to be
shrewder than he first appears. ``When he started controlling
pedestrian traffic on 50th Street,'' Magnet recalled, ``I thought,
`Oooh, a bridge too far.' But it worked. I was wrong. He was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Conn Nugent, director of Citizens' Union, sees the
whole tempest as just another off-Broadway theatrical. ``The fact
that Rudy Giuliani tackles controversies in an idiosyncratic way is
to the taste of New Yorkers,'' Nugent said. ``It's entertaining.
Entertainment has always been a big part of what New York
government is about.''

STAY HOME, MICHAEL JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ One and one-tenth second remained in what could
have been the last basketball game of his career. Michael Jordan
was in a position for a finish to top all the other breathtaking,
heart-pounding, mind-blowing finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bulls' ball, at midcourt, late Friday, down two points
to the Utah Jazz in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. After a deflected
pass left less than a second on the clock, the ball _ as it usually
has the good sense to do _ found its way into Jordan's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan took aim from behind the 3-point line and fired a shot at
the jugular of the Jazz. The game, the series, maybe the Bulls'
rollicking romp through the 1990s, would end if the ball went in
the basket. That would make three NBA titles in a row and six in
the decade for the Bulls. America waited to exhale, soaked in
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Is anybody other than Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general
manager Jerry Krause really ready to say goodbye? Breaking up is
especially hard to do when nothing is broken in the first place.
Still, what a way to go. The gunslinger of all gunslingers,
triumphantly riding off into the night, never to fire another
bullet. Airball. Airball?
</P>
<P>
   There would be no championship celebration for the Bulls that
night. (That would have to wait until Sunday, when the Bulls beat
the Jazz in Game 6 by 87-86.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jordan couldn't seem to stop smiling Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was cute,'' Jordan said, ``just thinking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is 35, and he's still the best player on the planet. He
has only just begun to slow enough for others to occasionally
venture into his stratosphere. On Friday, Karl Malone summoned the
sort of game (39 points, 25 in the second half) that Jordan used to
produce on demand. Jordan, meanwhile, made only nine of 25 shots in
the first 47 minutes and 59 seconds of Game 5. It hadn't been his
night, but that didn't discourage him one bit from trying to seize
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was anticipating a big shot on our side, on their
side,'' Jordan said. ``Everyone thought I could make a shot, and
that's the beauty of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted the ball, but no one knew what was going to
happen. That's part of my personality. That's the way things have
happened for me in my career. I was sure everybody was hoping that
would end that way, except for the Utah people. Everybody was
holding their breath.''
</P>
<P>
   To see Jordan embrace the moment, rather than wallow in his
failure, is to understand that he has little choice but to play
again next season.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the fans. Not for his teammates. Not for his coach.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the shoe company with the Swooshtika logo.
</P>
<P>
   Not for more scoring titles, more Most Valuable Player trophies,
more unbreakable records.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the NBA. Not for NBC. Not for Ahmad Rashad.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the fat wallet of Reinsdorf or the fat head of Krause,
who still can't make peace with the notion that Jordan is the alpha
and omega of this empire.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan should come back for Jordan. Jordan owes it to himself to
keep doing this for as long as he can. He owes himself the pleasure
of pushing himself, of creating new challenges for himself. The
next time he walks away from the NBA, it's for keeps. He'll never
find anything that approaches the feeling he gets on a basketball
court, where just about anything still seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan failed on Friday, failed to deliver the sort of
miracle that he and all earthlings have come to expect, and this is
the first four-letter word that came to his mind:
</P>
<P>
   Cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knew what was going to happen _ me, you, no one who was
watching the game,'' Jordan said. ``And that was the cute part
about it. I love those moments. Great players thrive on that in
some respects, because they have an opportunity to decide happiness
and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness was on our side at the time, and sadness was on
Utah's side. Unfortunately, we reversed roles _ sadness in Chicago
and happiness in Utah. That's what you live for.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan should hold on to those moments for as long as he
can. They bring him the sort of happiness that money can't buy.

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- With too much vehemence, Independent
Counsel-For-Life Kenneth Starr has sought to deny that of which he
was not accused in order to knock over straw men he has himself
erected.
</P>
<P>
   As his ox was being gored last weekend, Starr protested that not
once had he ever leaked so much as a milligram of ``grand jury
material'' and had spoken or authorized prosecutors' conversations
with journalists only to correct misinformation that might
otherwise be disseminated, all for that most noble of purposes, to
``engender public confidence.'' Oh, and what he was doing is not a
crime, and is _ like subpoenas of mothers, bookstores, dead men's
and live clients' attorneys _ par for the course in the
crook-catching game.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, everybody does it, and it's not illegal. I
assume my Clinton-hating friends will note the irony.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to obliterate this nonsense is to spend a couple of
hours with Steve Brill's 30,000-word examination of the press and
Starr in the early weeks of the Monica Lewinsky investigation,
contained in his new magazine about the media, Content.
</P>
<P>
   The meat of the article is definitely not about the leaking of
grand jury material, and the fact that Starr and some of his senior
prosecutors meet with journalists regularly and privately is not
the article's chief focus either. Instead, it is in large part
about the use of the press to put information of dubious veracity
into the public domain without serious double-checking.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, while motive is not a fit subject for speculation, the
timing of these disclosures and their impact clearly worked in
tandem _ investigative information is selectively disclosed close
enough to a grand jury appearance to make it look like the
functional equivalent of it, and it has the effect of adding to the
pressure on Lewinsky to tell the prosecutors what they want to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   Example: While President Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, was
still a grand jury witness, The New York Times reported
characterizations of what she had to say to ``investigators'' about
supposedly being coached by the president that were disputed by her
lawyers. This was followed by a meeting between two of its
reporters and Starr and his deputy, Jackie Bennett Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Example: A Washington Post story about retired Secret Service
agent Lewis Fox, also at the time of his grand jury appearance, was
hyped to suggest that he could swear Clinton and Lewinsky were once
``alone'' for about 40 minutes. The story ignored other comments in
other venues by Fox that greatly undercut the significance of his
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The practice also extended to unofficial arms of the
prosecutor's office, like New York literary agent Lucianne
Goldberg, the friend and book agent wannabe for Starr's star
witness and secret Lewinsky-taper, Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters were desperate for tidbits from Tripp's tapes
that were being played for Starr's grand jury, Goldberg was one of
the tidbit suppliers. One of her best moves was to tell ABC News of
a Lewinsky dress, allegedly with semen stains on it. Goldberg then
added, out of the blue, that Lewinsky claimed to have saved the
dress.
</P>
<P>
   Brill is one-dimensional in his focus on reporters, neglecting
the unsung and unexamined enablers of modern tabloidization called
editors. He also should have included at least some context, above
all the fact that information-dispensing was routinely practiced to
his shame by Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, and admitted to
in his memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Brill article is causing the press-prosecutor
wagons to be circled here. The best clue is wildly varied press
coverage (the lead story, for example in yesterday's Los Angeles
Times, with not a word allowed into The Washington Post).
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate context, though, is to be found in the Watergate
analogy Kenneth Starr so valiantly tries to make in his routine
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Richard Nixon had Archibald Cox fired, the
prosecutor spoke with two members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Edward Kennedy and the late Phil Hart, and let slip a
piece of evidence given him months before by a scandal figure,
former Attorney General Richard Kleindienst.
</P>
<P>
   When the information appeared in print, Cox was so appalled he
might have been the indirect source, he turned himself in to the
committee, endured a public thrashing and even a brief bar
association inquiry _ even though he turned out not to have been
the cause of the evidence's disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   That was an ethical man. Today, political investigations so
flout the rules with the press's competitive connivance that they
could not withstand even a moment's scrutiny. That's why the wagons
are circulating.

TRAVEL READING THAT KEEPS THE ARMCHAIR ADVENTURER IN STITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Several years ago, needing something to read, I
was poking around a bookstore. A couple aisles over, I could hear
an odd cackling sound coming from the travel section. It was rather
loud: people all over the store were looking up to see what was
going on.
</P>
<P>
   I walked over there to see a middle-aged man, his face contorted
into the kind of grin that makes your jaw hurt after a while. Then
came the cackling again, followed by a sigh as he wiped a tear of
laughter from his eye.
</P>
<P>
   I maneuvered myself into position to see what he was reading. It
was ``Neither Here Nor There,'' by someone named Bill Bryson. I
could also see that it was the store's only copy.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the cackling man put the book back on the shelf,
after carefully folding over the corner of a page to mark his
place. Before he could turn back I reached past him and snatched
the book. The grin vanished from his face and he shot me a glance
that would, in the words of P.G. Wodehouse, open an oyster at 20
paces.
</P>
<P>
   I barely noticed. I opened the book at random and started
reading. It was a book about traveling through Europe, and here was
Bryson's description of ordering Kalbsbrann in a restaurant in
Bavaria with his friend Stephen Katz:
</P>
<P>
   ``A minute later the proprietor appeared at our table, looking
hesitant and embarrassed, wringing his hands on a slaughterhouse
apron.
</P>
<P>
   ```Excuse me so much gentlemans,' he said, `but are you knowing
what Kalbsbrann is?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other and allowed that we did not.
</P>
<P>
   ```It is, how you say, what ze little cow thinks wiz.'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon I was cackling to myself and heading to the cash register,
avoiding the glance of the no-longer-cackling man who wasn't going
to get the book back. &QL; /17_

A LUXURY TRAIN RIDE TO NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE CARITAS RAIL CAR _ Some things are worth getting up
early for. And that's why my wife and I were at the station before
8 a.m. on a Saturday, waiting to board a luxury rail car that would
take us to and from New York City while serving up relaxation,
scenery, and fine food along the way.
</P>
<P>
   That car was the Caritas, a nicely restored private rail car
that travels 45,000 miles a year, conducting excursions around the
country, some for a day and others for longer periods. Today's trip
was an afternoon and evening in New York, with the Caritas as the
last car on an Amtrak Northeast Direct train.
</P>
<P>
   The train was right on time, meaning that at 7:45 a.m. we
boarded the red-white-and-blue Caritas via its observation platform
for a 4 1/2-hour trip to the city. We were greeted by our host,
Taylor Johnson, who introduced us to the two waiters and cook and
told us a little bit about the 85-foot rail car.
</P>
<P>
   The car began life in 1948 as as the Pierre La Clede, a Pullman
sleeper. Sold to the Canadian National in 1964, it was renamed the
Churchill Falls. Then, in 1983, it was bought by the
Minneapolis-based High Iron Travel Corp. and renamed the Caritas _
a word that sent me scurrying to the dictionary to learn that it
means ``love for all people.'' The new owners transformed the
Caritas into an Art Deco observation car.
</P>
<P>
   The results of that transformation were readily apparent as we
settled into one of the 10 upholstered chairs that line either side
of the lounge area and face large windows. Those side-by-side
chairs are especially appreciated by a tall person: Unlike on some
plane trips, I wouldn't have to travel with my knees forced under
my chin. In addition, there are two glass-topped tables that seat
four people each (usually, the car accommodates 16 passengers on
day trips and eight on overnight journeys). Then comes the
all-important kitchen, followed by versatile rooms in which day
couches convert to upper and lower berths so that the Caritas can
sleep eight guests in three double bedrooms and a master suite.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect may not have been dazzling, but it was
certainly pleasant. Colorful photos of trains were on the
neutral-colored walls, and there were chrome lighting fixtures and
other Art Deco touches. I especially liked the two vertical glass
etchings, each depicting a maiden in a diaphanous dress holding a
round, bubbling vase, which to my unsophisticated eye appeared to
resemble a frothy cannonball.
</P>
<P>
   But enough glancing around: It was breakfast time. And this
would be no fast food on a plastic tray. We were served fresh
fruit, scrambled eggs, sausages, coffee, and orange juice on tables
set with tablecloths, china, and silverware.
</P>
<P>
   During breakfast and the rest of the trip, we chatted with our
fellow passengers and discovered just who takes such trips. After
all, the cost for this particular journey was $250 _ slightly more
than double what the same trip would cost on Amtrak's express,
reserved coach. So, not surprisingly, many of the Caritas
passengers were lovers of luxury and good food. Others were train
buffs, who seemingly spent the entire trip talking about rail cars
and track systems and other train-related minutiae. (One such
passenger used many feet of videotape photographing the rails
through one of the three circular windows in the door that leads to
the observation car. I occasionally wonder whether he pops up a
batch of popcorn and watches the video nightly.) My favorite
passenger, though, was a man simply trying to decompress. ``I'm
always on the go,'' he said. ``I hope I can take this kind of
slower pace.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Linda, and I certainly could. The ride was
exceptionally comfortable, with no sway. We sat and chatted and
read and gazed at surprisingly interesting scenery en route _ swans
(a lot of them) and geese, marshes and marinas, old mills and new
graffiti (including an elaborate drawing of what looked like a
horned snake), and the impressive domed Rhode Island State House in
Providence. In New Haven, we had a 15-minute break while the train
swapped a couple of cars. And although this was the last day of
February, it seemed like a spring break: We were blessed with a
mild, mostly sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   A while later, we got our first view of Manhattan, and, as
always, it was a thrill to see this skyscrapered city. To some, NYC
is simply overwhelming, but to me it is one of the world's most
exciting, vibrant cities. It had been a while since my last visit,
and I was eager to be in the city again.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers had made plans to catch a matinee at a Broadway
show. But Manhattan is a magnificent show all by itself, and we
spent most of the 5 1/2 hours allotted to us before the return trip
dining, shopping, and mostly just wandering. It was heartening to
see that there is indeed a ``new'' Times Square _ with not a
three-card monte game in sight. Construction seemed to be
everywhere as mini-malls, movies, and other attractions are added
to this revitalized, largely de-sleazed area. ``The Lion King''
musical was sold out at Disney's New Amsterdam Theatre, and the
huge Disney Store next door was filled with people buying items
such as coin banks depicting Minnie Mouse as the Statue of Liberty.
The Virgin Megastore lived up to its name _ it's said to be the
world's largest record store _ and every kind of dining experience
was available, from a big-buck luncheon at an ambience-drenched
restaurant to a hot dog served from a pushcart.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many sights. We wandered down to Grand Central
Terminal to admire its Renaissance-style architecture (our train
had arrived at the less-spectacular Pennsylvania Station, which is
on track to receive a new home at the massive but graceful Farley
Post Office). En route, we paused to watch a pro-Iraq protest march
composed of everyone from college students to aging hippies. We
strolled to the Empire State Building, where I went on the ``New
York Skyride,'' a silly but exciting simulated flight through the
city, while my wife waited and wondered why. Outside, we found
young men selling faux Rolex watches; in days past, they would have
been at Times Square. We strolled through Macy's _ the real Macy's
_ and watched the skaters at Rockefeller Center. The hours passed
pleasantly, even if our feet had begun to protest a bit.
</P>
<P>
   We returned to Penn Station in plenty of time to catch the
Caritas's return trip, which began at 6:05 p.m. Cold drinks
(including cocktails) and light snacks were awaiting us, and so was
a glorious view of New York City at night as the train headed
homeward. Some of us crept out onto the observation platform to
better enjoy the city lights. A line from the musical ``Annie'' _
``I want it to shine like the top of the Chrysler Building'' _ took
on a whole new meaning as we gazed at that illuminated Art Deco
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it was dinnertime, and we ate in two shifts of eight people
each. The meal was filet mignon, whipped potato, and broccoli in
cheese sauce, served with a good merlot. Dessert was a brownie and
ice cream, or ice cream with chocolate sauce or strawberries, or a
creative combination of all the preceding. Throughout the journey,
in both directions, the always-attentive waitstaff often would ask
if we wanted a drink or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   No one can predict the chemistry of a disparate group of
travelers. This turned out to be a largely quiet group, and most
simply relaxed or conversed for the rest of the trip, which would
end about 11:15 p.m. The Caritas has a stereo aboard (as well as a
public address system, television, and a VCR), and for a while soft
music was played. But to me the real music was the gentle rhythm of
the rails.

THE UNMASKING OF JOE MALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wow! That was some rain.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, my basement was so wet Leonardo DiCaprio was down
there looking for a place to drown. When I finally summoned the
courage to check it, I saw Sigourney Weaver chasing damp aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Man, what a mess.
</P>
<P>
   All over New England people are arguing with insurance agents.
Not me.
</P>
<P>
   What I do is simple: I shut the cellar door and keep it shut
until the end of July. It's bound to dry.
</P>
<P>
   However, I am surprised at the number of residents who are angry
because they feel they didn't get advance warning about the sheer
volume of rain that fell from the sky throughout the weekend. Too
bad they listened to the wrong people: the weather forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   They should have called Joe Malone. He's the formerly amiable
state treasurer now running for the Republican nomination for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   And, it turns out, a major league know-it-all. If we had made an
ordinary phone call to Joe on Friday he absolutely would have told
us to go buy sponges, mops, and wet vacs.
</P>
<P>
   See, there's nothing Joe doesn't know about. Ask him about the
Fells Acres child abuse case getting tossed out last week by a
judge and Joe will immediately tell you it was Scott Harshbarger's
fault.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Joe had barely graduated from high school when
the charges were first brought. Never mind that the sum total of
his legal knowledge comes from watching ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   You got a question? Joe's got an answer.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Joe Malone is a very sad story. His career is proof of
what can happen when political and personal ambition is allowed to
destroy conscience and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   When he started in politics, Malone traded on a nice-guy image.
He had those cute little radio commercials, complete with an
inoffensive jingle, where he'd tell voters he wasn't a career pol,
just a regular fellow who wanted to make things better, serve a
couple of terms, not make a life out of it, just do good, then go
home and mow the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Joe is merely a tool of trash-and-burn consultants. They
get paid a lot of money to turn out slime-ball ads and devise a
sleazy strategy based on the false premise that voters are truly
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Malone is desperately trying to make Paul
Cellucci's MasterCard bill an issue. Last week, he claimed people
were sick and tired of Cellucci's ``stonewalling'' on the subject
and that the governor's refusal to address his charge-card account
was getting people really mad.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I don't know about you, but it has been a while since I've
seen anyone in the `8 Items or Less' lane at Star Market go
ballistic over how many t-shirts Cellucci charged at the new
Marlboro Mall. But perhaps there is a silent, seething anger out
there that I have not picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Joe clearly decided there is a temporary advantage to be
gained by injecting William Bulger, the president of UMass, into
the campaign. Apparently, his consultants have told Malone he ought
to play off the daily headlines coming out of the hearings in
federal court that revolve around Bulger's brother, the notorious
fugitive who killed JFK, Martin Luther King, invented crack, and
ran the mob in America.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Bulger! That's Joe's stupid pet trick of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger upgraded the university, improved morale, and helped
attract more top high school students to the state system. In other
words _ no matter what you thought of him when he ran the Senate _
the man is doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't matter to the desperate Joe Malone. He's in the
process of a scorched-earth campaign aimed at satisfying his own
Yuppie self-absorption. He wants to be governor and he wants it
now. And if he can't be the guy, nobody else can, either.
</P>
<P>
   How pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, too, because there was a moment in his career when
Malone seemed to have a few of the things essential to success in
politics: personality, charm, a sense of himself, balance and an
awareness that holding office wasn't worth selling your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Yet look at what's happened. Look at what politics and no
beliefs will do to a guy: He has become a mean-spirited, right-wing
know-it-all who is willing to do, or say, just about anything in
order to get what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding: If you had called on Friday Joe Malone could have
predicted the downpour because he's got an answer for everything.
But I wonder if he would've seen the lifejacket wrapped around his
campaign as it settles in the cellar.

`I BOB' WAS ONE FOR THE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might just be time to bring Marv Albert back to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   He should get his job back on NBC, largely because his
replacement, ``I, Bob Costas,'' has taken the simple game of
basketball and made it his own pulpit to give views on everything
from looming labor problems in the NBA to the off-the court
behavior of Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   It's the world according to me, ``I, Bob.'' His commentary in
the NBA Finals would have been better if he wrapped a laurel wreath
around his head and wore a toga to let everyone know that ``I,
Bob,'' the all-knowing, all-seeing Greek God of Sports, was in the
house. Not that he played the game or anything. He has made his
name by watching.
</P>
<P>
   Once Costas was glib and smart, calling the games, particularly
baseball, without a lot of adjectives and verbs. But sizzle
replaced substance, and nowadays his colleagues in the booth barely
can get a word in, and when they do, they must hurry because they
know ``I, Bob'' needs the microphone back quick.
</P>
<P>
   Next to him, Costas had Isiah Thomas, a two-time NBA champion,
and Doug Collins, a former All-Star who once coached Michael
Jordan. These color commentators have strengths and weaknesses, of
course, but they had great things to say throughout the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Collins used the TelePrompTer superbly, showing viewers, for
instance, how the referees blew the call by disallowing Howard
Eisley's 3-pointer in the first quarter. Collins circled the ball
at least 8 feet away from Eisley's hand with the shot clock clearly
reading one second.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas had several good points at the end of the game,
questioning, for example, why Jazz guard John Stockton didn't feed
the ball down low to Antoine Carr when the injured Scottie Pippen
was guarding Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made another good point when he questioned Stockton's
fatigue. Thomas, as many recall, hobbled downcourt during the
Pistons' championship drives and said he wouldn't come out of games
because of fatigue or injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas and Collins were overshadowed by ``I, Bob,'' who
tried to work three jobs _ studio host, play-by-play announcer, and
color commentator _ at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Jordan was playing, or there's no telling how
many viewers would have turned off their sets. Not even ``I, Bob''
can offset Jordan, and not even in Boston, the most provincial of
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 had an overnight rating of 17.6 here, but the number is
deceiving because the last quarter pulled huge numbers. From
10-10:15 p.m., the neck-and-neck game earned a 23.3 rating. The
next 15 minutes did even better, pulling a 25.2.

<P>
   But ratings for NBC's postgame show dropped quickly and
substantially, to 13, with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   How many times do we have to listen to Ahmad Rashad or other NBC
sycophants ask Jordan, Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, or any player
if the team will remain intact next year?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, Pippen, and coach Phil Jackson have pulled this act
three straight years, and not once has an NBC interviewer asked a
sharp question like, ``Jerry, are you out of your mind to disband
your team?'' or ``Scottie, how much money would it take for you to
stay?'' The Bulls won't answer questions about their future, so why
should NBC stay chummy with guys holding the NBA hostage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I, Bob'' is becoming almost a parody of himself. Just calling
the game is not enough. Not a single moment is spared his
melodrama. When the genuine dramatic moments arise, viewers are too
numb to feel a sensation. Unlike in baseball, when announcers have
time to spin stories because of the pace of play, basketball is
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   Good announcers let the game come to them.
</P>
<P>
   Not ``I, Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Albert transcended the sport.

RUSSIAN INSTITUTIONS FACE NEW CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ An unfettered press, and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   With all the hardship and strife that Russians have endured in
the stumbling post-Soviet odyssey, the rise of these two democratic
institutions are often cited as the two clear successes of
President Boris N. Yeltsin's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent murder of an investigative reporter in southern
Russia has served as a reminder that Russian journalists are still
free to say what they want only as long as they do not make
powerful political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And fair elections? A run of recent election victories by
incumbent governors in Russia's regions has revealed strong-arm
tactics reminiscent of the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, which relies heavily on the political support of
regional leaders, has responded timidly to both challenges to
Yeltsin's democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has ignored a spate of apparent rights violations
surrounding Sunday's election victory by Murtaza Rakhimov, the
incumbent president of Bashkortostan, a largely Muslim region of 4
million people in central Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials said Monday that Rakhimov took 73 percent of
the vote, while his only competitor, Rif Kazakulov, received just
over 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakulov, the forestry minister in Rakhimov's Cabinet, actually
suggested that voters would be better off if the incumbent won.
That fueled suspicions that his candidacy was a cynical ploy to
meet the legal requirement in Russia that all elections have at
least two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   All serious opposition candidates were excluded from the vote
for a variety of technicalites, and local election officials
ignored a decision by Russia's Supreme Court last week to reinstate
them. Few voters in Bashkortostan could find out about this,
though, since the region's only independent newspaper and radio
station had already been shut down, and the radio station's
director, Altaf Galeyev, arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that it was a sham election,'' said Laura
Belin, an analyst on Russian politics for Radio Free Europe-Radio
Liberty. ``Outspoken opponents of Rakhimov were systematically
eliminated from the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Rakhimov's victory is not the first time that a Russian governor
was suspected of staging a landslide. Last October, Yegor Stroyev,
the powerful speaker of the upper house of parliament and the
governor of Oryol Region 300 miles south of Moscow, was reelected
with over 95 percent of the vote after election officials excluded
two potential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Stroyev was outdone this February by Nikolai Merkushin, the
incumbent president of the Russian republic of Mordovia, who won
reelection with 96.6 percent of the vote. In both regions,
opposition candidates were barred by election officials from
running, and the lone challengers were widely alleged to be
supporters of the incumbents, who entered the races to make them
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Far from protesting the apparent violations, Yeltsin
congratulated both Stroyev and Merkushin on their ``convincing''
victories. Analysts said Rakhimov, a longtime backer of Yeltsin,
can expect the same.
</P>
<P>
   But one regional strongman who has enjoyed the Yeltsin
administration's tacit backing until now, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov of
Kalmykia, was feeling some heat from Moscow Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying local authorities ``cannot be fully trusted,'' Yeltsin
Monday called for a full inquiry into the slaying last week of
Larisa Yudina, an opposition journalist in the Caspian Sea region.
Before her death, Yudina was frequently harassed by Kalmykian
authorities for her frequent criticism of Ilyumzhinov, and her
allies have suggested the murder was revenge by the man who firmly
controls all political and economic activity in the region.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is how far the Kremlin will go to prove
it.

<P>
   We suppose it had to happen: For the first time, a New York
hotel has found that more men than women locked themselves out of
their rooms in various stages of undress.
</P>
<P>
   According to the fifth annual survey from Novotel New York, 197
men and 114 women found themselves standing in the hallways, locked
out. Eighty-four of those guests were at least partly undressed _
but less than 1 percent of them were women, compared with 50
percent the year before. Other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Also for the first time, housekeepers reported that women keep
a cleaner bathroom than men. Furthermore, women are better tippers,
use the phone more often, and are more apt to take baths, iron, and
use the hotel laundry and pressing services.
</P>
<P>
   _Men, on the other hand, keep their rooms cooler, order more
adult movies, and are more likely to frequent the hotel bar, order
room service, use the fitness center, and bring home a hotel
``souvenir'' such as a towel.
</P>
<P>
   _Men are more likely to leave socks behind, while women leave
nightgowns and hairdryers.
</P>
<P>
   The top complaints by both genders about New York City are that
it's dirty, expensive, and has rude cabbies. The chief compliments
are that NYC has great theaters, shopping, and other activities.

 &UR; Travel Trivia: &LR;  Which New York City building is tallest: The
Woolworth Building, the Metropolitan Life Building, or the Bank of
Manhattan building? (Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``And you know your fate is/ where the Empire State is./
All you contemplate is/ the view from Miss Liberty's dome./ And the
Hudson River/ makes you start to quiver/ like the latest flivver/
that's simply dripping with chrome.'' _ from ``It's Nice to Go
Trav'ling,'' written by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen for an
irreplaceable singer named Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; And speaking of Sinatra: &LR;  A walking tour in New York's midtown area
on June 27 will pass Frank Sinatra's favorite restaurants, the
Paramount Theater site where the singer thrilled the bobbysoxers in
the 1940s, and the Friars, a private theatrical club where Sinatra
held the title of ``head abbot.'' The tour will include anecdotes
about the chairman of the board's singing and acting careers, his
wives, and the Rat Pack. And you can be sure there will be Sinatra
music in the background. The cost is just $5 a person. For
reservations or more information, call Adventure on a Shoestring at
212-265-2663.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Triple thanks: &LR;  John F. Kennedy Airport in New York has the
reputation of being confusing and sometimes hostile. We'll vouch
for the confusing part, but we found anything but hostility when we
missed an international flight a while back and found ourselves
stranded in the city for 24 hours. Although another airline was
responsible for our tardiness, three Delta employees were quick to
help arrange lodging and another flight. We don't know their names
but we do know their dispositions: sunny. So thanks, you Delta
three.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Cozy:  &LR; AMC Theaters has included ``love seats'' in plans for a
25-screen, 125,000-square-foot movie megaplex on Times Square's
redeveloped 42nd Street. Couples will have the option of lifting
the arm between the seats for a cozier viewing experience. But the
theater opening is months away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Museum of the month: &LR;  The Lower East Side Tenement Museum looks
like ... well ... a tenement. The six-story worn brick building at
97 Orchard St. takes you to the years between 1880 and 1919, when
more than 23 million Europeans moved to America, many living in
cramped and crowded quarters such as this building. There are
rotating exhibits and snapshots of tenement life. One apartment,
for instance, illustrates the life of a single German Jewish mother
in the 1880s who worked at home as a seamstress. Another depicts a
room during the Great Depression. For more information, call (212)
431-0233.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Mailbag: &LR;  From time to time, we run examples of fractured English.
The other day, we created some of that fractured English ourselves
when we wrote that the nickname Tootsie Tech applies to the ``Ohio
Pediatrics College.'' It, of course, is the Ohio Podiatrics College
(or, officially, the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine), and we
like to think the misnomer was merely a typing mistake. (With
thanks to Dr. David B. Alper, president of the Massachusetts
Podiatric Medical Society; Cindy Hoover of Londonderry, N.H.; D.
Burgess of Nova Scotia; and D. Post of somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Did you guess it? &LR;  Of the three, the Bank of Manhattan building, at
927 feet, is tallest. The Metropolitan Life Building is 700 feet
and the Woolworth Building _ the city's original skyscraper _ is
792 feet.

   POLMONEY-DEMS _ WASHINGTON _ The Democratic party exceeded the

according to Federal Election Commission auditors. The commission
has delayed consideration of the audit reports, which were obtained
Tuesday by Cox Newspapers. The commission decided earlier this year
that the Republican Party exceeded the limit for its 1996
convention by $1.7 million. In return for $13.4 million in federal
funds, both parties agreed to spend no outside money on their
conventions. If they don't win appeals, the parties will have to
pay the U.S. Treausry penalties equal to the overpayments. The
audit report on Democrats shows that the bulk of its overspeding
consisted of local and long distance phone bills from the

co-chaired by his brother William, who has since become President

<P>
   MILL RIVER, Mass. _ Long before Roy Blount Jr. became a
humorist, back when he was just another graduate student in English
uneasily home for the holidays, his parents asked what he wanted
for Christmas. A book, he told them: ``The Most of A.J. Liebling.''
Liebling, The New Yorker's press critic, boxing aficionado, and
trencherman supreme, didn't have much of a readership in Decatur,
Ga., back in 1963. Even so, Blount's parents managed to find a copy
for under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   The gift soon demonstrated its utility. When Blount's mother
took the opportunity to inquire about his plans, her son pointed to
Liebling's photograph on the dustjacket. ``I want to be like this
fat Jewish man here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is but one episode in a history of mutual bewilderment Blount
describes _ often hilariously, sometimes laceratingly _ in his new
memoir, ``Be Sweet: A Conditional Love Story.'' That book is part
of a Blount boomlet that includes the recently published ``If Only
You Knew How Much I Smell You'' (his text accompanies Valerie
Shaff's dog photos), and the reissue of his 1980 book,
``Crackers.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother's understandable consternation notwithstanding, the
56-year-old Blount has gone a long way toward fulfilling his
youthful aspiration. He is only borderline stocky and continues a
lapsed Methodist, but he has lived up to his role model in one key
respect. Liebling liked to brag that he could write faster than
anyone who could write better and better than anyone who could
write faster. Blount's preeminence among contemporary humorists has
for some time allowed him to boast (even if he's too modest to)
that he can write funnier than anyone who can write smarter and
smarter than anyone who can write funnier.
</P>
<P>
   Blount divides his time between an apartment on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan and a comfortably snug house in this hamlet in
the southern Berkshires. Dandelions dot his yard, and a river runs
through it. True, the river isn't all that big, but then neither is
the yard. ``That's the Konkapat,'' Blount announces with a
riparian-directed wave, savoring the syllables. ``I enjoy saying
that, Konkapat, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   How Blount came to Mill River says something about him _ and how
he came to stay here says even more. When he and his first wife
divorced in 1972, she moved to the nearby town of Monterey and
Blount came here to share custody of their two children. Seventeen
years later, when he divorced his second wife, Joan
Ackermann-Blount, a writer for the HBO series ``Arli$$,''
Ackermann-Blount kept their house and he bought this one a few
hundred feet away. ``I still don't quite understand it,'' he muses,
``but we all manage to pretty much get along and still like each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The children are grown (Blount even has two grandsons, which he
finds a source of personal delight and chronological consternation)
so more often than not he's in New York now. ``I've pretty much
become a weekend person,'' he says guiltily. ``I can work better in
the city. When I get up here I just like to piddle around in the
yard and walk outside. Whereas in the city when I'm in my high-rise
building, in order to get outside I have to get in the elevator,
and say hello to the doorman and the concierge, and then if they
see me going back and forth three or four times an hour they begin
to wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-bred, Vanderbilt-educated Blount has spent more than
half his life away from the South (in fact, he writes a column for
The Oxford American magazine called ``Gone Off Up North''): as a
grad student at Harvard, as an Army lieutenant, and then, after a
stint on The Atlanta Journal as an editorial writer and columnist,
at Sports Illustrated, followed by the move to Mill River. The
incongruity of his expatriate lifestyle provides frequent grist for
his typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be holding forth about something at, oh, say, the New
York Public Library, and whoever's introducing me will incorporate
the word `redneck' into the introduction and it always throws me.
People still tend to think of Southerners as, well, colorful, and a
little slow and not from around here. It's amazing how people laugh
at you when you take issue at being called a redneck. They don't
mean any harm, but I guess it'll never change. I've never belonged
to any kind of category that anybody feels there's anything wrong
with abusing. Men, Southerners. I kept trying to turn juniorhood
into some kind of class-actionable category, but not even other
juniors take that seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount's name rhymes with (itals)bunt(unitals) and
(itals)punt.(unitals) This is as it should be: Two such relatively
feckless acts evoke the character of a former sportswriter and
lifelong versifier (Blount's best-known poem, ``Song Against
Broccoli,'' reads in its entirety, ``The neighborhood stores are
all out of broccoli/Loccoli'') who as ``a jack of various trades
but primarily a fool by profession'' has made affable bafflement
very much a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Blount calls himself ``a free-range writer'' (which is
presumably like being a freelance writer only the chicken feed is
harder to come by). He's published 14 books and written for 118
publications, a figure that, as such specificity suggests, he takes
pride in. ``I always have two or three magazine pieces that are
overdue,'' Blount says. ``All my life I've been doing 14 things at
once, and I probably always will.'' His works in progress range
from a fairy tale for HBO's animated series ``Happily Ever After''
to an article about going golfing in Ireland with his pal actor
Bill Murray.

 MILL RIVER, Mass.: ... Bill Murray.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the tradition of Robert Benchley, a boyhood idol, Blount is a
performer as well as writer. ``Be Sweet'' includes an exhaustive
list of the network talk shows he's been a guest on (Johnny Carson
once whispered to him during a commercial break, ``So often, comedy
is rooted in sadness''). Blount frequently appears on his friend
Garrison Keillor's ``Prairie Home Companion'' and has had cameos in
Jonathan Demme's ``Married to the Mob'' and ``Philadelphia'' and a
regrettably forgettable 1996 comedy, ``Larger than Life''
(regrettable for Blount since he wrote the screenplay). A one-man
show at New York's American Place Theatre, ``Roy Blount's Happy
Hour and a Half,'' earned glowing reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Blount on stage is pretty much the same as Blount in person: an
energetically gestural talker (body English is one thing, but
Blount's has a drawl, to boot) with a guyishly gruff demeanor that
masks a winning cordiality. The temptation is to call him a
Southern gentleman, except that any such compliment would make
Blount howl (or at least growl) _ nor do Southern gentlemen usually
accessorize tweed jackets with baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking thing about Blount is his manner of speech _
or, rather, the manner of his manner of speech. He's always
qualifying what he says, searching for a better way to put
something, polishing it, editing himself. You'd think you were
talking to a politician, except for the fact it's not loopholes
he's after: It's getting the words (itals)right.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   A free-range writer who freely roams, Blount is about as
miscellaneous as an author can be and not suffer from
multiple-personality disorder. What unites all his work, whether
it's country &AMP; western lyrics or a travel piece about getting
chomped by a piranha-like fish in the Amazon or a manifesto for
``The Singing-Impaired'' (a group Blount forthrightly admits
membership in), is a feverish love of all things lexical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' he says, laughing, when told he could start an
organization called Language-Users Anonymous, and Blount actually
does belong to the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary.
S.J. Perelman excepted, no American humorist has pursued le mot
juste _ or at least le mot juiced _ quite so avidly. It's hard to
think of two more contrasting personas than Perelman's
Yiddish-British manneredness and Blount's down-home (itals)homme
moyen sensual(unitals) (or, if you prefer, Flaubertian good ole
boy); but, for both men, in the beginning was the word.
</P>
<P>
   There is this difference, though: for Blount it's the
(itals)spoken(unitals) word. Back in 1989, discussing the longtime
New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael, a friend and Berkshires
neighbor, he praised her for having ``risen to what is the
distinctive American writer's challenge: which is to create an
eloquent prose style that derives from American speech.'' It's a
description that applies equally well to himself. Far more than
just a very funny man _ which he certainly is _ Blount is a shrewd
and wide-ranging observer of our culture who invariably manages, as
he puts it, ``to get something down on the page while it's still
moving around.''
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``About Three Bricks Shy of a Load'' (1974),
describing a year spent in the company of the Pittsburgh Steelers,
may be the single best volume written about football precisely
because it's as much about aging, race, physicality, and much else
besides as it is about the NFL. ``Crackers,'' an extremely witty
book about the world of Jimmy Carter, has a lot more in common with
W.J. Cash's ``The Mind of the South'' than it does with, say, Lewis
Grizzard, an affinity further demonstrated in the lengthy
introduction and notes for ``Roy Blount's Book of Southern Humor''
(1994). Running through the four humor collections he published
during the '80s is one of the most biting (not to mention amusing)
critiques of Reaganism, and beneath the surface of one of them,
``What Men Don't Tell Women'' (1984) is enough truth, and pain,
about the war between the sexes to make James Thurber or Dorothy
Parker blush.
</P>
<P>
   If Blount has a deep dark secret it's that he's something of a
blusher himself: your basic red-blooded American writer made
slightly uncomfortable by the acuity of his intelligence and the
(dare one say it?) sensitive side of his nature. Intelligence and
sensitivity aren't supposed to be guy things, after all, which is
one thing men (itals)do(unitals) tell women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blount's working at it. What makes his novel, ``First
Hubby'' (1990), so beguiling is that all the laughs can't disguise
the fact that what it really is is a love story _ one whose
narrator-hero happens to be named Guy, no less. And then there's
``Be Sweet,'' which Blount has been working at off and on for most
of a decade, ``a book I've always been dreading writing.'' He
clears his throat. ``Writing about yourself is enormously
embarrassing _ that's for starters _ and now I have to go and talk
about it on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more than himself, though, it's his mother Blount's writing
about in the book, and that's where the embarrassment comes in. At
least his persona's only literary _ and it's funny. For Louise
Blount, her persona was through and through and not exactly
something to smile about. She was a character out of '50s Broadway:
a Tennessee Williams soul and William Inge personality cinched into
a Rodgers and Hammerstein manner. ``Climb Every Mountain''? ``Climb
Every Wall,'' was more like it. Both Blount and his sister, to whom
``Be Sweet'' is dedicated, are still trying to come to grips with
their mother's spun-sugar balefulness 17 years after her death.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book makes you laugh, and much of it makes you ache.
The former response is very Roy Blount, of course, and the latter
... isn't. That the book is a departure for him, he concedes. That
it might differ in the impact it has had on him, this he's not so
sure about. Exorcised some demons? Done some emotional processing?
The shoulders shrug, the eyes roll. ``The notion that writing is
therapeutic in any kind of lasting way is a delusion.'' He pauses a
moment, the humorist sneaking up on the memoirist. ``I mean, if
writing were psychologically good for you there would be an awful
lot of sane writers walking around _ and I haven't noticed many.''

SMALL BANKS HOPE TO CASH IN ON COMMUNITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAINTREE, Mass. _ When Donald C. Olson frets about capital
flight, he is not thinking of an exodus of money from troubled
Southeast Asian banks or of Russian investors who whisk cash abroad
to dodge tax inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Olson is worried about men driving their trucks up to
two trailers on a dusty construction site next to the Bugaboo Creek
steak house _ and stealing his new community bank.
</P>
<P>
   As a hedge against such a scenario, Olson, chairman and chief
executive of Horizon Bank &AMP; Trust Co., a new, pint-sized bank just
south of Boston in Braintree, recently placed two boulders at each
end of the trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled side by side and surrounded by sinkholes and gravel, the
trailers are home to a growing trend in the banking industry _
start-up community banks that see opportunity in a world where
bigger banks are laboring to offer the personalized service that
small-town banks have pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of this bank is the result of the
acquisitions and consolidation that have been taking place over the
last couple of years,'' said Olson, who wore wrinkled khaki
trousers and whose executive trailer suite contained a shovel.
``The small business community is underserved because of the
changes. People are very unhappy with the larger banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some customers,riled by the service disruptions and higher
charges that often accompany bank mergers, are increasingly taking
their business to smaller banks, according to some industry
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, 54 and his senior officers _ small-town bankers who have
spent their careers at tiny financial institutions _ rose to the
top at their banks only to be squeezed out or thrust into a harsh
new world when their companies were taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Olson left UST Corp, a Boston-based supercommunity bank, in
1997, after it took over The Braintree Savings Bank, where Olson
had been president and chief executive. ``I couldn't find a job. So
I started a bank and gave myself one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation sweeping the nation's financial services
sector and creating ever larger banks is intended to help banks cut
costs and boost revenues. But analysts say the merits of size are
not yet proven. In a world where personal service is valued as much
as a network of automated teller machines, community banks are
finding niche opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a better time to start a community
bank,'' said Alex Sheshunoff, head of Alex Sheshunoff &AMP; Co.
Investment Banking, a consulting firm in Austin, Texas. ``But there
has also never been a worse time. The big banks are increasingly
sophisticated in going after the customer and providing service,
which is the one advantage community banks have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with rising stock prices and good prospects for growth,
many community banks are riding high. At a time when the total
number of US banks is shrinking, more than 200 new banks, all
small, were chartered in 1997, a 27 percent rise from 1996,
according to the American Bankers Association, a trade group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a booming economy with low inflation, it is not unusual for
some community banks with less than $100 million in assets to swell
to $3 billion in several years, thanks to growing loans to small
business owners. Some of these banks have become acquisition
targets, producing a windfall for their shareholders and for
founders who own lucrative stock options
</P>
<P>
   Small banks are minnows in a world where mergers have begat
whale-sized institutions. But the small fry are legion _ there are
nearly 8,500 small banks in the United States, with a total of $785
billion in assets, according to the American Bankers Association.
By comparison, BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank Corp., which will
create the country's largest bank when they combine, have a
collective $580 billion in assets. In all, small banks account for
80 percent of the nation's total bank assets yet just 16 percent of
its deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Barbieri points out that small town bankers often live in the
communities where they work. ``We live here; we see our
customers,'' said Horizon's president, James R. Barbieri, who
worked alongside Olson at Braintree Savings Bank but declined to
join. ```Heck,'' he said, ``you're on the soccer field for your
kid's game or at the dump in Hingham, and you're selling accounts
and answering questions.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Olson watched a dozen South Shore banks get bought out
in recent years, he sensed an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, unsure of his future at US Trust and hankering to
run a bank of his own, he contacted Barbieri and John A. Fanciullo,
who was then president and chief executive of Quincy Savings Bank,
a community bank in the Boston suburb of Quincy. With his
mother-in-law in Florida for the winter, Olson set up camp in her
empty Boston apartment to draw up a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I said, we can't start a bank in my mother-in-law's
apartment _ we need an office,'' he said. The men decamped to a
building where staffers shared chairs and all the furniture was
borrowed. Under state law, they needed at least $8 million to
launch a bank.
</P>
<P>
   By May 1997 Olson had found 23 investors and $3.2 million. He
submitted his application, won approval, and began plotting an
initial public offering for November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called the local golf club and the Rotary Club. We went
through the telephone book _ any list we could get,'' Barbieri, 42,
said. ``We grabbed the Hingham phone book and said, `these people
live on a wealthy street. Let's send them a letter.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then an investment banker from Josepthal &AMP; Co., an investment
bank and brokerage in New York, sounded a warning. Investors, he
said, were jittery about the effect of Asia's economic crisis on
the US economy and market. They were in no mood for a unproven,
tiny community bank whose loan portfolio and lifeblood could be
devastated by an economic downturn or change in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   By December 1997, Olson had promises for $4.5 million. But many
investors got cold feet. By the holidays, Olson, who had just
bought a BMW, had only $1 million on hand. It took until last March
to raise the rest. The three men rewarded themselves with $125,000
each in salaries and benefits _ a princely sum for small-town
bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers opted to move into a building under construction in
a shopping area next to Bugaboo Creek. Then the edifice morphed
into a three-story project and fell months behind schedule, putting
Olson behind the August deadline by which he was legally obligated
to open his bank or scrap the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Olson panicked. Last month he ordered two trailers.
</P>
<P>
   There were other decisions to be made. The men nearly came to
blows over what kind of logo-emblazoned corporate freebies they
would hand out to customers. ``We had to decide, do we want key
chains, refrigerator magnets, or chip clips for the opening?''`
Olson said. (The other options were band-aid holders, 7-day pill
containers for the geriatric set, and paddle balls.)
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day in the back trailer that serves as executive
offices, Fanciullo, 47, Horizon's chief operating officer, beavered
away on a computer. Outside, concrete pipe sections lay piled up _
industrial innards strewn across gravel. Bulldozers and cranes
resembling giant praying mantises sp? stood idle in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't look at this and say, `A monkey could open a bank,'''
Barbieri said, ``because it couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Horizon knows it faces competition for small business customers
in the region, which is also served by Fleet, BankBoston Corp. and
a handful of community banks.
</P>
<P>
   It may do some advertising, but only on the cable channels. For
now, Horizon has only one branch _ in the front trailer. The bank
offers simple passbook savings and checking accounts. It offers
none of the credit cards, mortgages or investment products that
larger, one-stop shopping banks provide, although it plans to sell
those products through other firms.
</P>
<P>
   What it lacks in breadth and, for now, sophistication, it makes
up for in smiles and friendly service. ``Our customer isn't
high-tech, he's high touch,'' Barbieri said. ``He comes into the
bank three times a week for business or emotional reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times, Horizon has already refashioned itself.
Originally called South Shore Community Bank &AMP; Trust Co., Olson
chose a new moniker last April when two nearby banks merged and
adopted a name almost identical to that of his bank.
</P>
<P>
   And while he decries the effect of mergers on customer service
and winces at the insult of being downsized, Olson knows the
ineluctability of the changes reshaping the banking world.
</P>
<P>
   ``To grow, we have to establish branches or affiliate,'' he
said. ``Yeah, it could be through a merger. We haven't talked to
people yet or identified a candidate. But it's an option.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York City is having a weekend to remember. After all, you
only celebrate being 100 once in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The ``NYC 100: Centennial Weekend'' June 18 through 21 will be
celebrated in every borough and neighborhood as the city marks its
historic consolidation of 1898 into the New York City of today.
There will be hundreds of free events, spectacular fireworks,
walking tours, a parade, and a garden party.
</P>
<P>
   Centennial Weekend will also launch the NYC 100 Walking Tour
Festival with 21 tours that will be offered every weekend through
July 18 in all five boroughs. On June 20, there will be walks of
the political strongholds on both sides of the river sponsored by
The Museum of the City of New York; on June 21, visitors can step
back in time to ``meet'' the congregants at the Eldridge Street
Synagogue in 1898, and at the Richmond Hill Historical Society in
Queens there will be a walking tour of Victorian Vernacular
architecture, followed by a Victorian picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning June 21 and continuing through Aug. 30 (except July 4
weekend), the New York HistoricalSociety will sponsor Central Park
History Walks on Sundays at 2 p.m. For information and
reservations, call 212-873-3400.

pyrotechnical display. Doing the display will be the famed Grucci
family, who first came to New York through Ellis Island in 1870.
</P>
<P>
   And, ``New York is Free'' on June 21, when more than 100
institutions waive their admission fees or offer special free
events as a gift to the city _ a great opportunity to explore the

   Opening June 25 at the New York Historical Society (2 West 77th
St., telephone 212-873-3400) is Kid City, an interactive exhibition
that simulates the corner of West 82nd Street and Broadway in 1901.
Children can open doors in this Upper West Side neighborhood to
find out about residents, peer inside mailboxes to learn how mail
was sent, and take items from store displays to learn about
shopping in the past. Kid City lets young people learn about the
lives of New Yorkers past and present.
</P>
<P>
   The American Museum of Natural History (Central Park West at
79th Street, telephone 212-769-5800) has just opened a permanent
exhibition devoted to what many scientists believe to be the most
pressing environmental issue of our time _ the need to protect the
variety and interdependence of earth's living things. The new Hall
of Biodiversity features ``The Rainforest: A Diorama for the
Twenty-First Century,'' which immerses visitors into one of earth's
richest ecosystems; ``The Spectrum of Life,'' which depicts the
diversity of life on Earth; and a section that regularly updates
the changing state of biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its 30th anniversary, the Studio Museum in Harlem
(144 West 125th St., telephone 212-864-4500) is offering ``The Fine
Art of Collecting African-American Art,'' which showcases the most
important collection of the art of Black America and the art of the
African Diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's jewels is the Dahesh Museum (601 Fifth Ave. at
48th Street), featuring late-19th- and early-20th-century European
academic art. The museum, known for having exhibitions never before
seen in the United States will, beginning June 30, feature ``Image
and Text: Orientalist Works on Paper'' from the Permanent
Collection, which has 80 rare works of art. The museum is free and
near major hotels and tourist sites such as St. Patrick's
Cathedral.
</P>

TAKE ME HOME, AND BRING ME AN ASPIRIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One afternoon last week, my husband phoned to ask, ``So, when
are you coming home?'' But thanks to the magic of Caller ID, I knew
that he wasn't home _ he was still at his office, too. ``You can't
ask when I'm coming home,'' I told him. ``Unless you're already
there, you mean when am I going home.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, his workplace is much closer to home than mine, so
he could be forgiven for considering himself practically there, by
comparison. Still, it struck me as suspicious: Was it an extension
of his nonstandard (in my Midwestern view), New York-bred use of
bring in sentences where take would be my choice?
</P>
<P>
   Come, go, bring, take _ surely we can at least agree on which
way is which? Or maybe not. I dug out a letter from Nancy Sutton,
who wrote months ago to beg for support in the bring/take campaign
she's been waging ``since we moved to New England 40 years ago,''
to no avail: ``Now the misuse is spreading,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing mysterious about the basic rule: Take (like go)
denotes motion away from the person speaking, bring (like come)
motion toward the speaker. (Dog lovers and students of fine
distinctions will want to add fetch to this list: Whereas bring
implies motion from the addressee's location _ ``While you're up,
bring me a drink'' _ fetch asks a person or a pup to go find
something and bring it back.)
</P>
<P>
   While some usage arbiters think the distinctions are clear-cut _
or should be _ others point to a vast middle ground of bring/take
uses where either verb is possible, depending on the point of view
of the speaker. ``Don't forget to bring the umbrella,'' say the
Merriam-Webster usage guide editors, means that the speaker is
already picturing herself at the outdoor concert, needing the
umbrella, so it's bring, not take, from her point of view.
</P>
<P>
   But they may be projecting her imagination further than they
need to. Ten minutes before leaving, she might say ``Shall we take
an umbrella?'' But with one foot out the door, the same person
might ask, ``Shall we bring an umbrella?'' _ not because she's
imagining herself somewhere else, but because she's farther along
on the excursion than the umbrella is, and now must bring it along.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has a problem with what to say to a person at your
destination: ``Shall we bring our swimsuits when we come to see you
Saturday?'' But add a third party, someone neither here nor there,
and we have the most contentious bring of all: ``I'm going to see
my brother in Iowa, and I'm bringing him a live lobster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Merriam-Webster folks, a tolerant bunch, think it's up to
the speaker to posit a point of view, and none of the audience's
concern. They approve of ``he brought his family back to
Stockholm,'' which I think should appear only in a Swedish
publication; they condone ``She brought him to a professional
educator,'' which would mean, in my language, that the writer is at
the same institution as the professional educator. Though I
generally share their get-a-life attitude toward overzealous
parsers, in this case I think they're missing a logical point.
</P>
<P>
   Take those live lobsters: If you're talking to someone in your
brother's general vicinity _ house, city, state, depending on your
perspective _ you might well say, ``I'm coming to Iowa, and I'm
bringing my brother a live lobster.'' But if you're going somewhere
_ from your listener's point of view _ surely you should be taking,
not bringing, the lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I expect language to submit to mere logic; I was
hoping, though, that bring for take would turn out to be a regional
variant we could call a charming idiosyncrasy, like frappe and
tonic. But it's not that simple: The Dictionary of Regional English
surveys, done in the '60s, found the ``bring Mary to the dance''
usage among older interviewees in several Midwestern states as well
as among younger ones in New York and Boston. Now, it's everywhere.
Wordsman James Kilpatrick cites examples from sea to shining sea,
though not to condemn them: He has no problem with ``I brought my
car in for a tuneup last week,'' whether in LA or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if we need a vox-pop sampling of our own. Readers,
please fill in the blank below with the usage that seems normal to
you, and send it my way, along with any comments; names aren't
necessary, but please note where you spent your linguistically
formative years.

DUE PROCESS, EVEN FOR BIG TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stripped to its basics, this was Roland Maddox's legal claim
against Brown &AMP; Williamson, the manufacturer of Lucky Strikes:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)I liked to smoke, I enjoyed cigarettes, I knew they were
bad for me, I refused to quit, I laughed off the health risks, I
got cancer. What an outrage! The tobacco industry ought to pay me
$100 million.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1954, more than 1,000 lawsuits proceeding on roughly that
theory have been brought against cigarette makers. For only the
third time last week, a jury bought it. Six jurors in Jacksonville,
Fla., awarded the Maddox family $500,000 in compensatory damages
for Roland's cancer (he died last year). They awarded another
$450,000 in punitive damanges to teach Brown &AMP; Williamson a lesson.
``I don't think (the tobacco companies) will have a leg to stand on
much longer,'' one juror told reporters. ``We feel tobacco products
... are dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two previous cases in which a jury returned a verdict
against a cigarette maker, one was later overturned and the second
is on appeal now. Brown &AMP; Williamson's lawyer says this verdict,
too, will be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Three verdicts in 10 years don't add up to a trend. But they do
suggest that some judges and juries will ignore settled law in
order to strike out at Big Bad Tobacco. That should alarm all of
us, smokers and nonsmokers alike.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the tobacco companies prevailed in so many lawsuits
over the years is that the law was crystal clear: One who
voluntarily assumes a risk has no legal claim if harm occurs. This
assumption-of-risk doctrine is tort law at its most basic; law
students learn it in their first semester. The 1965 ``Restatement
of Torts,'' the definitive reference work on the subject, puts it
this way: ``If the user or consumer ... is aware of the danger, and
nevertheless proceeds unreasonably to make use of the product and
is injured by it, he is barred from recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Every American born in the last 100 years has known that smoking
can be harmful. Warnings have appeared on cigarette packs since
1966, and the danger of smoking was common knowledge long before
that. Gallup polls in the 1950s found that the public, by
majorities of 90 percent or so, had heard that cigarettes could
cause cancer. Maddox himself referred to his cigarettes as ``coffin
nails'' and ``cancer sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs suing tobacco companies have variously accused them
of marketing a defective product, of conspiring to cover up
tobacco's hazards, or of failing to warn consumers that nicotine is
addictive. Whatever the charge, the claims are fatuous. The smokers
knew their habit was bad for them; now they want someone else to
pay for their bad judgment. The law is clear that such suits have
no merit. Nevertheless, smokers have kept bringing them, and
lawyers have kept urging juries to disregard the law. Sooner or
later, a jury was bound to do it.
</P>
<P>
   But disregarding the law is dangerous. Much more dangerous than
smoking. Cigarettes threaten only those who use them. Tear up the
legal rules that codify ethics and common sense, and we are all at
risk. It is easy to pervert tort law in order to take a poke at Big
Tobacco. It will prove less easy to get the law back, unperverted,
when a more sympathetic defendant needs protection.
</P>
<P>
   Law and good sense were corrupted in a second courtroom last
week. A Boston judge ruled that tenants living above a busy bar can
refuse to pay rent if they object to the smell of cigarette smoke
from below. In an opinion that thrilled no-smoking activists, Judge
George Daher ruled, ``The tenants' right to quiet enjoyment was
interfered with because of the second-hand smoke that was emanating
from the nightclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish. Those who don't want to experience the smells and
sounds of a bar shouldn't rent an apartment above one. The law does
not permit tenants to stiff their landlords on the rent _ in this
case, $1,450 a month _ just because they can sniff tobacco smoke.
No judge would award free rent to tenants who complained that they
were kept awake by the sound of beer steins clinking late at night.
Or by the odor of liquor wafting up from downstairs. But cast
yourself as an unwilling victim of _ (itals)hiss!(unitals) _
tobacco, and basic landlord-tenant law goes out the window.
</P>
<P>
   It won't stop in Boston. Similar cases have been brought
elsewhere, until now without success. Now, a lawyer at the Tobacco
Control Resource Center exults, antismoking lawyers have the
precedent they need to open a new line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Law that can be shredded for a ``good'' cause is no law at all.
Due process either protects all _ even the unpopular _ or it
protects none.
</P>
<P>
   In a much-quoted scene in Richard Bolt's ``A Man for All
Seasons,'' William Roper urges that the law be set aside so that
Thomas Cromwell can be defeated. No, replies Thomas More, the law
must not be tampered with _ not even to defeat the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   Roper: So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law!
</P>
<P>
   More: Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law
to get after the Devil?
</P>
<P>
   Roper: I'd cut down every law in England to do that!
</P>
<P>
   More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned
round on you _ where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being
flat? ... D'you really think you could stand upright in the winds
that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for
my own safety's sake.

MENTORS' IMPORTANCE EXAMINED IN NEW BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk to Virginia O'Brien and she will tell you mentoring is as
old as Greek mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Odysseus was off sailing the seas around Greece, his
trusted friend and adviser, Mentor, was counseling Odysseus' son,
Telemachus,'' said O'Brien, author of ``Success on Our Own Terms:
Tales of Extraordinary, Ordinary Business Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to the late 1990s and successful executives will
likely tell you that help from a well-placed mentor was the single
most important factor in catapulting a promising employee into a
top job. Mentors warn against dangerous career moves, and guide
employees away from political or cultural mindfields.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien says as much in her book, which offers an inside look at
the corporate and personal lives of women who have crashed through
the glass ceiling, many of them with the help of a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I interviewed women over 40, for example, I found that
most had male mentors because there weren't many women in high
positions to mentor them back in the 1970s,'' says O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also found that many women in the 1970s were too insecure to
reach out to the women around them. They were afraid of losing
their status, or they did not want to upset the relationships they
had established with men on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, many women seek out guidance from female executives, and
a number of organizations have established formal programs that
pair women.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many companies create their own mentoring programs to help
women and minorities succeed and promote diversity. At AT&AMP;T,
managers not only are expected to develop career ladders for such
employees, but their compensation is linked to their ability to
promote diversity throughout the company ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Menttium 100, a national mentoring program for talented women,
pairs midmanagement women with top executives for one year. Once a
month, the women meet with their mentors to discuss concerns and
business topics. The meetings, called peer-networking forums, are
designed to help professional women better position themselves for
promotion. In addition, the program provides a network of key
executives in various industries.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who devoted an entire chapter of her book to mentoring,
said a 1992 Korn Ferry study found that 15 percent of all women
executives had been mentored by other women during their careers.
Other studies have shown that women benefit most from having both
male and female mentors.
</P>
<P>
   What does the mentor receive from the relationship? If he or she
is a senior executive, the person who is being mentored may serve
as a liaison between the executive suite and front-line workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes top managers are not really aware of everything
that is going around within the ranks, which is why the
relationship can help keep him or her abreast of changes _ and
concerns,'' noted O'Brien.
</P>

SMALL BANKS HOPE TO CASH IN ON A SENSE OF COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this Gideon Gartner's last chance?
</P>
<P>
   Gartner, the cantankerous pioneer of the technology consulting
world, is trying for a second time to launch an initial public
stock offering for Giga Information Group Inc., his Norwell, Mass.
company.
</P>
<P>
   The goal: raise as much as $46 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giga tried to jump into a hot IPO market late in 1996 as a very
young company with less than two years' history, a product line
under development, and nothing resembling a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gartner, 62, is pushing to bring Giga public again. Sales
are growing rapidly, the company's research products and delivery
system are recognized as a distinctly new model, and Gartner
himself remains a powerful draw to clients.
</P>
<P>
   But there is trouble too. The small service company has lost a
staggering amount of money, $54.7 million in just three years, and
is running out of cash. Giga's new IPO underwriter, Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co., has given the company a $10 million bridge
loan to help carry it through the stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Early venture investors have been diluted by the financing
requirements of rapid expansion and Giga's working capital deficit
has grown to $13.8 million by March 31. Executive defections and
firings have created a revolving-door management team below
Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is bleeding red ink from every orifice and has been
for a while,'' said Howard Anderson, president of the competing
Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is no Gartner fan and there are many others in the
information technology consulting business who feel the same way.
But Gartner has been a powerful draw with consulting clients and
institutional investors for years. Critics may scoff, but others
don't hesitate to call Gartner a legend in his field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has demonstrated tremendous instincts over the years
about what customers really want,'' said Jeffrey Swartz, a former
senior vice president of marketing at Giga. ``I think the market
will eventually decide'' how to assess Gartner's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that file documents to sell public stock usually are
not permitted to discuss their business except in investor road
show meetings. Calls to Gartner and other Giga executives were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner, routinely characterized by a powerful intellect and
personality to match, has led a high-profile professional and
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tel Aviv and raised in America, Gartner made a name for
himself as a young classical pianist but left music for an
education in engineering and business at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Recently divorced, Gartner's former wife was featured in People
magazine this year making the case that she, not Tipper Gore or
anyone else, was the inspiration for the novel and movie ``Love
Story,'' the product of her years growing up in Brooklyn when both
author Erich Segal and Gartner were friends.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner started his career at IBM Corp. but later went to Wall
Street to become a star stock analyst at E.F. Hutton and
Oppenheimer. It was those years, in the 1970s, when Gartner
developed a strong following among investors and built a reputation
that continues to serve him today.
</P>
<P>
   He formed the Gartner Group in 1979, selling research and advice
to companies using technology instead of investors. His years of
experience at IBM were especially valuable and the company became a
star in a fledgling business.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group went public in 1986 and was sold to Saatchi
and Saatchi Group two years later. He came back to the company,
which went public again, this time as its chairman for a few years,
but left for good in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Gartner Group has since soared, to about $3.2
billion today. Other companies in the industry he helped create
also blossomed, either in their own IPOs or in sales to larger
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc., based in Cambridge, went public in 1996
and now has a stock market value of about $300 million. Meta Group
Inc., another publicly traded research company, is worth $261
million today.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gartner himself is clearly a rich man, it is unlikely he
achieved fabulous wealth comparable with the technology research
industry itself. People who know Gartner say he had discussed his
own personal wealth as being in the range of $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner sat on the sidelines from his home in Aspen for two
years before forming Giga, named after the first two letters of his
names, in 1995. Today, he still owns 31.9 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Giga had a big idea: providing customers access to blanket
technology coverage instead of pigeon-holed research based on
narrow categories of interest. Giga offered its customers access to
lots of analysts with different specialties. Now it distributes
information even more broadly to clients via the Internet for
annual fees of $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner had no problem raising money for Giga, going back to the
investors who had made money on his advice years ago. Among its
largest investors was a partnership led by James D. Robinson III,
the former American Express Co. chief.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner was thinking big from the beginning. He had to spend
heavily on research up front and employed a strategy that worked
well at the Gartner Group: building a very large sales force that
could cover a lot of territory.
</P>
<P>
   But that sales force, now about 100 representatives, was another
huge expense. The cost of sales and marketing last year, about $19
million, equalled all of Giga's revenues in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the research actually sold by Giga has won mixed
reviews. A survey of all technology research firms, conducted last
year by Information Week magazine, placed Giga well into the middle
of the pack in all categories.
</P>
<P>
   Giga has managed to retain about two-thirds of its clients year
to year, a figure below many other research firms' retention rates.
New Giga documents suggest its figure isn't directly comparable to
the rates of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Giga first saw its chance to jump into a hot IPO market in 1996.
An offering led by Lehman Brothers tried to raise $40 million.
Initially, the underwriters estimated an offering at $9 to $11 per
share and favorable reviews during the company's road show led to
hopes of a higher price. But the market began to cool as Giga's
offering drew near and executives pulled the plug at the last
minute, when it appeared they would receive only $6 or $7 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Giga's president, Ken Marshall, left a short time later and
nearly all of the company's senior executives went on to other
jobs. Management turnover became a regular feature at Giga.
</P>
<P>
   The company's top technology officer, Jacques Bouvard, was fired
last October. A month later, new Giga president Henry Givray was
let go. Cofounder David Gilmour gave up his top research post to
start a new company in February, three months before Giga's latest
IPO filing. Gilmour remains a Giga director and works as a
non-employee consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Giga's latest IPO effort may succeed or Gartner could raise more
private money. But the company is still expected to lose money in
the immediate future and has limited cash.
</P>
<P>
   Swartz, the former Giga marketing executive, said it would be a
mistake to count Gartner out now. ``Gideon has an incredible
reputation on Wall Street,'' said Swartz. ``He's proven again and
again that he can pull a rabbit out of his hat.''

   SALT LAKE CITY _ We all got a good look at the 1998-99 Chicago
Bulls in Game 6 of the NBA Finals Sunday night. Two minutes worth.
It wasn't a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan was getting a rest. Scottie Pippen was getting
therapy on his back. Dennis Rodman was watching. The only saving
grace for Chicago was that Utah was resting its big guns, too.
Otherwise it could have been even uglier.
</P>
<P>
   It was a brief look into a future that neither Bulls fans nor
NBC wants to contemplate. The mere thought of, ``Please welcome
Toni Kukoc and your world champion Chicago Bulls ...'' echoing
through the United Center next season is anathema to Chicago fans,
not to mention NBC, the official network of the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, it could happen. Jordan talked a lot in the past
tense after his unforgettable, 45-point performance in the 87-86
clincher. Coach Phil Jackson said he thought only something ``out
of left field'' could change things. (Given that owner Jerry
Reinsdorf's idea of a left fielder is Albert Belle, well, you get
the picture.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it should happen. Can anyone endure another season of the
second-guessing, sniping, waffling, and scrutiny that would surely
envelop the club if it reloaded again? Even this season, especially
in the last two playoff series, the famed Last Dance started to
look more like the Aztec Two-Step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if people realize the kind of stress and tension
that we deal with every day of the year,'' Steve Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma, of course, is that it appears to be an
all-or-nothing scenario for Chicago. If they all come back, they'll
be favored again. If Jordan retires, Pippen goes elsewhere, and
Jackson does his rain forest thing, you're looking at Vancouver
East.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan doesn't want to play without the teammate he calls his
``twin brother,'' the valuable Pippen. The feeling is mutual. If
Jordan does go, do you think Reinsdorf would empty the vault for
Pippen, to try to maintain some semblance of the dynasty?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's seasonlong contingency of having Jackson return may be
earnest, but it's also probably not cut in stone. Pippen said he
thought Jordan still had five years left _ that may be a stretch,
but no one thinks he doesn't have at least one _ and Jordan's
desire to compete and accept challenges is well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would view winning another title without Pippen and
Jackson as a real challenge, Jordan said, ``It would be a pretty
big challenge. The question is, do I want to do that or not? That's
the thing that has to be debated. My answer is that there still are
a lot of unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf probably could assure another run or two with the same
crew by doing two main things: writing a lot of checks with a lot
of zeroes and reassigning general manager Jerry Krause. Neither of
those is seen to be feasible, especially the latter. Reinsdorf and
Krause are tight and they are both a bit agitated by the imperious
Jackson, who has taken on almost a Nixonian/Rileyesque persona
lately. (We couldn't wait to see whom he was going to blame for the
Game 6 loss had Jordan not saved the day.)
</P>
<P>
   What better, more fitting way for Jordan to go out than the way
he did in Game 6? Two big hoops, including the game-winner. A steal
from Karl Malone, who, as the reputed greatest power forward to
play the game, allowed himself to be stripped in that critical
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he wouldn't mind going out the way he did, Jordan
said, ``If that's the case, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   We may have to wait several months to see how this unfolds.
Jackson's status wouldn't be affected by a lockout in the NBA; he's
management, although it's easy to forget that sometimes. But all
the key free agents _ Pippen, Rodman, Jordan, Kerr _ will be
affected. By the time the labor situation is resolved, Jordan may
be eligible for the Senior PGA Tour and Rodman may be a
WrestleMania regular.
</P>
<P>
   They have had a remarkable run. They have never lost an NBA
Final series, a truly incredible achievement. They've never even
been extended to a seventh game in their six Finals appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never see any other team in the future being as dominant
as this ball club has been,'' Pippen said. ``You hate to see it
come to an end. You don't want to see it come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has to sometime. They all seemed to sense that Sunday
night.

LABOR SHOULD BACK HARSHBARGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 25, the Massachusetts AFL-CIO will make a choice _ to
be, or not to be, a force in this year's gubernatorial election.
</P>
<P>
   That is the day when the 400,000-member umbrella organization
for most of the state's major labor unions is expected to endorse
candidates for statewide offices _ including governor. And, based
on some reports, a gubernatorial endorsement by the state AFL-CIO
is not assured.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsements will be decided by the group's Committee on
Political Education, which consists of approximately 60 members who
are executive officers.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate needs the vote of two-thirds of the committee. If a
candidate falls short, he or she does not receive this politically
important endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   And that possibility may present a particularly difficult
dilemma for both the state AFL-CIO and the leading Democratic
contender for governor, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger. Despite
his front-runner status and his oft-repeated public pronouncement
that ``labor's agenda is my agenda,'' various sources say he may
not yet have the support of two-thirds of the panel to gain the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Some committee votes are expected to be cast for the two other
Democratic contenders, former state Senator Patricia McGovern and
former US Representative Brian Donnelly. But it is not likely that
either will get more votes than Harshbarger, who won the
endorsement of the Democratic state convention and has a
significant lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is more of a possibility that if the panel fails to
reach a two-thirds majority to endorse Harshbarger, then no
candidate will receive its support. And that could be more of a
problem for the union than for Harshbarger. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some committee members are also officers of unions who have
disagreed &UR;  &LR; with Harshbarger on certain issues and are reportedly
reluctant to support him.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems a few unions have had with Harshbarger: his
opposition to casinos in New Bedford and Springfield. The unions
saw casinos &UR;  &LR; as &UR;  &LR; job providers, &UR;  &LR;  but Harshbarger felt the economy
should not be based on gambling. Other unions felt Harshbarger did
not move fast enough, or was not tough enough, on firms that
violated wage enforcement laws.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, &UR;  &LR;  a few voting members reportedly may vote not only
for Donnelly or McGovern, but also for Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci. The state's chief executive, along with his GOP rival,
state Treasurer Joseph Malone, declined invitations to attend the
recent AFL-CIO forum organized to help determine labor's strongest
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cellucci has &UR;  &LR;  finally given his support to a raise in
the minimum wage, which had already been endorsed by the Democratic
contenders, most labor officials saw his forum absence as a lack of
support for labor's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Harshbarger gave the strongest endorsement of
labor's agenda, which ranged from better wages for working families
to better education for children.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll of union households in the Boston Herald
Harshbarger emerged as the clear favorite among the Democratic
candidates for governor. &UR;  &LR; For example, 46 percent of union
households supported Harshbarger for governor, &UR;  &LR; while 10 percent
went to McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger received 48 percent support among nonunion
households to &UR;  &LR; McGovern's &UR;  &LR;  17 percent . Overall, Harshbarger
received 47 percent of likely Democratic voters, McGovern 17
percent, and Donnelly 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Harshbarger does not get the committee's necessary two-thirds
vote, it will not be as much a loss for him as it would be for the
AFL-CIO . If there is no AFL-CIO endorsement for governor, the
group, which has reflected organized labor's growing clout in
recent years, could see its image and strength diminished.
</P>
<P>
   One &UR;  &LR;  way to ensure the AFL-CIO will be a winner in the November
election is to endorse the only Democrat who can win _ Harshbarger.

GROWTH WILL KILL SAN PEDRO RIVER, REPORT CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Without new efforts to manage growth and conserve
water, the San Pedro River will dry up, ruining one of North
America's best bird sanctuaries, an international report concluded
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented study by the Commission for Environmental
Cooperation concluded what environmentalists have warned for a
decade: that excessive pumping of underground water will lower the
river enough to kill trees along Arizona's last major undammed
waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The study, done in connection with the North American Free Trade
Agreement, identified the U.S. Army intelligence post at Fort
Huachuca and the adjacent town of Sierra Vista as two of the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the recharge capacity of the regional aquifer
is now being exceeded due to pumping,'' said the report,
``Sustaining and Enhancing Riparian Migratory Bird Habitat on the
Upper San Pedro River.''
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for cutbacks in water pumping on both sides of
the Arizona-Sonora border, an increase in eco-tourism opportunities
and controlled growth in a region where groundwater pumping has
increased fivefold since 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The report was immediately denounced by local government
officials, who resent the idea of an international group _
representing the U.S., Mexico and Canada _ intruding on the affairs
of their community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report hurts,'' said Sierra Vista City Councilman Harold
Vangilder. ``It doesn't tell any of the story and gives ammunition
to the people who would attack Fort Huachuca and this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the report was released, the Arizona Legislature
voted, earlier this year, for a memorial attacking the San Pedro
River study. It asked Congress to ``refuse to ratify or adopt
future treaties that subject the states to international intrusion
or authority over states' environmental matters.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the commission has no regulatory authority and relies
entirely on voluntary self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The report maintains that ``the people of the Upper San Pedro
Basin . . . will . . . largely define the future of the riparian
bird habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are also the ones with the most at stake and the most to
lose if this extraordinary habitat is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Pedro between the Mexico border and Benson was protected
by Congress in 1988 as the nation's first riparian conservation
area. In 1995, it was recognized by the American Bird Conservancy
as the Western Hemisphere's first ``Globally Important Bird Area.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that it is home to 390 bird species, including
250 Neotropical migratory birds, which move between the United
States and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The report praised water conservation, recycling and recharge
efforts already undertaken by the Army and throughout Cochise
County. However, it warns that these measures are not enough, and
the local citizenry needs to be open to additional actions.
</P>
<P>
   Without local support, a solution is doubtful, the report
stated, ``and over time demand fueled by uncontrolled growth could
overwhelm other measures (already) adopted to address the water
budget deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Block, director of the Montreal-based commission, said his
organization's objective was to develop ways for groups in Arizona
and Mexico to cooperate and find solutions that will keep the San
Pedro flowing, without substantially harming the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It currently is on an unsustainable course,'' Block said.
``Unless a growth management strategy is put in place, (further
expansion) could lock in the water deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Tucson-based
Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, said the report backs up
what environmentalists have said all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report, hopefully, will have settled once and for all the
fact that the San Pedro River is being killed by development,''
said Suckling, whose organization petitioned the commission last
year to do the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficult work is ahead of us now to solve this problem.
Whether any of the local county supervisors and City Council
naysayers will accept any of this is the real question.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Hansen, spokeswoman for Sierra Vista, said the city
government did not support doing the report but will attempt to
circulate it to as many people as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Public meetings are planned next month to solicit public
comment. The report will be formally delivered to a panel of local
and state government officials in September.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was formed under an environmental side agreement
required before NAFTA was signed by President Clinton and ratified
by Congress in 1993. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
AN ENLIGHTENING STUDY OF STARR AND THE PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- With too much vehemence, Independent
Counsel-For-Life Kenneth Starr has sought to deny that of which he
was not accused in order to knock over straw men he has himself
erected.
</P>
<P>
   As his ox was being gored last weekend, Starr protested that not
once had he ever leaked so much as a milligram of ``grand jury
material'' and had spoken or authorized prosecutors' conversations
with journalists only to correct misinformation that might
otherwise be disseminated, all for that most noble of purposes, to
``engender public confidence.'' Oh, and what he was doing is not a
crime, and is _ like subpoenas of mothers, bookstores, dead men's
and live clients' attorneys _ par for the course in the
crook-catching game.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, everybody does it, and it's not illegal. I
assume my Clinton-hating friends will note the irony.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to obliterate this nonsense is to spend a couple of
hours with Steve Brill's 30,000-word examination of the press and
Starr in the early weeks of the Monica Lewinsky investigation,
contained in his new magazine about the media, Content.
</P>
<P>
   The meat of the article is definitely not about the leaking of
grand jury material, and the fact that Starr and some of his senior
prosecutors meet with journalists regularly and privately is not
the article's chief focus either. Instead, it is in large part
about the use of the press to put information of dubious veracity
into the public domain without serious double-checking.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, while motive is not a fit subject for speculation, the
timing of these disclosures and their impact clearly worked in
tandem _ investigative information is selectively disclosed close
enough to a grand jury appearance to make it look like the
functional equivalent of it, and it has the effect of adding to the
pressure on Lewinsky to tell the prosecutors what they want to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   Example: While President Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, was
still a grand jury witness, The New York Times reported
characterizations of what she had to say to ``investigators'' about
supposedly being coached by the president that were disputed by her
lawyers. This was followed by a meeting between two of its
reporters and Starr and his deputy, Jackie Bennett Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Example: A Washington Post story about retired Secret Service
agent Lewis Fox, also at the time of his grand jury appearance, was
hyped to suggest that he could swear Clinton and Lewinsky were once
``alone'' for about 40 minutes. The story ignored other comments in
other venues by Fox that greatly undercut the significance of his
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The practice also extended to unofficial arms of the
prosecutor's office, like New York literary agent Lucianne
Goldberg, the friend and book agent wannabe for Starr's star
witness and secret Lewinsky-taper, Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters were desperate for tidbits from Tripp's tapes
that were being played for Starr's grand jury, Goldberg was one of
the tidbit suppliers. One of her best moves was to tell ABC News of
a Lewinsky dress, allegedly with semen stains on it. Goldberg then
added, out of the blue, that Lewinsky claimed to have saved the
dress.
</P>
<P>
   Brill is one-dimensional in his focus on reporters, neglecting
the unsung and unexamined enablers of modern tabloidization called
editors. He also should have included at least some context, above
all the fact that information-dispensing was routinely practiced to
his shame by Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, and admitted to
in his memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Brill article is causing the press-prosecutor
wagons to be circled here. The best clue is wildly varied press
coverage (the lead story, for example in yesterday's Los Angeles
Times, with not a word allowed into The Washington Post).
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate context, though, is to be found in the Watergate
analogy Kenneth Starr so valiantly tries to make in his routine
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Richard Nixon had Archibald Cox fired, the
prosecutor spoke with two members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Edward Kennedy and the late Phil Hart, and let slip a
piece of evidence given him months before by a scandal figure,
former Attorney General Richard Kleindienst.
</P>
<P>
   When the information appeared in print, Cox was so appalled he
might have been the indirect source, he turned himself in to the
committee, endured a public thrashing and even a brief bar
association inquiry _ even though he turned out not to have been
the cause of the evidence's disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   That was an ethical man. Today, political investigations so
flout the rules with the press's competitive connivance that they
could not withstand even a moment's scrutiny. That's why the wagons
are circulating.

`CHARM' LACKING AT CHURCHILL DOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything was set up nicely for Silver Charm in Saturday's
Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs, but then he lost the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Reality, in the form of the victorious Awesome Again, intruded
on the best-laid plans of Churchill officials, who raised the purse
of the Foster from $500,000 to $750,000 to attract last year's
3-year-old champion, and of Silver Charm's trainer, Bob Baffert,
who chose the Foster over the Massachusetts Handicap May 30 and the
Hollywood Gold Cup June 28. Both of those races were spots to face
handicap champion Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   Off as the 2-5 choice under Gary Stevens, Silver Charm could not
handle Awesome Again, who was getting 14 pounds (127 to 113), in
late stretch, losing by a length to the 5-1 shot ($13.80 to win)
and Pat Day in the time of 1:48 3/5 for 1 1/8 miles. Semoran,
Silver Charm's stablemate, set the pace to the eighth-pole and
managed to finish third under Kent Desormeaux despite bowing a
tendon in the final yards. Semoran was retired Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do enough with Silver Charm before the Foster,'' said
Baffert, who had not started the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner since capturing the Dubai World Cup March 28. ``If I had
known I was going to give away 14 pounds to a good horse, I would
have done more.''
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again, a 4-year-old son of Deputy Minister, had started
only once this year, winning an allowance race by 7 lengths at
Churchill May 22. However, he was a serious player last year,
winning the Queen's Plate at Woodbine and the Jim Dandy at Saratoga
before running third as the favorite in the Travers. He then
finished fifth in the Super Derby at Louisiana Downs Sept. 28 and
was laid up for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always sorry to see Silver Charm and horses of his caliber
lose, but if we were going to beat him I thought it might be when
he was coming off a layoff,'' said trainer Pat Byrne, who this year
took over Awesome Again from David Hofmans. ``Our horse was fresh
and he had a good race under his belt over the track. We'll
definitely go to Saratoga with this horse. We want to get a Grade I
(the Whitney) for him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for racing fans is that Silver Charm's loss
dropped him behind Skip Away in the race for Horse of the Year and
now Baffert, who has been taunted by Sonny Hine, Skip Away's
trainer, for ducking him, is going to have to stop playing it cute
and come out to fight. Now, Baffert not only is pointing Silver
Charm to a meeting with Skip Away in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar
Aug. 15 but also wants to give his popular gray star, who has never
been worse than second in his career (14-8-6-0), a race before that
as a prep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to find something for him,'' said Baffert, who said
Silver Charm was ``big and heavy'' following his loss. ``I'm
looking everywhere.''

Matchmaker misses
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the Foster, Baffert turned thumbs down on a $2 million
match race between Silver Charm and Skip Away in late July at
Laurel. The proposal was made by Joe DeFrancis, president of the
Maryland Jockey Club. ``I've talked casually to the connections of
both horses about it and I think that the Skip Away people are very
interested in it, but trainer Bob Baffert is concerned about
running Silver Charm in the heat in the summertime,'' said
DeFrancis. ``At this stage, I don't think there's much likelihood
that it's going to happen.'' ... Semoran, who almost came to the
MassCap before Baffert opted to run him in the Foster, will
recover, but the 5-year-old son of Phone Trick is too valuable to
return to racing. ``He'll be all right,'' said Baffert. ``There was
no bone damage but he will be retired. He'd need a year off to be
able to come back.'' Semoran won the Cornhusker Handicap at Prairie
Meadows and the Kentucky Cup Classic at Turfway Park last year, and
retires with a record of eight wins from 22 starts and more than
$860,000 in earnings ... Byrne also trains Touch Gold, who stopped
Silver Charm's Triple Crown bid in last year's Belmont Stakes when
he was trained by Hofmans, and he's counting on Awesome Again and
Touch Gold to form a powerful 1-2 punch by the fall. Byrne gave up
2-year-old champion and Horse of the Year Favorite Trick and
2-year-old filly champion Countess Diana, both of whom went to Bill
Mott, to become private trainer for Frank Stronach, who owns
Awesome Again and Touch Gold. ``You can tell them that Touch Gold's
trainer will have two for the (Breeders' Cup) Classic,'' said Byrne
after the Foster. Touch Gold, who has not raced since finishing
ninth and last in last year's Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood
Park, is working forwardly at Churchill and Byrne expects to get
him a start in July at Belmont Park.

<P>
   Formal Gold, owned by Jack Murphy of Quincy and trained by Bill
Perry, will enter stud at Gainsway Farm in Lexington, Ky., in 1999.
A son of Black Tie Affair, Formal Gold engaged in a memorable
series of duels with Skip Away last year, defeating him in the Donn
Handicap at Gulfstream, the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth, and the
Woodward Stakes at Belmont, while Skip Away turned the tables in
the MassCap and the Suburban at Belmont. Formal Gold suffered a
fracture of the right hind leg while training for the Breeders' Cup
Classic, which Skip Away won, then injured his right front ankle in
April and was retired with a record of 16-8-4-1 and more than $1.5
million in purses. ``Formal Gold is very special to me and we took
our time finding the right farm that will give him every
opportunity to prove himself as a stallion,'' said Murphy. ``We are
very pleased he will stand at Gainsway.'' ... Deputy Commander, who
won the Travers and Super Derby last year, has been retired. The
son of Deputy Minister suffered a small tear in the suspensory
ligament of his right front leg while competing in the Californian
at Hollywood Park May 31. ``It was a great run,'' said trainer
Wally Dollase. ``He was a hell of a horse.'' Deputy Commander, who
also was second in the Breeders' Cup Classic, goes to the breeding
shed with four wins from 13 starts and nearly $2 million in
earnings ... Free House, who was third in last year's Kentucky
Derby, second in the Preakness, and third in the Belmont Stakes, is
training well at Hollywood for his return to the races. Trained by
Paco Gonzalez, Free House, who won the Swaps Stakes at Hollywood
last July but has not raced since finishing sixth in the Super
Derby, will make his '98 debut in either the Triple Bend Handicap
on the Hollywood Gold Cup undercard or in the Bel Air Handicap July
11.

MESSAGE TO MICHAEL: BOW OUT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ He shouldn't come back.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan should walk away for good, leaving us with the
perfect closing line, like Humphrey Bogart talking about the
beginning of a beautiful friendship, or Clark Gable not giving a
damn. Would ``Gone With the Wind'' or ``Casablanca'' be better
movies if the directors had added another scene?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan left on top on the mountain in Salt Lake City Sunday
night. He scored 45 points, carrying an old, wounded team to a
sixth championship in eight years. With his team trailing by 3
points and 41.9 seconds to play, he: 1. scored on a driving layup;
2. stole the ball from Karl Malone; and 3. faked Bryon Russell into
the next century, then swished a 17-foot textbook jumper from out
top.
</P>
<P>
   On what might have been the final shot of his career, Jordan
looked a little like a ballet dancer, extending his right arm and
leaving it out there long after the ball had ripped through the
net. His basket put the Bulls ahead by 1 and shocked the Utah
crowd. I expected lightbulbs to explode all over the scoreboards,
like in the final scene from ``The Natural.''
</P>
<P>
   What more can be achieved if Jordan returns? Scottie Pippen is
as good as gone, and that goes double for coach Phil Jackson. Does
Michael really want to spend his final year(s) trying to carry a
mediocre team all by himself? He did that already. Remember when he
scored 63 against the Celtics in the '86 playoffs _ and lost the
game?
</P>
<P>
   Those early days of Michael seem so far away. He was the third
pick in the 1984 draft. Houston taking Hakeem Olajuwon was
understandable, but Portland's selection of Sam Bowie at No. 2 is
still worthy of a class-action lawsuit by Blazer fans.
</P>
<P>
   There were some doubters and detractors in the early years.
Young Michael could jump out of the gym and had enormous hands
(like Julius Erving) that made the game easier for him. Some
veterans scoffed when he played wearing his own line of sneakers
and Isiah Thomas was one of the East All-Stars who ``froze'' rookie
Jordan out of the action at the 1985 All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's '86 Celtics handed off to Magic's '87-88 Lakers, who
dished it to Isiah's '89-90 Pistons. Then came Michael's time. And
what a time it was.
</P>
<P>
   The ``best ever'' argument is pretty much over. Bird was one of
the last to concede. As late as 1990, he still said, ``People talk
about me and Magic and now Michael. I can tell you who the best
ever was. It's Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. Hell, it's right
there in the book. Look it up. Russell won 11 championships.
Chamberlain averaged 50 points a game over a whole season!''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan didn't win 11 championships, but he won six in eight
years and would have had eight if he hadn't taken two years off for
baseball (or a commissioner-ordered silent suspension for his
gambling debts and associates). Winning six in eight years in a
29-team league (there were 27 when the Chicago run started in
'90-91) seems almost as impressive as 11 in 13 years in an eight-
to 14-team league.
</P>
<P>
   But the absolute best thing about Jordan is his wonderful merger
of hunger and talent. Some guys want the ball but don't have the
skills. There are plenty of players with the ability who don't want
the ball. Jordan always gave us both.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being Phil Jackson. Your most talented player is also
the one who works hardest, plays the best defense, and wants the
ball in the last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may go down as the last great American athlete who played
just to win championships. Larry and Magic were like that, but
Shaquille O'Neal isn't. Neither is Antoine Walker. And there's not
a baseball player on the planet who'd choose to win a World Series
if if meant making Donald Fehr unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Michael had a chance to win Title VI in Chicago last Friday but
his buzzer-beating prayer missed everything. This is what he said
after the game: ``I was sitting there, thinking about the whole
thing. I knew I wanted the ball, but no one knew what was going to
happen. Me, you, and no one who was watching the game. I love those
moments. Great players thrive on that because they have an
opportunity to decide happiness and sadness. That's what you live
for. That's the fun part about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the comment of a true champion, and two days after making
the statement, Jordan put himself back in the same position and
delivered the goods like no one before him.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if Jordan were a tad more political, speaking
out against the high price of Nike shoes and the low price of Nike
wages. It would be powerful if Jordan made gun control his life's
work after his father was murdered with a handgun. But not every
person is political. It was never Michael's way.
</P>
<P>
   To the finish, he gave us a true American sports hero. We didn't
have to know about his private life or tell our kids to be like
Mike. But it was always OK to tell them to play like Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Playing like Mike doesn't mean you have to jump the highest or
be the best. It means you play every day, and get the most out of
what you've got. It means you play for fun, without fear of
failure. And it means you play to win championships.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing more to say and no more ball for Michael to
play. I hope he walks, and leaves us with the perfect finish from
the best there ever was.

AIRPORT USES MECHANICAL `POOCH' TO SNIFF FOR BOMBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Security officers at the San Francisco
International Airport are using a computerized canine to sniff for
explosives inside luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The airport's ``explosive trace detector'' doesn't look like the
robotic pooches of science-fiction films. Rather, the trace
detector is as drab as its name _ a squarish, blandly colored box
the size of a medium-sized television set. It is so inconspicuous
that passengers ignore it as they stream past security checkpoints
toward aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   All passenger luggage is X-rayed inside standard X-ray machines.
But since late last year, some luggage also has been checked for
organic molecules wafting from any nitroglycerine or other
explosives that might be concealed in luggage.
</P>
<P>
   A security officer sniff-tests luggage by taking a clean,
circular slip of paper and wiping it over the luggage. Then the
paper is inserted into a hole in the explosive trace detector.
</P>
<P>
   Usually within seconds, a light on the computer screen declares:
NO ALARM. That means the luggage is safe.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally, the computer flashes the word ``NITRO.'' That
means it has detected organic molecules _ chains of carbon atoms
with other atoms attached, such as nitrogen _ characteristic of the
explosive nitroglycerine.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, in all such cases to date at the San Francisco
airport, the passenger has proven to be innocent of evil intent. He
or she is really transporting nitroglycerine, but it's the kind
used in trace amounts to treat heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the device sometimes flags innocent passengers who have
been exposed to organic molecules used for legitimate purposes, as
in farming or construction work, airport spokesman Ron Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The device, manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Manassas, Va.,
also can identify TNT and other common explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's looking for is any of the atoms given off by an
explosive material. It's like being around an orange: You know the
orange is there because you can smell it a little bit,'' said Bob
Collins, president of the Aviation Crime Prevention Institute in
Hagerstown, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Not all luggage is selected for ``sniffing.'' Airport security
personnel say that passengers are ``randomly'' selected for
sniffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not detect a knife,'' said Romila Deo, operations
manager for the checkpoint at the San Francisco airport's Concourse
E.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco airport was the first in the nation to test
the explosive trace detector, Wilson said. The devices cost from
$50,000 to $60,000 each.

TRAVEL READING THAT KEEPS THE ARMCHAIR ADVENTURER IN STITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Several years ago, needing something to read, I
was poking around a bookstore. A couple aisles over, I could hear
an odd cackling sound coming from the travel section. It was rather
loud: people all over the store were looking up to see what was
going on.
</P>
<P>
   I walked over there to see a middle-aged man, his face contorted
into the kind of grin that makes your jaw hurt after a while. Then
came the cackling again, followed by a sigh as he wiped a tear of
laughter from his eye.
</P>
<P>
   I maneuvered myself into position to see what he was reading. It
was ``Neither Here Nor There,'' by someone named Bill Bryson. I
could also see that it was the store's only copy.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the cackling man put the book back on the shelf,
after carefully folding over the corner of a page to mark his
place. Before he could turn back I reached past him and snatched
the book. The grin vanished from his face and he shot me a glance
that would, in the words of P.G. Wodehouse, open an oyster at 20
paces.
</P>
<P>
   I barely noticed. I opened the book at random and started
reading. It was a book about traveling through Europe, and here was
Bryson's description of ordering Kalbsbrann in a restaurant in
Bavaria with his friend Stephen Katz:
</P>
<P>
   ``A minute later the proprietor appeared at our table, looking
hesitant and embarrassed, wringing his hands on a slaughterhouse
apron.
</P>
<P>
   ```Excuse me so much gentlemans,' he said, `but are you knowing
what Kalbsbrann is?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other and allowed that we did not.
</P>
<P>
   ```It is, how you say, what ze little cow thinks wiz.'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon I was cackling to myself and heading to the cash register,
avoiding the glance of the no-longer-cackling man who wasn't going
to get the book back. The phrase is much overused these days, but
``Neither Here Nor There'' was literally, demonstrably,
laugh-out-loud funny.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished it I immediately went out and bought Bryson's
``The Lost Continent,'' his tale of traveling through small-town
America. It was, if anything, even funnier. Next I read ``The
Mother Tongue'' and ``Made in America,'' Bryson's histories of the
English language, which managed to be both scholarly and hilarious
at the same time. Then I read ``Notes from a Small Island,'' a
hysterical account of Bryson's journey around Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   These books were not always easy to find: Bryson regularly tops
the best-seller lists in Britain, where he has lived most of the
last 20 years, but the Iowa-born author is not as well known as he
ought to be in his native land.
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting this will change with the publication of ``A Walk in
the Woods,'' (Broadway Books) Bryson's tale of walking _ or at
least attempting to walk _ the Appalachian Trail, which runs 2,100
miles along the spine of the eastern seaboard, from Georgia to
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Part of book's charm comes from the fact that Bryson was
breathtakingly ill-suited to the task, after, as he put it, ``years
of waddlesome sloth.'' Hardly a hair-shirted outdoorsman, Bryson
obsessed about the dangers he'd face: ``The woods were full of
peril _ rattlesnakes and water moccasins and nests of copperheads;
bobcats, bears, coyotes, wolves and wild boar; loony hillbillies
destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and
generations of profoundly unbiblical sex; rabies-crazed skunks,
raccoons, and squirrels; merciless fire ants ... ''
</P>
<P>
   I recently asked Bryson what possessed him to set out on a
journey of this sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to do a really long version of a Lake
District walk _ a Lake District walk times a thousand,'' he said,
referring to the region of Britain. ``I thought I'd lose some
weight, get fit and see a bit of the country. I had no idea how
difficult and demanding it was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the surprises of the book, for dedicated Bryson readers,
was his choice of hiking partners: Stephen Katz, his Europe
companion of 25 years ago and comic foil from ``Neither Here Nor
There.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Bryson described him in that book: ``Katz was the
sort of person who would ... announce his farts by saying, `Here
comes a good one. You ready?' and then grade them for volume,
duration and odorosity, as he called it. The best thing that could
be said for traveling abroad with Katz was that it spared the rest
of America from having to spend the summer with him.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered why Bryson would go on another trip with Katz, and
why, after what he'd written about his erstwhile pal, Katz would go
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really uneasy with the idea of going by myself. I asked
everyone I knew to go with me, and Katz was the only one who said
yes,'' Bryson said. ``He's been an unbelievably good sport about
everything. I knew that I'd have a lot of comic material with him
along, and it gave the book the dimension of being a sequel.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz is a one-dimensional cartoon character in ``Neither Here
Nor There,'' but in ``A Short Walk'' his efforts to cope with
alcoholism give him depth and poignancy. By the end of the book I
could see why Bryson, beneath it all, was so fond of him.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bryson's stated goals was to rediscover America after 20
years (he moved back to New England before beginning the hike), but
the America he rediscovered was the America of 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd stand up on a mountaintop and look out over miles and
miles of unbroken wilderness,'' he said. ``If you wanted to step
back into the world of Daniel Boone, this was it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bryson, like all but a few who set out each spring
to walk from Georgia to Maine, failed to achieve their goal. By his
estimate he walked 870 miles, or 39.5 percent of the Appalachian
Trail.
</P>
<P>
   His misfortune was our good fortune: Bill Bryson has produced a
book that has once again left me cackling out loud and grinning
until my jaw ached.

NO ONE TOLD THE FISH THAT EL NINO'S OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Everybody's been chanting ``Adios to El Nino,''
but the fish in San Francisco Bay and along the Pacific Coast have
been speaking another language.
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions of the end of El Nino by the end of June,
the continuing saga of the biggest ocean temperature tantrum in
history turned up several new bizarre episodes in the past week.
The consequences are making this the story of the 1990s for
California outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The latest series of events started in San Francisco Bay earlier
this month when the bait trawler Johnny T out of Fisherman's Wharf
set its huge net around what appeared to be an acre of schooling
anchovies. When the net was tightened and drawn in, it turned out
that the fish were not anchovies, but adult sardines in numbers
that haven't been seen in the Bay in generations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another swirling horde of sardines was spotted
just 100 yards off the beach at Pacifica, another anomaly, and a
pod of 40-foot gray whales moved in right behind them, targeting
the baitfish like giant torpedoes, scooping, breaching and playing
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, off the Marin coast along the Point Reyes National
Seashore, I've seen the same thing in the past month, the whales
are feeding and frolicking so close to the beach that you could hit
them by skipping a sand dollar across the ocean surface.
</P>
<P>
   When there is something to eat, everybody in town with an
appetite can show up. And so it is now for striped bass, rockfish,
and believe it or not, even albacore and tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Striped bass? Fishing for striped bass has been generally poor
for years. With the sardines in the Bay, though, the bass are
schooling up and corralling them, just like the best days ever of
Bay fishing in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Art Roby was one of the first to find them, at the reefs
just west of Alcatraz, and he took 20 people out on his boat New
Huck Finn. They caught 40 striped bass (2-fish limits) to 21
pounds, 17 halibut to 24 pounds, 3 lingcod and 9 rockfish.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Armand Castagna of the Imagine heard that several San
Francisco Giants were injured, so he called Giants manager Dusty
Baker to go fishing and salved the week by catching 13 stripers to
18 pounds in three hours. Yeah, it's like living in a time machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the beach at Pacifica, there have also been stripers and a
sprinkling of salmon chasing the sardines just north of the pier at
Sharp Park, trapping the baitfish against the back of the surf
wall, complete with hovering, diving and feeding birds.
</P>
<P>
   Well, when it comes to fishing, a lot of people have difficulty
with the truth, but birds never lie. Evenings have seen anglers who
have seen those birds out on the beach, then reaching the fish with
long casts with Worm-Tail jigs and Hair Raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the feed has also drawn huge numbers of rockfish and
lingcod to inshore waters on the San Mateo County coast, especially
between Pescadero and Pigeon Point. This is just in 100 feet of
water on in, a wonderful and crazy scenario for anglers who have
been able to use light tackle and fish as if in a lake.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been eye-popping. In four trips, a total of 60
people caught 900 rockfish (15-fish limits), 67 lingcod to 27
pounds and 127 cabezone to 12 pounds, all in less than 100 feet of
water. That's just plain unheard of, but it's now the daily deal.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more, maybe the stunner of all: Fieldscout Bob
Franco on his boat Fishing Machine left from Half Moon Bay last
weekend and caught a bluefin tuna at Guide Seamount. What? Tuna?
Yep, the fish don't know, apparently, that El Nino is supposed to
be about over and they should be down off San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the sea surface temperature anomaly is still
in force, an average of three to four degrees above normal along
the California coast and as much as nine degrees above normal 100
miles offshore. That is why albacore have been discovered at two
spots, 15 miles offshore of Point Reyes between Cordell Bank and
Soap Bank, and out of Half Moon Bay at Guide Seamount.
</P>
<P>
   Is this for real? You decide. Generally, the prospects for
albacore off the Bay-area coast can be predicted by early-summer
scores out of Morro Bay in central California, fish that are
usually migrating north. So get this: A half dozen commercial boats
out of Morro Bay all had 100-fish days on albacore recently.
</P>
<P>
   It sure sounds like El Nino, but hey, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the official source on the matter, says
it's the tail end of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modelers predict that equatorial El Nino Sea Surface
Temperature conditions will return to normal by June-July.'' That's
the word from NOAA's special El Nino site on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   They better start consulting with the fish. Sardines in the Bay?
Whales in the surf? Stripers, rockfish, marauding like the good old
days? Rockfish biting like a guard dogs getting hold of a burglar's
rear end?
</P>
<P>
   That's right, and, thanks to El Nino, it's happening here and
now. There's nothing else like this anywhere across the rest of
North America.

AN OUTSIDER COMES IN FROM THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Here's a story that never happens:
</P>
<P>
   After seeing photographs of paintings, top Manhattan art dealer
Phyllis Kind flies to Seattle solely to see a painter who has never
exhibited before. Not anywhere. Nor has this painter shown her work
to anyone even remotely associated with art, meaning she had no
track record and no contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kind suggests a solo show. When it takes place seven
months later, it generates feverish sales and avid reviews,
including a long one in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The story that never happens happened to Marilee Stiles Stern of
Seattle, who had her first show at Phyllis Kind Gallery in January.
</P>
<P>
   Still unknown locally, she is rapidly developing a following in
New York, and this isn't her first foray into the spotlight there.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, she joined the New York City Ballet Company under the
direction of George Balanchine. He had discovered her when she was
14 and chose her to dance in the newly formed Ballet of Los Angeles
under his direction.
</P>
<P>
   A dancer all her life, she began painting eight years ago as
part of therapy. She is recovering from dissociative identity
disorder, previously known as multiple personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   None of the inner chaos that has plagued her is evident when
meeting her. At 48, she is gracious, soft-spoken but articulate and
full of quiet self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   The assurance is hard won. Stern eventually painted a portrait
of the teenage dancer who charmed Balanchine. Standing artfully en
pointe and possessing a long, supple body, the dancer, whose body
is in profile, turns her face over her shoulder to the audience,
and her head is full of monstrous things.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has mixed memories of herself as a dancer. While she
thinks of Balanchine as a genius and cherishes her time working
with him, the day-to-day life in the company was a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers taking Ex-Lax and throwing up with the other
dancers to stay thin, but back then, she said, ``those things
didn't have a name and we didn't realize anything was wrong with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In her view, Balanchine saved her, rescuing her from an abusive
family and giving her the art of dance to concentrate on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an abusive family, the child is the parent's tool,'' she
said. ``In a dance company, the dancer is the tool of the
choreographer. I was used to being a tool, but in dance it makes
sense and serves a larger good.''
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating is key in dance, but it's hard work for a multiple
personality. Stern remembers walking in the city saying the names
of the streets to herself, the stores she passed, the number of
people waiting for a light _ anything to keep her mind focused on
the present and in control of the voices in her head.
</P>
<P>
   Just as throwing up seemed OK, she wasn't aware there was
anything wrong with having voices.
</P>
<P>
   The necessity of maintaining rigid control both helped and
hampered her as a dancer. While she could follow rules beautifully,
she could never let go and merge with the music.
</P>
<P>
   After she had been with the company six years and failed to
secure major roles, she met with Balanchine to ask about her
future. ``He told me some dancers mature early and some late, and
that I was one of the late. He said he needed a dancer to be able
to do batterie, or fast beats, something I didn't do well. Instead
of hurrying to the studio to practice, I decided that he hated me
and left the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly under pressure from the voices in her head, she
danced with the Los Angeles Ballet for two years, the Zurich Opera
Ballet for one and taught ballet in Los Angeles and later Seattle
through the Pacific Northwest Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Helping her through tough moments was her husband, screenwriter
Stewart Stern, whom she married in 1980. His credits give him
legendary status, including ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' ``Rachel,
Rachel,'' ``Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams'' and the TV miniseries
``Sybil.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, she suffered a breakdown and entered intensive therapy
with Brian J. Moss, in whose office she began to draw with black,
red and yellow felt-tip pens on Bristol lined paper.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged was extraordinary by anyone's measure. Stern
brought her formidable ability to focus to the task of filling
thousands of little grids with patterned shapes. The shapes lock
into place, gain force through repetition and then open up again
with fluid grace.
</P>
<P>
   The power to merge with the music that eluded her as a dancer
became hers through drawing. Stern's patterns enclose living
worlds, places where predatory monsters enter small people and
occupy their souls.
</P>
<P>
   When English writer E.M. Forster said his goal was to ``only
connect,'' he couldn't have been thinking about the kind of
connection Stern depicts. The connections she makes are prison
grids that both contain and describe the figures within them.
Drawings 22 inches high by 28 inches wide connect to other
drawings. Shift the drawings and the pattern changes but the sense
of imploding disaster remains inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, Stern has introduced more colors:
pinks, purples and a variety of greens. While the horror of the
early work is missing, the intensity of experience delivered
remains the same. Instead of larger figures enveloping smaller
ones, the figures in Stern's new work are whole and entire.
</P>
<P>
   While she started painting as a necessary therapy, helping her
give voice to what she was otherwise powerless to express, her new
work proves that her gifts as an artist do not depend on
nightmarish content.
</P>
<P>
   Stern found the Phyllis Kind Gallery through her therapist. Moss
happened on a magazine titled ``Raw Vision'' and showed it to her.
``I knew I didn't belong in the regular art world,'' she said,
``but I had hopes I might belong here, in the world of outsider
art.'' Seeing ads for Phyllis Kind and liking the artists she
showed, Stern and her husband went to the Outsider Art Fair in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent Stewart to talk to her,'' said Stern. ``I was too
afraid to approach her myself.'' Kind agreed to look at the photos
but failed to do so for a week. Finally, her gallery assistant,
Chris Wyrick, insisted, because he'd taken a look when Stern
brought them in. One look was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have Stewart, I wonder if I could have made
connection with her,'' Marilee Stern said, looking at him as he
busied himself in the kitchen, making dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Stern continues to make art and wants to show it not only in New
York but in Seattle. This time, she says, when she presents her
work, she'll be the one to do it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My brother-in-law told me that Yahtzee got its name from a
yacht. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.G., Burleson, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The dice game Yahtzee was invented by a Canadian couple in
1956 and was often played with guests on their yacht.
</P>
<P>
   The couple approached toy manufacturer Edwin S. Lowe in the
hopes he would print a few copies of their ``yacht game'' as gifts,
according to the World Wide Web site Toy Tips, at www.toytips.com.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed with the game, Lowe bought all rights from the couple,
who agreed to sell it for a few copies of the game and no
royalties. He renamed it Yahtzee.
</P>
<P>

Congressional Medal of Honor is No. 1. What place does the Silver
Star have?
</P>
<P>
   _ U.K., Cleburne, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The Silver Star is the fifth highest medal awarded by the
United States Army, said Carol Bush, a military personnel
technician with Army Reserve Personnel Command.
</P>
<P>
   It ranks behind the Congressional Medal of Honor, Distinguished
Service Cross, Defense Distinguished Service and Distinguished
Service Medal.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A: According to the ``Lone Star Book of Texas Records,'' with
the 1970 census, Houston officially became the first Texas city
with 1 million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Its population in that census was 1.23 million. By comparison,
Fort Worth had 393,000 residents and Dallas 844,000.

SAN FRANCISCO LAWMAKER SEEKS TO EXPAND DOMESTIC PARTNER LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A city supervisor is proposing an ordinance that
would require all rental car agencies, health clubs and insurance
companies that offer discounts to married couples to extend the
same rates to registered domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mark Leno seeks to expand the city's
anti-discrimination law and would apply to all San Francisco
businesses offering discounted goods, services or privileges to
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ordinance, residential hotels that only allow spouses
to share rooms would have to extend that privilege to domestic
partners who register with the city. Domestic partners in San
Francisco include homosexuals and non-married heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banning discrimination is no new concept. ... We're talking
about inalienable rights here,'' Leno said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, businesses with offices or stores outside
the city would have to adhere to the domestic partners requirement
only in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many businesses would be required to change
their policies if the proposal were approved. Leno noted that many
businesses already comply with the equal-benefits concept.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce is taking a wait-and-see approach to the
proposal. But spokeswoman Carol Piasente said the organization was
``strongly opposed to any form of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   If Leno's plan is adopted, a business found in violation of the
law could face a civil lawsuit. However, the city's Human Rights
Commission would be brought in first to try to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposed ordinance, among them Supervisors Tom
Ammiano and Leslie Katz, said it's the natural progression to the
city's equal-benefits ordinance. That year-old law requires
companies that do business with the city to provide the same
benefits to their workers with domestic partners as they do to
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are challenging the ordinance in federal
court.

GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF A MEDICAL PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A philosopher once said that man is nothing but a digestive tube
open on both ends, at which point the science of gastroenterology
was born.
</P>
<P>
   As a practitionee of the science, I am impressed with the amount
of ground it covers. Everything from the lips to the lap and beyond
. . . but not far.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, dentistry or ophthalmology seldom strays from the mouth
or eyes, respectively, gastroenterology ranges from our tops to our
bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Some gastroenterologists, for reasons known only to them and
their accountants, gravitate toward the lower end . . . near your
wallet. These are known as proctologists.
</P>
<P>
   As an aside, I note that while studies have reported high
suicide rates among dentists, no one has discovered any such
correlation among proctologists or gastroenterologists in general.
If there is a psychological effect from looking into people's
mouths every day, and being generally feared, as the suicide
studies indicate, then one would think that the proctologists and
gastroenterologists would be lined up on both sides of the Aurora
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to report, however, that my personal (and how much more
personal can one be) gastroenterologist is a fellow of high spirit
and pleasant demeanor. So, too, is the Heir Apparent's
father-in-law, who practices this same top-to-bottom science in
Helena, the cultural center of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   I noted above that I am intimately familiar with this science as
a practitionee, more plainly, one upon whom, or into whom the good
doctors do their scientific snooping. Some several years ago, I was
introduced to this field of medicine by way of a sigmoidoscopic
examination.
</P>
<P>
   All middle-age men should have one, not only because it's deemed
a medical necessity for anyone at or beyond the age of 50, but
because it gives you the right to exchange knowing ``Oh, yeah ...
I've been there and done that!'' commiserations with someone on the
brink of his or her first such exam.
</P>
<P>
   The sigmoidoscope, thought mistakenly to have been invented by
the Marquis de Sade, is truly nowhere as uncomfortable as a trip to
your local physical therapist. And upon the latter we will dwell in
a later discussion of my recent rotator cuff surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But I have strayed _ by a good meter or so _ from the
application of gastroenterology to this 58-year-old body. Having
those several years ago passed the sigmoidoscopy with good marks
and been pronounced clean as a whistle _ a gastroenterologist's
phrase if ever there was one _ I went merrily on my way through
midlife until a recent annual physical.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of blood _ which might have come from as far away as my
rather large nose _ showed up in tests down under. And the
gastroenterologist suggested we start at the top and look down,
thereby enlarging my passive study of his science as well as my
gullet. We did an ``upper G.I. endoscopy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the term implies, the doctor and his team in
color-coordinated surgical scrubs get you all comfy on an exam
table and then stick a long camera-and-light tube down your throat
and into your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Braver folks than I tell their dentists to hold the Novocain and
their gastroenterologists to hold the sedative and pain-killing
sprays. But if someone's gonna push a spotlight and camera past
your molars and into the duodenal distance of your stomach exit, I
recommend the sedated trip.
</P>
<P>
   That means not watching the closed-circuit pictures of your
esophagus, but you don't want to be watching if the doctor strays
off course like that tunneling machine under Eastlake Avenue.
Besides, they offer you suitable-for-framing still shots, which you
can put in your journal.
</P>
<P>
   There is a built-in good news/bad news to the upper G.I.
endoscopy: If your upper tubes look clean, as mine apparently do,
they circle around and attack from behind, so to speak. Another one
of those ``someone your age'' things: the colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, the sigmoidoscopy makes only a few basic turns, sort of
like the Renton ``S'' curves on I-405, the colonoscopy goes all the
way to the Canadian border. It is not, like the upper G.I.
endoscopy, a simple in-and-out procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But since we are still learning to endure the biweekly trips to
the physical therapist's chamber of arcane mechanical devices _
part of the shoulder surgery recovery route _ we are backing off
the recommended colonoscopy until we feel better able to bend to
that task.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the least bit squeamish about reading this sort of
thing _ now's a fine time to be asking _ you have my permission to
turn instead to the news columns dealing with murder, genocide,
global warming and the proposal to sell naming rights of the state
ferries to a Tacoma-based pickle and condiment producer.

RESEARCHER SEES DRAMATIC RISE IN DIABETES CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DON FINLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ San Antonio has seen an explosion of new diabetes
cases in recent years, and if the rest of the country is following
suit, the result could be a reversal of a 30-year decline in heart
disease deaths, a Texas researcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings ``suggest that diabetes and obesity are likely to
emerge as the preeminent public health problems in the near
future,'' said Dr. Michael Stern, professor of medicine at the
University of Texas Health Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent findings from the 19-year-old San Antonio Heart
Study, which follows 5,100 adults around the South Texas city, show
the rate of new Type 2 diabetes cases rose by 9 percent per year on
average over the decade ending in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New cases among Mexican Americans rose from 5.7 percent in 1987
to 15.7 percent in 1996. Among non-Hispanic whites, new cases rose
from 2.6 percent to 9.4 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
   Stern presented his findings Sunday at the American Diabetes
Association's annual scientific meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, afflicting 90 percent of the
estimated 16 million American diabetics, arises because of an
inability by the body to use insulin produced by the pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is most often seen in people over age 45 who are
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   National surveys have shown an overall increase in diabetes, but
the latest data from the San Antonio Heart Study looked
specifically at newly diagnosed cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diabetics are surviving longer, so that by itself would
increase the number of cases. The population is aging, so the
number of cases is going up for a couple of reasons. But what we
measured was the actual development of new cases over a time
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans are getting heavier, obesity is not the whole
explanation for the increase, Stern said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even after researchers adjusted their data to account for
differences in obesity, age, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic
status, ``the trend for a rapid rise in diabetes incidence
remained,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities for the rise, Stern said, include a decline
in physical activity, which wasn't measured in the study; and some
undefined changes in diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because diabetes and obesity are major risk factors for
cardiovascular disease _ and both are increasing _ this escalation
may well eventually blunt or reverse the decline in heart disease
that has been under way in the United States since the 1960s if
trends similar to those in San Antonio are occurring nationwide,''
Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1960s, deaths due to heart disease have steadily
declined by about 50 percent, a reduction attributed to declines in
risk factors such as cholesterol, high blood pressure and cigarette
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all ethnic minorities suffer higher rates of Type 2
diabetes, but the San Antonio Heart Study focused on Mexican
Americans and non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the growing recognition of the threat posed by
diabetes would lead to more research funding, which when directed
against other risk factors for heart disease, led to improvements
in health.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Institutes of Health invests about $330 per
patient in heart disease research, it invests only about $20 per
patient for diabetes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diabetes has been kind of the poor stepchild of NIH funding. I
think there's been a sudden realization that this is a major public
health problem and needs to be addressed as such.''

<P>
   SHANGHAI _ China's movers and shakers will activate a global
re-education campaign when President Bill Clinton reaches the
country on Thursday with an entourage expected here to number more
than 1,000 aides, congressmen, journalists, industrialists and
think-tankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The images of China in the United States are not yet
adequate,'' said Zhou Mingwei, director general of Shanghai's
foreign affairs department, a branch of the Chinese foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important opportunity at this moment, at the
end of this century and the beginning of the new century, for
America to have a better idea about China.''
</P>
<P>
   Image _ that was the word most-repeated by a range of Chinese
interviewed about the importance to their country of Clinton's
unprecedented nine-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   This trip is China's hope for blotting out the image of a
monolithic, unyielding communist power, the image freeze-framed in
millions of Western minds in the shape of a man standing defiantly
alone in the path of a tank during the bloody crackdown that ended
the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989. It happened three
months after then-U.S. President George Bush walked on Chinese
soil, but assured that nearly a decade would lapse before another
president dared to return.
</P>
<P>
   In full concert with the White House, China is orchestrating a
tour competitive with Madison Avenue's deftest ad campaigns, one
aimed at reforming Western views of China on a scale grander than
the ``re-education'' of urbanites dispatched to learn from the
peasants in the harrowing 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   From the glories of ancient culture to the high-tech marvels of
tomorrow, the president will discover China.
</P>
<P>
   But images are cast in two directions, and Chinese intellectuals
who believe America has wrongly snubbed their country for a decade
are warning Clinton to beware that the impression he leaves does
not come across as arrogant and preachy to China's 1.2 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton should not say America is the beacon of democracy in
the world, and China should follow. That's finished,'' said Yang
Jiemian, director of American studies at the Shanghai Institute of
International Studies, a think tank that advises the nation's
leaders. ``You have to have new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese business leaders expect the presidential visit to
build investor confidence, or even to yield new deals like the $4.2
billion worth of contracts announced when China's President Jiang
Zemin visited America last October.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Clinton to ring the opening gong on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange elated Yang Guoping, general manager of the Shanghai
Dazhong Taxi Co., Ltd., a booming transportation, hotel and biotech
conglomerate listed on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mr. Jiang rang the opening bell at the New York Stock
Exchange, the stocks in the United States soared 20 percent,'' he
said, ``so we think this will be helpful for the stocks in
Shanghai. Though maybe not so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he joined other Chinese in assessing that deals and
communiques take a backseat to ending what one academic called
``the abnormal situation'' characterized by a decade of tension,
continuing sanctions and irregular top-level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese will do their best to depict a nation that is
jumping a time warp, advancing through generations worth of
technological and economic development in an atmosphere freer than
ever before. And they are expecting to have a broad audience of
Americans who will take home the official snapshot of changing
China.
</P>
<P>
   The exact numbers in the Clinton entourage may never be added
up, but the Chinese are ready for a friendly invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total numbers that will accompany the president are
different every day,'' said Yang Jiemian, the American studies
expert. ``The minimum I think is 1,200 and the most I heard is
about 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai foreign affairs office, tasked with keeping track
of such visitors, at last count was expecting 1,400 people,
including the press corps, to arrive in the wake of the first
couple and daughter Chelsea. Another 300 aides and U.S. Secret
Service agents were due here early to finish last-minute advance
work.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House is declining to give an estimate, that
number will far exceed the body count of the official delegation.
Ancillary visitors will include aides to Cabinet officials,
journalists outside the tent of the White House press corps,
business executives eying a new locus of world economic growth and
academic China specialists drawn to the summit as a magnet that
well may set the compass of U.S.-Sino relations for coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai is the broadest stroke of the new sketch China wants to
beam out to the world via the scores of opinion-molding visitors
and through the television clips and news stories that will fill
media across the continents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will spend two days and three nights in this showcase
city of 13 million people, the metropolis that China's leaders
calculated only six years ago should become the preeminent
financial and high-tech center of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous plotting of how and where to grow the city has
created a skyline studded with skyscrapers and a smart lifestyle
totally alien to China just a decade ago. Nearly $20 billion of
infrastructure investment has produced elegant new bridges,
elevated cross-city highways and a central public square lined by
City Hall, an extraordinary Shanghai Museum and a new Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the Pudong New Area, where multinational industry
and financial institutions are enticed by liberal export policies,
helped Shanghai's gross domestic product reach $41 billion in 1997
after six years of annual double-digit growth rates. Since 1991,
retail sales have grown an average of 21.8 percent a year, and
industrial output value 17.1 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, we didn't know what the stock market is,''
said Tu Guangshao, the 40-year-old president of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange. ``The only thing we knew is that the stock market was a
product of capitalism, and that is something we must resist.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Tu said the financial community is hoping Clinton
will trail along a group of American chief executives to engage in
more ``cooperative relationships'' with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet below the surface of this new China lie some of the same old
approaches and sticky issues that have frustrated good relations
with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   An example is the soon-to-open General Motors plant, a joint
venture with Shanghai's government-run car company that will
produce a variant of the Buick Regal.
</P>
<P>
   GM tried mightily to lure Clinton to the factory, but the big
U.S. strike this month _ based largely on workers' protests against
GM's cheap, non-domestic operations, just like this one _ seems to
have sunk hopes for a presidential drop-in. Celebrated as a pride
of Shanghai, the plant is a potential embarrassment to an American
president.
</P>
<P>
   The entire super-structure of economic development here is a
different animal from Western capitalism, one carefully controlled
and still dominated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The stock exchange, in most countries the herald of free
enterprise, lists almost exclusively state-run companies. Set up to
draw capital to state enterprises, it shuts out the most daring of
China's fledgling capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies hoping to manufacture goods for sale within
China had better find a Chinese partner, and that means a
government-run company, with which they will share the profits and
more importantly the technology they are required to hand over.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the most important bases of China's new great
leap into the 21st Century: the technology Westerners are bringing
to the building of everything from cars to computers to nuclear
power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction of Shanghai itself has been approached in the
typical command-plan manner of a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people living where skyscrapers should rise? One
million people were forced to move from the center city to the
suburbs. Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhou Mu Yao, who said another million
families have yet to be relocated, emphasized that they are moving
from substandard to bigger, better housing.
</P>
<P>
   That is surely the case, yet stories abound of Shanghai
residents awakened at 5 a.m. by construction workers who bundle
them out to a truck and start whacking down the walls.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the visions President Clinton and the attendant
world audience will absorb beginning this week.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the sharp young students, ambitious farmers
and savvy business executives Clinton will meet on his China tour
are unrepresentative. But they won't tell the whole story of a
nation still stretching out of old ways and means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance is to realize how we who have different
concepts can live together, can work together,'' said Zhou Mingwei
of the Chinese Foreign Affairs Department. ``I think China is not a
place for limited imagination. It is especially not a place for
limited imagining of China-U.S. relations.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ Here is a chronology of previous presidential visits
to China and how they came about:
</P>
<P>
   April 1971 _ China used ``Ping-Pong diplomacy'' to signal
China's readiness for a thaw with Washington after two decades of
animosity following the Korean War. Premier Zhou Enlai invited 15
American table tennis players and three reporters to Beijing for
what Zhou called ``a new page'' in U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
   July 9, 1971 _ President Richard Nixon's national security
adviser, Henry Kissinger, vanishing on a trip to Pakistan, secretly
flew to Beijing. Kissinger and Premier Zhou Enlai tentatively
agreed that their countries should cease being enemies. At
Kissinger's insistence, the Chinese agreed to refrain from dealings
with Nixon's political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 21, 1972 _ Nixon electrified the world by stepping off Air
Force One in Beijing and shaking hands with Premier Zhou Enlai,
thus symbolizing America's de facto recognition of the Chinese
Communist revolution of 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 28, 1972 _ Nixon and Zhou Enlai issued a ``joint
communique'' in Shanghai committing the United States to
``normalization'' of relations between the U.S. and mainland China.
In it the United States accepted that ``there is but one China and
Taiwan is a part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15, 1978 _ President Jimmy Carter announced
``normalization'' of relations in Washington, carrying out Nixon's
pledge. Carter promised the withdrawal of the last 750 U.S. troops
from Taiwan. Congress responded a few months later with the Taiwan
Relations Act, which obligates the United States to defend Taiwan
in case of aggression from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   April 30, 1984 _ President Ronald Reagan ended a seemingly
symbolic six-day trip to China that turned out to be a turning
point. In the next five years, trade and security cooperation
blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 25-26, 1989 _ President George Bush was glowingly received
in Beijing by Chinese Premier Li Peng. But Chinese police stopped
dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi from reaching a presidential
dinner to which he had been invited at the U.S. embassy. Bush
publicly expressed ``regret'' to Chinese leaders over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   June 4, 1989 _ Chinese troops killed 500 to 1,000 people in
Beijing while quelling a pro-democracy uprising centered on
Tiananmen Square. Appalled at the violence, Congress and the Bush
Administration imposed sanctions on trade and military cooperation
with China, some of which still remains in effect.

STOCKS' VOLATILITY GIVE BONDS APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   By PAMELA YIP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1998c. Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's time for a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrials dropped by more than 200 points last
week because of worries over Asia's worsening financial crisis and
concern that U.S. corporations may be hard-pressed to sustain
strong profits.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of thing that makes the fixed income of a bond
look appealing.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're seeking shelter in bonds, consider the possible
perils, because the solution isn't so clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds have performed rather well over the past year. In the year
ended last Thursday, general bond mutual funds soared an average
10.8 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services in New York,
which tracks fund performance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the falling interest rates that have pushed
up the value of bonds may mean an encore will be hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, yields on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond are at their lowest levels. Yields move in the opposite
direction from bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 30-year yields briefly fell to 5.64 percent _ the
lowest level since the Treasury began regular sales of the
securities in 1977 _ and closed at 5.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at an all-time low,'' said Meggan Walsh, vice president
and a portfolio manager at Aim Management Group in Houston, a
mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT INVESTORS ARE LOOKING FOR
</P>
<P>
   Bonds have done well lately for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is virtually nonexistent. Inflation is the archenemy
of bonds because it erodes the value of fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. dollar has shown lots of muscle against foreign
currencies, which ups the value of dollar-denominated investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's also been a flight to quality by foreign investors
fearful of turbulent foreign markets and eager to buy
dollar-denominated bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking to invest in bonds now for income, this
isn't good news because of the inverse relationship between bond
prices and yields.
</P>
<P>
   Consider going to shorter maturities that offer nearly the same
rate without the interest risk.
</P>
<P>
   There's minimal difference between long-term and short-term
interest rates. A tight interest rate spread ``more than anything
else indicates that investors don't expect interest rates to rise
dramatically,'' said Leslie Fox, senior portfolio manager at Dain
Rauscher in Houston, an investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fox recommended going with treasury bonds with two- and
three-year maturities, which are yielding 5.45 to 5.46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best choice right now in the trade-off between
interest rate risk and current yield,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the 30-year bond at 5.65 percent, you're not being
compensated enough for tying up your money that long.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries due in 10 years and under are all yielding below 5.5
percent _ the Federal Reserve Board's target for overnight loans
between banks. For yields to go much lower, many investors said
they'd need evidence that the Fed might consider cutting rates _
which many consider unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   More price gains by bonds are still possible but the momentum
will be slower than that of the last year, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH EXPENSES
</P>
<P>
   Tighter spreads between short-term and long-term bonds make it
more imperative that you watch your pennies when shopping for a
bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   Find a fund whose expense ratio is less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For investors, a narrower range of returns simply means it's
necessary to dig deeper to find the best funds, and that expenses
matter more than ever,'' said Alice Lowenstein, fixed-income editor
at Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago, an investment newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that with bonds, you have interest rate risk, as well
as credit risk, which is the chance you take that the bond issuer
will default.
</P>
<P>
   In these times, don't look to bonds to provide you income, but
to diversify your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Investors ``should not focus nearly so much on the income aspect
because the yields just aren't very satisfactory across the
board,'' Fox said. ``They should buy bonds just on the need to
reduce volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds are good for diversifying your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really are an extraordinary diversifier to a stock
portfolio,'' said John Merrill, a money manager at Tanglewood
Capital Management in Houston and author of the books Beyond Stocks
and Outperforming the Market. ``The total return of bonds tends to
go in the opposite of the total return of stocks just when you want
them to.''

WHEN TO IGNORE THE MOM ALARMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to what we've led our children to believe, there are a
number of things that parents fear. There's the letter from the IRS
that contains anything but a check. The personal phone call from
your physician. A flat tire on a deserted road at night and, well,
telephone conversations like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi sweetie. It's mom,'' I say to my youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Mom! Where are you? Are you coming to get us?''
</P>
<P>
   His voice gladdens my heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``No honey,'' I sigh. ``We'll be home tomorrow. Remember? I said
two days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday and Saturday. That's two days.''
</P>
<P>
   `` ... OK, 48 hours. I meant 48 hours.'' Kids are so literal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you'll be home in 24 hours right?'' Clearly, he'll do well
in math next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, 27 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you said...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetie, we'll be home in time for dinner. I promise.''
</P>
<P>
   I wink at my husband across the restaurant. He is irritated. He
didn't want me to call so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you being a good boy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure am! I ate a spoonful of peas for Grandpa last night so
he let me have cake for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   The first mommie alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, did you have anything else with the cake?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. Cold pizza and milk.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nutrition there I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caleb, when we left yesterday, you were wearing blue shorts
and a white T-shirt. What are you wearing today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue shorts and a purple and white T-shirt,'' he answers
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't pack a purple and white T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was white before I spilled grape juice on it. Grandpa
said it was a waste of time to wash it 'cause grape juice don't
never come out anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm at two mommie alarms and looking for a safe subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you remember to brush your teeth before bed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. Calvin said if we brushed for 10 minutes, we wouldn't
have to do it again this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is Calvin?'' I hear loud voices and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's watching wrestling with Grandpa. You know that show you
won't let us watch? It's really good. Hey, Mom, where are our gym
bags, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably by the front door where your father left
them. How did you brush your teeth without a toothbrush?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I found one in Grandpa's toolbox. Guess what, Mom. We're going
fishing when it gets dark and Grandpa says I can shine the
flashlight and make the fish come.''
</P>
<P>
   We are now at three alarms and my husband is frowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Grandmother, Caleb?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She called and said the church bus broke down in Arkansas. She
won't be back 'til tomorrow. Oh, Mom! Killer is strangling Mr.
Wonderful with a crowbar. See ya!''
</P>
<P>
   The line goes dead. I weigh my options and slowly walk back to
the table where my food is getting cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are the kids?'' my husband asks over chicken teriyaki.
</P>
<P>
   I douse fretful fire with a cold sip and reply like any working
mother on a much-needed vacation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Great. They're having a ball.''
</P>

CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN BAPTIST COUP HAD ITS BEGINNINGS IN HOUSTON
SKYBOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ When Paige Patterson, a Texas native and an
icon to conservatives in his denomination, became president of the
Southern Baptist Convention last week, I was drawn back in time to
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, then practically anonymous in the nation's largest
Protestant group, was in a plush skybox of Houston's Astrodome,
along with Houston Judge Paul Pressler, orchestrating the beginning
of what became one of the most dramatic takeovers of a major
denomination in this century.
</P>
<P>
   I was there in the Astrodome skybox, too, along with
then-Houston Chronicle religion editor Louis Moore, reporting on
the first shot fired in a bitterly fought conservative campaign
that won control of the august Protestant group.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates didn't realize what had hit them.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, moderates dominated the giant denomination, and
they were basking in the glow of fresh national attention brought
on by the election of President Jimmy Carter, a born-again Southern
Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   But working in the background were conservatives such as
Patterson and Pressler, who thought Baptists were on a liberal path
to destruction.
</P>
<P>
   At that Southern Baptist Convention in Houston, the
conservatives shocked everyone by winning the presidency. The Rev.
Adrian Rogers of Memphis, a biblical inerrantist with much
charisma, was elected over moderate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first in a series of hard-fought presidential
victories that within 10 years put conservatives in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates were at first angry, then demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   At the Houston convention, moderates approved resolutions
condemning the blatant, secular-style politicking of Patterson and
Pressler.
</P>
<P>
   But the two revolutionists were undeterred. They had discovered
a little-known way to seize the denomination from moderates. All
they had to do was get enough people to come to the convention to
elect a conservative president.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist presidents, until then, were considered
symbolic figureheads and not very powerful. What Patterson and
Pressler learned was that Baptist presidents had more power over
appointments of agency heads of Baptist seminaries, mission boards,
publishing houses and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Each conservative president used his power to name unbending
conservatives as trustees of those powerful Baptist agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative revolution was completed in 10 years. It was
dramatic, and painful.
</P>
<P>
   Two friends, Dan Martin and Al Shackleford, highly competent
journalists who had dedicated their lives to religious work, were
fired from their Baptist news service jobs in Nashville, mainly
because they were moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives acknowledged the brilliance and effectiveness of
Russell Dilday as president of Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Fort Worth but fired him because he was deemed
sympathetic toward moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed we would be so successful,'' Patterson told
reporters during an interview in Salt Lake City last week. Now he
is president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake
Forest, N.C. The seminary, once the most liberal of Baptist
seminaries, has become one of the most conservative under
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Southern Baptists have gone their separate ways and
have formed their own group, called the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship, which has its own headquarters in Atlanta and sends out
missionaries and other church workers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, an interesting mixture of brashness and Southern
friendliness, believes Southern Baptists are better off with their
new conservative bent.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old Patterson said his entire focus as president
will be to encourage his fellow religionists to rededicate
themselves to reaching out to the unsaved millions.
</P>
<P>
   No plans are in the works, though, to reach out to Southern
Baptist moderates.

U.S. WORLD CUP COACH CONTEMPLATES CHANGES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A day after a humbling 2-0 loss to Germany in the World
Cup, the United States began looking toward Sunday's match with
Iran while contemplating new personnel and a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   At least three lineup changes were being discussed on a day when
coach Steve Sampson seemed to second-guess himself and his players
second-guessed everything from the lineup, to the 3-6-1 formation,
to the isolated chateau where the team is staying outside of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Tab Ramos said he had been told by Sampson that he would start
against Iran. He would most likely play as an attacking midfielder,
replacing Ernie Stewart, who was all but invisible against Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Hejduk, who provided the only real U.S. threat to score
Monday, seems certain to replace Mike Burns on the right wing in
midfield. And Sampson appears to be considering replacing Eric
Wynalda at forward with Roy Wegerle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sampson would not discuss his intended lineup, he said
he was ``absolutely'' considering changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need personality on the field,'' Sampson said. ``We need
players who give 1,000 percent of themselves from the first
second.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson and his players could agree on one thing. Another timid
start, like Monday's, and the Americans might find it impossible to
beat Iran, which seemed fearless and hard tackling in a 1-0 loss to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be a lot more aggressive and have the confidence to
go forward,'' Ramos said. ``When we're as timid as we were in the
first half, we don't give ourselves a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the Iranians could appear more aggressive than the
Americans in their opening match, when they are playing in their
first World Cup in 20 years, Ramos said: ``Maybe they have a lot of
confidence. They had two difficult playoff games in qualifying;
they got a tie in Australia. They're used to pressure. They have
15,000 people at training every day. The World Cup is almost like a
relief to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Without really bickering, the U.S. players Tuesday wondered
whether the right lineup was on the field against Germany. Ramos
said it was ``hard to believe'' when he saw such mainstays as Alexi
Lalas, Marcelo Balboa and Jeff Agoos on the bench. Claudio Reyna
pointed out that Germany started seven players who have won a World
Cup title while the Americans started seven players who had never
started a World Cup game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience was a factor and it showed, especially in the first
half,'' Reyna said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wynalda: ``Some guys were questioning their own
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, inexperience did not let the Americans down so
much as the failures of some of their most experienced stars. Reyna
was knocked off the ball repeatedly. Wynalda did not seem
aggressive coming back for the ball. Burns, a natural defender, was
overmatched in the midfield and reluctant to go forward in attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of confidence and willingness to get in
position behind the defense,'' Sampson said of Burns. ``I begged
him to put himself in position to make them work to defend him.''
</P>
<P>
   After halftime, Sampson replaced Burns with the fleet Hejduk who
knows no direction but forward. And Ramos should add some
creativity and goal-scoring chances in midfield while removing some
of the playmaking pressure from Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson was clearly not happy with Wynalda's effort at the lone
forward spot. ``I was very happy with the energy Roy Wegerle
brought to us in the second half,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos said that he preferred a 4-4-2 formation with two forwards
and that Wynalda seemed to tire himself chasing after the Germans
while they played ball control in the first half. Wegerle has said
that the lone forward formation means playing with ``half the help
and twice the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda pointed out that he did not have trouble finishing his
shots because he took no shots. Asked about the inability of his
teammates to service him with the ball, Wynalda said, ``That would
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalas wondered whether the isolated vineyard living of the
Americans had been counterproductive. ``We were in the middle of
nowhere, then suddenly we were plopped in Paris,'' Lalas said. ``It
was like a big circus. A lot of guys didn't have the experience for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, one thing is clear now. While Sunday's match
against Iran may present a political sideshow for the Americans,
they simply need a victory for victory's sake if they hope to
advance to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need to be concentrating on that,'' Wynalda
said of the political interest surrounding the Iran match. ``We're
in enough trouble as it is.''
</P>

SCOTS TIE RAGGED NORWAY, 1-1  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ Scotland's ``tartan army'' came back from the
dead Tuesday to keep its World Cup soccer chances alive with a 1-1
draw against a ragged Norwegian team.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the opening match of the tournament to champions
Brazil, Scotland looked doomed after Havard Flo headed Norway into
the lead in the 46th minute. Even the massive, kilted Scottish
crowd, whose encounter with Bordeaux wine had helped keep it in
fine voice, was silenced.
</P>
<P>
   But running onto a magnificent 40-yard pass from substitute
David Weir, Scottish midfielder Craig Burley brought the crowd back
to life in the 66th minute with a precise lob over the advancing
Norwegian goalkeeper into an empty net. Scotland then pressed
furiously for a winner, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game of Anglo-Saxon bustle, rather than Latin finesse,
with the ball spending much of the time high in the air, thumped
forward in the vague hope that it would land on a friendly head.
Despite its impressive results in qualifying matches _ winning six
games and drawing two while scoring 21 goals _ Norway looked
thoroughly mediocre for most of the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we were the better team and we are bitterly
disappointed that we did not win,'' Craig Brown, the Scottish coach
said. Scotland did indeed dominate the game for long periods, but
regularly ran out of ideas and precision in front of goal.
</P>
<P>
   The result left the two sides' group, which also includes
Morocco and Brazil, wide open. Norway, having drawn its opening
game against Morocco, has one more point than Scotland, but still
has to play Brazil. The identity of at least the second team to go
through will now not be known until the final group matches next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux, an elegant and conservative city, had never seen
anything quite like the invasion of bagpipe-playing Scots and
Norwegians sporting mock Viking helmets with horns. ``Alouette,
we're going to find the net,'' the Scots chanted, outsinging the
Norwegians decisively, and in the opening minutes it seemed they
might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Dailly, the Scottish leftwinger, headed wide in the
fourth minute from point-blank range. Then, eight minutes later,
striker Gordon Durie's looping header went inches wide. When the
same striker was brought down as he raced into the penalty box in
the 15th minute, a penalty seemed inevitable, but the Hungarian
referee, Laszlo Vagner, ruled that the foul was committed just
outside the box. The free kick was squandered by the Scots.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian side, having changed three players after its 2-2
draw with Morocco in the opening match, was in disarray. Its
midfield appeared to have disappeared into some endless
Scandinavian night. But as Scotland squandered chance after chance,
Norway gradually came into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after halftime, with the Scots apparently
day-dreaming about their missed opportunities, Norway's
left-winger, Vidar Riseth, swung over a long cross and Havard Flo,
alone at the far post, nodded in.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland crumbled and it seemed that yet again, in its eighth
World Cup, the team would make an early exit, failing to get beyond
the first round. At last, the Norwegians seemed to have found some
cohesion and were coasting toward victory. But then Burley burst
through the middle, and Scotland could dream again as the Norwegian
goalkeeper, Frode Grodas, watched the ball loop over his head for
the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Those dreams almost became reality when Burley's 75th minute
drive from the edge of the box brought a fine save from Grodas.
``We were lucky not to lose,'' said the Norwegian manager, Egil
Olsen. He was right.

WITH MY LUCK, IT'LL BE THE PAT TRULY MEMORIAL POTHOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAT TRULY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this day and age, it is a chancy proposition to pick names
for highways, bridges, airports, schools and such.
</P>
<P>
   This has been on my mind ever since a recent road trip. I was
motoring through Dayton, Ohio, with The Lady Who Shares Her Tuna
Salad with Me when I noticed an exit from Interstate 75 to the
Edwin Moses Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that!'' I marveled. ``They named a freeway for Edwin
Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' asked TLWSHTSWM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edwin Moses,'' I said. ``Great hurdler. Dominated the
400-meter hurdles back in the 1970s and 1980s. Would have won three
straight gold medals if Carter hadn't pulled us out of the 1980
Olympics. By golly, I think Dayton was his home town.''
</P>
<P>
   By then she had dozed off, and I started thinking about the
people whose names go up on expressways and such. In Cincinnati
there is (I guess there still is) a Pete Rose Way, down close to
Riverfront Stadium. Rose may never make baseball's Hall of Fame (he
gambled and went to jail, you see), but he's still a notable in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Every time some author writes a new and unflattering biography
of Lyndon B. Johnson, I half expect Dallas to change the name of
the LBJ Freeway (otherwise known as Interstate 635).
</P>
<P>
   The safest idea is to name freeways by direction or destination
(West Freeway, Eastex Freeway, Santa Monica Freeway, Broken Arrow
Expressway). But I figure that Dayton's Edwin Moses Expressway is
safe enough, once you get your steps down (that's an old hurdling
expression, for the uninitiated).
</P>
<P>
   Some names of things I really like. I have previously written
about the thrill of unexpectedly coming upon the Alvin C. York
bridge over the Tennessee River (on Highway 412, as I recall).
</P>
<P>
   I am sure that Detroit is the only city with freeways named for
(1) labor leader Walter Reuther and (2) Edsel Ford. Those whose
memories extend to the Ford Co.'s union-busting activities in the
1930s will see the irony.
</P>
<P>
   I find it excellent that the District of Columbia named a
parkway for a nurse, Clara Barton, while ignoring all the politicos
who have crossed its portals.
</P>
<P>
   I have to take my hat off to Louisville, Ky., which must be the
only place in America to name an expressway for a newspaperman:
Henry Watterson.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took a politically neutral stance, naming interstate
expressways for John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai
Stevenson. But the thoroughfare I like most in Chicago is Cermak
Road, honoring the mayor who was killed in 1933 by an assassin who
was shooting at Franklin D. Roosevelt. Fortunately for America, but
unfortunately for Cermak, the guy's aim was poor.
</P>
<P>
   The woods are full of schoolhouses and roads named for various
ex-presidents and congresspersons and other notables, including
many of purely local fame. Some double-dip. There is a Daniel Boone
Parkway in Kentucky (where he trailblazed) and a Daniel Boone
Expressway in St. Louis (he lived his last years in Missouri).
</P>
<P>
   My real point is that you have to be careful, naming freeways,
airports and public buildings for folks whose reputations might
later suffer. It is safest to wait until the honoree is deceased.
It is even safer to wait until he or she has passed from actual
memory into the realm of mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Even with revisionist historians on the loose, it's OK to name
stuff for Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin and other
Founding Fathers. After all, their peccadilloes were committed 200
years ago or more. (Did Jefferson dally with a slave? Do we care
that Franklin was a randy old guy and that Lincoln told smutty
stories?) There's a sort of statute of limitations on these things.
</P>
<P>
   Yet anything named for J. Edgar Hoover would run the risk of
becoming a cross-dressing joke. And can you imagine what sort of
edifice might be named in the future for Bill Clinton, Newt
Gingrich or a lot of other contemporary folk?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, you have to be careful what you name for a village idiot
like Rep. Dan Burton or a bad boy like Sen. Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking up something appropriate to bear Clinton's name reminds
me of a scene in ``That Touch of Mink,'' an otherwise negligible
Doris Day-Cary Grant movie. Grant is writing a big check to a home
for single mothers or wayward girls or some such, just as Day
appears in his office wearing only a bathrobe (it was all quite
innocent; we won't go into the silly details). The proper ladies
collecting the money agree, as they leave, that anyone who gives so
generously to the upkeep of fallen women ``deserves to use the
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, write your own Clinton punchline.

   BOSNIA-MILOSEVIC (MOSCOW) _ The Yugoslav President, Slobodan
Milosevic, promised to make a series of small concessions toward
ending the crackdown in Kosovo to forestall military action by the
West but stopped short of meeting the key condition: the withdrawal
of Serbian security forces from the province, which is
predominantly ethnic Albanian. The Yugoslav leader announced his

   NANNY-VERDICT (BOSTON) _ The highest court in Massachusetts left
Louise Woodward, the plump-faced au pair convicted last year of
killing the baby in her care, free to go home to England _ but not
free of the taint and trauma of her sensational trial. The three
dissenting justices said in their non-binding opinion that they
believed Woodward, 20, should be re-sentenced, and that a new judge
should consider two special conditions: that she be barred from
earning money from her story, and that, ``as a felon convicted of a
grave act of child abuse,'' she be barred from caring for children.

stretch of scrub off Highway 395 was the largest outpost between

   ELDERLY-PAIN-STUDY (WASHINGTON) _ Researchers studying elderly

complain of pain _ especially minorities and the oldest of the old
_ are given no pain medication at all. The study, the largest of
its kind, is all the more troubling, experts say, because as

more and more old people with cancer are living out the end of

   GM-LABOR (DETROIT) _ The strikes now crippling General Motors,
while partly about short-term job security and workplace safety
disputes, reflect a larger struggle over whether America's auto

in Brazil have copied Japanese manufacturing practices on a huge
scale, and have become the company's most profitable, efficient and
flexible. When General Motors introduced new mid-size sedans in the
United States and Brazil two years ago, a Kansas factory took seven
months to make the switch while the Brazilian factory reached full
production in just three months. By Keith Bradsher.

EATING WELL: MORE TO COOKING BURGERS THAN MEETS THE EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you think your hamburger is safely cooked when it is brown
all the way through? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburger meat turns brown for reasons that have nothing to do
with cooking, according to tests done by the federal government.
And that means it can hold bacteria that make you sick.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Agriculture Department spent eight months
testing meat that had browned prematurely, that is, browned simply
because it had been exposed to air and light. They discovered that
premature browning occurs ``at such a significant rate that color
can no longer be considered a good indicator that hamburger has
been cooked to 160 degrees,'' the temperature at which all harmful
bacteria are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The department bought 240 pairs of packages of ground beef from
stores around the country. Some of the patties made from them were
frozen and then cooked, and some were cooked without freezing.
</P>
<P>
   The patties were cooked to one of four temperatures: 135
degrees, 150 degrees (both too low to assure safety), 160 degrees
(the department's recommended cooking temperature) and 175 degrees,
at which a hamburger has lost most of its juices. The color of
these hamburgers was then rated on a scale of 1 (reddest) to 5
(brownest). A reading of 3.5 indicated slight pink, while 4
indicated no pink.
</P>
<P>
   Variations in color occurred even in patties that were cooked at
the same temperature. While most of the patties that were cooked to
135 and 150 degrees looked on the rare side, as might be expected,
some reached the 3.5 level of slight pinkness. More than 47 percent
of the patties cooked to 160 degrees were slightly pink, while 23
percent were scored at 4, showing no pinkness.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that freezing ground beef and thawing it
overnight in the refrigerator greatly increased its chances of
turning brown before it was thoroughly cooked. But whether the meat
was frozen or not, the color could range from brown to bright pink
before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The simple message here is that you cannot tell by looking if a
hamburger is done. If you don't already have an instant-read
thermometer (the big ones meant for roasts will not do), invest in
one.

DESSERTS THAT COULD BE BY ARMANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SUZANNE HAMLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their homes, Italians refuse to budge on the issue of
desserts. The guiding principle is so brilliantly simple: whatever
follows a meal should be pure, fresh and, preferably, seasonal _ an
aid to digestion, an inducement to further conversation. It's an
Armani way of eating: the elegance of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Viana La Place, an Italian-cookbook author, has compiled a
lovely collection of intense pleasures in ``Dessert and Sweet
Snacks: Rustic Italian Style'' (William Morrow, $23). With its
delectable, natural-looking photographs and instructions for homey,
easy ways to finish a meal, the book seems made for summer.
</P>
<P>
   s. La Place, who lives in San Francisco and is the daughter of
Italian immigrants, is the author or co-author of seven books on
rustic Italian cooking. For those who know her books, they are like
a series of conversations, a running translation of the Italian
sensibility. ``Desserts and Sweet Snacks'' is a provocative
continuation.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, her desserts celebrate pure fruit, with all
its refreshing, palate-cleansing sweetness. But the collection
includes many different kinds of deeply flavorful moments _
puddings and gelatins, cakes, crostatas, cookies, ice creams and
cheese desserts. (Surprisingly, there's only one ice.)
</P>
<P>
   Many require no cooking, and none require special equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To make Peaches in a Glass of Red Wine, for example, just dice
an unpeeled peach into a tall glass and pour in enough chilled
light red wine or rose to cover it. Then you add two or three sugar
cubes, crush the cubes against the side of the glass with a spoon
and stir.
</P>
<P>
   To dress up seeded watermelon cubes a bit, serve them with their
juices in chilled goblets and sprinkle bittersweet chocolate
shavings on top. Or, now that raspberries have reappeared, you can
take a couple of baskets, sprinkle on a tablespoon or two of sugar,
mound them into four dessert goblets and pour on a half cup of
chilled Moscato di Pantelleria, a dessert wine with a honeyed
flavor and a flowery orange blossom bouquet. The author comes
through on her promise: ``Its effect on raspberries is magical.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher up the preparation ladder, there are perfect little
no-flour cakes like an Italian rice cake, a semolina cake and a
chocolate and espresso cake. The elegantly flat cake of carrots and
almonds _ a perfect blend if ever there was one _ could be the
highlight of a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet olive oil quick bread is as good for breakfast as it
is with a glass of dessert wine.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in with the ice creams and ice cream confections is an
Italian-style open-face ice cream sandwich: you spread lemon
marmalade on slices of crusty bread and cover with soft vanilla ice
cream. Or you can just stuff fresh figs with goat cheese and mint,
or drizzle honey over whole-milk ricotta and sprinkle with toasted
almonds.
</P>
<P>
   This is a book full of reasons to linger at the table these long
summer evenings. &QL;

WINTER THAT WON'T GO AWAY TAKES TOLL ON PARKS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A winter that won't go away has caused
summertime travelers to think twice about venturing into some
national parks in California.
</P>
<P>
   Roads and campgrounds that normally are filling up at this time
of year remain shrouded in a blanket of white stuff. Meanwhile,
some state parks are trying to restore trails and repair damage
caused by heavy rains and snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storms are just kicking our teeth in,'' said Marilyn Parris,
superintendent of the Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern
California park.
</P>
<P>
   Many areas of Lassen are accessible only by skis, snowshoes or
snowmobile. Some campgrounds remain snowbound.
</P>
<P>
   From Crater Lake, Ore., to Mammoth Mountain, the story is the
same _ warm skies over snow, snow, snow. The weather phenomenon
known as El Nino is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Old timers do not recall a heavier snowfall at Lassen.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Highway 89, which bisects the park north to
south, ``the snow measured 46 feet, and that was with a straight
tape,'' Dan Jones, the park's maintenance chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The week after Memorial Day we gt over nine feet of snow.
That's worse than Tioga Pass. We're working in 25-plus feet of
snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas all park roads are normally open in early June, ``we're
hoping to get them open by July 4 this year, but whether we do is
up to the weather,'' Parris said.
</P>
<P>
   Lassen, established in 1916, is one of the least used, most
scenic of national parks. At 160,933 acres, it contains 40 glacial
lakes, hot springs, lava beds, mud geysers and majestic Lassen
Peak, which at 10,457 feet affords one of the grandest vistas in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Snow removal started on March 23, ``and we've been going 10
hours a day, seven days a week'' and just barely holding even,
Parris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to secure some money and more equipment _ we even
got a plow from Death Valley _ and people from other parks have
come to help. We've done all we can do. Mother Nature is going to
have to give us a break,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 of the 175 campsites in the park's Manzanita campground
are open, as is the Crags campground.
</P>
<P>
   Drakesbad, the family resort in the park, won't be open until
Friday, more than a week late, Parris said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the heavy snow, ``some people are turning away. We've
had about a 25 percent turnaround'' _ that is, people who drive up
to the park entrance, then decide not to drive in, Parris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't interested in paying a $10 entry fee for one
mile of road.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is much the same in other parks affected by El Nino,
which spawned heavy snowfalls during the winter and well into the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   At Sequoia National Park, spokeswoman Malinee Crapsey said there
was ``virtually no (snow) melting going on above 9,000 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main highways through Yosemite National Park remains
closed because of deep snow.
</P>
<P>
   California's state parks suffered $14.8 million in damage over
the winter. Eight-seven parks were affected, and 25 percent of the
system's trails were damaged, said William Berry, chief of the
department's park services division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that most of it (damage) won't be cleared up until
toward the end of fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hardest-hit coastal parks are among the state's most
popular, such as Gaviota and Refugio in Santa Barbara County, which
are usually full all summer. Gaviota's campground is closed, and
Refugio's water system was washed out, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Other coastal campgrounds that suffered extensive damage causing
reduced visitor accommodations are Prairie Creek Redwoods and
Cardiff Beach.

BARGAINS IN THE LAP OF BORDEAUX LUXURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't give up on Bordeaux. Prices are going through the roof and
in recent weeks there has been some unpleasantness at one of the
chateaus, Giscours, over alleged shortcuts in the winemaking. But
keep in mind that there are two Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The first and best known is the Bordeaux of the great chateaus
and their often rare and always expensive wines. This is the elite
world of titled owners, wealthy buyers, spectacular cellars and
lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   The other Bordeaux is an immense region, much of it beautiful
country and picture-perfect villages that visitors rarely see.
Blaye, Bourg, Fronsac, Moulis, Listrac and other towns produce 800
million bottles of wine a year. Not all of it is memorable, but a
lot of it is extremely good.
</P>
<P>
   It is not necessary to range far afield in Bordeaux to find
bargains. Nestled in among the monarchs of the Medoc, which include
Margaux, Latour and the two Rothschilds, Lafite and Mouton, are
lesser lights, not royalty but not peasants, either.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Lanessan, whose history goes back to at least the 14th
century, sits on the southern border of St.-Julien and regularly
produces big elegant clarets that compare favorably with many of
the classified growths. Louis Delbos, who owned the place in 1855,
refused to submit his wine for the famous classification made that
year, regarding it as bureaucratic nonsense. The 1995 is selling
for about $25.
</P>
<P>
   Way up north on the Medoc peninsula, in the town of Begadan, is
Chateau Patache d'Aux, which makes a wine I used to enjoy in
magnums. The wine tends to be lighter than some but without a loss
of flavor or intensity. It used to be quite abrasive in its youth;
no more, at least not in the 1995 vintage. It is about $13.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Begadan is Chateau Vieux Robin, the producer of a
smooth, elegant wine with considerable complexity, which means an
intriguing combination of oak and fruit, nicely balanced. It sells
for $15 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Fourcas-Dupre is in Listrac, a town inland from the more
famous wine communes of the Medoc like Margaux and Pauillac.
Fourcas-Dupre has stood in the shadow of its better-known neighbor,
Fourcas-Hosten, but in 1995 it turned out a most attractive wine.
It is hardly one for the ages, but it has character and a nice
finish. Under $15.
</P>
<P>
   Two old standbys in the Medoc are Chateaux Larose-Trintaudon and
Greysac. Larose, owned for many years by the Forner family from
Spain, is the largest vineyard in the Medoc. The wine can be
one-dimensional at times, but it is pleasant to drink and
reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
   Greysac is well known in the United States, probably because of
its high merlot content. In fact, if it were made in California or
on Long Island, in some years it would easily be mistaken for a
merlot. Both of these wines sell for about $11.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best buys among the lesser Medoc chateaus is La
Cardonne, in the commune of Blaignan. From 1973 to 1990, it was
owned by members of the Rothschild family, who virtually rebuilt
both the winery and the vineyards. Thanks to their efforts,
Cardonne is a deeply colored, fruity wine that is at its best after
three or four years. La Cardonne usually sells for $10 or less.
</P>
<P>
   The Graves region, south and west of the city of Bordeaux, was
split up a few years ago, with some famous properties falling in
the area just beyond the city limits known as Pessac-Leognan.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau La Louviere, one of the most beautiful chateaus in the
Bordeaux region, also makes a delightful wine in the best tradition
of the Graves, rich and opulent but with considerable elegance.
About $25. La Louviere also makes an impressive white wine.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Segonzac is in Blaye, across the Gironde River from
St.-Julien. The best wines of Blaye come from the Premieres Cotes
de Blaye, and Segonzac is one of the better-known properties in
that appellation. The wine is not particularly complex but it has
delicious fruit and, in the 1995 vintage, surprising intensity.
Also around $10.
</P>
<P>
   St.-Emilion is one of the two most famous wine communities in
the country east of the city of Bordeaux; the other is Pomerol.
St.-Emilion chateaus like Cheval Blanc and Ausone _ whose 1995
sells for more than $300 a bottle _ are among the glories of
Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also good, lesser-known estates like Chateau Haut
Corbin that offer classic St.-Emilion depth and are often ready to
drink a few years after the harvest and at much lower prices. Like
many St.-Emilion wines, it is made principally from merlot grapes.
About $15.
</P>
<P>
   Is $30 a lot to spend on a bottle of wine? Given the prices of
wines like Ausone, no; considering what most people in the real
world can afford, yes. But for anyone interested in venturing into
that pricier category, Chateaux d'Armailhac and d'Angludet are
worth the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Angludet was the home of Peter Sichel, who died a few months
ago. He converted Angludet into one of the most promising of the
second-tier wines in the commune of Margaux. His 1995, deep and
intense, is a fitting memorial to his work, and I am told the 1996
is even better. It is $24 to $28.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Armailhac adjoins Mouton-Rothschild in Pauillac and is
owned by Baroness Philippine de Rothschild. Its wine is made with
all the care invested in Mouton-Rothschild, and its 1995 displays
much of the brawny power associated with Mouton. This is a wine to
put down for another five years. Or break open a bottle to welcome
in the next millennium. It is $25 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   If you give Bordeaux a chance, in the company of one or two of
these wines, you just might be glad you did. &QL;

SIMPLE COOKING: BEET PANCAKES (HOLD THE SYRUP) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: recipe at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although sweetness is not an unfamiliar sensation at the dinner
table, no so-called savory food gives quite the experience of the
beet, whose intensity is incomparable. This has typically led cooks
to counter its sweetness with acidity or other sharp flavors, a
natural inclination that has given us beets with vinegar, beets
with sour cream, beets with lemon, vinaigrette, ginger, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But the sweetness of beets is wonderfully exploited in this
dish, created by Michael Romano, the chef at Union Square Cafe in
New York. It's a thick beet pancake, cooked slowly until the beet
sugars caramelize and a crunchy, sweet crust forms, reminiscent of
creme brulee. A touch of rosemary does not diminish the sweetness,
but simply adds a dimension to this versatile side dish, which is
good with braised meats or grilled food or can accompany a salad as
a light dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The concept and technique are unusual for beets, although they
are identical to those used in roesti, the Swiss grated-potato
dish. The beets are peeled and grated raw; the grating disk of a
food processor does this task easily, but a box grater also works.
The beets are then combined with flour, an essential ingredient.
``The beet resembles a potato, and you can cook it like a potato,''
Romano said. ``But it doesn't have the starch of a potato, and if
you don't add some flour, the pancake won't hold together.''
</P>
<P>
   In this dish, butter is the fat of choice; it complements the
beets perfectly. If you choose to substitute, use a neutral oil
like canola rather than strong-tasting olive oil. The beet roesti
must be cooked in a nonstick skillet, preferably one measuring 12
inches across. (If you have a 10-inch skillet, decrease the amount
of beets from two pounds to one and a half; the quantities given
for the other ingredients can remain the same.) And keep the heat
moderate. Cooking too quickly will burn the sugary outside of the
pancake while leaving the inside raw.
</P>
<P>
   Beets bleed and can easily stain clothing. Peel them over the
sink, and wash the grater as soon as you are finished with it. Oh,
and wear an apron.
</P>
<P>
   BEET ROESTI WITH ROSEMARY
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds beets (3 very large or 4 to 6 medium)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   { cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley or a few rosemary leaves for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Trim beets, and peel them as you would potatoes; grate them
in food processor or by hand. Begin preheating 12-inch nonstick
skillet over medium heat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Toss grated beets in bowl with rosemary, salt and pepper. Add
about half the flour; toss well, add rest of flour, and toss again.
</P>
<P>
   3. Put butter in skillet; heat until it begins to turn
nut-brown. Scrape beet mixture into skillet, and press with spatula
to form a round. With medium to medium-high heat _ the pancake
should gently sizzle _ cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bottom
of cake is nicely crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Slide cake onto a plate,
top with another plate, invert the two plates, and return cake to
pan. Keep cooking, adjusting heat if necessary, until other side is
browned, another 10 minutes or so. Garnish, cut into wedges, and
serve hot or at room temperature.

<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   Planeta La Segreta Rosso 1996, Sicily. About $15.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of exciting, reasonably priced wines from Italy
continues. One importer, Vias Imports, offers a substantial
selection of attractive wines from the Alps to Sicily, which just
happens to be the source of La Segreta Rosso.
</P>
<P>
   The Planeta family has been making wines near Menfi on the
southwest coast of Sicily for more than three centuries. La Segreta
is named for the vineyard from whose grapes the wine is made.
</P>
<P>
   And those grapes are cabernet sauvignon, merlot and nero
d'Avola, a much respected local variety, which may have come from
the mainland because it is also known as Calabrese. The blend is 20
percent cabernet and 40 percent for each of the other two
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The wine has considerable body, a garnet color and a
fruit-filled taste. There is no oak aging here; none is needed. Why
the vineyard is called La Segreta remains just that _ a secret.

LAFAYETTE, ZAGAT IS HERE, AND PARIS HARDLY SHRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Zagat Survey's first Paris Restaurant Guide has arrived
at newsstands and bookstores here, introducing French readers to
the novel idea that customers can rate restaurants just as well as
Michelin's and Gault Millau's authoritative inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   And surprise _ the 1,710 diners (out of 20,000) who returned the
questionnaires Zagat used for its ratings put the venerable
Taillevent at the top of their list, both for its cuisine and for
being a ``favorite'' restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin, which awarded Taillevent and 5 other Paris restaurants
its top three-star rating this year, might also be surprised to
find two restaurants to which it gave only two stars, Guy Savoy and
Faugeron, among the top 6 of the 40 that Zagat's Parisian
respondents rated as having the best food in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Ducasse, the sensation of the French culinary world since
Michelin awarded three stars this year to two of his restaurants,
in Paris and in Monte Carlo, came in fifth for his cooking in
Zagat's rating and sixth as favorite restaurant, a category
Michelin does not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with the choices, though I think the guide is a
good idea,'' Ducasse said. ``I don't think it can be truly
accurate. My restaurant has room for only 50 people. A restaurant
that has 100 could get twice as many votes as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagat says that its statistical averaging methods can take care
of that, but Jean-Claude Vrinat, the proprietor of Taillevent,
where Philippe Legendre is the chef, had another worry about his
top ratings. ``Now I have to try to keep them,'' he fretted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guide is very easy to read, has an attractive format, and
I think it will be a great success,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, critics here and elsewhere in Europe seem to
agree so far. Costing 69 francs, a little over $11, the Zagat is
easy to carry and covers 825 restaurants in Paris, 300 more than
Michelin.
</P>
<P>
   The first printing was 80,000 in French and English, but the
publisher, Alain Flammarion, said the guide could sell as many as
100,000 copies here in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zagat is you, the readers,'' the weekly Paris Match declared.
An article in The Times' Saturday magazine in London last weekend
noted, ``The end is nigh for the food critics who lived like kings
and executed on a whim.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be overdrawn. Zagat's ratings don't come out of the
blue. They may shuffle around the places that Michelin's
authoritative inspectors place at the top of the firmament, but all
10 of Zagat's top-rated restaurants for food have two or three
Michelin stars, suggesting that customers probably found these
places by using traditional guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 96 percent of our respondents answered in French, which
we assume means they are French, not Americans,'' said Nina Zagat,
a New York lawyer, who with her husband, Tim Zagat, started the
guides in 1982, at first as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Some 71 percent of the Parisian customer critics were men, which
may account for the listing of so many expense-account restaurants
as favorites, while in the United States, more than half the people
who fill out Zagat questionnaires are women.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris month for a round of parties to get the guide started,
Mr. and Mrs. Zagat said they got the idea for their guides when
they lived in Paris in the late 1960s. Clients and friends
constantly asked them for restaurant recommendations. The Zagats
found the available restaurant guides incomplete or otherwise
wanting and began compiling lists of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never knew when you walked into a Paris restaurant you
found in the Michelin guide whether it was a Victorian wood-paneled
place or a Norman half-timbered castle,'' Mr. Zagat said. Gault
Millau is more descriptive, but loquacious, he said, while Zagat is
terse but succinct, with excerpts from the questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Beauvilliers in Montmartre, the Paris Zagat says, is
``romantic'' and ``overflowing with flowers'' for some, but
``pretentious'' and ``odiously expensive'' for others. Chez l'Ami
Louis, a restaurant near the Bastille that isn't even in the
Michelin guide, is frequented, Zagat says, by ``people with big
appetites and Americans,'' consuming ``enormous portions'' and
paying equally big prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prices, the Zagats say, are higher in Paris than in any of the
other 45 cities that their guides cover, an average of $48 a person
for a meal, including wine and service, compared with $43 in London
and $31 in New York City. The top 10 restaurants in the best-food
category average $127.50, while the 20 highest-priced restaurants
in London average $97 and in New York City, $69, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Zagat top 10 in Paris are, in order, Taillevent,
L'Ambroisie, L'Arpege, Guy Savoy, Alain Ducasse, Faugeron, Lucas
Carton, Pierre Gagnaire, Michel Rostang, and Grand Vefour.

IN RESTAURANTS, DOING AS THE CHINESE DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I will never forget that narrow storefront on East
Broadway in Chinatown, where many years ago a Chinese business
acquaintance of my husband's once took us to dinner. There were
little pans of dried seafood in the window. The dishes were
plastic, the napkins paper, and the food, including my first taste
of Shanghai soup dumplings, was delicious.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I returned there on our own (the place is no
longer in business), but it didn't measure up to that first visit.
</P>
<P>
   Dining with someone who is Chinese is one way to be served food
that is truly superb. ``The restaurants treat Chinese people
differently _ they take more care and send out special dishes,''
said Judy Wong, the catering manager of Balthazar. ``When I dine
out with my father, he always asks what is the best and the
freshest.''
</P>
<P>
   For Westerners, dining the way the Chinese do may be the best
approach. Chinese-food mavens all recommend large parties of eight
or 10, so that it's easier to share more dishes. And it's wise to
develop a palate willing to forego the orange beef and give fish
heads, dried eel and water spinach a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never look at a menu,'' said Leonard Lopate, the host of ``New
York and Company'' on WNYC-AM and a Chinese-food enthusiast.
``Decide how much you want to spend per person, and ask the waiter
or manager to propose a meal.'' Unlike some, he said advance
arrangements are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the possibility that you may get something you
don't like or that someone at the table will freak out when they
bring the live shrimp,'' he said. ``But it's the only way you'll
get interesting food you may never have had before.''
</P>
<P>
   He raved about the buffalo carp at Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown.
Also in Chinatown, he likes Oriental Garden, Lin's Dumpling House
and Evergreen, a new Shanghai spot on Mott Street. For a small
party, he prefers Shanghai restaurants over Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jacqueline Newman, a professor of nutrition at Queens
College and the editor of Flavor and Fortune, a Chinese-food
magazine, said she never asks a waiter or restaurant owner to
suggest the food. ``I know people who think that's the best way,
but I don't,'' she said. ``They'll only give you what they think
Westerners will like.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also has little use for menus. ``My husband walks around
the dining room looking at what other people are eating and chooses
that way,'' she said. She said organ meats and unusual seafood are
less likely to be Westernized.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, you might be surprised how delicious an
appetizer of thin-sliced kidneys in a cold spicy sauce can be.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Schoenfeld, a restaurant consultant who has long been
involved with Chinese restaurants, recommends ordering a banquet in
advance. ``That way you know the head chef will be involved in the
planning and the cooking,'' Schoenfeld said. ``Most restaurants
have two separate systems, one for a la carte and one for banquets.
The head chef never gets involved in the regular menu.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chinatown, he likes Golden Unicorn, Mandarin Court and 20
Mott Street.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Ferretti, a contributing editor of Gourmet, whose wife,
Eileen Yin-Fei Lo, is Chinese and a cookbook author, said that top
restaurants will cook well from the menu but that they, too, need
to be nudged in the direction of authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a place like 20 Mott or Shun Lee, you can talk to the
owner or manager and say you want the food cooked Chinese style,''
he said. As an example, he said to request that the Peking duck be
done in traditional fashion, in three courses, or to ask for live
shrimp steamed with garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Other good bets, he said, are simple Cantonese steamed fish,
home-style pork belly with preserved mustard greens or Shanghai
red-cooked pork shoulder. He also said to stay away from fried
foods, which tend to be prepared for Western tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is dim sum, which levels the playing field because
everybody is offered the same dishes. The best tactic here? Head
for the least desirable table, as close to the kitchen door as
possible, especially in large dim sum palaces. That way the food
will be hot and fresh when it comes rolling your way. Glazed
chicken feet are delicious, but not when they're cold. &QL;

LABELS FOR RHONE WINES COMMUNICATE IN BRAILLE

<P>
   If there are bumps on the label, it must be Chapoutier.
Reasoning that blind customers want the same information that other
wine lovers look for on a bottle, Michel Chapoutier, a well-known
maker and shipper of Rhone wines, has put Braille labels on all his
premium wines, including appellations like Hermitage,
Crozes-Hermitage, Condrieu, St.-Joseph, Cote Rotie and
Chateauneuf-du-Pape. That adds up to nearly two million bottles
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the Braille, customers can learn the type and name of
the wine, the vintage date, the name of the winery (Chapoutier),
the town where the wine was made and the color of the wine, a vital
piece of information, since some of the appellations come in both
red and white.
</P>
<P>
   Chapoutier, who for years has run a wine auction to raise money
for the Bone Marrow Fund in France, came up with the idea of
Braille labels in 1994. Working with the French Association for the
Blind, he developed a Braille label for his Monier de la Sizeranne
Hermitage, a dense, smoky, long-lived red wine from the northern
Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   The wine was a fitting choice for the new label: the Association
for the Blind was founded by Maurice de la Sizeranne, whose family
once owned the vineyard that gives the wine its name. &QL;

A FOOD SHOPPER'S ESCAPE TO A SUPERMARKET DISNEYLAND

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDITORS: FIRST 5 GRAFS CAN BE CUT)
</P>
<P>
   I have just returned from the ballet. Not the one starring Darci
Kistler at Lincoln Center, the one starring me at Gristede's. My
co-star was the pathetic excuse for a cart that refused to dance
along.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, today was something of a victory; out of 15 items on
my list the store had 13 in stock, which may be a record. But I
still didn't get my eggs.
</P>
<P>
   There they were, right behind the hand truck piled with
Tropicana boxes that completely blocked the way. I backed up, into
two other dancers and their laissez-faire carts, and pushed down an
aisle that was clear, or at least I thought it was, until the Alpo
bags leaning against the shelves caught in the wheels and started
coming with me.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I love New York. But the town's dirty little secret is its
dirty little supermarkets. Sure, sure, they're not ALL dirty and
they're not ALL little. After all, there are places like the Food
Emporium at 68th and Broadway, quite large and if not dirty, just
messy.
</P>
<P>
   And if I'm lucky enough to want to see a movie playing at
Lincoln Square across the street, I might actually be able to
finish off one entire shopping list in only seven days _ before
it's time to start again. (And no, I'm not interested in paying
double at the corner deli).
</P>
<P>
   So, when I started hearing about Draeger's in the last year, I
suspected it might just be the supermarket of my dreams. Draeger's
opened a year ago in San Mateo, 15 miles south of San Francisco,
and occupies an entire city block. It is so spectacular, it was
even photographed for Town &AMP; Country. I knew it was only a matter
of time before destiny brought us together. And it did.
</P>
<P>
   Right on the edge of Silicon Valley, Draeger's is a veritable
supermarket Disneyland, measuring in at 60,000 square feet. It is
designed around a two-story atrium (Sunlight! Indoors!) where baby
moguls of the computer industry try mightily to dent their bank
accounts, and they may have met their match.
</P>
<P>
   This ``market'' is a grocery, butcher shop with its own
smokehouse, fishmonger with its own sushi chef, delicatessen,
cheese cave, bakery, florist, 30,000-bottle wine shop, candy store,
housewares emporium, food library and cooking school.
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor, there is a restaurant run by the former chef
at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco. Though this Draeger's is the
third supermarket of the same name to open in the area (of the
other two, one is in Menlo Park and the other in Los Altos), it is
by far the grandest.
</P>
<P>
   My day finally arrived. When the front doors opened and I
stepped into the enormous expanse of light and space, I saw on the
right a profusion of colors where the walls were covered with
flowering plants. To the left were glass cases filled with fresh
fruit tarts glittering with sugar syrup, homemade chocolates and
Black Forest cakes dotted with vivid red cherries. Everything was
there but the yellow brick road.
</P>
<P>
   I floated in, accompanied by two friends, Bob MacDonald and Ron
Valentino, who had moved to San Francisco from New York a few years
ago. It was noon.
</P>
<P>
   We started with lunch at Viognier, which means ``great variety''
in French. The chef is Gary Danko, who was named Best California
Chef by the James Beard Foundation in 1995. Though I haven't kept
track of who's won since, he or she would be hard-pressed to do
improve on the pancetta-wrapped prawns from the wood burning grill,
the gratin of polenta with roasted garlic cream or the chocolate
peanut brownie with caramel sauce. So much for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   After we were done, I ran into Diana Kennedy, the authority on
Mexican cooking. (Funny how I never see her at Gristede's pondering
the Goya selection). She was at Draeger's to teach two classes and
was busily perusing the Food Library _ 4,000 titles, including
hard-to-find cookbooks from Europe and the Far East. (Though the
books are available for reference, they are also for sale.)
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Ron were more interested in the Cooks Tools department.
Bob had been to Draeger's once before and was eager to come again.
Ron was more suspicious. Though an excellent cook, he keeps a sharp
eye on the bottom line. When Bob and I considered the merits of
buying a Bagel Block _ that wooden contraption that holds the bagel
so you slice IT in half, not your hand _ for $15.50, Ron muttered,
``Suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   But even his reserve quickly subsided, surrounded as we were by
bounty, bounty everywhere. Rosenthal china, lobster bibs, ravioli
forms, cookie cutters in the shapes of ducks and penguins. Room
followed room filled with Italian pottery, table linens, napkin
rings. (But no decent potholders, the one thing I actually needed.)
</P>
<P>
   Sated with things, we were ready for more food, and headed
downstairs to the massive produce department. Five varieties of
apples, all polished. Seedless watermelon. Emperor red grapes, each
one the size of a walnut. Mango, papaya, kumquats, limequats. The
mushroom section featured golden chanterelles, portobello,
shiitake, oyster and crimini. The tomatoes were astonishing, so
deep red and round that if Eve had only seen them she would have
skipped the apple altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking as I do for the three men in my life, whose motto is
``the spicier the better,'' I was impressed by the fresh chili
selection: Anaheim, Thai, pasilla, red Fresno, jalapeno, habanero,
serrano. Underneath them, the okra were lined up straight, like
soldiers, next to vibrant yellow peppers, shining zucchini and pale
ears of fresh white corn.
</P>
<P>
   The wine department was next, with 2,500 labels on dislay,
representing the 30,000 bottles in the cellar. For Francophiles
there is an extensive selection of Bordeaux and Burgundy. A locked
display case featured a Grande Fine Champagne Cognac, La Fontaine
de la Poyade for $799, and a Glenlivet Scotch, aged 50 years, for
$1,100.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There were also aisles filled with ready-to-drink California
wines and gallon bottles of liquor. (The freezer held Absolut,
Ketel One and Stolichnaya, all ready for the party.)
</P>
<P>
   Two women walked past us. ``This is so much fun!'' one
exclaimed, while the other nodded, filling her cart. Forget fun.
It's an orgy. Directly across the aisle from the wine and liquor
were Pez dispensers and Oreo ice cream cones. Life and all its
undiscovered opportunities started to glow like a sunrise. I looked
over at my friends. At that moment, I knew that we would live
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The three of us were drawn to the full aisle of beers, most from
microbreweries, including our favorite, He'Brew: The Chosen Beer.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the aisle was the 100-foot-long butcher counter,
which sells every meat imaginable, and 25 varieties of house-made
sausages. From the on-site smokehouse come freshly smoked chicken,
turkey, ham and trout. In the display case before us was a side of
pepper bacon, lamb curry sausage and pork sausage with porcini,
black olives and roasted peppers.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing standing between me and bankruptcy was the fact
that my hotel room did not have a kitchen, let alone a freezer.
</P>
<P>
   I started to feel drunk. Shelves of biscotti rolled by.
Sourdough walnut bread, sourdough cheese bread, olive and rosemary
and cinnamon raisin bread.
</P>
<P>
   Ron appeared with a bag of organic coffee beans. We smelled
them. Mmmmm. I looked in his cart. ``No sausages?'' I asked,
disappointed, and he started to lecture on low fat, which I found
hilarious after the polenta with garlic cream we all just ate. He
had a package of Martha's Low Fat Swedish Oatmeal Pancake Mix in
the cart, instead. I shook my head. If youth is wasted on the
young, California is wasted on the Californians.
</P>
<P>
   The fish section was beautiful, but no more so, to be fair, than
Citarella's. Though Draeger's has a full-time sushi chef and a
dozen varieties of fresh caviar.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese and charcuterie counter was astonishing. Draeger's
has a Halior aging case with three humidity chambers that can
simultaneously age different types of cheese, which means you can
request that a cheese be aged to the exact degree of ripeness you
want.
</P>
<P>
   The prepared-food counter seemed to go on forever. A pizza oven,
a meat carving station and a charbroiler for freshly made
sandwiches. That day there were three kinds of rotisserie chicken:
barbecue, rosemary and mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   Bob, the responsible one, was suddenly pointing to his watch. It
was 4 o'clock. Ron and I were amazed. ``The afternoon just flew
by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't get to make much of a dent in the 100 varieties of
mustard, 90 types of vinegar or 130 brands of olive oil. But the
cans of snails and cans of rendered goose fat displayed nearby
certainly stopped us in our tracks.
</P>
<P>
   We got on the checkout line. ``Do you get a discount?'' I asked
the cashier. She laughed. ``No, I'd be in worse trouble if I did,''
she said. ``I buy enough stuff here already.''
</P>
<P>
   And who could blame her, I thought, for the thousandth time, on
my way home today from Gristede's, yet again. Each time I have
shopped there since Draeger's, I have thought back on it fondly and
dreamily, like a boyfriend from junior year abroad you'll never see
again.
</P>
<P>
   Once home, I unpacked my groceries and reviewed the receipt.
Five Snapple iced teas at 99 cents apiece. I checked. I had bought
only four. One box of onion matzoh, $3.09. I checked. The label
said $3.19.
</P>
<P>
   OK. For my day's efforts, I had 13 out of 15 items, no eggs, and
was only down 89 cents. In New York, that's the good news. &QL;

MAINE AND NOVA SCOTIA: MOVING CLOSER TOGETHER  
 NORTHWEST AND DELTA RAISE BABY-SITTING FEES  
 NEW HORIZONS FOR FREQUENT FLIERS  
 TRAVELS WITH STEINBECK, ON VIEW IN SALINAS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21)

<P>
   Planning a trip between Nova Scotia and Maine? Once the choices
were a 10-hour car journey or a six-hour ferry ride. It's still 10
hours by car, but the ferry trip has been cut to two and a half
hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bluenose service, which carried people and cars across the
Bay of Fundy for 42 years, has been replaced by the Cat. The new
high-speed catamaran travels from Bar Harbor, Maine, to Yarmouth,
Nova Scotia, at speeds up to 54 miles an hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-built Cat accommodates 900 passengers, a third
more than the old ferry. Its capacity of 240 cars is almost the
same as that of the Bluenose. It has two passenger levels, five
parking ramps, airline-style seating, four passenger lounges, a
cafeteria, a casino, a duty-free shop, a sundeck and an arcade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Cat was scheduled to begin its summer schedule of
two round trips a day. On Oct. 3 it will revert to the off-peak
schedule of one trip a day until Oct. 31. The summer fare is $45
each way, $20 ages 5 to 16 and $40 over 64. Children under 5 are
not charged. The one-way fare for a car and driver is $100. Special
day trips and overnight packages to Yarmouth are available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cat is operated by Bay Ferries, a Prince Edward Island
company that runs ferries throughout the Maritime Provinces of
Canada. Call (207) 288-3395. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   Airline officials say the number of children flying alone has
risen significantly over the past few years, and this month two
U.S. carriers increased the fee they charge to chaperon
unaccompanied children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines have doubled the extra fee
charged for unaccompanied children traveling on connecting flights,
and Delta has added a charge for children flying alone on direct
flights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both airlines now charge $30 for an unaccompanied child aged 5
to 11 on a nonstop flight. And both charge $60 for children
traveling alone on a flight with connections. Delta does not permit
children under 8 to fly unaccompanied on connecting flights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airline employees supervise children from the time of departure
to the time of arrival at the final destination, where they are
turned over to a designated adult. The service is mandatory for
children under 12, but can be requested for those ages 12 to 17. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other major domestic airlines have no plans to raise their fees.
Most charge $30 for an unaccompanied child on a flight with
connections. &QL;

   Trans World Airlines has begun a new frequent-flier program,
called Aviators, to replace its Frequent Flight Bonus program.
Mileage from the old program has been transferred to Aviators. The
new program offers benefits based on money spent as well as miles
flown, quicker access to higher program levels and changes in award
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Members are awarded one bonus Aviator mile for each dollar spent
on full fares in first class, business or coach. Flights between
cities less than 750 miles apart require only 15,000 miles for
coach or 30,000 miles for first class. Longer domestic flights cost
25,000 miles for a coach ticket and 40,000 miles for first class.
More information: (800) 325-4815. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airtran, formerly Valujet, inaugurated its A-Plus Rewards
program in March. Airtran customers earn free travel through the
end of the year, redeemable on Airtran and several other airlines
(America West, American, American Trans Air, Continental, Delta,
Eastwind, Midway, Midwest Express, Northwest, Reno, Southwest, TWA,
United and US Airways).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All travel must be either to or from Atlanta, Orlando or
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Participants collect flight credit vouchers before departure.
Those traveling in coach class receive one voucher for each one-way
trip, those in business class receive two. Twelve vouchers are
needed for a travel-reward certificate. One travel-reward
certificate is required for a free round-trip ticket on any Airtran
flight, and two certificates are required for a round-trip economy
class ticket on another airline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free tickets on other airlines are available only for nonstop or
direct round-trip flights to cities that Airtran does not serve
within the United States (except Hawaii and Alaska) or to the
Bahamas from Atlanta. Thirty days' notice and a Saturday-night
stopover are required. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Redemption of a reward certificate for an Airtran flight does
not require the Saturday-night stopover or 30-day advance notice.
All credit vouchers must be redeemed for certificates by March 31,
1999. Certificates may be used for travel through December 2000.

   The National Steinbeck Center, a $10.3 million museum, gallery
and archive devoted to the life and work of John Steinbeck, will
open on Saturday in Salinas, Calif. Steinbeck, a winner of the
Nobel Prize, was born there in 1902 and brought up in a house that
still stands, about two blocks from the center.
</P>
<P>
   The town and its namesake agricultural valley _ the 85-mile-long
``Salad Bowl of the World'' _ figured prominently in Steinbeck's
writing, and he is buried less than two miles from the center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 37,000-square-foot center houses permanent interactive
exhibits that recreate places from Steinbeck's life and writings,
including Cannery Row and a plaza that reflects the author's
interest in the people, history and culture of Mexico. Rocinante,
the camper used by Steinbeck for ``Travels With Charley'' (1962),
is part of the collection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition gallery will open with ``This Side of Eden:
Images From Steinbeck's California,'' paintings and prints from
California artists of the 1930s and 40s, through Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   In the archive and library, researchers will have access to
first editions, a Steinbeck journal, typescripts, photographs and
audiotapes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Aug. 6 to 9, the center will be host to the 18th Steinbeck
Festival, a series of lectures, films and tours. This year's theme
is ``Travels With Charley: Beyond Steinbeck.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Steinbeck Center, 1 Main Street, is in the historic
Oldtown district of Salinas, a 20-mile drive inland from Monterey.
It is open daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $7, $6 for seniors
and students. Information: (408) 753-6411. &QL;

WHY ONLINE CHAT IS WHERE IT'S AT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I love to chat online. My husband, however,
hates it. He says he can tell when I have been chatting and to
whom. Can you tell me how he does it? I always erase the history,
but he has another way.
</P>
<P>
   _ You Talkin' to Me?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR YOU: Maybe your guilty conscience tips him off.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't really have anything to feel guilty about. Your
husband is the one who needs to unclench and join the rest of us
here in the late '90s. For millions of people, online chat has
replaced street-corner chatter and backyard-fence gossip. And, when
you consider that the guy on the other side of the fence may well
be Norman Bates, it's a heck of a lot safer as long as you use some
common sense: Don't give out your phone number or address, and
don't ever meet anybody you chat with in real life unless you do it
in a public place and drag a couple of your friends along. Oh, and
prepare to be disappointed, because in a chat room nobody is who
they say they are, and if they are, well, they're probably lying
about something else. That's OK. You can be whomever you want, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might think it's unhealthy to be friends with
strangers from around the world instead of your own neighbors. But,
really now, what do I have in common with a lunatic saxophone
player who puts ceramic chickens and one of those stupid windsocks
in his front yard? I'd much rather talk to Mandy, the 19-year-old
supermodel from Argentina, about quantum physics, geopolitical
economic strategy and interesting things you can do with Jell-O. At
least she says she's a supermodel. For all I know I'm talking with
Margaret Thatcher. Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, back to your husband being a loon. He's probably blowing
smoke about keeping track of your extracurricular typing. Maybe if
he's got way too much time on his hands, he's actually figured out
a way to make you think he knows all and sees all. For instance, if
you chat on Yahoo! or any other place where you use your browser,
the chat site not only shows up in your history folder, there's a
good chance some of the pages are in the browser cache. All you
have to do is dump your temporary Internet files to get rid of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe you're using some sort of a chat program that can log
your conversations, and your paranoid little hubby has switched
that feature on and forgotten to tell you about it. Could be he's
truly insane and has some sort of program running on your computer
that records all your keystrokes and commands. The problem is not
whether it's possible for him to do it, it's that he feels like he
has to do it at all, or at least intimidate you into feeling like
he can.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to get a cyberlife. Try exposing him to chat rooms in
small doses. Find a topic he's interested in, whether it's the
Stanley Cup playoffs or needlepoint. Locate a chat room or channel
dedicated to the subject, and ask him to try it out. Pretend you
like the same stuff. He can even call himself ``Studmuffin'' if he
wants to. I bet he'll get hooked the same way you did. And, if you
want, I'll introduce him to Mandy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if anybody out there knows a way that people can actually
track your chats the way this guy claims to, please let me know and
I'll pass it along. Nobody should be able to get away with that.
Besides, I'd hate it if my recipe for Hot Jell-O Surprise got out.
</P>

GRANDPARENTS HAVE IMPORTANT `WORK' TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mama Ruby died suddenly the year I moved to Sacramento. She was
84 and had lived a full life. But growing up, I never imagined
living out my own life without her.
</P>
<P>
   I think about her now, remembering those thick signature braids
on her head, her sense of humor, her heart, and I wonder how I ever
got this far without her.
</P>
<P>
   Never a day passes that I don't remember her, but I was reminded
recently of the important role she played in my life, the important
role all grandparents play. I've wished a thousand times we could
just sit and talk like old times. I wished my own daughters, Asha
and Jamila, could know such moments.
</P>
<P>
   They have only one grandparent, their father's mother, and she
lives miles away in Illinois. Although they talk by phone on a
regular basis and exchange gifts through the mail, they've seen her
only four, maybe five times in the nine years since Jamila was
born.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many children, their grandparents are either dead or
live too far away for regular visits.
</P>
<P>
   And so I was delighted to read that the Texas Department of
Protective and Regulatory Services recently launched a program to
fill that void.
</P>
<P>
   Young at Heart matches residents 55 and older to act as
surrogate grandparents to children at Tarrant County day-care
centers. They provide a wide range of services, including rocking
infants, reading stories, gardening and creating art and music.
</P>
<P>
   At ages 7 and 9, my daughters are too old to benefit from such a
program, but officials estimate that there are more than 265,000
Texas children in child-care facilities who can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to realize that children not only need homes
and good families, studies show that when an adult gives a child
one-on-one attention, it makes a huge difference in the way that
child grows,'' said Jennifer Clark, Tarrant County's project
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   By providing children with surrogate grandparents, officials
hope to enhance their self-esteem and promote healthy brain
development. They also believe that simple physical contact like
recognition, touching, hugging or a pat on the head gives a child a
sense of comfort and feeling of acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of Young at Heart also extend to its volunteers,
providing them the opportunity to feel needed, to the child-care
facility and even to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm just trying to do a little good, if I can,'' said
88-year-old Inetta Schnitzer. ``I love the youngsters, and they
seem to respond to the way I help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnitzer, who spends her time reading to 4-year-olds, is one of
two seniors who volunteer at Children's World in Arlington, said
director Sylvia Dougharty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children love her, and the parents just go crazy about
her,'' Dougharty said of Schnitzer, who has two grown grandchildren
of her own. ``We couldn't have asked for a sweeter person.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said that more seniors like Schnitzer are needed. To
date, only 10 have signed on with the program. There are about 90
child-care centers across Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to have at least two volunteers at each
center,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the program, interested seniors must undergo a
criminal background check and attend a 1 1/2-hour-long orientation.
Seniors interested in volunteering may contact Clark at 640-9600,
Ext. 2014.

   In the future, you might be consuming foods that include
high-yield, insect-resistant breeds of corn and herbicide-resistant
soybeans. They're called ``transgenic'' crops, and some people
claim they may hold the power to increase food production around
the world. Seed companies say the plants they've created are safe.
But who's to know what will come from a romp in the field with an
untamed weed? Josie Glausiusz, an associate editor at Discover
magazine, reports.

   This time of year one can see a slew of manmade objects slowly
crisscrossing the heavens. They weren't visible two months ago, and
they won't be around after August. But they're here now during
satellite season, when Earth's northern axis tilts just 5 degrees
from its maximum sunward extreme. Bob Berman, director of Storm
King Observatory in Cornwall and Overlook Observatory near
Woodstock, N.Y., reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemplating world hunger from the vantage point of a
well-laden breakfast table is certainly comfortable, if odd.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last January, executives of Iowa-based Pioneer
Hi-Bred International, the ``world's largest developer, producer
and marketer of genetically improved seed,'' gathered at a cafe in
downtown Manhattan for a discussion about global food security.
</P>
<P>
   The three officials and a group of journalists ate pancakes and
muffins as Pioneer's chairman and CEO, Chuck Johnson, outlined his
vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business we're in is ensuring that the world has the
capacity to have the food it needs to survive,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   That future capacity, he is convinced, can come only from the
crops that companies such as Pioneer are producing: high-yield,
insect-resistant breeds of corn, soybeans, sorghum and sunflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer makes some of its seeds conventionally, by creating
hybrids. Back in the 1920s, though, the conventional was radical,
and the typical farmer looked upon the newfangled seeds, in
Johnson's words, as ``witchcraft and Satanism _ until he got his
first taste of the yield.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, however, Pioneer has been offering
genetically engineered seeds, which have genes spliced into their
chromosomes that make them more resistant to insects and weed
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told the journalists about herbicide-resistant soybeans
and a variety of corn that produces a toxin normally made by a
bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, a million acres of the Bt corn were planted
in the Midwest, with an increased yield of 10 percent to 15
percent, thanks to the way the Bt toxin discourages corn-eating
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's vice president for marketing, Mary McBride, then
chimed in, claiming that these ``transgenic'' crops have the power
to increase food production in the developing world with minimal
environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer, as McBride put it, is creating ``virtual acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of transgenic crops claim that ecological and
evolutionary forces could turn these crops into disasters. Perhaps
the plants will prove so robust that they will grow aggressively,
like weeds, and invade other environments _ including a neighboring
farmer's fields.
</P>
<P>
   Virus-resistance genes could escape into weeds and make them so
hardy they'd outcompete endangered plants in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic-resistance genes (which botanists insert into
transgenic crops as supposedly harmless markers) might escape into
soil bacteria and from there into those that infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Crops engineered to carry Bt-toxin genes might trigger the
evolution of ever adaptive Bt-resistant bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Is all this worry just more witchcraft and Satanism? The only
way to know how seriously to take such doomsday scenarios is to run
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have only begun to do this work, setting up
experiments to see how readily transgenic genes and proteins can
escape the crops they were meant to help. The results thus far are
proving that the doomsday scenarios are not pure fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers are split over whether the results should be
cause for anxiety. Much of the concern over transgenic crops stems
from the promiscuous sexual habits of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can pollen from one breed of plant fertilize another,
but different species can sometimes mate and produce hybrids that
can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Genes in one population of plants (crops, for example) can thus
seep into another population (neighboring weeds).
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s geneticist Norman Ellstrand at the University
of California at Riverside began warning of the dangers of this
genetic escape.
</P>
<P>
   One could, for example, imagine an herbicide-resistance gene
getting into weeds and making superweeds that could take over a
field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this possibility hinged on how likely it was for crops and
weeds to hybridize, and for the transgenic genes to establish
themselves in the wild population.
</P>
<P>
   Ellstrand decided therefore to measure the likelihood, and in
1996 he reported that domesticated sorghum, Sorghum bicolor, could
readily form hybrids with a weed called Johnsongrass, Sorghum
halepense.
</P>
<P>
   (Domesticated crops are often surrounded by their close weedy
relatives, since both flourish under the same conditions.)
</P>
<P>
   Using harmless gene markers rather than actual transgenes,
Ellstrand found that wind-carried pollen could create hybrid seeds
over 300 feet away from the original crop.
</P>
<P>
   These hybrids produced pollen and seeds as viable as the
johnsongrass, meaning that they could spread just as aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   More recent experiments with actual transgenic crops also show
that inserted genes can move between species.
</P>
<P>
   Plant geneticist Rikke Bagger Jorgensen of Denmark's Riso
National Laboratory in Roskilde studied the yellow-flowered crop
called oilseed rape, known in the United States as canola and in
Latin as Brassica napus. Oilseed rape is a cultivated cross between
a weed called wild mustard, or Brassica campestris, and Brassica
oleracea, the cabbage plant.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen planted a version of oilseed rape engineered to
survive a weed killer called Basta alongside its wild ancestor (and
weedy neighbor) B. campestris.
</P>
<P>
   Fertile hybrids easily formed, and when jorgensen sowed the
hybrids together with the original weed, a second generation of
seeds was produced. These seeds grew to adulthood and turned out to
be impervious to Basta as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen returned to her fields the following spring and
discovered that this second generation had produced offspring of
their own, which continued to be herbicide resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these results, Jorgensen and others remain sanguine
about the prospects of transgenic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put in genes that give the plant itself a better
resistance, for instance, to fungal pathogens or to insect pests,
then you can minimize your use of pesticides, and that would be
beneficial to the environment,'' Jorgensen says. And she believes
that as long as transgenic oilseed rape is carefully managed, it
can be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spray very early, before the campestris flowers, you
minimize its potential to hybridize,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unwise to grow Basta-resistant oilseed rape
alongside a crop resistant to a different herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what you'll have is Brassica campestris plants with
multiresistance in very few generations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A weed with only one herbicide-resistance gene would, however,
still be manageable. As one researcher said, you can always destroy
the plants with another herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of herbicide-resistant crops creating the need for
spraying still more herbicides doesn't fit well with the
environmentally friendly image offered by companies like Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some critics think that biotech corporations are actually
comfortable with that prospect because they can make transgenic
crops as well as herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech companies, since they make the herbicides, don't
see it as a big problem, because it forces them to make a new
herbicide,'' says botanist Hugh Wilson of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been studying transgenic gene flow and its possible
effects not on the struggle between weeds and crops but between
weeds and rare or fragile wild plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide resistance isn't so much of a problem in this regard,
since weed killers are found only on farms. Of far more pressing
concern to him is the possibility that genes for resistance to
insects, viruses and fungi can be just as important in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that a spread of genes from transgenic crops
into wild plants could allow them to outcompete other species.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   One possible way to contain the threat of transgene escape might
be to bar certain genetically engineered crops when weedy relatives
already exist in a given place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no weeds related to maize in Europe,'' says French
cytogeneticist Anne-Marie Chevre of the national Institute of
Agronomic Research at Le Rheu. ``But we have a lot of wild species
more or less related to oilseed rape in the field everywhere.''
Therefore France has permitted transgenic corn to be grown on its
soil.
</P>
<P>
   The United States could similarly allow transgenic maize
soybeans, and potatoes to be farmed, since they have no wild
relatives with which they are sexually compatible here. On the
other hand, squashes and sunflowers do.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways that this policy might go wrong, however. A
desperate farmer might ignore the law and plant a transgenic crop
that can breed with local weeds.
</P>
<P>
   And crop-to-weed gene exchanges are only one kind of change that
transgenic crops can bring. Researchers have been developing a
transgenic potato, for example, that can fight off the aphids that
feed on it. The new potato produces a protein called lectin that
ruins the aphids' digestion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhouse tests have shown that this transgenic potato can
reduce populations of the peach-potato aphid by half. That's
impressive but not quite good enough to allow the potatoes to
survive on their own. To fully protect their crop, farmers would
need to introduce aphid-devouring ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   But as entomologist Nick Birch of the Scottish Crop Research
Institute in Dundee has shown, the lectin in the potato makes
ladybugs ill: After eating transgenic potato-glutted aphids,
ladybugs produce far fewer offspring and live much shorter lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though he has shown how transgenic crops can have
harmful effects that spread through a food chain, Birch doesn't
think his results are cause for alarm. If ladybugs can also find
aphids in the wild that are unaffected by transgenic potatoes, the
plant's harmful effects will be diluted.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Birch thinks that with careful tests of their
potential effects, transgenic crops can prove safe and useful in
reducing our dependence on pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows _ maybe those witchcraft and Satanism theories are
indeed wrong ...

<P>
   The night sky seldom offers a ``first'' _ an event never before
seen, even by the most grizzled observer.
</P>
<P>
   This past January featured one of those rare spectacles, when
the asteroid-observing spacecraft NEAR became the first
interplanetary craft visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the craft zipped in for a close approach (using Earth's
gravity to change its trajectory), the sun glinted off its large
solar panels, resulting in star-bright flashes in the northwestern
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fail to spot NEAR? Don't despair. While there won't be any more
interplanetary probes to view, this time of year offers a slew of
other manmade objects slowly crisscrossing the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't visible two months ago, and they won't be around
after August. But they're here now during satellite season, when
Earth's northern axis tilts just 5 degrees from its maximum sunward
extreme, allowing satellites as low as 200 miles to stand in full
sunlight even an hour after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four decades, some 7,000 satellites have been
launched into orbit around Earth. They deliver weather images,
monitor ground resources, provide telecommunications and
navigational aid.
</P>
<P>
   More often they're used by the military _ to spy on us even as
we try to spy them.
</P>
<P>
   Most satellites are invisible, but a few hundred are large
enough (typically school-bus size) and low enough (200 to 600 miles
up) to catch our eye.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest satellites orbit Earth in 90 minutes and take nine
minutes to cross the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites perched 600 miles up appear some 10 times dimmer,
take an extra 20 minutes to circle the globe and require up to 18
minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know you've spotted a satellite? Elementary, my dear
Westar. If it's a silent dot with no accompanying lights that moves
in a straight line, and if it crosses the sky in minutes rather
than seconds, you've spotted either an alien mother ship or a
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites sometimes appear to zigzag, but that's an optical
illusion resulting from imperceptible eye-muscle movements.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites travel every which way, but never east to west.
That's because they're usually launched in the same general
direction as the rotation of Earth, which gives them a free
1,000-miles-per-hour boost.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't circle the equator but are angled northward or
southward so they can fly over much of our planet in just a few
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Many TV viewers aim backyard dishes at communications satellites
stationed 22,300 miles up. Orbits at that distance are
geosynchronous _ the satellites orbit at the same speed as Earth
and so appear motionless. Don't even think of finding them; they
are a million times fainter than their lower cousins and hopelessly
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites can shine fairly steadily or wink on and off if
they're tumbling. And if they're tumbling _ and most do _ they're
no longer functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this space junk was always junk. Last October we passed
the 40th anniversary of the first shiny, useless, basketball-size
artificial satellite, Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sputnik was too small to be seen by the naked eye, and
the awestruck world gazed unwittingly at the huge discarded
third-stage booster that went with it into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Today over 22,000 pieces of unrecyclable debris clutter the
skies, garbage masquerading as fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   If you need help tracking the major satellites, the Web site
http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/spacecraft.html
provides current passages.
</P>
<P>
   Or simply go out as evening twilight ends and look around. After
only a minute or two you'll strike orbiting pay dirt.

WHY ONLINE CHAT IS WHERE IT'S AT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I love to chat online. My husband, however,
hates it. He says he can tell when I have been chatting and to
whom. Can you tell me how he does it? I always erase the history,
but he has another way.
</P>
<P>
   _ You Talkin' to Me?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR YOU: Maybe your guilty conscience tips him off.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't really have anything to feel guilty about. Your
husband is the one who needs to unclench and join the rest of us
here in the late '90s. For millions of people, online chat has
replaced street-corner chatter and backyard-fence gossip. And, when
you consider that the guy on the other side of the fence may well
be Norman Bates, it's a heck of a lot safer as long as you use some
common sense: Don't give out your phone number or address, and
don't ever meet anybody you chat with in real life unless you do it
in a public place and drag a couple of your friends along. Oh, and
prepare to be disappointed, because in a chat room nobody is who
they say they are, and if they are, well, they're probably lying
about something else. That's OK. You can be whomever you want, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might think it's unhealthy to be friends with
strangers from around the world instead of your own neighbors. But,
really now, what do I have in common with a lunatic saxophone
player who puts ceramic chickens and one of those stupid windsocks
in his front yard? I'd much rather talk to Mandy, the 19-year-old
supermodel from Argentina, about quantum physics, geopolitical
economic strategy and interesting things you can do with Jell-O. At
least she says she's a supermodel. For all I know I'm talking with
Margaret Thatcher. Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, back to your husband being a loon. He's probably blowing
smoke about keeping track of your extracurricular typing. Maybe if
he's got way too much time on his hands, he's actually figured out
a way to make you think he knows all and sees all. For instance, if
you chat on Yahoo! or any other place where you use your browser,
the chat site not only shows up in your history folder, there's a
good chance some of the pages are in the browser cache. All you
have to do is dump your temporary Internet files to get rid of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe you're using some sort of a chat program that can log
your conversations, and your paranoid little hubby has switched
that feature on and forgotten to tell you about it. Could be he's
truly insane and has some sort of program running on your computer
that records all your keystrokes and commands. The problem is not
whether it's possible for him to do it, it's that he feels like he
has to do it at all, or at least intimidate you into feeling like
he can.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to get a cyberlife. Try exposing him to chat rooms in
small doses. Find a topic he's interested in, whether it's the
Stanley Cup playoffs or needlepoint. Locate a chat room or channel
dedicated to the subject, and ask him to try it out. Pretend you
like the same stuff. He can even call himself ``Studmuffin'' if he
wants to. I bet he'll get hooked the same way you did. And, if you
want, I'll introduce him to Mandy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if anybody out there knows a way that people can actually
track your chats the way this guy claims to, please let me know and
I'll pass it along. Nobody should be able to get away with that.
Besides, I'd hate it if my recipe for Hot Jell-O Surprise got out.
</P>

   OHIO -- MUSKINGUM. The fate of the Muskingum River's possible
American Heritage Rivers designation may be decided today in St.
Louis when the initiative's advisory committee meets to come up

SMALL BANKS HOPE TO CASH IN ON A SENSE OF COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects circumstances of President Henry Givray's departure from
Giga.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this Gideon Gartner's last chance?
</P>
<P>
   Gartner, the cantankerous pioneer of the technology consulting
world, is trying for a second time to launch an initial public
stock offering for Giga Information Group Inc., his Norwell, Mass.
company.
</P>
<P>
   The goal: raise as much as $46 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giga tried to jump into a hot IPO market late in 1996 as a very
young company with less than two years' history, a product line
under development, and nothing resembling a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gartner, 62, is pushing to bring Giga public again. Sales
are growing rapidly, the company's research products and delivery
system are recognized as a distinctly new model, and Gartner
himself remains a powerful draw to clients.
</P>
<P>
   But there is trouble too. The small service company has lost a
staggering amount of money, $54.7 million in just three years, and
is running out of cash. Giga's new IPO underwriter, Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co., has given the company a $10 million bridge
loan to help carry it through the stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Early venture investors have been diluted by the financing
requirements of rapid expansion and Giga's working capital deficit
has grown to $13.8 million by March 31. Executive defections and
firings have created a revolving-door management team below
Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is bleeding red ink from every orifice and has been
for a while,'' said Howard Anderson, president of the competing
Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is no Gartner fan and there are many others in the
information technology consulting business who feel the same way.
But Gartner has been a powerful draw with consulting clients and
institutional investors for years. Critics may scoff, but others
don't hesitate to call Gartner a legend in his field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has demonstrated tremendous instincts over the years
about what customers really want,'' said Jeffrey Swartz, a former
senior vice president of marketing at Giga. ``I think the market
will eventually decide'' how to assess Gartner's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that file documents to sell public stock usually are
not permitted to discuss their business except in investor road
show meetings. Calls to Gartner and other Giga executives were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner, routinely characterized by a powerful intellect and
personality to match, has led a high-profile professional and
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tel Aviv and raised in America, Gartner made a name for
himself as a young classical pianist but left music for an
education in engineering and business at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Recently divorced, Gartner's former wife was featured in People
magazine this year making the case that she, not Tipper Gore or
anyone else, was the inspiration for the novel and movie ``Love
Story,'' the product of her years growing up in Brooklyn when both
author Erich Segal and Gartner were friends.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner started his career at IBM Corp. but later went to Wall
Street to become a star stock analyst at E.F. Hutton and
Oppenheimer. It was those years, in the 1970s, when Gartner
developed a strong following among investors and built a reputation
that continues to serve him today.
</P>
<P>
   He formed the Gartner Group in 1979, selling research and advice
to companies using technology instead of investors. His years of
experience at IBM were especially valuable and the company became a
star in a fledgling business.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group went public in 1986 and was sold to Saatchi
and Saatchi Group two years later. He came back to the company,
which went public again, this time as its chairman for a few years,
but left for good in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Gartner Group has since soared, to about $3.2
billion today. Other companies in the industry he helped create
also blossomed, either in their own IPOs or in sales to larger
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc., based in Cambridge, went public in 1996
and now has a stock market value of about $300 million. Meta Group
Inc., another publicly traded research company, is worth $261
million today.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gartner himself is clearly a rich man, it is unlikely he
achieved fabulous wealth comparable with the technology research
industry itself. People who know Gartner say he had discussed his
own personal wealth as being in the range of $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner sat on the sidelines from his home in Aspen for two
years before forming Giga, named after the first two letters of his
names, in 1995. Today, he still owns 31.9 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Giga had a big idea: providing customers access to blanket
technology coverage instead of pigeon-holed research based on
narrow categories of interest. Giga offered its customers access to
lots of analysts with different specialties. Now it distributes
information even more broadly to clients via the Internet for
annual fees of $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner had no problem raising money for Giga, going back to the
investors who had made money on his advice years ago. Among its
largest investors was a partnership led by James D. Robinson III,
the former American Express Co. chief.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner was thinking big from the beginning. He had to spend
heavily on research up front and employed a strategy that worked
well at the Gartner Group: building a very large sales force that
could cover a lot of territory.
</P>
<P>
   But that sales force, now about 100 representatives, was another
huge expense. The cost of sales and marketing last year, about $19
million, equalled all of Giga's revenues in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the research actually sold by Giga has won mixed
reviews. A survey of all technology research firms, conducted last
year by Information Week magazine, placed Giga well into the middle
of the pack in all categories.
</P>
<P>
   Giga has managed to retain about two-thirds of its clients year
to year, a figure below many other research firms' retention rates.
New Giga documents suggest its figure isn't directly comparable to
the rates of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Giga first saw its chance to jump into a hot IPO market in 1996.
An offering led by Lehman Brothers tried to raise $40 million.
Initially, the underwriters estimated an offering at $9 to $11 per
share and favorable reviews during the company's road show led to
hopes of a higher price. But the market began to cool as Giga's
offering drew near and executives pulled the plug at the last
minute, when it appeared they would receive only $6 or $7 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Giga's president, Ken Marshall, left a short time later and
nearly all of the company's senior executives went on to other
jobs. Management turnover became a regular feature at Giga.
</P>
<P>
   The company's top technology officer, Jacques Bouvard, was fired
last October. A month later, new Giga president Henry Givray
resigned. Cofounder David Gilmour gave up his top research post to
start a new company in February, three months before Giga's latest
IPO filing. Gilmour remains a Giga director and works as a
non-employee consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Giga's latest IPO effort may succeed or Gartner could raise more
private money. But the company is still expected to lose money in
the immediate future and has limited cash.
</P>
<P>
   Swartz, the former Giga marketing executive, said it would be a
mistake to count Gartner out now. ``Gideon has an incredible
reputation on Wall Street,'' said Swartz. ``He's proven again and
again that he can pull a rabbit out of his hat.''

MASTERING THE ART OF THE PERFECTLY GRILLED FISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: recipes at end of article) 
 (bl)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grilling a whole fish is to outdoor cookery what a triple axel
is to figure skating: the apex of the skill pyramid, daunting
enough to turn back many challengers. As such, accomplishing it
provides a sense of mastery.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other such pursuits, though, a perfectly grilled whole
fish is within reach of any backyard cook. Admittedly, it takes
some practice, so it is best to try it in private, revealing your
skills to outsiders only when fully developed. To take a short cut
around the learning period, we recommend the following simple
steps.
</P>
<P>
   First comes the fire. Seafood is best cooked over a medium-hot
fire, rather than a hot one. To reach this point, the fire must
build to a peak and then die down; try grilling on the way up and
the fish will almost certainly end up incinerated. A fire is
medium-hot when you can hold your hand about five inches above the
cooking surface for three to four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the grill grid is very clean and very hot. An easy way
to accomplish both of these simultaneously is to set the grid over
the coals just as the fire is lighted, wait till any flames die
down, scrub the grid well with a wire brush and then leave it on as
the fire heats up.
</P>
<P>
   It is also very important to choose the proper candidate for the
grill: a super-fresh fish of the right size. If you are grilling
one whole fish per person (which is the best plan), look for a fish
that weighs between 12 ounces and 2 pounds; if it is any larger
than that, you'll have trouble flipping it; any smaller, there will
be too many bones.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the fish, coat it very lightly with oil, and make
several horizontal slashes on each side, about two-thirds of the
way down to the bone. The slits will help the fish cook more evenly
and make it easier to tell when the fish is cooked properly.
</P>
<P>
   When introducing fish to flame, gentleness is a critical factor.
Carefully lay the fish down over the fire, and _ here is a crucial
point _ don't fool with it for four or five minutes. One's natural
instinct is to lift the fish and check to see if it is sticking,
but you should resist that impulse. It is important for a good sear
to form between the fish and grill so that the fish is easier to
turn when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   After four or five minutes, use your tongs to sort of worry the
fish free of the grill surface. Don't turn it at this point;
separate it from the grill, and then let it cook for three or four
more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the second decisive moment: turning the fish. Do not
flip the fish like a pancake or pick it up like a burger. Instead,
roll the fish over very gently. There is no reason for the fish
ever to leave the grill completely during this process.
</P>
<P>
   Despite your best intentions, sometimes the fish will rip apart
at this point. If so, bail out. Get a spatula, lift the pieces onto
a baking sheet, and finish cooking it in a 350-degree oven. The
presentation will suffer, but the fish will still taste great.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the fish does not rip, though, you're almost home. All
you have to do now is to let it finish cooking. To assess when you
have reached that point, simply push apart the flesh around those
slits and peer into the center. With a whole fish, you should leave
a trace of translucency at the middle, since residual heat will do
the final bit of cooking after you remove the fish from the grill
with your tongs.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to it. You are now ready to bear your
trophies to the table and receive the plaudits of your guests.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is also the option of grilling your fish inside
the wire mesh grilling baskets that have achieved a degree of
popularity. Some are fish-shaped, others are more versatile
rectangles. If you choose to use them, follow all of the
instructions above except for those involving turning and lifting.
</P>
<P>
   In our opinion, though, a wire basket does not really make the
process much easier, and it definitely blunts the glory. For full
satisfaction, there's nothing like facing the grill with only your
tongs, your skill and the fish you now know you can cook perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED WHOLE RED SNAPPER WITH AVOCADO-CORN SALSA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 ears of corn, husked, with silk removed (about 2 cups kernels)
</P>
<P>
   3 ripe but firm avocados, peeled, pitted and diced large
</P>
<P>
   1 red onion, diced small
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper, diced small
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   \ cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   6 dashes Tabasco, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chopped fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   { cup lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 1\-pound whole red snappers, scaled and gutted (or substitute
with ocean perch, bluefish or hybrid striped bass)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. Build a fire in your grill, placing most of the coals on one
side of grill basin so that the fire has hot and cooler sections.
</P>
<P>
   2. Make salsa: Blanch corn in boiling water for 3 minutes,
drain, and cool under cold water. Cut kernels off cobs, and mix in
medium-size bowl with avocados, red onion, bell pepper, olive oil,
vinegar, garlic, Tabasco sauce, cumin, chili powder, chopped
oregano, lime juice and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make three diagonal slashes about two-thirds of the way down
to the bone along both sides of each fish. Rub fish lightly with
vegetable oil, and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper inside
and out.
</P>
<P>
   4. Make sure grill grid is very clean, and place it on the fire
at least 10 minutes before beginning to cook.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gently place fish on grill over hot part of fire, and cook
for 4 minutes without moving. Then use tongs to gently free the
fish from the grill grid, but don't turn them. Instead, gently move
them to the cooler part of the fire, and continue to cook until the
down side is nicely charred, about 5 more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Roll fish over gently, without lifting from grill. Continue
to cook for another 10 minutes or until a peek inside the fish
shows that they are opaque throughout and just a trace translucent
near the center.
</P>
<P>
   7. Remove fish from grill. Top each one with several tablespoons
of Avocado-Corn Salsa, and serve immediately, accompanied by
remaining salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED WHOLE TROUT WITH ASIAN-FLAVORED SLAW
</P>
<P>
   Time: 35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded Napa cabbage
</P>
<P>
   { cup radish or alfalfa sprouts
</P>
<P>
   1 cucumber, peeled, seeded and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   \ cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   \ cup rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno or other fresh chili pepper of your choice, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   4 12-ounce whole trout, scaled and gutted (or substitute with
hybrid striped bass or ocean perch)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Build a fire in your grill, placing most of the coals on one
side of grill basin so that the fire has hot and cooler sections.
</P>
<P>
   2. Make slaw: In medium bowl, combine cabbage, sprouts and
cucumbers. In small bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, ginger,
garlic, chili, sugar and basil, and whisk together well. Add just
enough of this dressing to the cabbage-cucumber mixture to moisten
ingredients well, toss gently, and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   3. Follow steps 3 through 6 in recipe for Grilled Whole Red
Snapper, cooking fish for about 2 minutes less on each side. When
fish are fully cooked, remove them from grill, and serve at once,
accompanied by Asian-Flavored Slaw.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   Ripe Strawberries, Ripe, At the Greenmarkets
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Quarts of ripe, luscious strawberries from local
farms were lined up at stands at the Union Square Greenmarket last
week, and they should be available through early July. They were
being sold for $3 a quart by Caradonna Farm of Marlboro, N.Y.,
Sycamore Farm of Middletown, N.Y., and Hodgson Farms of Newburgh,
N.Y. Caradonna Farm offered two quarts for $5. Most of the other
Greenmarkets in the city also have strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Farm stands and some markets in the region are also selling
locally grown strawberries for $3 to $5 a quart. They are more
perishable than the California variety but have sweeter flavor and
a lovely perfume. They are sold at Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third
Ave. (71st Street), for $2.49 a quart, at Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560
Broadway (Prince Street), for $3 a quart, and at Fairway, 2127
Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132d Street), for
$3.89 a quart.
</P>
<P>
   This promises to be a banner year for Greenmarkets, with 27, up
from 24 a year ago. The three new ones will begin in mid-July, on
Wednesdays in Elmhurst, Queens, and on Saturdays in Greenpoint and
Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Exact sites have not been determined.
For Greenmarket schedule information: (212) 477-3220.
</P>
<P>
   Bread Marches On
</P>
<P>
   Ecce Panis is moving two doors up at the end of the summer, to
1126 Third Ave. (66th Street). The bakery, which is also at Madison
Avenue and 91st Street and Columbus Avenue and 74th Street, is
opening two new branches in September, at 434 Avenue of the
Americas (10th Street) and 4 World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   And with new plans come new products, including a dark and
savory onion pumpernickel and a rye bread ($2.50), assorted rolls
with flavorings like olives or chocolate (75 cents to $1.75) and
traditional Italian grilled panini sandwiches ($5.25 to $6.50).
</P>
<P>
   Hazardous to Waistlines
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate cigars may not be the newest idea for Father's Day.
But a man with a child's palate still might like the new filling of
crunchy peanut butter and chocolate being sold at all Starbucks.
And the $2.95 price makes for a gift that a child's allowance could
handle. But who can open the cellophane casing that wraps the
treat?
</P>
<P>
   Downsized Chocolate
</P>
<P>
   When John Scharffenberger's excellent chocolate was introduced
in the New York area in February, it was available only in bulk or
in hefty 3.3-pound bars designed for commercial use. Now it is also
being sold in a 9.7-ounce size, which is more convenient for home
bakers, and a 3-ounce candy-bar size. Both sizes are made from the
San Francisco company's fruity, bittersweet dark chocolate, which
is 70 percent cacao. The 9.7-ounce bars also come in 99 percent
cacao, which makes them about the best unsweetened baking chocolate
available.
</P>
<P>
   The large bar costs around $9 and the candy bar $4 at Dean &AMP;
DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street); the Gourmet Garage stores,
453 Broome St. (Mercer Street), 301 East 64th St. and 2567 Broadway
(96th Street), and Fresh Fields markets.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's Steak Sauce
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to actor Paul Newman's line of products is
serious stuff. Newman's Own Steak Sauce, one of his best products,
is spiced with enough mustard, horseradish, pepper and
Worcestershire sauce to give the taste buds a workout and stand up
to whatever flavors the charcoal grill can deliver. It has no nasty
preservatives to affect its clean, sharp flavor, and the
consistency is pourable yet thick enough to coat and glaze the
food. An 11.5-ounce bottle is about $4.25. All profits go to
charity.

A TURKEY'S FREEZER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I placed a fresh-killed turkey into the freezer in November.
Is it still good? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: If the turkey was properly wrapped, you may serve it without
qualms _ even to your guests this coming Thanksgiving. Fresh turkey
that has been wrapped well has an indefinite freezer life, as far
as food safety is concerned, according to the Agriculture
Department's Meat and Poultry Hotline. But the meat's texture and
flavor will gradually decline as it loses moisture.
</P>
<P>
   These changes are subtle during the first year and detectable
only to people with keen palates, so the roasted bird would
probably make a perfectly acceptable meal. After a year, though,
you may not want to serve it to guests you especially want to
impress.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can compensate for the loss of taste and the
dryer texture by using marinades or spice rubs or by cooking the
meat in casseroles or similar dishes in which it is one of many
flavorful ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to insure maximum freezer life for turkey and other
foods is to double-wrap it. The layer closest to the bird should be
a plastic wrap that clings as tightly as possible, to dispel air.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure that the wrap does not tear and that the ends are ample
enough to be turned for securing. For the outer wrap, use a heavy
foil, pressing it tightly to conform to the shape of the food. As a
second layer, you could also use another layer of plastic wrap, a
layer of freezer paper or a large freezer bag.
</P>
<P>
   If not wrapped properly, meat will be damaged by freezer burn,
meaning it will dry out and acquire a discolored or whitish cast.
It may also take on the flavors of other foods in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Trim away these dried, undesirable parts until you reach flesh
that is unaffected, and use it in soups and casseroles.
</P>
<P>

AN ASPARAGUS CLAFOUTIS THAT'S ALMOST A QUICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., this is the last of eight columns by Daniel Boulud, the chef
and owner of Restaurant Daniel in Manhattan. His collaborator has
been Dorie Greenspan. Next week: the first of eight columns by
Deborah Madison, the founding chef at Greens in San Francisco and
the author of ``Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone''; from Broadway
Books, 1997.) 
 (HLW)  
 By DANIEL BOULUD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The clafoutis has a long and controversial history.
The mother of all clafoutis is the one with sweet black cherries
that put the Limousin region of France on the gastronomic map. But
even as it was winning admirers, it was causing a rift between the
Academie Francaise, the guardians of the French language, who
defined it as a flan, and the Limousins, who insisted it was a
cake. The Limousins prevailed, as it is officially considered a
cake.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine what either would say about this clafoutis,
which celebrates one of my favorite vegetables, asparagus. My
rendition is savory, baked in a crust, and harks back to the
quiche, a recipe that is at least a half-sister to the clafoutis.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional clafoutis batter is a direct descendant of the
one used to make a crepe, but for this version I have replaced the
flour with a puree of asparagus and ramps, the garlicky wild spring
onions. (If you can't find ramps, garlic can be used.) I mix the
puree with eggs and heavy cream, season it well and then bake it
slowly so that the filling retains its spring-green color and
custardy texture, the better to contrast with the crumbly, buttery
crust and the slightly firm sauteed mushrooms, Texas onions and
thin slices of blanched asparagus, which are scattered over the
bottom of the tart.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get the most flavor out of the puree, it is
important to make sure that after you blanch the asparagus and
ramps, you dry them very well. It is not overkill to wrap the
vegetables in several changes of paper towels and allow them to
dry.
</P>
<P>
   I serve this with a salad of blanched asparagus spears, sliced
mushrooms and purslane, dressed with nut oil and sherry vinegar.
For me, this is not a garnish, but a part of the dish. It
complements the tart's lightness and adds a touch of coldness. It's
the yang to the yin of the clafoutis.

<P>
   1 tablespoon finely grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   \ pound purslane leaves, optional
</P>
<P>
   Hazelnut or walnut oil
</P>
<P>
   Sherry vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut 6 tablespoons of the butter into 6 pieces. Lightly beat 1
egg. Using a food processor with a metal blade, pulse the flour,
butter pieces and [ teaspoon salt until the mixture is crumbly. Add
the beaten egg and pulse until the dough forms moist curds. Shape
the dough into a {-inch-thick disk. Wrap in plastic and chill for
at least one hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Separate 1 egg, lightly beating
the white and reserving the yolk for the filling. Butter a
9{-by-1-inch-high round fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. On
a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to a thickness of [ inch.
Fit the dough into the pan, taking care not to stretch it. Cover
the crust with aluminum foil or parchment paper, and weight with
dried beans or rice. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 300
degrees, remove the foil and beans, and bake 5 minutes more. Brush
the inside of the crust with the egg white, bake 1 minute, then
transfer to a rack to cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. While crust is cooling, prepare the filling. In a large pot
over high heat, combine 2 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons salt.
Fill a bowl with ice water and set aside. Starting from the tip,
cut a 4-inch-long piece from each asparagus stalk. Cut the next 3
inches of stalk into \-inch-thick slices; discard the rest. Boil
the spears for 5 minutes, then transfer the spears to the ice water
to cool. Add the ramp bulbs or garlic to the pot, and boil for 5
minutes. Add the asparagus slices and ramp leaves, boil another 2
minutes, and transfer to the ice water. Drain vegetables, and set
asparagus spears aside separately. Squeeze the excess moisture from
the ramp leaves, and pat everything dry using several changes of
paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the remaining
tablespoon of butter and add the onions and rosemary. Saute until
softened but not colored, about 5 minutes. Add half of the mushroom
slices, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Saute
another 5 minutes, then set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   5. Preheat oven to 275 degrees. In the work bowl of a small food
processor or blender, combine the ramps, ramp leaves and half the
asparagus slices. Pulse to chop. Add the cream, remaining 2 eggs,
reserved egg yolk and salt, black pepper and cayenne to taste.
Process until smooth. Spread the onion mixture on the bottom of the
crust, and scatter the remaining asparagus slices over it. Pour in
the egg mixture almost to the edge of the crust; discard any
excess. Arrange 5 asparagus spears in a pinwheel in the center of
the tart, and sprinkle over the Parmesan. Bake until the custard is
set in the center, about 40 to 45 minutes. Cool on a rack for 10
minutes before cutting into 6 wedges.
</P>
<P>
   6. While clafoutis is cooling, prepare salad. In a mixing bowl,
combine remaining mushroom slices, remaining asparagus spears and
purslane. Add hazelnut or walnut oil, sherry vinegar, and salt and
pepper to taste. To serve, arrange a slice of clafoutis and some
salad on individual serving plates.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Chinese chefs are much more skilled than French
chefs,'' Ching Yun Pu said. And then he added, ``Although we do not
brag the way French chefs do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1981, and Pu, a master chef trained in pre-revolutionary
China, was working in a restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown. I
was working at a magazine there, trying to find the best Chinese
restaurants in the state. I couldn't do it on my own, so I enlisted
the help of Chinese friends (among them, Wayne Wang, then an
unknown filmmaker).
</P>
<P>
   They read the ads in Chinese-language newspapers, talked to
their parents and consulted employment agencies that placed cooks.
And then we started eating; before we were done we had found 50
astonishingly good restaurants cooking regional Chinese food and
catering almost exclusively to a Chinese clientele.
</P>
<P>
   I had been to China the year before, but working on that guide
gave me a new respect for Chinese food in America. As I ate Sichuan
minced squab soup, Shanghai lion's head, Chiu Chow crab roll and
Hakka stuffed bean curd, I learned about the enormous impact
politics and immigration laws have had on the Chinese restaurants
of America. It was not an accident that regional Chinese cooking
became a craze during the late 1960s; the Hart-Celler Act of 1965
allowed many more Chinese people into the country and brought new
chefs to our shores.
</P>
<P>
   America got Chiu Chow food as a result of turmoil in Southeast
Asia. The first wave of Hong Kong cooking was due to the Cultural
Revolution, which drove many people out of South China to Hong Kong
and from there to the United States. The second wave came courtesy
of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which increased
the Hong Kong immigration quota.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting the flavors these new immigrants brought with them was
exciting, and I became convinced that America was about to
experience an explosion of Chinese cooking. I was positive that
before long the country would have as many notable Chinese
restaurants as French ones.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years later, I have to admit that I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible to find a good Chinese meal in the United
States. As more Chinese people have come into the country, the
number and quality of small, regional restaurants have certainly
increased. If you want the Chinese equivalent of French bistro
cooking, you can easily find it.
</P>
<P>
   But China, like France, also has a venerable tradition of haute
cuisine. While expensive French restaurants in New York can hold
their own against many places in Paris, if you want to move beyond
steamed dumplings and stir-fries to experience the complexity of
Chinese banquet cuisine, the possibilities grow dimmer each year.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   Chinese food experts in this country contemplate this culinary
disappointment with deep sadness. The reasons, they say, range from
the apathy and lack of sophistication of American diners to a
shortage of great Chinese chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, San Francisco had the benefit of master chefs
like Pu. New York's Chinese restaurants of that period also showed
the influence of T.T. Wang, who opened the original Shun Lee
restaurants; Uncle Lou, a renowned banquet chef, and the chefs from
mainland China who opened Sichuan Pavilion. They had all been
classically trained, a process that can take years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our training was very hard,'' said Pu, who served a formal
apprenticeship in Beijing in the 1940s with one of China's most
powerful families. ``We were sometimes beaten when we made
mistakes. And we had to prepare each dish according to the classic
method, no matter what the conditions. In the winter we had to peel
shrimps, washing them with cold water because warm would have
changed their taste. No matter that our hands were burning from
cuts and stinging from the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The revolution, of course, put an end to all that. ``Who wanted
to be a chef in China from 1949 to 1985?'' said Michael Tong, the
owner of Shun Lee Palace and Shun Lee West, both in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But today's China is a different place. Tourism is booming,
along with national wealth. Hotels are being built. Restaurants are
opening. The market, Tong says, is getting bigger, and there are
not enough chefs. ``Over the years we must have had 500 chefs
coming and going at Shun Lee Palace,'' he said, ``and only 5
percent were trained in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Tong, also talks of the old system of apprenticeship, in which
young people who worked for famous chefs lived behind the kitchen
and did everything from making their beds to heating their wine.
But prosperity has changed that, as well. ``China has never thought
of being a chef as a high profession, and there is no tradition of
celebrity chefs,'' Tong said. ``Young people aren't being trained
as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is intense global competition for top Chinese chefs.
And rising salaries.
</P>
<P>
   A good chef in Hong Kong, says Philip Chiang, the owner of the
Mandarin Restaurant in Beverly Hills, Calif., can make more than
$100,000 a year. After taxes. If a restaurant in the United States
wants a chef of that caliber, it has to match those dollars. Few
chefs in the United States, no matter what their style of cuisine,
are paid that much money. ``Chinese chefs are better paid than
French ones,'' Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, though, with their growing tourist economy and new
freedom to enjoy luxuries in public, are increasingly willing to
pay whatever it takes to hire great chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Most Chinese experts are too tactful to say so, but money is
only one part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should Chinese cooks come here?'' asked Bruce Cost, the
restaurateur and author of several Chinese cookbooks. Cost, who is
not Chinese, was the chef and an owner of Monsoon in San Francisco.
He is now an owner of Big Bowl in Chicago. ``Anybody who can cook
can make a good living in Asia,'' he said. ``And if you're a
Chinese chef, you want to feed Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Simonds, a cookbook author and another non-Chinese expert
in Asian cooking, agrees. ``The best Chinese chefs,'' she said,
``don't cater to Westerners.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that many Chinese are convinced that Americans do not
value Chinese food. Tong is among them. ``Americans appreciate
French culture more than Chinese culture,'' he said. ``And
Americans have much more knowledge of French food.'' He noted,
rather heatedly, that he sometimes goes to Restaurant Daniel in
Manhattan and watches incredulously as people devour squabs. ``They
even eat them rare!'' he added. ``I used to put squab on the menu;
maybe I would sell two or three. And if I put eel, duck webs or
sliced kidneys on the menu, nobody orders that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cost said: ``There is a difference in what people like to eat.
The Chinese eat bones and innards. Americans don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Ms. Simonds said, ``In this country the audience is not
there to appreciate really great Chinese food.''
</P>
<P>
   Tong blames himself. ``In the '70s we invented all these dishes:
orange beef and crispy sea bass. There's no such thing in classic
Chinese cooking. When Americans eat Chinese food now, they want
crispness. They want sweetness. They want spicy. If I try to give
them red-cooked dishes, they don't understand or want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a shame. Red-cooking is a classic Chinese technique
that involves searing meat or fish in oil and then slowly stewing
it in a mixture of soy, sherry, rock sugar and spices like star
anise. The result is a glistening sauce with a complex flavor that
is simultaneously salty, sweet and rich.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I was invited to an elaborate banquet at Shun Lee
West, given by a friend eager to prove that Chinese food can be as
impressive as anything produced by the French. It was testimony to
the fact that when Shun Lee wants to pull out all the stops, the
kitchen is equal to the task.
</P>
<P>
   The meal began with cold hors d'oeuvres surrounding an edible
landscape, in which pandas carved out of vegetables cavorted around
a gelatin lake. Eight cold plates were set around it: crisp slices
of pig's ear in hot oil crunched pleasantly when you ate them.
Dried bean curd was cut into noodles and tossed with fava beans.
Pork kidneys had been soaked in many changes of water until they
were pure texture, little clouds under a hailstorm of Sichuan
peppercorns. Fish was richly smoked. Jellied pate rivaled anything
on the Champs-Elysees. ``They just don't sell,'' Tong said. ``We
sell one cold hors d'oeuvre for every 30 hot ones like egg rolls,
dumplings or spare ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Pu was already lamenting what had become of
his native food in American hands. Speaking of the Hunan food that
was then the rage in San Francisco, he said: ``What is often called
Hunanese food is something made up to please the American palate.
Once the pattern of spiciness and the overuse of garlic was
established, nothing could change it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another attitude that nothing seems to be able to
change, either. Drew Nieporent, the restaurateur and an owner of
Nobu, TriBeCa Grill and Montrachet in Manhattan, has been
considering opening a Chinese restaurant. But he said: ``One thing
worries me _ price. There's a certain conditioning about Chinese
restaurants that they shouldn't be expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Tong said flatly, ``American people won't come if you charge
more than $75'' per person.
</P>
<P>
   Cost said: ``Think about Hong Kong, where a single abalone dish
can cost $1,100. &UR;  &LR; And then ask why the restaurants here aren't as
good.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true: the most expensive meal I have ever had was in a
Hong Kong restaurant where dinner for two, without alcohol, was
almost $1,000, in American dollars. The crabs alone, with delicious
fat down to the end of their claws, cost $400. Would Americans be
willing to pay those prices?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they would not,'' said Cost, who still becomes angry when
he thinks about the reviews of his now-defunct San Francisco
restaurant, Monsoon. ``One review called it Asian food at European
prices. I was buying the same raw ingredients as Chez Panisse, but
there was an attitude that Chinese food had to be cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a prejudice that extends even to cookbooks, Ms. Simonds
maintains. ``Publishers tell me that people will pay more for an
Italian or French cookbook than a Chinese one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice, however, goes both ways, and even if you were willing
to spend a fortune on a Chinese meal, you might not succeed. There
are many small restaurants serving good regional Chinese food, and
they will feed you well. But when you get to the next level, eating
well becomes more difficult. Consider the Chinese food palaces that
opened when Hong Kong money was flooding into the United States in
the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong money is only invested in Chinatown and Flushing,''
Tong said. ``They only want to cater to Chinese people. They have
no interest in taking care of Caucasians.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are mainly pragmatic. ``The Chinese spend more
money,'' he said. ``They eat more quickly. Caucasians come in, just
a few of them, and they want to have a drink first. Then, when you
want them to order, they say, `Don't rush me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese also arrive in bigger numbers, he said. ``Look
around,'' he said. ``The Chinese go in groups. It's a cuisine of
sharing. In a Chinese restaurant there are no tables for two or
four; there are only big tables and private rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese people, Tong said, even order differently when they go
out to eat. ``They always,'' he said, ``order ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Haas, a Boston food writer, recently had a meal at one of
that city's best Chinese restaurants, New Shanghai. Julia Child and
Ms. Simonds were seated nearby, and he noted that their food looked
much more appealing than what was on his own table. When he asked
C.K. Sau, the chef and an owner of the restaurant, the reason for
it, Sau replied: ``When Julia and Nina come in, they don't order.
They call me the day before and say `C.K., go to the market, get
something fresh, get something that's in season.' They never order
from the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the culture gap unbridgeable? Probably not. Americans
could certainly become more knowledgeable consumers of Chinese
cuisine. Chinese restaurateurs could learn to trust American
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too late. Ed Schoenfeld, one of the first
non-Chinese to take Chinese food seriously, recalls that when he
was a manager at Uncle Tai's Hunan Yuan in Manhattan in 1973, the
chefs were extraordinary. ``The three top chefs each had 25 years'
experience,'' he said. ``The No. 10 chef had 10 years' experience.
The rest had learned in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The food was
wonderful. There aren't so many Chinese chefs of that caliber in
New York anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There may not, in fact, be many chefs of that caliber anyplace
anymore. Ms. Simonds has just returned from Asia. She said that
although she ate splendidly in Taiwan and Hong Kong, it was getting
harder to find good food there, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mentor, T.C. Lai, becomes very upset when he starts talking
about the general level of cooking there,'' she said. ``He is one
of the most knowledgeable people about Chinese food, and he thinks
the standard has gone down.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a banquet of whole shark fin, abalone with goose web and
fish maw, scallops and sea conch in brandy sauce, and minced
lobster in lettuce cups, Ken Hom, the man who tried to put a wok in
every American home, was supposed to discuss the reasons Americans
aren't interested in Chinese haute cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   And in a way he did.
</P>
<P>
   But Hom, impeccably attired in a gray Chinese-style suit with a
mandarin collar, spent most of the three hours at the Harbour
Village in San Francisco _ and several hours the next day as he
cooked in the kitchen of his blue Victorian house in Berkeley _
talking about why he was leaving the United States to live in
France.
</P>
<P>
   There is a connection.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, he said, have never given Chinese food the respect it
deserves and consequently he has never had the celebrity that might
be open to him had his field been French cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   This state of affairs is not true everywhere. In England, for
example, Hom, 49, is a star. ``I made my career outside the United
States,'' he said. ``I'm known here only to a small group of foodie
people. I'm a cult figure. I can't be a Richard Simmons type. The
country is so big people like me get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, however, his books are best sellers and his popular
cooking shows on the BBC network have kept him consistently in
front of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.K., I'm known like Julia Child is here,'' he said.
``The cachet of BBC is amazing worldwide. My programs are seen in
prime time. You've been on BBC and people lay their bodies before
you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his books, ``Ken Hom's Chinese Cookery,'' was published
only in England and sold 350,000 copies. He has a line of
ready-to-eat foods sold in British supermarkets; his line of
Chinese cooking equipment and sauces is available in 44 countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain alone he has sold more than 2 million woks. Which
means that Ken Hom woks grace the kitchens of roughly one in every
27 citizens. In America, 4,455 have been sold (even in Slovenia
they have sold more _ 5,701). His books have been published in
German, Dutch and Spanish. On German shop-at-home television, he
said, his equipment sold out in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   And he has a fan at 10 Downing Street. ``It's interesting that I
was asked by Tony Blair to cook for a heads-of-state summit,'' he
said, ``but when the White House has a Chinese state dinner it
doesn't even ask me for advice on what to serve. I'd have done it
for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Hom's catalog of slights might seem like sour grapes. But he is
so charmingly hospitable and so disarmingly open as he describes
his hurt that it is easy to sympathize with him. Besides, his eyes
crinkle when he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   So he is decamping to Europe _ following his cash flow.
Logically, he should be moving to England; but it's too expensive,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is heading for France, where his companion of many
years still has family. They have a 13th-century stone house with a
tower in the village of Catus, outside of Cahors, south of
Perigord. And a flat in Paris. ``We've always wanted to go back,
but financially it wasn't possible,'' he said. ``Now most of my
work is there. I like living in France because it is a food
culture. I love the life in a small village.''
</P>
<P>
   And his restored manor is far grander than the tiny house in
Berkeley that has been his home for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, judging from the photo album anyway, the kitchen in
France is far more expansive than the one in Berkeley, which is
packed stem to stern, up the walls and down, with jars of spices
and Western and Chinese cooking equipment _ including a wok stove,
a Western stove and an oven just for Peking duck. An island in the
middle of the kitchen has a chopping board and a couple of sinks.
It is surrounded on three sides with director's chairs, just the
right height for eating at the counter, which is what most people
want to do so they can watch Hom cook.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Hom hasn't spent that much time in California in
years. He is on the road 60 percent of the time. This year's
schedule, from April to the beginning of July, includes England,
Bora-Bora, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia and
Thailand as well as Berkeley and France.
</P>
<P>
   In his ideal world, he explained, he would live part time in
France and part time in Hong Kong, a city he loves because, he
said, people look like him and speak Cantonese, the language he
spoke until he was 6.
</P>
<P>
   Hom was born in Tucson, Ariz. When his father died eight months
later, his Canton-born mother took him to join relatives in
Chicago. He remembers his uncle's restaurant where there was one
menu for Americans and another, untranslated, for Chinese. In
Chinese restaurants, this is still the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese people are really adaptable,'' he said, ``and if they
didn't sell enough of their own kind of food they would go to the
lowest common denominator and give the customers what they wanted _
heavy stuffed egg rolls, sticky sweet-and-sour pork, stir-fried
beef dishes and plenty of soy sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   The only difference today is that chop suey has given way to
sesame noodles. A steamed whole fish with ginger, scallions and soy
sauce, a classic Cantonese dish, doesn't travel well in one of
those white cardboard carry-out containers.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent book, part memoir, part cookbook, ``Easy
Family Recipes From a Chinese-American Childhood'' (Alfred A.
Knopf, 1997), Hom quotes one historian who calls Chinese-American
food a ``distinctive species'' that was adapted by restaurateurs
``to suit the `lo fan''' (``barbarians'').
</P>
<P>
   Behind his gentle manner, charming smile and warm laugh, Hom is
expert at skewering American tastes. ``Americans don't appreciate
Chinese food,'' he said. ``They have dumbed it down. The perception
is that Chinese food is cheap grub.''
</P>
<P>
   Our banquet, at $636 for two, was hardly cheap grub. He pointed
his chopsticks at the perfectly cooked dish of scallops and conch
and commented that most people would say: ``What's the big deal? It
doesn't taste like Chinese food.''
</P>
<P>
   Hom's view is that so many of those woks eagerly bought in the
1970s are rusting in the far corners of American kitchens because
people chose to make such elaborate recipes that they tired of
them. ``They made 10-course Chinese meals and were exhausted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the last book, an effort to entice Americans back to their
woks, Hom returns to the easy recipes of home cooking with readily
available ingredients and simple techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The book was Hom's final effort to get Americans to pay
attention to Chinese food and, by extension, to him. It has sold
10,000 copies, his publishing house said.
</P>
<P>
   He described it as an attempt to make unfancy home-style Chinese
cooking accessible to Americans. ``The type of food Americans eat
is not the type of food Chinese would eat,'' he said as he cooked
several of the recipes. ``In my latest book I've tried to come to
grips with this.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Hom has found his niche. Recently he had his picture
taken by Patrick Litchfield, a celebrity photographer and an earl,
no less (he's the Queen's cousin). It was for the British Tourist
Authority, which is promoting the country by featuring those who
are changing the face of British life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stranger than fiction,'' said Hom with a laugh, but also with
a sense of having arrived _ somewhere, if not here. ``Here I am, a
Chinese-American, becoming this sort of icon in another country.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

     TECH COMPANIES SEEKING FOREIGN WORKERS
REPORTEDLY LAYING OFF AMERICANS
 &HT;     By CHRISTI HARLAN and KIMBERLY MARSELAS 
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some of the high-tech companies that are lobbying
to hire more foreign workers are also announcing layoffs of
thousands of U.S. workers, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, is using
the layoff numbers to bolster his insistence that companies
employing foreign workers take specific steps to protect the jobs
of U.S. workers _ steps that companies are strenuously fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so wrong with asking companies to advertise jobs and
hire qualified American workers?'' Smith asked in a news release in
which he listed 21 ``high-tech dependent'' companies that have
announced layoffs in the past six months. The list includes
Motorola Inc., which announced layoffs of 15,000 workers June 4, as
well as consumer-products companies such as Sunbeam Corp., which
announced 6,400 layoffs last month.
</P>
<P>
   The companies and their trade associations said Smith is making
a connection where there is none. Jerry Jasinowski, president of
the National Association of Manufacturers, said the layoff numbers
have little to do with a shortage of qualified U.S. technical
workers and the companies' desire to hire the best workers, no
matter where they come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who get laid off and rehired every day,''
Jasinowski said. ``Even with that, we'll have this shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement is the latest skirmish in what is becoming an
increasingly entrenched battle between Smith and the business
community over H-1B visas, which enable highly skilled foreign
workers to hold jobs with U.S. companies for up to six years.
</P>
<P>
   This year's allotment of 65,000 visas ran out almost six weeks
ago, and companies and their would-be employees are anxious for
Congress to make more visas available immediately and to boost the
number of H-1Bs available in coming years. The Senate has passed
legislation that would increase the visas, but the House version _
written by Smith _ is stalled because of corporate opposition to
the requirements he would impose on companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't know what I should do,'' said Valentina Videva, a
foreign student who worked as a manufacturing engineer at Texas
Instruments Inc. in Massachusetts until her student visa expired in
May. The H-1B visas were gone before she got one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I pack my belongings and return to Macedonia?'' she
asked. ``Or will the H-1B cap be increased so that I can stay
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Videva spoke Tuesday at a Capitol Hill press conference
sponsored by business and pro-immigration groups that are anxious
to see the House approve more visas. Outside the conference,
Smith's spokesman, Allen Kay, distributed the congressman's news
release questioning corporate layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which was not represented at the news conference in
Washington, does not see ``a direct connection'' between the
layoffs it has announced and the company's desire to hire H-1B
workers, said spokesman Lonny Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a direct relationship between one or the other,''
Hurst said. The company is hoping early retirements and natural
attrition will trim its work force to cure a short-term business
downturn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, we are always looking for the most qualified
people,'' including foreign workers, Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's legislation would require companies to attest that they
made ``good faith, timely and significant steps'' to hire U.S.
workers for the jobs and that no U.S. workers were laid off from
the jobs being filled by foreign workers. Employers say the
requirements sound simple. but could turn into bureaucratic
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said Smith believes that U.S. businesses should retrain U.S.
workers instead of hiring foreign workers for technical positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry where people are trainable and
retrainable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jasinowski, with the National Association of Manufacturers, said
the need for highly skilled workers is immediate: ``We're doing
everything we can to improve the training and education of American
workers,'' he said, ``but that's not going to be enough, soon
enough.''

   `X-FILES' MOVIE SEEKS NEW FANS
</P>
<P>
   David Duchovny believed that he was taking part in a first when
he filmed the ``X-Files'' movie last summer: starring in a
big-budget Hollywood film, playing the same character he plays in a
continuing television series.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then somebody told me there had been a `Beverly
Hillbillies' movie one year while that show was on, and then there
was a `Munsters' movie while it was on the air,'' Duchovny said.
``So maybe we're just the first  &UR; drama &LR;  that's made a movie while
on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, ``The X-Files'' movie, which opens Friday, is the
first film to be dropped into the middle of a television series
with a continuing story line. Duchovny, who is in New York this
week to promote the movie, admitted that recreating his Fox Mulder
character _ the FBI agent exposed to alien invaders, monsters of
all descriptions and government conspirators on every side _ posed
a few challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is all about storytelling,'' Duchovny said, ``which
leads to slight differences in how you play the character. On TV,
it's been five years. People know Mulder. In the movie, you have to
play him for people who are seeing him for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   What this means in the movie is a subtle shift in Mulder's sense
of the events surrounding him. ``In the TV show, we have so many
different types of episodes: monster shows, the mythology shows,
satiric-type shows,'' Duchovny said. ``We couldn't be all of that
in the movie. So there are some aspects of Mulder from the show
that you don't see in the movie. What happens is you see some
things that Mulder doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' has a steady audience of 20 million every week
on the Fox network. But Chris Carter, the creator of the series and
the film, said he had to open the movie up to nonfans.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's episodes of the series were being shot after the
movie's filming was completed. All Duchovny knew going into the
film, he said, was that the X-Files division of the FBI was going
to ``be closed down in the final episode of the season, when my
office burns down.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the starting point for the film. ``But I didn't want
Mulder to be moping around depressed when the movie started,'' he
said. ``That's no way to introduce a character to people. So I
talked it over with Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   They came up with an approach that included a touch of humor in
the early scenes of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that was really a risk,'' Duchovny said. ``We're
taking plenty of other risks with this movie, but I don't think my
characterization is a big one. The biggest gamble we're taking is
doing the movie at all. If the movie were not to work, it might
tarnish the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny said that he was very happy with how the film turned
out and that he expected to make another film if this one is a
success. Whatever happens, he said, ``I'm on board for this coming
year in the series.''

<P>
   A WRESTLER'S OTHER SIDE
</P>
<P>
   When Judson Vaughn, an independent filmmaker in Atlanta, cast
Steve Borden as a lead character in his first feature, he had no
idea about Borden's alter ego.
</P>
<P>
   In his day job, so to speak, Borden plays the silent and
menacing Sting, one of the most feared and therefore most popular
characters in World Championship Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   But without his frightening black-and-white face paint, Borden
is just another good-looking young actor learning his craft,
perfect for a role in Vaughn's romantic comedy ``The Real Reason,''
which focuses on five men who commit assorted crimes out of
devotion to beautiful women (hence the title).
</P>
<P>
   It includes some foreign-language wooing (with subtitles), an
oenophilia theme and some high-flown discussion of the philosophies
of Aristotle, Schopenauer and Kant.
</P>
<P>
   But because of Borden's other, more notorious identity, Vaughn
was able to sell his film's distribution rights to what he
described as ``a division of Turner.'' That division turned out to
be World Championship Wrestling, which promotes professional
wrestling matches, both as weekly fare on Turner's cable network
TNT and as enormously lucrative pay-per-view events. Sting is one
of its biggest celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's movie is being sold as a pay-per-view film this month;
the ads for it feature a fearsome photo of Sting, and this
headline: ``Warrior. Vigilante. Lover?! See Sting as You've Never
Seen Him Before.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is flattered that Turner thinks the more than 30 million
people who watch pro wrestling every week on cable television might
want to watch his film. But he's a tad concerned that wrestling
fans may sense a bait-and-switch tactic, while film buffs who might
enjoy his movie will skip it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smart romantic comedy in the vein of `Metropolitan' or
`Barcelona,''' he said. ``It was in the Peachtree Film Festival
last fall. Now it's being marketed as a wrestling movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm no elitist, and I didn't make the movie for
intellectuals or wine snobs. It's just that I think it's a pretty
good little romantic comedy, and I wouldn't mind if some
nonwrestling fans saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Turner pointed out that more than 36 million
people a week watch wrestling matches on cable: not a bad potential
audience for earning a producer some money from a pay-per-view
movie.

<P>
   DOUBLING `MONEYLINE'
</P>
<P>
   Trying to build audiences by capitalizing on one of its
better-known names, the Cable News Network is expected to announce
Wednesday that the financial news program ``Moneyline With Lou
Dobbs'' will be expanded to one hour from a half-hour, starting
next week, and will change its name to reflect a broader approach.
</P>
<P>
   The new show, ``Moneyline News Hour with Lou Dobbs,'' will
appear from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. weekdays, following CNN's ``World
News'' at 6. The name has been changed to enable Dobbs to present a
wider range of news reports, usually, but not always, with business
or financial ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   The move is another attempt by Richard Kaplan, president of CNN
in the United States, to generate ``appointment viewing,'' meaning
a program people will tune to regardless of whether they were
already watching that network or not. Currently, when Dobbs' show
comes on at 7 p.m., CNN's viewership usually increases by 20
percent, a network spokesman said.

CULTURE NOTES: FRESH LAURELS FOR COMPOSER; COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS;
RUSSIAN EXHIBIT EXTENDED; MEXICAN CONTEMPORARY ART;   STONES CANCEL

   Already the recipient of the gold medal for music from the
National Institute of Arts and Letters, the National Medal of Arts
and two Pulitzer Prizes, the composer Elliott Carter is the
recipient of another honor. The latest is the Prince Pierre
Foundation Music Award, bestowed by the Principality of Monaco and
carrying a prize of 100,000 francs or about $16,500. Carter, who
turns 90 in December, was given the award for his composition
``Allegro Scorrevole,'' commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra,
which gave it its premiere last year. The Prince Pierre foundation
was created more than 30 years ago by Prince Rainier III in memory
of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Vox Populi
</P>
<P>
   Accolades will do a lot for an achy breaky heart. Six years
after his hit song of that title, Billy Ray Cyrus left the TNN
Music City News Country Awards in Nashville on Monday night laden
with honors for best single, video, song, album and male vocalist.
The only one of his nominations that failed to translate into an
award was the one for Entertainer of the Year, which went to Neal
McCoy, who also triumphed over Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson and
George Strait. The winners are chosen by fans. At the ceremonies,
Reba McEntire won the Minnie Pearl Award for her charity work, and
Porter Wagoner was named a Living Legend.
</P>
<P>
   Second Chance
</P>
<P>
   Time eventually runs out on procrastinators, but those who have
been thinking about paying a visit to the Brooklyn Museum of Art to
see the 200 exquisite works from five major Russian museum
collections in ``Jewels of the Romanovs'' are getting an extended
chance to mend their ways. The display of priceless crown jewels,
imperial portraits and court costumes is prolonging its stay by a
week, until July 12.
</P>
<P>
   New Look
</P>
<P>
   Mention 20th-century Mexican art, and names like Diego Rivera
and David Siqueiros may come to mind. But much has happened since
their heyday. On Saturday, an exhibition showcasing a new
generation of contemporary Mexican artists opens opens at the
Chicago Cultural Center. Running until Aug. 23, it is titled
``Mexico Ahora: Punto de Partida/Mexico Now: Point of Departure.''
Featuring the works of 13 innovative artists, the show comprises
sculpture, photography, installations and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Silent Night
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones canceled their concert in Milan, Italy,
Tuesday after Mick Jagger came down with laryngitis. The concert
had already been rescheduled from May 30, when the guitarist Keith
Richards was unable to perform. Organizers said they were trying to
reschedule the performance for September.

 &HT;    Former Texas defensive genius Campbell critically ill
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Mike Campbell was about to make his biggest comeback,
perhaps his best contribution, if two decades too late. This was to
be no formal coming out of retirement, no full-time return to a
calling that had been his life's work for nearly 30 of his 76
highly productive years.
</P>
<P>
   The former longtime defensive coordinator under Darrell Royal
had been invited back into the Longhorns fold to impart his advice
in the formidable task of rebuilding the once-proud University of
Texas defense.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Campbell was wanted again.
</P>
<P>
   And he couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, life is playing one of its cruelest tricks on
this most honorable of men. At a time when new UT head fooball
coach Mack Brown and defensive coordinator Carl Reese were
petitioning him to share the brilliance that was Campbell's
defensive intellect, he is lying critically ill in a hospital bed
at Seton Medical Center, a victim of lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has called his room at Seton home for the better part
of two weeks, a staph infection robbing him of the precious white
blood cells needed for the fight. It is one of the few times in
this man's life that his defense has let him down.
</P>
<P>
   The man who drew up some of the finest defenses this program has
ever seen devised, who stopped threats from Roger Staubach to Joe
Theismann, could not concoct a defense to fight this final battle.
</P>
<P>
   Let it be said there has been no finer man who has coached at
Texas. There might have been those with better credentials _ if so,
it would be a short list _ and there are those who were called to
greater glory.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell was never about winning percentages or coaching
honors or silver hardware that gathered dust in a too-soon
forgotten trophy case. That's why he turned down head coaching
offers from Baylor and Texas Christian, preferring to remain loyal
to Texas, a trust that would hardly be returned in kind years
later.
</P>
<P>
   He was always about the kids _ pushing them, goading them,
inspiring them to be better players, stronger people. He worked
them hard and he worked them long. Three of those people were his
sons, twins Mike and Tom, and Rusty. It would be Tom who would hang
on to Bill Montgomery's final pass to turn back Arkansas in 1969
and give Texas its last undisputed national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Mike wasn't always soothing. He could holler and scream with
the best of them. But he always found a way to brag on the guilty
player to avoid any lasting emotional wounds. The coach never
forgot that he was a father as well.
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, he was nothing short of genius, able to sit in a
dark room armed with nothing more than a yellow pad and a clanky
projector and magically produce that week's defensive game plan
before the lights came on. Texas fans still marvel at the defense
that shut down a vaunted 1976 Oklahoma squad and, but for an Ivey
Suber fumble, would have brought Texas another win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so simple,'' said David McWilliams, a former pupil and
colleague of Campbell's. ``I always asked myself, `Why couldn't I
see that?'''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious was lost on a lot of people back then when coaching
was less about shoe contracts and personal agents and more about
team and championships. It wasn't enough about loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be all too true, Mike Campbell might have been the
greatest head football coach Texas never hired.
</P>
<P>
   For all that Campbell did to elevate Longhorns football over 20
wildly successful years, he will also be remembered for the job he
wasn't allowed to do. When Royal resigned in 1976, worn out by the
cheating ways of Barry Switzer and others, the line of succession
clearly pointed to Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   There was no good reason Campbell shouldn't have replaced Royal,
but the first telltale sign he wouldn't was a formal interview. He
and fellow assistant Ken Dabbs drove to the University of Texas
Tower in a heavy rainstorm. When they arrived, a gust of wind
hyperextended Campbell's umbrella, leaving him drenched and very
much distraught.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he was as respected a football coach as there was in the
nation. He was a true gentleman in every respect. He was
media-friendly and had a wit drier than a West Texas breeze. And,
above all, he had Royal's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the assistant coaches on Royal's first Texas staff in
1957 later became head coaches, Jim Pittman and Charley Shira among
them. Another, T Jones, became Texas Tech's athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, 1976, the heir apparent seemed such a foregone
conclusion that the city's ill-fated afternoon newspaper, the
Austin Citizen, printed a front- page story with the bold headline,
``It's Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   President Lorene Rogers and Board of Regents chairman, former
Gov. Allan Shivers, instead, turned to another former Royal
assistant, 38-year-old Fred Akers, who had the necessary
prerequisites. Turnaround season at Wyoming. Southwestern roots.
Deadly charm. Defiant chin.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Smith can name Bill Guthridge his successor in 1997, but
Darrell Royal wasn't afforded that privilege in 1976. The
54-year-old Campbell was out faster than yesterday's trash.
Secretaries openly cried. Staff members stoicly cleaned out their
desks. Royal assistant Spike Dykes called passing over Campbell
``the greatest injustice that's ever been done.'' Dabbs said it was
``like breaking up a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell deserved so much better. What followed was a decade of
acrimony that, along with the deterioration and eventual ruin of
the Southwest Conference, served to kick the underpinnings out of a
once-great, once-feared dynasty that was one of the bedrocks of
college football.
</P>
<P>
   Akers' teams competed hard and won big until the lingering
bitterness between the Royal and Akers camps completely engulfed
UT. Some 10 years later, Akers was dismissed despite flattering
numbers, and so, too, in turn were McWilliams and John Mackovic.
Their inability to return Texas to the ranks of the nation's elite
came partly as a result of weaker staffs, the antithesis of Royal's
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Campbell wouldn't have won enough either, this
legend-following being a rather dicey proposition. But when it came
to trusted, respected assistants and decent men, one clearly stood
out.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mike.

projects, PenPartner can be used to create original works of art or
draw a mustache on your boss's computerized photo.
</P>
<P>
   Users can draw freehand, edit or trace images, and add their own
handwriting to almost anything. It can be used with a computer
mouse, or it can replace the mouse and be used to drag, drop,
double-click and zoom around the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's pressure-sensitive, this drawing tool responds to
every hand movement. Press harder for thicker and darker lines, or
lighter for thinner and more opaque lines.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like what you've drawn, turn the pen over and use
the eraser. The software automatically recognizes the eraser and
removes what you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Bundled with Corel Print &AMP; Photo House, PenPartner has a
suggested retail price of $99.95.

damage and loss of data.
</P>
<P>
   Its maker, American Power Conversion, claims that sensitive
modem connections, such as PCMCIA cards, make laptops even more
susceptible to damaging power surges than their desktop cousins.
</P>

<P>
   Tripmate, which operates on AA batteries or an optional
cigarette lighter adapter, retails for about $200 and is bundled
with a copy of Street Atlas USA.

 &HT;    Cloudy days for Sunbeam?
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ With Al Dunlap gone, will Sunbeam Corp.
stay?
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap's removal as chairman and CEO chief executive officer of
Sunbeam raises questions about the company's future in Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the situation say Sunbeam, which
employs about 110 at its Delray Beach headquarters, is not likely
to leave. ``Why go through the pain and expense of relocating the
headquarters again,'' said Larry Pelton, president of the Business
Development Board of Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap moved Sunbeam's headquarters to Delray Beach from Fort
Lauderdale after he took over in 1996. He announced plans in April
to move Sunbeam to a new complex site in Boca Raton that would
house operations from the three companies Sunbeam bought in March.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam signed a 15-year lease for nearly 150,000 square feet at
Peninsula Executive Center, a two-building complex under
construction off Butts Road. The builder, CarrAmerica Realty Corp.,
said Monday that Dunlap's departure won't affect the project.
</P>
<P>
   But newly named CEO Jerry Levin indicated Monday that he may
pull back from Dunlap's plan to centralize all operations. ``My
feeling is that for Sunbeam, it won't work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean Sunbeam may not need to triple the 50,000 square
feet it now occupies in Delray Beach. In that case, the company
could stay in Delray Beach or move and use only part of the space
it's rented in Boca Raton. In either case, Sunbeam would need to
find a tenant for part or all of the Boca Raton space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lease is already fully executed and in place,'' said Jim
Peterson, CarrAmerica's regional vice president of Florida.

 &HT;    Sunbeam gives 'Chain Saw Al' the ax
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH _ Al Dunlap, best known for laying off tens of
thousands in a ruthless formula for cutting costs, has himself been
fired as chairman and chief executive officer of Sunbeam Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Citing continued operating losses and the company's inability to
meet its own earnings forecasts, Sunbeam's board of directors said
recently it has lost confidence in Dunlap's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to restore Sunbeam's credibility,'' Director
Peter A. Langerman said from the appliance maker's Delray Beach
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap's ouster brings to a close a saga that began here in
1995, when the boisterous corporate gunslinger rode into town
dragging Scott Paper Co. and loudly proclaimed ``a great day for
Boca Raton.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Dunlap sold the stripped-down paper company after
eliminating 11,000 jobs, and its Boca Raton headquarters was
closed. Not long after that, he joined Sunbeam and moved it to
Delray Beach from Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   But what was to be Dunlap's crowning achievement _ the creation
of a consumer product powerhouse through the consolidation of
Sunbeam and three newly acquired companies _ has ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what happened today, I don't think he'll ever work
again,'' one former employee of Sunbeam said Monday. ``He's
humiliated.''
</P>
<P>
   Langerman, who represents Sunbeam's largest shareholder,
investor Michael Price, will replace Dunlap as chairman. Jerry W.
Levin, former chairman and CEO of Revlon Inc. and Coleman Co., will
serve as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Levin represents financier Ronald Perelman, the part-time Palm
Beach resident who in March became Sunbeam's second-largest
shareholder when he sold the company his interest in Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Sunbeam has reported a first-quarter loss of $44.6
million and warned that the red ink will spill into the second
quarter. And despite assurances from Dunlap that his plan will work
given time, the stock (NYSE: SOC) has tumbled 70 percent from a
12-month high of $52 in early March.
</P>
<P>
   It closed Monday at $15.75, down $2.31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine that Ron Perelman was happy,'' said Connie
Maneaty, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Even
though he didn't have board representation at the time, he's a
force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dunlap met his match in Perelman, whom he reportedly
clashed with when the two met at Perelman's Palm Beach home late
last year during the initial negotiations on the Coleman deal.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Dunlap struck the $2.5 billion deal to buy Coleman,
along with smoke alarm maker First Alert and Mr. Coffee maker
Signature Brands USA, when he couldn't find a buyer for Sunbeam.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street had driven Sunbeam stock so high on faith in
Dunlap's record of richly rewarding shareholders that the company
was seen by prospective buyers as too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   So Dunlap, who acquired the nicknames ``Chain Saw Al'' and
``Rambo in Pin Stripes'' for his ruthless cost-cutting tactics,
decided to take a different approach: He would build the company
instead of dismantling it.
</P>
<P>
   But things quickly began to unravel. In April, Dunlap fired
consumer products chief Don Uzzi and said he expected to report
lower-than-expected sales as well as a loss for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Monday at his Boca Raton home, Uzzi, a veteran of Quaker
Oats, PepsiCo and Procter &AMP; Gamble, said the board's decision
improves Sunbeam's prospects for success ``exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap unveiled a far-reaching cost-cutting plan on May 11 that
called for slashing the total three-company work force by more than
6,400 jobs to 9,500 and closing numerous plants, warehouses and
sales offices.
</P>
<P>
   But in a news release Monday, Sunbeam's board said it does not
expect the company to meet even the revised earnings forecasts
Dunlap released at that time: 5 to 10 cents a share for the quarter
that ends this month and $1 a share for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it was the earnings (that spurred Dunlap's
firing),'' said William Steele, an analyst with Buckingham Research
Group in San Francisco. ``The board must have felt uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sunbeam's five independent directors met Saturday in New
York and set up a conference call with the two absent board
members: Dunlap and Sunbeam Chief Financial Officer Russell Kersh.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Charles M. Elson, a law professor at Stetson
University in St. Petersburgcq, made the motion to fire Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the motion, but it was a sentiment shared by everyone
on the board,'' Elson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap did not return calls Monday to his Boca Raton home.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the company say Dunlap knew things were not
working, but refused to acknowledge the problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, two senior executives sent Dunlap a memo outlining
the dim outlook for sales and second-quarter earnings, according to
a source close to the company. But Dunlap refused to meet with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was known in the organization that you can't go to Al with
a problem,'' one former Sunbeam employee said. ``He just wanted
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, it seems, was overconfident to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, Sunbeam's new CEO, said Monday that many of Sunbeam's
employees are working on compensation incentive systems that are
dependent on earnings-per-share targets.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company hasn't met the lofty financial goals, many
workers haven't been making much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a big morale booster,'' said Levin, who added that
he expects to work to ``set some realistic targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin, Sunbeam's new CEO, also said he will be working with
Sunbeam's major customers, which include discount chains Wal-Mart
and Kmart, to sort out the bloated inventories they have
accumulated. He declined to promise a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of you who've worked with me before know I can be a
little slow to declare success,'' said Levin, who engineered
Revlon's turnaround for Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   The board denied Dunlap's removal was tied to concern over the
company's 1997 financial statements. A report by Barron's last week
said that 1997 profits were based largely on accounting tricks, a
charge denied by both Dunlap and company auditor Arthur Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, the Buckingham Research Group analysts, said he believes
there is no underlying problem with Sunbeam's business or its
brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business just has to be run on a consistent long-term
viable strategic plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Langerman, Sunbeam's new chairman, said Monday the board has
given Dunlap no severance pay and issues related to his employment
contract have been referred to the company's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Dunlap signed a lucrative three-year employment
deal with Sunbeam, which gives him $2 million a year in salary, a
grant of 300,000 shares of common stock and options to buy 3.75
million shares at $36.85 a share.
</P>
<P>
   That contract states that if Dunlap is fired for cause, he will
have the right to exercise the vested portion of his latest option
award, as well as all previous options, for 90 days after his
firing. If Sunbeam's stock doesn't rebound in that time, the
options from his new contract will be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunlap, who walked away from Scott Paper $100 million
richer, won't be hurting for money. He'll still feel the sting of
losing a job, however.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing, says J.E. Smith, mayor of Bay Springs,
Miss., a town of 2,200 that lost 350 jobs when Dunlap closed its
two Sunbeam plants in 1996 and early this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he won't wonder where he's going to get his next
meal, like a lot of my people,'' Smith said. ``I thought about
calling him and asking if he needed any work. I need someone over
here to mow the parks.''

`SYMPTOMS OF CULTURE': FROM SHAKESPEARE TO JELL-O 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By SARAH BOXER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first few pages of ``Symptoms of Culture,'' Marjorie
Garber helpfully defines the words symptom and culture. Both
definitions are Freudian. Symptoms, she writes, are repressed
``ways of speaking,'' and culture is something that can be read
``as if it were structured like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garber's dreamy idea of culture determines her style of
analysis in this book of essays. If culture is dreamlike, then it
is necessarily full of fragmentary and repetitive elements, double
entendres, malentendus and puns.
</P>
<P>
   And analyzing culture, like analyzing a dream, is a game of free
association. The difference is that there is no awaking from
culture. Once you slip into it, you can't get out, not even for a
moment of interpretation. That is a crucial difference.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garber, the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of English at
Harvard University and the director of the Center for Literary and
Cultural Studies there, uses her own wacky brand of erudite
free-association to analyze everything from Roman numerals and
faked orgasms to football and Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay about greatness, she connects the Great Wall of
China to the idea that greatness used to be a synonym for fat or
well-born, to the fat, ill-born Ralph Kramden's sign off to his
wife Alice, ``Baby, you're the greatest!'' to ``I am Oz, the Great
and Terrible,'' to the idea in ``The Wizard of Oz'' that greatness
is what happens away from home, to the idea that in baseball
greatness is the home run or homer, to the greatness of Homer, the
author of the first of the Great Books (which was about going
home), to the fact that Homer Zuckerman was the man who bought
Wilbur the great pig in ``Charlotte's Web,'' to the idea that
Wilbur's greatness was not inherent but an effect created by
Charlotte the spider who spun the words ``Some pig'' into her web.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this breathless exercise in free association lead?
``Greatness is an effect of decontextualization,'' Ms. Garber
writes. In other words, those who believe in inherent greatness
have forgotten that: Behind every great pig is a spider who has
done some serious spin control.
</P>
<P>
   There are no inherently great pigs or great ideas or great
people. Context is everything. To live in a culture is to be
embedded in a web of cultural associations. And those who ignore
this are doomed to misunderstand whatever bits of culture they use
or praise. Take, for example, Ms. Garber's special bete noire, the
``disembodied, free-floating quotation'' from Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   During Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court confirmation hearings, she
writes, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., tried to defend Thomas' name by
reading a speech from Shakespeare's ``Othello'': ``But he that
filches from me my good name/ Robs me of that which not enriches
him,/ And makes me poor indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was, Simpson missed the irony dripping from the
words. They belonged to Iago, the great manipulator, and the speech
that Simpson quoted with such earnest feeling was intended, Ms.
Garber writes, as ``an example of the most blatant hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garber, the author of ``Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and
Cultural Anxiety,'' ``Shakespeare's Ghost Writers'' and ``Coming of
Age in Shakespeare,'' is not defending Shakespeare. She is
defending contextuality.
</P>
<P>
   Whether she is looking at Shakespeare's speeches or Jewish
identity or women's orgasms, she finds that they are often misread
because their meaning is disguised in a complicated network of
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, a ``key piece of prosecution evidence'' in
the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the Jell-O box that the
government contended was the conspirators' password. Was it just
evidence or was it a perfect symbol for Jewish betrayal?
</P>
<P>
   According to the case against the Rosenbergs, Julius had cut the
Jell-O box ``into two odd-shaped pieces'' and kept one half for
himself. The other half was to have been brought to Ruth
Greenglass, Julius' sister-in-law, by a courier. Harry Gold
testified that he was that courier and took the piece to David
Greenglass, saying ``I come from Julius,'' or was it ``Benny sent
me,'' as he first remembered it?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garber suggests that Gold, whose memory seemed faulty at
best, was in fact free-associating. She thinks that the Benny he
had in mind was Jack Benny, whose radio show was sponsored by
Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, it is not, I think, insignificant,'' she writes,
``that Jack Benny, born Benny Kubelsky, was a Jewish comedian.''
Why? ``Gelatin as a product, and Jell-O as a brand, was much in
debate among Jewish leaders,'' for some gelatin comes from very
un-kosher things and yet Jell-O was popular in many Jewish homes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Portnoy's Complaint,'' for example, Alex Portnoy praises
his mother's uncanny ability to ``make jello with sliced peaches
hanging in it, peaches just suspended there, in defiance of the law
of gravity.'' Risen peaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Jell-O box, Ms. Garber argues, was the ideal emblem of
Jewish conspiracy, for it ``both marked and crossed the borderline
between Jewish and Christian, American and foreign, kosher and
traif.'' And if that were not enough, what about the accidental
irony of a certain Commie-sounding Jell-O ad: ``Is there a Party
hiding in your Ice-box?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Symptoms of Culture'' is tantalizing, amusing, learned and
frustrating. At a number of points one has the sense of being in a
maze and encountering certain culturally loaded terms _ greatness,
Jewishness, Shakespeare, and even the letters C, M and O _ over and
over again. Why? Perhaps because Ms. Garber represses all
interpretations of them.
</P>
<P>
   If we live in a web of cultural associations, as Ms. Garber
suggests, then we cannot even step out long enough to analyze its
structure. The only kind of cultural analysis we can do is akin to
the kind of dream analysis we could do while sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   In traveling through the dreamland of culture, Ms. Garber takes
Freud as her guide. But her real mentor seems to be Charlotte the
spider. Like Charlotte, who gets her vocabulary from soap-flake
boxes and magazine ads, Ms. Garber takes her examples from popular
culture. Like Charlotte, she believes in the power of spin. And
like the great spider, her web of words is circular.

A VISION OF RUSSIA'S FUTURE: ART VS. DESPOTISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toward the end of his tour of Russian culture, James Billington
suggests that Russia's future will be decided by a clash between
art and despotism. That conventional coda does not do justice to
the more complex if less wishful history that he tells, which
demonstrates that art can be in the service of despotism as well as
at war with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Face of Russia'' begins Wednesday night with the
mysteriously beautiful icons, the oldest and perhaps deepest
expressions of Russian culture, which symbolized a religion that
served many generations of czars and resisted assaults by several
generations of Communists.
</P>
<P>
   And it ends with the movie classics of Sergei Eisenstein, which
served the Communist cause until they ran afoul of Joseph Stalin.
If anything, this series resists the conventional worship of art as
liberator and confirms that the relation between art and power
remains ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   It's a visually rich tour. Billington, the Librarian of Congress
and an eminent historian of Russian culture (as well as the author
of a companion book to this series), ranges from 10th-century
religious art up to today's moviemakers, with pauses along the way
at lovingly photographed onion-domed cathedrals and baroque
palaces, musical masterpieces in performance and great novels in
intriguing adaptations.
</P>
<P>
   He is in search of connections, between the works of art and the
larger culture, between Russia and the West, between power and
creation.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable and energetic though he is, as a television
personality and critic, Billington lacks the forceful individuality
of such masters of the tube as Kenneth Clark and Robert Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   His observations are never less than informed and informative _
he is especially interesting about the origins and enduring
significance of the icons _ but rarely exciting. His performance
and language smack of the lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporaries whom he calls on to lend grand meanings to
the proceedings tend to settle for art-appreciation cliches:
Mstislav Rostropovich, the cellist and conductor, says Mussorgsky
gives us the Russian soul; Vladimir Mirzoev, a theater director,
says Gogol helps readers understand their own motivations.
</P>
<P>
   The result is edifying in an easy-to-take way, but references to
the continuing power struggle in Russia often seem to be straining
for relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is much here to be savored, one craves to be
unsettled. I was grateful for what is probably an overwrought
assessment by a theater director who, by way of both tribute and
condemnation, calls Eisenstein's films ``a gigantic advertising
agency of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that without the ``false memory of events'' they
imposed, ``the Bolsheviks would never have succeeded.'' His
conclusion: ``We owe to the cinema the entire Communist regime.''
Now there's a claim for the power of art to delude that ought to
trouble its worshipers. &QL;

RUMORS ABOUT WAYLON JENNINGS' RETIREMENT HAVE BEEN GREATLY
EXAGGERATED
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BC-WAYLONJENNINGS-CD) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it was just because Waylon Jennings' contemporaries
seemed to be in decline during the past two years: Carl Perkins
died, Johnny Cash was found to have Parkinson's disease, Merle
Haggard had heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   So where was Waylon?
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, doctors suggested he take some time off due to
health issues including diabetes and heart bypass surgery, both
dating to the '80s. So he did. And suddenly, the outlaw legend and
Buddy Holly protege became the object of speculation. Would he
retire? Was he dying?
</P>
<P>
   The talk is the only thing that's bothering him now, he says. He
has a new album, ``Closing in on the Fire,'' released Tuesday. He
turned 61 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hanging in there,'' Jennings said during an interview last
week from his Nashville office, miffed at the mention of that
R-word, ``retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to borrow a line from an earlier Jennings hit,
``Maybe I'm used, but baby, I ain't used up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings still intends to do the occasional show. But with the
new album; a voice-over for a Nickelodeon children's series, ``The
Angry Beavers''; the re-release of his '93 kids' album, ``Cowboys,
Sisters, Rascals &AMP; Dirt''; an appearance in a new
``Highwaymen''-based movie; and a collaboration with Jerry Reed,
Bobby Bare and Mel Tillis, Jennings isn't lacking for things to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a lot busier than I intended to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is on Ark 21, an independent, eclectic-format label
based in Sherman Oaks, Calif., after years on RCA Records and
shorter stints on other labels, including MCA and CBS/Epic.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Copeland, Ark 21 chairman, said Jennings is ``as vital and
interesting today as when he first started,'' and praised his new
album as ``one of the best he's ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes collaborations with Sheryl Crow, Travis Tritt, Marty
Stuart, Sting, Mark Knopfler and Jennings' longtime friend, Carl
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, too, seemed pleased with the project, which includes
five songs he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His other projects are quite eclectic:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Old Dogs'' with Jerry Reed, Bobby Bare and Mel Tillis, which
will be telemarketed: ``That could set music back 20 years. Shel
Silverstein wrote all the songs, so they're great songs, but I
wasn't there when they passed out the songs, so I got all the dirty
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``Highwaymen'' movie project, called ``The Long Kill,''
isn't a true ``Highwaymen,'' Jennings said, because Johnny Cash
didn't participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get killed early, and then do the narration,'' he said.
``Willie started in on me about five or six years ago about this. I
did a great dying scene _ just kerplunk, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cowboys, Sisters, Rascals &AMP; Dirt'': ``A lot of that stuff is
about myself, and a lot of it is about kids I've known.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American Film Institute announced the winners
Wednesday night in a contest for the 100 best American films of all
time. And the winner was ... the perennial favorite, ``Citizen
Kane,'' Orson Welles' 1941 classic film about the rise and fall of
a media titan, made when Welles was only 25.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the top 10 included, in order of ranking,
``Casablanca,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``Gone With the Wind,''
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``The Graduate,''
``On the Waterfront,'' ``Schindler's List'' and ``Singin' in the
Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the 100 winners was televised on CBS. They
were chosen from a pool of 400 finalists selected by the institute.
Ballots were then sent to 1,500 prominent Americans, among them
screenwriters, directors, critics, President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. The film institute would not say whether Clinton
and Gore voted.
</P>
<P>
   The film institute established the contest to promote the first
100 years of American filmmaking. The criteria for winning included
historical significance, critical recognition and awards, and
popularity as measured by box office, syndication, video sale and

     SENATE PANEL DELAYS DECISION ON AIR FORCE
SECRETARY NOMINATION
 &HT;     By SHANNON JOYCE 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Armed Services Committee will meet in a
rare executive session this month to discuss whether or not Daryl
Jones, nominated as Air Force secretary, has been cleared of
wrongdoing in a Florida bond sale inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a Florida state senator, answered the committee's
questions for two hours Tuesday but failed to provide proof that he
is no longer subject of an inquiry into a $200 million bond sale
last October by a Florida securities firm to finance an expansion
of Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   No decision will be made on Jones's nomination until after the
committee meets in the private session, said John DeCrosta, a
spokesman for the panel. He said that would take place before the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an
inquiry into the airport bond sale, and the Miami New Times, a
weekly newspaper, questioned whether Jones worked as a unsalaried
employee or a paid consultant for Douglas James Securities, Inc..
</P>
<P>
   Jones said someone from the Securities and Exchange Commission
told him he had been cleared in the inquiry, but would not give the
person's name during his public conformation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he worked as an investment banker for Douglas James
Securities, one of several Miami firms that help the city with bond
issues, but left to pursue other interests. When the city wanted to
remove Douglas James from the list of firms doing bond work, Jones
said he came back as a municipal finance professional to help the
firm keep its relationship with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the firm did keep its contract with city, and as part
of a usual rotation, oversaw the sale of the airport bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A 1977 graduate of the Air Force Academy, Jones served for seven
years as an F-4 fighter pilot before entering the reserves. He was
elected to Florida's House of Representatives in 1990 and to its
Senate in 1992. President Clinton nominated Jones for the Air
Force's top civilian slot in October.
</P>
<P>
   While other senators at the hearing asked Jones to simply
explain what happened in connection with the bond sale, Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., questioned Jones about his duties at the firm, what
kind of benefits he received, and how he was paid.
</P>
<P>
   Warner and other committee members questioned Jones on
professional problems such as an incorrect line on his resume
saying he still is a reserve fighter pilot and press reports that
his former colleagues called him ``an unsafe pilot with attitude
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always tried to conduct myself in a way that treats
everyone with dignity and respect,'' Jones said. ``I can't even
begin to venture into the minds of other people as to why they
would do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he chose to stop flying several years ago when a
state congressional election, a new law practice and a growing
family made it too difficult to devote a week each month to flight
training _ not because his superior officer threatened to yank his
flight status. As for the outdated line on his resume, he said it
was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also outlined his vision for the Air Force during the
hearing, calling the F-22 stealth fighter one of the service's top
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delicate battle between readiness and modernization is our
biggest challenge,'' Jones said. ``We can support modernization
only if we reduce the cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said two of the biggest problems facing the Air Force are
cost overruns and delays in the development of the F-22 and a
bloated infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have that plane as soon as possible,'' Jones
said. ``It shouldn't take 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he supported consolidating bases to make more money
available for research, acquisitions, and personnel and ``get the
optimum use of our resources.''

GREENSPAN SAYS MERGER WAVE WON'T HURT ECONOMY OR CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
Congress and government regulators Tuesday not to intervene too
quickly in the current wave of multibillion dollar mergers sweeping
some U.S. industries.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the mergers
should have little impact on the overall U.S. economy and on
American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who asked, ``What
happens to the people in these mergers?'' the Fed chairman admitted
that job losses would result. But he added that the nation's
growing economy should be able to handle the displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 300,000 U.S. workers lose their jobs each week but
said that with the creation of new jobs the unemployment rate
stands at a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects of the present merger wave on concentration have
yet to be determined, but there is little reason to expect their
influence will differ substantially from the merger wave of the
early 1980s, which produced at most a slight increase in
manufacturing concentration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was joined by several top antitrust officials at the
committee's hearing on what impact the recent mergers could have on
the economy. He noted that the nation is now experiencing its fifth
wave of mergers since 1900, the others having occurred at the turn
of the century, in the 1920s, 1960s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Justice Department, the United States is
expected to see $1.75 trillion dollars worth of mergers this year,
more than the combined value of mergers in all of the years between
1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have expressed concern that a number of big bank
mergers could force consumers to pay higher bank fees because of
reduced competition.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that while the mergers had reduced the overall
number of banks nationally, the number competing in any given
region remained about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also criticized government antitrust regulators for
trying to prevent mergers based on sketchy industry forecasts. ``At
the end of the day, I would have a lot of problems with preventing
mergers based on the predictions of how a market will evolve,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress and government antitrust officials should wait
to see how mergers affect the economy before attempting to break up
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Joel Klein, antitrust chief at the Justice Department, and
Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued
against waiting until after a merger occurs to determine whether it
was a good or bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I radically disagree with waiting,'' Pitofsky said. ``If you
wait until after the companies have come together and the employees
have been fired, it is very difficult and expensive to break them
up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who challenged 31 mergers in 1997, told the committee
that the growing number and size of mergers ``can be expected to
have long-term effects on markets and on the future of our
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said his division would challenge only those mergers
that regulators believed would raise prices or limit competition.
``The key to what we do is that we focus on competition, not
size,'' Klein said. ``Our economy is the most powerful in the
world, and that is due in large part to our belief as a country in
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan attributed the growing number of mergers to the
increasing use of computers and other high-tech equipment in many
American firms.
</P>

 &HT;    CNN stands behind story as military advisor resigns
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A military adviser to CNN has resigned in protest over a recent
report that U.S. armed forces used deadly nerve gas on U.S.
defectors in Laos in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   CNN is standing by its story.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Perry Smith quit his position as
military adviser, stating that he had tried and failed to get CNN
to issue a retraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had tried very hard for a week to convince (executives) to
do a major retraction, but to no avail,'' Smith told WorldNetDaily,
a politically conservative website that has previously been
critical of the CNN story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly stand by the accuracy of the reporting, which was
done over eight months and included talking to more than 200 people
up and down the chain of command,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
said Tuesday. Tom Johnson, CEO of CNN Newsgroup, and Richard
Kaplan, president of CNN/U.S., were both traveling Tuesday and
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN report, which originally aired June 7 on the debut of
``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' has caused a firestorm of controversy.
Correspondent Peter Arnett reported that a secret U.S. military
operation, ``Operation Tailwind,'' used sarin nerve gas to kill
American defectors during the Vietnam War. Among those interviewed
who appeared to support the charge (although stating they did not
have direct knowledge) were former Secretary of Defense Melvin
Laird and former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral Thomas
Moorer. Maj. Gen. Smith was on retainer to CNN, and occiasonally
appeared on air as a military expert. He received most of his air
time during the Persian Gulf War, when he was a regular presence.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the CNN report have also cited the version that
appeared in Time magazine, written by Arnett and CNN producer April
Oliver. Time turned the main headline into a question: ``Did the
U.S. Drop Nerve Gas?'' But the Time story was as emphatic in its
assertion as the CNN report.

GREENSPAN SAYS MERGER WAVE WON'T HURT ECONOMY OR CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
Congress and government regulators Tuesday not to intervene too
quickly in the current wave of multibillion dollar mergers sweeping
some U.S. industries.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the mergers
should have little impact on the overall U.S. economy and on
American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who asked, ``What
happens to the people in these mergers?'' the Fed chairman admitted
that job losses would result. But he added that the nation's
growing economy should be able to handle the displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 300,000 U.S. workers lose their jobs each week but
said that with the creation of new jobs the unemployment rate
stands at a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects of the present merger wave on concentration have
yet to be determined, but there is little reason to expect their
influence will differ substantially from the merger wave of the
early 1980s, which produced at most a slight increase in
manufacturing concentration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was joined by several top antitrust officials at the
committee's hearing on what impact the recent mergers could have on
the economy. He noted that the nation is now experiencing its fifth
wave of mergers since 1900, the others having occurred at the turn
of the century, in the 1920s, 1960s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Justice Department, the United States is
expected to see $1.75 trillion dollars worth of mergers this year,
more than the combined value of mergers in all of the years between
1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have expressed concern that a number of big bank
mergers could force consumers to pay higher bank fees because of
reduced competition.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that while the mergers had reduced the overall
number of banks nationally, the number competing in any given
region remained about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also criticized government antitrust regulators for
trying to prevent mergers based on sketchy industry forecasts. ``At
the end of the day, I would have a lot of problems with preventing
mergers based on the predictions of how a market will evolve,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress and government antitrust officials should wait
to see how mergers affect the economy before attempting to break up
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Joel Klein, antitrust chief at the Justice Department, and
Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued
against waiting until after a merger occurs to determine whether it
was a good or bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I radically disagree with waiting,'' Pitofsky said. ``If you
wait until after the companies have come together and the employees
have been fired, it is very difficult and expensive to break them
up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who challenged 31 mergers in 1997, told the committee
that the growing number and size of mergers ``can be expected to
have long-term effects on markets and on the future of our
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said his division would challenge only those mergers
that regulators believed would raise prices or limit competition.
``The key to what we do is that we focus on competition, not
size,'' Klein said. ``Our economy is the most powerful in the
world, and that is due in large part to our belief as a country in
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan attributed the growing number of mergers to the
increasing use of computers and other high-tech equipment in many
American firms.
</P>
<P>
   He said technology has allowed companies in many industries to
expand nationally and globally, which has led them to look for ways
to enter new markets. Instead of trying to push their way into the
new markets, many companies simply buy or merge with established
firms in the areas.

   A priest, minister and rabbi were playing their usual Wednesday

   Specifically, they started to compare how they decided what
portion of the collection to keep for themselves and what portion
to give to God.
</P>
<P>
   The minister explains: `I draw a circle aroung myself and toss
the money in the air. Whatever lands in the circle I keep for
myself. What ever lands outside the circle, I give to God.`
</P>
<P>
   The priest then adds: `I use a similar method, except that
whatever lands in the circle I give to God, and whatever lands
outside the circle I keep for my personal needs.`
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi then proclaims: `I use the same method, as well.
Except, that when I toss the money in the air, I figure that
whatever God wants he'll take.'

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will be unsettled over much of the Northeast again on
Wednesday, as a large dip in the jet stream persists. Bands of
showers will sweep across northern New England, buoyed by a flow of
moist air from the Atlantic. Eastward-moving showers and
thunderstorms will ignite over the Appalachians, as the mountains
act as an elevated source of heat for rising parcels of warm air.
Meanwhile, a few stronger storms will accompany a cold front
approaching the coast as it dislodges the sultry mass that is in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Although a front lay draped from the Carolina coast to the
Tennessee valley, sinking air currents and ample sunshine will
bring little risk for rain from the Deep South. It will stay hot.
Florida will remain parched, with brush ires continuing. North of
the front, weak high pressure will prompt sunshine in the parts of
the Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous low pressure for the season will crawl northward
through the Plains states. Clusters of showers and thunderstorms
will precede a surge of hot air in the central Plains. Meanwhile,
isolated severe storms will fire up in Texas and Oklahoma, where
dry air east of the southern Rockies meets with humid Gulf of
Mexico air.
</P>
<P>
   A stalled front will be the focus for frequent rains from the
northern Plains to the northern and central Rockies. Downpours will
locally produce more than two inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the far West, sunshine will be abundant with seasonal
temperatures in most places. However, patches of morning fog and
low clouds will interfere with sunshine along parts of the Pacific
coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Carolina Ice
</P>
<P>
   Ice has been falling from the sky with unusual frequency around
Wilmington, N.C. During the past 40 days, four days with hail have
been recorded at Wilmington, tying the record for the most days
with hail in any year since records began there 127 year ago.
Indeed, only 94 days have had hail in the record that spans over
46,000 days. Hail is a ball of ice that forms when rain drops
collect and freeze onto partially melted snow flakes high in a
thunderstorm. Strong updrafts can prolong the time hail remains
aloft, allowing it to grow further as additional rain drops freeze
onto it.

`BOATS IN MOATS'

<P>
   Columbia: The tangled case affects 10 of the state's 16
riverboat casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, only the Argosy Riverside is not
threatened by judicial or Missouri Gaming Commission sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In a worst-case scenario _ defeat in court and at the polls in
November _ the offending casinos would be forced to unplug their
slots. That would slash revenues by as much 70 percent and almost
certainly force the closing of some boats.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Don Poston said the boats' strategy is
simple: ``Let the people decide, and take it out of the courts'
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry won at the polls four years ago when 54 percent of
voters approved slot machines and other games of chance, such as
roulette.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, St. Louis-area gambling foes argued
successfully before the Supreme Court that under the constitutional
language approved by voters in 1994, games of chance could be
played only on boats floating ``upon'' the main channels of the
Missouri and Mississippi rivers _ not moored behind floodgates or
in off-river, man-made ponds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skill'' games, such as craps and blackjack, were not affected.
</P>
<P>
   After months of legal sparring, the Gaming Commission is
expected to set hearings later this month to determine which boats
comply with the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Any adverse decisions are certain to be appealed to the state
courts and ultimately to federal court _ unless voters
short-circuit the legal conflict on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Fridkin, a Kansas City lawyer for Harrah's four Missouri
casinos, said the central issue is unfair treatment. The boats, he
said, rigorously obeyed the Gaming Commission's licensing rules and
spent more than a billion dollars on their casinos. Then the rules
were changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fairness issue...that is a federal question,'' Fridkin
said. ``That's a substantial part of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also at the heart of the appeal the casinos will make to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   But not all casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Missouri Riverboat Gaming Association and the American
Gaming Association are sitting this one out.
</P>
<P>
   Some casinos, such as the Argosy, stand to gain if their
off-river competitors are put at a disadvantage or forced to close.
Such bottom-line considerations have neutralized the state and
national industry groups on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   Only four casino companies, Harrah's, Station Casinos, Players
International and the Flamingo Hilton, are paying the tab for the
Winner/Wagner political consulting group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a states' rights issue,'' said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr.,
president of the national industry group. ``The people of Missouri
are entitled to not have gaming. If that's what they decide, so be
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Poston said the campaign's strategy and slogans were still
taking shape and he wouldn't discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   But a flier being distributed by Station Casinos in Kansas City
offers a glimpse at what voters can expect to see in ads and on
television commercials:
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaming has invested more than $1.3 billion in Missouri's
riverboat properties...Changing the rules now is totally unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help us save your favorite games. Help us save our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   If the riverboats lose in court and at the polls, operators
would be left with almost no choice but to offer only games of
skill, as they did before the 1994 vote. Or they could opt to make
costly physical changes to their buildings and riverfront land to
meet the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The latter would certainly trigger a new round of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The `Ohio plan'
</P>
<P>
   For six years Grey has criss-crossed the country campaigning
against legalized gambling on behalf of his church and as spokesman
for the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, which he
helped found four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He's lost plenty of elections. But his movement has also won its
share. Grey takes credit for the crushing defeat of a riverboat
gambling measure in Ohio two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign spawned a strategy that Grey has since dubbed
``the Ohio plan,'' which he's putting into effect in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Grey was in Columbia on two recent weekends for annual
conferences of the state's United Methodist Church, where he began
organizing grass-roots workers for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in 1994 loose-knit anti-casino volunteers still
attracted more than 46 percent of the vote against a professionally
managed campaign that cost the casinos millions.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with that 46 percent, Grey boldly predicts a 60 percent
victory this year.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is a showdown, Grey said, laden with national
implications about whether Americans are becoming weary of hometown
gambling parlors and are willing to shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   A loss, he said, ``would be a crippling blow to our argument
that there is a backlash out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory, however, would send a message to gambling's nerve
centers in Las Vegas and on Wall Street that an era of casino
expansion is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom's been saying that for years,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``He
needs to get some new material.''

<P>
   COLUMBIA _ Many in Missouri's religious community are itching
for a ballot-box rematch against the casinos. They're going to get
one.
</P>
<P>
   But this time _ in November when Missourians are expected to
vote on retroactively legalizing slot machines on ``boats in
moats'' _ church leaders say the gloves are coming off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bitterly opposed to gambling and will do all we can as
a church to see that this referendum in November is defeated,''
said Ann Brookshire Sherer, resident bishop of the statewide United
Methodist Church, 190,000 members strong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, an underfunded and mostly church-driven coalition came
close to defeating a casino-sponsored ballot measure to legalize
slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   What's different this time is that Missouri's anti-gambling
establishment appears to be organized as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Under a strategy unfolded at meetings on two recent weekends in
a Columbia Holiday Inn, the Methodist church is training hundreds
of its members to serve as the campaign's ``precinct captains.''
</P>
<P>
   They will go home and recruit other church, business and civic
leaders to stage public debates, distribute literature, raise money
and get out the vote on Nov. 3. The first volunteer training
sessions already are set for June 29 and 30 at Methodist churches
in Kansas City and Lee's Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Other religion-based groups are signing on, including early
support from leaders of the multidenominational Missouri Christian
Leadership Forum and the Christian Civic Foundation of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we didn't have last time was a campaign from the bottom
up,'' said Tom Grey, a Hanover, Ill., Methodist clergyman and icon
of the anti-gambling movement. His presence alone invigorates the
Missouri campaign and forces it into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Off-river gambling facilities _ boats in moats _ have been
licensed by state regulators since 1995. But they were outlawed by
the Missouri Supreme Court last fall in a decision that stunned the
gaming industry.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back, the casinos are now close to gathering the
109,000 signatures they need to force a question onto the fall
ballot that would nullify the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gambling industry tries to portray us as narrow-minded
moralists,'' Sherer said. ``But legalized gambling is not a
personal morality issue. It is a community justice issue....
Gambling preys on the poor, the old and the lonely.... It hurts our
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry has well-practiced answers ready for its critics _
symbolized in the name of its 1998 campaign committee:
``Missourians for Fairness &AMP; Jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry also has its own cadre of precinct captains _ more
than 8,000 employees whose jobs are at stake. Earlier this month
casino workers in St. Louis announced formation of a statewide,
pro-gambling citizens' political action committee _ called AFFIRM _
that will work for passage of the moat measure this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos also will tout industry-financed studies that
attempt to debunk critics' claims that they hurt the economy and
foster compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside City Administrator Ann Daniels is one of many public
officials whose jurisdictions are reaping millions in new tax
dollars from the casinos and who side with them.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago last month to testify before a congressional panel
studying gambling, she said, ``I would share our problems with you
now, but there have been no problems'' since the Argosy casino
opened for business four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared (for) prostitution, robberies, domestic
violence, bankruptcy and on and on,'' Daniels testified. ``No
increases in any of these problem areas have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Academic studies and news organization investigations, including
one last year by The Kansas City Star, have found pockets of
increased crime and other social problems _ but not uniformly in
every casino city, and certainly not to the dire straits that some
critics claim.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements such as Daniels' will be crafted into ads by the
same national political consulting group _ Winner/Wagner &AMP;
Mandabach Campaigns _ the industry used in 1994 to persuade
Missouri voters to legalize slots.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is survival for the casinos,'' Grey said. ``It's
winner-take-all in Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Slots at stake
</P>
<P>
   The gambling industry has suffered a setback in the ongoing
court battle over boats in moats. The tangled case affects 10 of
the state's 16 riverboat casinos.

KANSAS WHEAT HARVEST WILL BE BIG, BUT IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DEAL
WITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is expected to be the 10th-largest wheat harvest in Kansas
history is roaring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agricultural statisticians reported Monday
that, despite rain delays over many fields, about 2 percent of an
estimated 394 million-bushel crop has been harvested, mostly in the
far southeastern and south-central part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   That 2 percent represents more than twice the progress farmers
made through mid-June last year, but it trails a longer-term 3
percent average.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest may be an awkward one for farmers and Kansas to deal
with, some observers predict.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a promising start, reduced plantings and earlier weather
losses are going to leave many Kansas farmers with much less wheat
to sell than they became used to the nine times the harvest topped
400 million bushels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bad news, because prices are low, and it means they
can't simply sell a little extra wheat'' to improve their cash
flows, said Mark Nelson, a Kansas Farm Bureau economist in
Manhattan. ``Plus, we've got transportation and storage problems,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Grain-hauling rail cars and elevator storage space are expected
to be scarcer than normal this season. If those expectations are
accurate, extra costs could push grain prices below even the
extremely low levels that federal economists recently projected.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Kansas, farmer or otherwise, would be immune from a
disappointing harvest, said Jim Ragan, a Kansas State University
economics professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheat prices are an important indicator of how much the entire
state's economy will grow,'' Ragan said.
</P>
<P>
   And while wheat prices aren't yet low enough to tip the state's
economy downward, they have been a drag on potential statewide
economic expansion for several months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Look for that to continue, at least until Asia's economies
improve, which isn't expected any time soon, said Karen Fegley, a
trade specialist with the National Association of Wheat Growers in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an optimistic picture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asian countries buy about 40 percent of the farm goods U.S.
producers export, Fegley said. Turmoil in Asian economies has
chilled that buying a lot and helped push U.S. wheat prices to
their lowest level in seven years, Fegley said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Department of Agriculture economists estimate that Kansas
farmers will receive no more than $3 a bushel for their wheat
during the coming marketing year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, there is Pakistan,'' Fegley said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is the third-largest international buyer, after Egypt
and Japan, for the wheat raised by American farmers. But wheat
sales to Pakistan this year may be shut off because of trade
sanctions being imposed after last month's nuclear tests in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is proposing legislation that would allow the sales.
But Pakistan's own crop is larger than usual, and the country is
expected to buy less wheat from all its suppliers, Fegley said.
</P>
<P>
   At midday Monday back in Kansas, combines and trucks and the
crews that run them were busily harvesting fields scattered across
a broad wedge of southern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The northern edge of the most active harvesting runs across the
state from near Liberal (400 miles southwest of Kansas City near
the Oklahoma border) to Hutchinson (about 200 miles nearer to
Kansas City) to Chanute (about 100 miles south of Lawrence), say
crop watchers at the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Hit-or-miss thundershowers across the state and pockets of grain
still not ripe enough to harvest lend a spatter-painted texture to
progress in many areas, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But give us another good day and we'll be more than 50 percent
done around here,'' said Martin Hampel, a state wheat harvest
coordinator in Kingman, near the center of the harvest surge.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the first fields to be harvested have yielded beautiful
wheat by industry standards.
</P>
<P>
   Yields per acre reportedly have ranged from near the 39-bushel
average projected for Kansas to almost twice that much. Test
weights, which measure how much potentially usable wheat is in each
bushel, have been running at or above a federally specified
60-pound standard. Protein and moisture levels, which are two other
important indicators of quality, also are described as being close
to ideal in many places.
</P>
<P>
   But this harvest perfection seems unlikely to last much longer,
crop watchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers haven't yet done much cutting in fields farther north
and west where frost devastated a federally estimated 100,000 acres
of wheat over the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And Kansas Agricultural Statistics, the agency that issued the
harvest progress estimate Monday, also reported that 2 percent less
of the wheat still standing was in the same good-to-excellent
pre-harvest growing condition as a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, about 65 percent of the state's wheat crop still is
rated in good or excellent condition, the statisticians estimated.

SAME OLD WAYLON, FRESH NEW CUTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies WAYLON JENNINGS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waylon Jennings sets out to unite country, rock and blues, as
well as reclaim his territory as an innovator, on his first new
album in two years, ``Closing in on the Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Give him the first objective hands down: Few artists can cross
those three genres so easily. As for innovation, Is he really a
groundbreaker, or does it just sound that way next to the
pop-country stuff on the radio?
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: He's perhaps one of the few country artists
who would think to collaborate with Sheryl Crow, Travis Tritt,
Marty Stuart, Sting and Mark Knopfler, all on one album.
</P>
<P>
   The title cut, by steamy bluesman Tony Joe White, has sinewy
electric guitar work that draws listeners in on a harmonica's
breath. Jennings' vocals sound like a shadow of himself, a nasty
blues whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings and Travis Tritt trade tempos and vocals on the
Kostas-Kelly Willis-penned ``I Know About Me, Don't Know About
You,'' a roadhouse duet.
</P>
<P>
   Willis isn't the only Texas singer-songwriter represented on the
album. Kimmie Rhodes' sweet ``Be Mine,'' garnished with Mark
Knopfler's guitar solo, is a simple delight.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' own incisive work is represented on five of the 12
cuts, including the companionable ``Best Friends of Mine,'' written
about his buds ranging from Hank Williams Jr. to Buddy Holly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most tender songs Jennings has ever done is the waltz
``Just Watch Your Mama and Me,'' which he said took all of an hour
to write, so deeply personal is the message.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jennings originals include the autobiographical ``Back
Home Where I Come From''; a lighthearted ``Easy Money'' and ``The
Blues Don't Care,'' written by Jennings and Gary Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing in on the Fire'' has its flaws, though. Most glaring
is the Sting cut, ``She's Too Good for Me.'' If only Sting would
stay away from country music. (Remember the Toby Keith-Sting
collaboration?) Perhaps Sheryl Crow should, too, if the best she
can do is the '60s pop chorus on that clunker.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for the Mick Jagger-Keith Richards-penned cut
``No Expectations,'' a 1968 song with a true honky-tonk feel and no
awkward guest stars. Marty Stuart contributes guitar.
</P>
<P>
   The rockabilly veteran Carl Smith is anything but awkward when
he vocalizes with Jennings on Kevin Welch's ``Untitled Waltz,''
with the fun line ``We all got where we are as fast as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio liner notes are offered on track 12, and it's just as
interesting to hear a purring Jennings tell stories about the album
and its cuts, as it is to hear them performed:
</P>
<P>
   ``My life hasn't been without humor,'' he drawls, amid
background laughter, ``and I've tried to be sexy the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, ``Closing in on the Fire'' is a true Jennings
sampler, and should allay any fears about the state of his health

TAKING ON MITSUBISHI TOOK COURAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know a lot of lawyers. I'm married to one. So I'm not naive
about lawsuits. They're usually tedious, time-consuming and
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes they're necessary. A case in point is the suit the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought against Mitsubishi
Motors in April 1996 and won last week.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, women and men are harassed at work. Most suffer in
silence because they don't know their rights or because they fear
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   It takes courage to file a harassment complaint with the EEOC.
It takes strength to withstand the depositions, the denials and in
many cases the retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what was more difficult for the women working at the
Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Ill. _ to tolerate the repeated
harassment or to withstand the criticism and death threats they
received after the federal agency sued Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Mitsubishi management initially denied the
allegations and even tried to convince workers and the community
that the women were a threat to their high-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Employees responded by defending the company. You know they
said, ``Boys will be boys.'' They ignored the fact that male
workers and supervisors kissed and fondled the women, called them
``whores'' and worse, demanded sexual acts, and retaliated against
women who refused.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi even persuaded thousands of workers to attend a
company-sponsored picnic with free buses and free lunches to
protest at the Chicago EEOC office.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mitsubishi isn't denying anything anymore. Last week the
company agreed to pay a record $34 million to settle the claims of
repeated harassment. It is by far the largest sexual harassment
settlement for the EEOC and covers women who have worked at the
plant since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree, which is subject to federal court approval,
also requires the company to provide mandatory sexual harassment
training to employees and investigate allegations of harassment
within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   EEOC Chairman Paul M. Igasaki warned other companies that ``the
Mitsubishi situation is not unique, and no employer should assume
that it can't happen in my company.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's settlement is not only a victory for the women at
Mitsubishi but for all of us. Sexual harassment isn't just illegal,
it's intolerable. No one should have to experience such horrendous
working conditions to support their families.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it usually takes courageous women such as those
at Mitsubishi to file lawsuits and multimillion-dollar settlements
to persuade businesses to change.

DAY'S END IS NO TIME TO BE ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wind fell and the pond, stirred to a chop in afternoon, lay
perfectly still as the long evening came on.
</P>
<P>
   Red-winged blackbirds whistled from the reeds. A handsome little
snake, green as emerald, etched his sinuous way across the surface
just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a better way to spend a quiet hour or two than in a
boat, on a piece of water you know as well as you know that face in
the mirror. But if there is, it doesn't come readily to mind.
</P>
<P>
   A cool front had dipped down from the northern plains, bringing
with it a badly needed rain. Even as I'd pushed the little johnboat
out from the bank and through the cattails there had come a last
pelting of big drops.
</P>
<P>
   Then that shower blew on past as well, and the sky began showing
broken patches of blue. Except for birdsong and the creaking of the
oarlocks, the silence was absolute.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old pond, that one _ built most of 30 years ago, where
the corner of a field dips down toward the next man's land. Because
it lies in the open, unshaded by bordering trees, it comes awake
earlier in the season than other waters on the place.
</P>
<P>
   Deep and clear, fed by runoff from untilled grassland, it has
been wonderfully productive. I have fished it with my daughters
through all their ages, and with a good many friends.
</P>
<P>
   Even when I'm by myself those memories are with me in the boat.
</P>
<P>
   I had come to the country on other business. Somehow the day had
gotten away, and I'd considered not going to the pond at all. But
then I remembered what a man once said about hunting: that a day
when you might have followed the dog, but didn't, was a day you'd
never see again.
</P>
<P>
   So there I was, rod in hand, dropping the bass bug close against
the reeds. There'd be time for two, maybe three circuits of the
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious, how little the excitement of it changes through
the years. The skipped heartbeat when the fish's weight is first
felt and line is stripped from the reel in that initial bullish
run. The thrill's no different today than it was in boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed is that the catching matters less, especially
since nearly all those brought to boat are freed to grow and give
battle another day. It's enough to be attached for a while _ to
feel that wildness at the tippet's end.
</P>
<P>
   This one was a female largemouth, heavy-bodied, a wonder of a
fish. I grasped her lower lip and slipped the hook free without
lifting her from the water. Released, she sank away and vanished
with a flash.
</P>
<P>
   One like that is enough. I put down the rod and took up my
coffee, gone cold in the cup.
</P>
<P>
   The late sun had dropped below what remained of clouds, and
threw long shadows of the cattails dark across the glassy pond. The
color of the water changed with the sky, deepening finally to
purple.
</P>
<P>
   A bullfrog boomed from the near shore. From across the way a
rival answered.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fine hour, just before the light goes out, but also a
melancholy one. You think of everything and everyone, happy things
and sad _ of times gone, and people gone, and mistakes made, and
chances of one kind or other let slip away.
</P>
<P>
   And it's always then, with darkness closing, that one would be
most grateful for a little company. But there wasn't any. So, not
lingering longer, I rowed ashore, pulled the boat up and hurried to
the car.
</P>
<P>
   One ought to fish in the early mornings, when the first light is
just coming and the whole day lies bright ahead, I was thinking
then.
</P>
<P>
   Or else not fish alone.
</P>

 &HT;    COLUMN: Kolsches prove perfect for sipping in the summertime
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 18: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In France, law requires a winemaker's pledge of honesty. The
appellation controlee not only assures the buyer that the grapes
are from the region claimed, but also prohibits outsiders from
claiming to produce the same wine.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the ancient German city of Cologne does a similar
practice exist in brewing. In a country that enjoys dozens of
regional beer styles, each different from the next, the only place
you'll find a Kolschbier is Koln (Cologne in German) and
surrounding towns.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the darker Altbiers of nearby Dusseldorf and the
spritzy white beers of Berlin, Kolsch is the least familiar of
German styles in the United States. For one thing, it's an ale,
top-fermented, and not a bottom-fermenting lager like most German
beer. But it's a different kind of ale (an English word Germans
never use), light as a sister's kiss, pale as summer corn, served
in a cylindrical 7-ounce glass with no ornamentation.
</P>
<P>
   In Cologne, you don't drink a Kolschbier from a mug, a stein or
a conical pilsner glass; you drink from what looks like a tall
juice glass. The size and simplicity of the glass, like the color
of the beer, suggest lightness. ``I have on more than one occasion
seen a waiter help himself to a glass in one swallow,'' Michael
Jackson writes in his ``Beer Companion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolsch is drunk year-round in Cologne, even during the
Rhineland's cold, wet winters, when other palates (mine, at least)
might hope for something more robust.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is a different matter, and now Atlantans have the
opportunity to sample a German style that's light but not Lite.
Thunder Head, an enterprising upstart among the area's beer
distributors, has brought H.C. Berger's Mountain Kolsch to retail
shelves, and a Kolsch also went on tap last week at Phoenix Brewing
Company in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   H.C. Berger, based in Fort Collins, Colo., is one of the few
American craft brewers that offer a Kolsch _ and the proprietary
name isn't the only reason. This is a style whose delicacy is hard
to bring off. Some, in deference to the Cologne Association of
Brewers, call theirs Kalsch rather than Kolsch; others,
Kolsch-style.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's Mountain Kolsch is a reasonable approximation of the
real thing, its gentle malt flavor up front and its finish so soft
and dry it vanishes from the tongue. This isn't a beer to set
alongside a plate of nachos, although Jackson notes that Cologners
accompany it with a snack of smoked sausage (called mettwurst) or
the local blood sausage called Cologne caviar.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the caviar, it's an easy, light-bodied beer to
sip on a summer evening. I might have liked a touch more hop aroma
and flavor, but a Kolsch isn't a hoppy beer to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's interpretation of the style is more complex than
Berger's, a beer you might well have been served in Cologne. On
Monday night, at a Brewmaster's Dinner, Phoenix is serving it as an
aperitif with soft-shell crab on Asian vegetable slaw. Not for
caviar alone is Kolsch made, even in Cologne. A true pilsner would
be too assertive with a dish so light (Phoenix's superb pilsner
will be served later, with smoked black angus beef carpaccio), and
a Munich-style lager too rounded and malty (the Seven Sisters
Munchener will accompany a grilled veal chop and mushroom gratin).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the accompaniment _ or with none at all _ a Kolsch is a
summer beer that was never designed as one. In fact, between the
two world wars, Cologne's brewers refined the top-fermented beer
they'd been brewing to compete with the bottom-fermented golden
pilsners that were becoming more popular in Germany. They liked
what they had, and weren't about to embrace bottom fermentation.
</P>
<P>
   They liked it so much they got the government to decree it
theirs and no one else's. You know people take their beer seriously
when they get the government involved. Many Atlantans _ tasting
either of these locally available Kolsches without fear of a legal
imbroglio _ will understand why.

 &HT;    DON'T MISS: Hometown remembers Helen Keller
 &HT;    By Alan Patureau
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Country star Ronnie Milsap will headline the entertainment at
the 20th annual Helen Keller Festival, June 25-28 in the quaint
Tennessee River town of Tuscumbia, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Milsap, who was invited because his career has soared despite
his blindness, will give a free concert at 8 p.m. June 27 in Spring
Park, site of the festival's arts and crafts fair and other musical
events.
</P>
<P>
   The nostalgic center of the celebration will be Ivy Green, the
plantation cottage where Keller was born June 27, 1880. ``The
Miracle Worker,'' William Gibson's drama about the blind legend's
life, will be performed on the grounds at 8:15 p.m. every Friday
and Saturday through July 25. (Tickets are $8.) Included is the
actual water pump where young Helen learned her first word:
``water.''
</P>
<P>
   Hourly tours of Ivy Green, at 300 West North Commons in
Tuscumbia, feature Keller's grandparents' original furniture, her
Braille books and typewriter, and the ``whistle path'' that leads
to a well-preserved outdoor kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $3 for adults, $1 for children, from 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. Monday through Saturday and 1 to 4 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Another festival highlight, on the Colbert County Courthouse
lawn, is nightly music and dance by regional groups such as T.
Graham Brown, the Midnighters and the Kerry Gilbert Band. A
one-hour parade down Main Street began at 10 a.m. June 26. A
26-mile bicycle race and seven-mile family bicycle ride starts at 6
p.m. June 26. An antique car show will be staged on downtown
streets June 27, and the Full Moon Ensemble folk band will close
the festival with a free concert at 3 p.m. June 28.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Miracle Worker'' tickets or festival information, call
256-383-4066.
</P>
<P>
   -- Just for kids: With Keller's perseverance in mind, the
festival will offer schoolchildren a free ``Keller Kids'' program
June 25 at the Tuscumbia Multi-Purpose Center, teaching them
Braille, sign language and games that stress overcoming sensory
handicaps. A ``Keller Art for Kids'' course will be June 26 at the
Tennessee Valley Art Center (cost is $30 per child; call
256-383-0533). Children will learn watercolor painting and will
sketch the famous water pump.
</P>
<P>
   -- Famous musicmakers: Tuscumbia is also the home of the Alabama
Music Hall of Fame, on U.S. 72, featuring artifacts of W.C. Handy,
Hank Williams Sr., Nat King Cole, Lionel Richie and other
Alabamians. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, 1-5 p.m.
Sundays. Adults $6, children $3.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: It's a 280-mile drive from Atlanta, via I-20
west to Birmingham, I-65 north to Cullman and Ala. 157 to
Tuscumbia.

   Ellen Bryan _ Mrs. Wright Bryan _ died at the age of 93 years.
When I got the word from Jim Bryant, Mercer University(Ga.)'s
historian, I sat long moments thinking about Ellen, and feeling an
odd sense of loss for a woman I really didn't know well. It's funny
the things that stick in your mind about a person you don't know
well, but cherish like you cherish unexpected laughter and a crazy,
odd meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bryan's husband was editor of The Atlanta Journal, a
newspaper we on The Atlanta Constitution considered our unlikely,
unloved competition. But we did like the Bryans and rejoice in
Ellen's humor and goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   I had not met her when she first spoke to me on a parade route
celebrating Gen. Lucius Clay's homecoming from Europe at the end of
World War II. His hometown, Marietta, Ga., had staged a wingding of
a celebration, and I borrowed a country expression in describing
it. They had, I wrote, ``put on the big pot and the little pot,
too.'' Our young city editor regarded it as an obscure and
meaningless expression, but let it go. Ellen Bryan walked up to me
on the parade route and said, ``I know exactly what you meant by
that old expression and it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   I was relieved and grateful that this long-time and stylish
Atlantan knew what I was talking about, and thereafter delighted
when I saw her. She always accompanied her husband to the Georgia
Press Association meetings in Athens, and she was a charmer at the
after-banquet gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bryant, author of a history of the Druid Hills golf club,
wrote that he was greatly helped by Mrs. Bryan, whose father,
Alfred C. Newell, joined the club in 1914. Her father played golf
there with Ernest Woodruff, father of the famous Robert Woodruff,
and Ellen rode her horse on the golf course. Her family dwelled in
a Neil Reid house on Clifton road, the home of Col. and Mrs. Z. D.
Harrison ``whose pond she sometimes fished and swam in in her
birthday suit with her sister,'' Jim wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He added a wonderful Ellen Bryan note: ``One day a dignified
butler knocked on the Newells' door carrying a small silver tray
with a note on it, which read: 'Dear Mrs. Newell, Would you please
keep your children out of my pond? It is our drinking water. Thank
you. Mrs. Z.D. Harrison.'
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bryant wrote of Ellen's social activities, which were more
important in the 1920s than they are today _ debut, founder of the
Girls Cotillion Club, vice president of the Junior League and an
elegant wedding at which Enrico Leide, conductor of the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra, led a stringed orchestra in nuptial music.
</P>
<P>
   I was interested to learn that her great-grandfather was Georgia
Gov. Alfred Hope Colquitt and that she and her husband took the
first all-day flight to New York on their honeymoon when air
service was inaugurated Atlanta-to-New York.
</P>
<P>
   I am sorry I wasn't here to say goodbye to Ellen Bryan, blithe
spirit. Jim said it for many of us when he wrote that her ``genteel
manner and quick wit, sparkling eyes and charming stories''
embellished his history of Druid Hills and ``will remain part of my
own experience for the rest of my days.'' He added: ``Many of us
feel richer and are thankful for having known Ellen Newell Bryan.

   You know that place in your kitchen where loose recipes, old

 &HT;    Internet birth a reality even though most couldn't see it
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first delivery shown over the Internet produced a baby boy,
but thousands who turned in couldn't see the birth.
</P>
<P>
   For those who got through, the images were abrupt _ they tended
to freeze _ and blurry at best. Still, thousands tried to see the
birth of 7-pound, 8-ounce Sean, the fourth child of Elizabeth, a
40-year-old woman who didn't want her last name used. Cameras were
discreetly trained on Elizabeth's side and in front of her hospital
bed, but nurses backs blocked any view of the actual delivery.
</P>
<P>
   America's Health Network, which put the delivery on its Internet
site, said there were more than 10 million hits at the Web site
throughout the day. At any one minute, 5,000 viewers were able to
log onto the site.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth and the network said they wanted to help educate
mothers-to-be and quell their fears. But those who logged on may
not have gotten much of an educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit here and say this is the proper method to educate
the public,'' said Peggy Hotz, the department director for
perinatal services at Crawford Long of Hospital of Emory Hospital.
``The problem with the Web is that no one is there to give support
or answer questions that may rise from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did not rise at the crack of dawn to follow
Elizabeth from her 6 a.m. check-in to her delivery at 10:40 a.m.,
was Christopher Rywalt, a New Jersey resident who tried to showhis
wife's delivery live through the internet last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rywalt, who wrote about the conception and development of their
first baby on a Web site called ``It's Just Another Baby''
(http://www.westnet.com/ (tilde)crywalt/pregnancy.contents.htm),
admitted that he did not find Tuesday morning's live birth ``too
thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could just be bitter,'' joked Rywalt.
</P>
<P>
   He had arranged to show his wife's delivery over the Web, but
the hospital pulled the plug at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural outcome of the Web site. It was in
conjunction with the book and so those who were following it could
join in,'' said Rywalt. ``We wanted to do it because it was a fun
thing to do. The tradition on the Internet is that people say,
`This is fun, let's do it because we can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Werbach, managing editor of ``Release 1.0,'' a monthly
newsletter that discusses trends in the computer industry, said
that the amazing factor of the Internet is that it allows
information and events such as a live birth to be broadcast, an
event that the original creators of the Internet most likely never
imagined or expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is the Internet allows everybody to be a
publisher. It lets people who would not have access to the media to
get the word out,'' said Werbach. ``It makes it possible to
distribute information, although information on childbirth may be
stretching it.''

 &HT;    N.Y. Times dons leisure Web suit
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The online battle for the leisure time of New Yorkers heated up
a notch Tuesday when The New York Times launched New York Today
(http://www.nytoday.com), a guide to arts, entertainment and
leisure activities in the Big Apple. Martin Nisenholtz, president
of the New York Times Electronic Media Co., said in a statement
that the Web site will include a searchable database of information
along with editorial content and full Yellow Pages for New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Although NYToday enters the city guide arena with The New York
Times name behind it and a laundry list of 300 advertisers, it
still faces an uphill battle for users in the very crowded New York
City guide arena. Microsoft Sidewalk, America Online's Digital
City, Yahoo! and Citysearch already are competing for the attention
of time-crunched New York Web surfers. There are also restaurant
and travel guides devoted to New York. But the Times is confident
there's room for everybody. ``In the future,'' Nisenholtz said,
``we expect thousands of groups from all over the city to take
advantage of this free and unique offering.''

 &HT;    CNN stands behind story as military advisor resigns
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A military adviser to CNN has resigned in protest over a recent
report that U.S. armed forces used deadly nerve gas on U.S.
defectors in Laos in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   CNN is standing by its story.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Perry Smith quit his position as
military adviser, stating that he had tried and failed to get CNN
to issue a retraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had tried very hard for a week to convince (executives) to
do a major retraction, but to no avail,'' Smith told WorldNetDaily,
a politically conservative website that has previously been
critical of the CNN story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly stand by the accuracy of the reporting, which was
done over eight months and included talking to more than 200 people
up and down the chain of command,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
said Tuesday. Tom Johnson, CEO of CNN Newsgroup, and Richard
Kaplan, president of CNN/U.S., were both traveling Tuesday and
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN report, which originally aired June 7 on the debut of
``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' has caused a firestorm of controversy.
Correspondent Peter Arnett reported that a secret U.S. military
operation, ``Operation Tailwind,'' used sarin nerve gas to kill
American defectors during the Vietnam War. Among those interviewed
who appeared to support the charge (although stating they did not
have direct knowledge) were former Secretary of Defense Melvin
Laird and former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral Thomas
Moorer. Maj. Gen. Smith was on retainer to CNN, and occiasonally
appeared on air as a military expert. He received most of his air
time during the Persian Gulf War, when he was a regular presence.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the CNN report have also cited the version that
appeared in Time magazine, written by Arnett and CNN producer April
Oliver. Time turned the main headline into a question: ``Did the
U.S. Drop Nerve Gas?'' But the Time story was as emphatic in its
assertion as the CNN report.

 &HT;    Once a cult series, X-Files now a major motion picture
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On and on came the beast, relentlessly. Mulder and Scully were
exhausted, but knew they could not give up.
</P>
<P>
   In one hotel suite, Mulder, in his civilian guise as actor David
Duchovny, was sprawled on a couch, barely able to get up. He'd
kicked off his shoes, stripped to a white T-shirt over khakis,
describing himself as ``pretty whipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the hall in an identical room, Scully, aka Gillian
Anderson, sagged wearily into a high-backed chair, her eyes heavy
as she sipped hot tea. ``Beaten to a pulp,'' she called herself.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of Duchovny/Mulder and Anderson/Scully have been
dominated by the hydra-headed media beast (including Entertainment
Weekly, Newsweek and TV Guide) in the days leading up to the Friday
premiere of their movie ``The X-Files: Fight the Future.'' Trapped
in a luxury hotel, they have endured the endless probes of
journalists who come to their rooms seeking the truth, or at least
a juicy tidbit.
</P>
<P>
   For five seasons, FBI agents Mulder and Scully have been
professional soulmates on television's ``The X-Files,'' forever on
the trail of aliens, vampires, shape-shifters, evil goverment
agents and the occasional demonic substitute teacher.
</P>
<P>
   They've evolved from polar opposites (he spooky and obsessed,
she rational and skeptical) to partners in sync in all but the
sexual sense, Fred and Ginger in trenchcoats, searching for truth
rather than facing the music, with cell phones and flashlights to
pierce the all-encompassing darkness of conspiracies and cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same five years, the Fox series has mutated from
cult-object to Top 10 Nielsen favorite, Internet obsession, and now
the movie, an attempt to appeal to both the 15 million-or-so
hard-core fans, as well as those who've never tuned in to the
show's eerie wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   The actors behind the roles are nowhere near as close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We show up and do the work, and in the process we might have
some laughs, but our relationship is basically within the realm of
the show and doesn't extend beyond that,'' says Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're not as close as Mulder and Scully,'' agrees
Duchovny. ``But we've got a good working relationship. The fact
that we're still doing the show speaks for itself. You don't have
other examples of a two-person show that comes back for five
seasons. The two-person hows explode 'cause it's tough to get
thrown together in an arranged marriage like that.''
</P>
<P>
   (Indeed, the two-character drama series is a volatile form,
littered with four-year marriages like ``Moonlighting'' and ``Lois
&AMP; Clark.'' ``Cagney &AMP; Lacey'' is the notable exception for
longevity.)
</P>
<P>
   There is, Anderson says, more intimacy between Mulder and Scully
than between her and Duchovny, which is ironic, given that the
level of intimacy between the two FBI agents has always been an
issue for the show's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter used to say that there would
never be any romance between the agents, that simply having two
attractive, intelligent people working in close quarters created
its own chemistry. Some fans buy that, while others passionately
wish the two would get together, filling the Internet with romantic
``fan fiction'' scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The movie makes an effort to please both groups. In a scene that
has been widely shown in trailers and ads, they come very close to
a kiss, and there is a level of emotional closeness in the film
unknown in the TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I was most struck by is that the movie is a
love story,'' says Anderson. ``There's a heightened level of
intimacy and respect and care that you don't get in the show. I'm
curious as to how the relationship is going to shift in the
series.'' (The series returns in the fall for its sixth season.)
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny admits that early on, he was one of those pushing
Carter to get the agents romantically involved. ``I used to say,
'Let's get 'em together, 'cause selfishly as an actor then I get to
play the boyfriend, or love, or jealousy, or the things they play
on ``NYPD Blue.'' ' As an actor you say, 'Hey! I want an Emmy!'
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you grow up, and realize you're servicing a piece,
and what may be more fun for or better for you as an actor may not
be better for the show.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actors' stories diverge at a key point in the
interrogations. Anderson will own up to be occasionally tiring of
playing Scully for the past five years, while Duchovny gets
downright riled over devoting his prime years to Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulder's a very needy guy,'' he says. ``It's all that I do, is
be Mulder. And when I'm not doing that, I'm talking about Mulder or
preparing to be Mulder. It's really human to be tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He catches himself, knowing how he sounds; that without the role
of Mulder, he might still be little more than the narrator of
Showtime's soft-porn series ``Red Shoe Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you allow yourself to talk like that, people see it as
being ungrateful to the show, or not liking the people you're
working with, when in fact it's a reaction against something that's
consuming all your time.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, he's never tried to get ouf of his contract, which
runs for two more TV seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the show,'' he says. ``To try to destroy it that
way, even if it would be helpful to me, is not the right thing to
do in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bored with Scully,'' Anderson counters. ``I am, at
times, frustrated with not having the freedom to do other projects.
But I've never regretted being a part of it. I'm constantly
grateful for the gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Both actors, and Carter, creator of the characters that rule
their lives, see the series extending for two more seasons, then
possibly morphing into a series of movies, a la ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   That will depend largely on how successful this first movie is,
which may depend largely on what fans think of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine the die-hard fans are gonna be upset about
something,'' says Duchovny, aware how picky and contentious the
sensibilities can be of those who love the show the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they're die-hard fans. That's why we love 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   And the beast, sated, retreated.
</P>
<P>
   The Duchovny File
</P>
<P>
   David William Duchovny
</P>
<P>
   Plays: Fox Mulder, an FBI agent obsessed by the alien abduction
of his sister, forever seeking the truth about the paranormal.
Nicknamed ``Spooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Age: 37
</P>
<P>
   Youth: Very bright. Attended Princeton University on academic
scholarship (he played junior varsity basketball and was nicknamed
``Scruff'' for his appearance). Senior thesis: ``The Schizophrenic
Critique of Pure Reason in (Samuel) Beckett's Early Novels.''
Master's degree in English lit from Yale. Dropped out of the Yale
PhD. program when he got a Lowenbrau beer commercial and decided to

</P>
<P>
   Family: Married one year to actress Tea Leoni (``Deep Impact'').
No children so far, but ``I think that'll happen sometime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad movie history: ``Playing God.'' ``I had six weeks to do a
film,'' he says. ``Because I'm a big TV star, people wanted to make
it my breakout attempt. So much for perception.''
</P>
<P>

a transvestite FBI agent on ``Twin Peaks'' and the bad guy in the
doggie movie ``Beethoven.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Spare time: Writes poetry, plays basketball, recently started
golf lessons.
</P>
<P>
   On Mulder: ``He appears to be a rational person, but he's
completely insane. Isn't the definition of insanity doing the same
thing over and over and expecting different results? By that
definition, he's insane.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mimi Goese lives in one of those old New York City
apartments whose rooms are so tiny that they feel like a complex of
cages. Yet Ms. Goese, a 38-year-old performing artist, has
transformed this standard walk-up into enchanted chambers.
</P>
<P>
   A vast window she cut into the wall between the kitchen and the
living room opens up an unexpected vista. A manual typewriter hangs
by invisible cords in the air above her desk. Clear threads also
cover the living room ceiling, blanketing white stucco with sheets
of parchment-colored paper filled with seemingly random sentences _
samples of the speed-writing that sometimes inspires the lyrics to
her pop songs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she gazes at her ceiling for musical inspiration, Ms.
Goese laughed. ``There's a big hole,'' she said. ``I was basically
covering up.''
</P>
<P>
   Renewing the worn-out stuff of urban life is a requirement for
artists like Ms. Goese (pronounced GAY-zee), who survive and thrive
on the borders of New York City's art worlds. While stars dodge
paparazzi and high-culture careerists hobnob uptown, a quiet
assemblage of experimentalists and virtuosos brightens the city's
corners, their innovations filtering out to feed the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Famous to a few, these inconspicuous originals fortify New
York's artistic communities, which open onto one another like the
rooms linked by Ms. Goese's makeshift kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Goese belongs to this shadow pantheon. She has
choreographed or danced in dozens of programs, starred in
independent films, composed all varieties of experimental music and
appeared at spaces ranging from the Kitchen to the Central Park
Bandshell. As the singer for Hugo Largo, she helped define
1980's-style art rock. In 1995, she was the co-writer of two songs
that she sang on ``Everything Is Wrong,'' the eclectic album by the
groundbreaking New York techno artist Moby. Now, with a new album,
``Soak,'' on Luaka Bop, the record label run by the veteran musical
genre-hopper David Byrne, she is aiming to reach her largest
audience yet.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the release of ``Soak,'' Ms. Goese is performing
every Wednesday this month at Fez, in the East Village, with her
band, Mimi, and a list of guest stars that connects the dots of her
musical history. Collaborators include Lloop, a founding member of
two electronic art-and-music collectives, We and Multipolyomni;
Elliot Sharp, a multi-instrumentalist; Ben Neill, the inventor of
the ``mutantrumpet'', and Mark Mulcahy and Syd Straw,
singer-songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I should have this tree with all these branches,''
Ms. Goese said, discussing her network of musical allies. ``Or
something more like a hexagon, like the chemical symbol for
helium.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goese, born in Milwaukee, came to New York in 1982 and dived
into the fertile mayhem of the performance-art scene. She
collaborated with old friends, like the choreographer and filmmaker
Jo Andres, and new ones, like Tom Murran, the Alien Comic. She
joined a Butoh troupe, studying the stark, morbid style of Japanese
dance, and learned to keep her eyes open for 40 minutes at a time.
For other shows, she would convincingly camouflage herself as a
burly man or a young boy. Sometimes she worked with two fellow
graduates of Ohio University, Anne Iobst and Lucy Sexton, known as
Dancenoise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Tim Sommer, who was then Ms. Sexton's boyfriend, formed
a band and recruited both women to sing. The band was Hugo Largo;
Ms. Goese was the vocalist who lasted. Her voice, which vividly
blends warmth with melodrama, suited the daring, arty atmosphere of
post-punk New York and proved a revelation to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something about Mimi that blew my mind,'' said Ms.
Andres, who recently directed Ms. Goese's first music video for
``Soak.'' ``I knew her for years; then she joined this band. All of
a sudden we all realized she could sing. No one knew! I think she
figured she didn't need to use singing in her performance before
then.''
</P>
<P>
   With spookily desolate songs, a deliberately strange
instrumental lineup _ two basses and a violinist, no guitar or
drums _ and Ms. Goese's visceral presence at its center, Hugo Largo
immediately became a talked-about band, loved by some and despised
by others, who found its antics unbearably pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the fear, the heightened awareness of performance,''
she said. ``I would drag a butcher knife across my face. I had
little lines on my neck for every show. One time, I threw the knife
out into the audience.'' She shook her head at the memory. ``What
was I thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goese explored pop music's terrain without being attached to
its myths. But Sommer wanted Hugo Largo to become a successful rock
band. Tensions mounted after the group recorded a critically
acclaimed EP, ``Drum,'' produced by Michael Stipe of R.E.M. for
Brian Eno's label, Opal. A full-length album, ``Mettle,'' and a
European tour followed. Success only heightened the differences
within the band. ``It did spontaneously combust,'' Ms. Goese said.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer went to work for Atlantic Records, where he realized his
goal of getting rich before age 30 by signing Hootie and the
Blowfish. Ms. Goese entered a fallow period. Cuts to arts financing
had severely damaged the dance and performance communities; what
arts jobs she got were brief and usually took her to Europe. At
home, she baby-sat and cleaned out people's closets for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Realizations And Reflections
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hugo Largo there was always this attitude of we're not
going to sell out,'' Ms. Goese said. ``I was the one behind that; I
was the  &UR; artiste &LR; . But then I realized _ and this was eye-opening _
that even though nobody wants you to sell out, nobody's handing out
medals when you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after sharing these reflections, Ms. Goese ascended
the rickety staircase of a converted warehouse near the Gowanus
Canal in Brooklyn. She found Hahn Rowe, the former violinist in
Hugo Largo, in his darkened closet of a practice space, busily
charting electronic samples on his Powerbook. Over a lunch break,
he shared his thoughts on the making of ``Soak.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, whose quick smile enlivens his shy demeanor, has been Ms.
Goese's main musical collaborator since Hugo Largo's demise. A
guitarist and D.J. as well as a violinist, he represents the bridge
between Ms. Goese's old musical style and her current incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   The drifting compositions of the electronic music world
preoccupy Rowe, but frustrate him too. ``It's very easy to come up
with something that sounds cutting edge, but is really very
shallow, just a diagram of originality,'' he said. ``It's funny,
because three years ago, if I'd heard anybody say, `It's all about
the songs, man,' it would make me reach for my revolver. But now I
see both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Rowe was immersed in dance music, recording
solo and with various collaborators and frequenting underground
gatherings, sponsored by collectives like Soundlab and Unity Gain.
Like many of Ms. Goese's friends, including most of her Fez guests,
he had caught the electronic bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were people who had not been excited in years,'' Ms.
Goese said. ``There's something intrinsic in the beat. In the
energy of the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing the Live And the Electronic
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goese was thrilled by electronic music, too, but she
disliked its lack of focus on performers. What partly persuaded her
to collaborate with Moby was his onstage charisma. Rowe agrees that
the human spark of live performance is a key to the band Mimi's
success.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goese's ``singing and even her melodies are very involved
with the way she is physically,'' he said. ``Hopefully, watching us
is like watching music.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimi, the band, wasn't always so well balanced between
electronic and live elements. The demo tape that David Byrne heard
while getting his hair cut at a salon run by Ms. Goese's friend
Valerie Ohms, was mostly electronic. At Byrne's suggestion, Ms.
Goese tried a more organic approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urged her to perform, so that when the record came out
there would be a real thing there,'' Byrne said. ``Then at some
point we all felt that that approach was making some stuff a little
more conventional. I suggested she work with Hector Zazou. They met
and got along really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe had long admired Zazou, an Algerian-born ambient musician
and producer based in Paris, and agreed to share production on
``Soak'' with him. The two traded material via the Internet.
Although the process sounds like cut-and-paste when described,
``Soak'' is a remarkably cohesive suite grounded in Ms. Goese's
dramatic vocals.
</P>
<P>
   The live Mimi band has also gone from traditional to electronic
to a blend. ``We're incorporating what's available to us now _ the
sampler, and the large sonic palette,'' Rowe said. ``But we're
still also trying to have the feeling we had in Hugo Largo, which
was almost like being in a chamber music group.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber group, rehearsing at Fez for Mimi's first
appearance, was having trouble fitting onto the stage. Lloop, the
dreadlocked auteur whose pseudonym describes his technique of
looping samples together to make sonic collages, stood,
disgruntled, behind his bank of machines, now banished to the front
row of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Metaphors for Art In the Surroundings
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goese's surroundings often suggest metaphors for her art,
and here was another one: two banks of samplers, two turntables and
the instruments of three traditional musicians had created an
overflow akin to her intense new songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life's a piece of cake,'' Ms. Goese sang as the band crashed
through the first single from ``Soak.'' ``Except with Lloop, where
everything's difficult,'' she improvised.
</P>
<P>
   As the band got going, with Lloop finding the rhythm of his
synthetically created and found sounds, Ms. Goese rocked and
gestured in synch with the increasing noise. Vocally, she sparred
with the jerky rhythms of the music, her movements adding a third
dimension to the shifting tableaux engendered by her words and the
players' shifts between tunefulness and clamor. Later, Lloop said
he enjoyed rising to the group's challenges. A prime mover in the
local electronic music scene, he belongs to the younger generation
of artists that Mimi's new songs take from and give back to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future will be hybrid,'' Lloop predicted. ``There won't be
a distinction between electronic and traditional artists. If they
were two different religions, it would be a good idea for them to
intermingle anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloop's prophecy seems likely, and such events could bring
greater success to artists like Ms. Goese. These days, musical
undergrounds often infiltrate the mainstream more easily than they
survive in their own environments. Ms. Goese's talent for leaping
boundaries may help her take some missives from those subterranean
scenes into pop's great beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, where I teach, very often I've have a group of 10
people and every one is from a different country,'' she said. ``So
you get down to your pidgin English and hold on for dear life. You
find the very important words that you need to communicate. That's
what I hope for in writing the songs.''

`NOT ABOUT NIGHTINGALES': TENNESSEE WILLIAMS, A YOUTH CONFINED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Pa., Mo.)  (Eitors: production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``Now is the time to make a break _ get away _ away.''
The words, hopeful and desperate, appear in the private journal of
the 27-year-old Thomas Lanier Williams III, who was soon to adopt
the first name of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was then living, most unhappily, with his parents in
St. Louis. His older sister, Rose, who people said might as well be
his twin, had recently been institutionalized for mental illness,
and the young man found himself ``pinning pictures of wild birds on
my lavatory screen.'' The idea of flight, of escape, saturated a
life that was becoming more and more claustrophobic.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1938, the same year that Williams wrote a play that
is only now receiving its American premiere. Called ``Not About
Nightingales,'' it was shaped with the aim of getting the attention
of the politically minded Group Theater in New York, and it is
directly topical in a way that Williams' plays would never be
again.
</P>
<P>
   But its subject, inspired by newspaper accounts of four brutal
deaths in Philadelphia, matched its author's state of mind all too
well: it is a drama about a prison and the toll that incarceration
takes on the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, searing production of ``Not About Nightingales'' that
can be seen at the Alley Theater here owes its inception to Vanessa
Redgrave, who became curious about the play while researching her
role in Williams' ``Orpheus Descending'' and tracked down the
manuscripts. It has been brought to life as a collaboration by Ms.
Redgrave's Moving Theater, the Alley and the Royal National Theater
in London, where it was first staged, under the direction of Trevor
Nunn, to excited hosannas in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not About Nightingales'' is by no stretch of the imagination a
mature piece of craftsmanship. Williams, who was aching to have his
work produced, was clearly cutting the play's design according to
polemical patterns of theater made popular by Clifford Odets. But
the emotional cloth of the drama, and much of its imagery, is pure
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   As a cry of social protest for prison reform, it can seem as
much of an artifact as the ``big house'' movies of the 1930s. As an
anguished cry of empathy for fellow souls in captivity, it is a
full-strength heartbreaker.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional tide that sweeps through ``Nightingales'' and that
makes it so strangely compelling isn't as much righteous anger as
corrosive fear: fear of losing all connection with the fast-passing
stream of life; of madness; of sexual loneliness; of entombment,
real and metaphorical. From the beginning of ``Nightingales,''
which traces the battle of wills between a sadistic warden, Boss
Whalen (Corin Redgrave), and a group of prisoners on a hunger
strike, there hovers the threat of an ungodly punishment:
consignment to ``Klondike,'' a subterranean chamber lined with
steam radiators. In the events that inspired this play, four men
were cooked to death in such a room.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of excruciating death in a locked room figures in
Williams' work as early as a short story (set in ancient Egypt) he
wrote for a pulp magazine when he was a teen-ager. Here, it becomes
the conclusive symbol in a chain of images of isolation and
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn and his excellent cast and production team admirably
refrain from overemphasizing this pattern. They are clearly aware
of the work's difficult status as the previously unseen product of
a master, and they don't overload it with interpretive quirks or
shadings. They present ``Nightingales,'' as they should, as a
story, not a poem, and give full due to the sensational thrust and
tension of a play Williams himself identified as a melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   But the wholesale commitment of the actors, a mixture of British
and American performers, to their roles gives the evening both an
urgency and an organic-seeming lyricism that overrides its clunkier
lines and speechifying.
</P>
<P>
   The drama begins in darkness with the amplified voice of a guide
on a tour ship called the Lorelei. (Williams' affinity for
ironically grand names is already in evidence.) It's a siren call
that can't be heeded by the prison inmates who hear the teasing
voice of a world of motion to which they no longer belong. Richard
Hoover's set and Chris Parry's lighting, which ply Expressionist
techniques with commendable delicacy, create a bleak, stranded
environment so bleached of color that even the American flag in the
warden's office is rendered in shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave, the brother of Vanessa and a co-founder of the Moving
Theater, plays the corrupt, lusty Boss Whalen with an outsize
satanic gusto that is as unnerving as it is entertaining. He
becomes the embodiment of the element in which the prisoners exist.
He's the oppressive, tyrannical God in their circumscribed
universe, holding the power of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   As is always true in Williams' plays, there are those who are
strong enough to survive in this context and those who are crushed
by it. Williams admires the former; he loves the latter.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the characters can be broken into a familiar
lineup of the stereotypes that show up in everything from the
prison dramas to the war movies of the period. There's the
inevitable sensitive young man, here named Jim Allison (Finbar
Lynch in a piercing, sharp-edged performance), a prisoner who works
in the warden's office and a writer in the making, and his sworn
enemy, Butch O'Fallon (James Black), who is all swagger and
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The good-hearted inmate (Dion Graham) is in prison for stealing
a box of canned food to feed his starving family, is liked by all
and is destined to die early; the cocky new boy (Mark Dexter)
swears he doesn't belong in prison, and the appropriately named
Queen (Jude Akuwudike) utters a line that anticipates the Almas and
Blanches to come: ``All my life I've been persecuted by people
because I'm refined.'' For love interest, there is the warden's
alluring but honorable young secretary, Eva Crane (Sherri Parker
Lee).
</P>
<P>
   You've seen all these characters, with only slight variations,
before, right? But if their outlines come from cookie cutters,
their uneasy souls are their own. Even the robust Butch, given
vigorous credibility by Black, is haunted by the shadows of an
unlived life. Jim, whose anxious moral ambivalence beams steadily
from Lynch's glittering eyes, has developed trembling hands from
years of self-disgusted compromise and sexual repression.
</P>
<P>
   Before all the men looms the warning figure of Sailor Jack
(Richard Leaf), who has gone ``stirbugs,'' reduced to babbling
incoherence by his time in solitary confinement. The official
diagnosis is dementia praecox, a phrase, for the record, with which
doctors had recently described the condition of Williams' sister.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Crane, too, suffers from frayed nerves, an aspect that Ms.
Lee has the good sense not to exaggerate, and though she is
repulsed by the warden's sexual overtures, she also admits she is
hypnotized by them. The overall climate, as Whalen notes with
remarkable understatement as the play reaches its horrific climax,
is one in which ``we're all just nervous, strained, overwrought,''
a phrase he repeats like a seductive litany. The setting may be a
prison, but it is also the same ``suburb of hell'' inhabited by
Williams' great later characters.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's character, by the way, is derisively called Canary Jim
by his fellow inmates, and the motifs of birds in cages and
feelings of flightlessness pervade the play. The work's title comes
from Jim's declaration that he will portray only the raw truth in
his writing and not the pretty creatures of nature of Romantic
odes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a way, this drama IS about nightingales, precursors to
the fluttering, fragile life seekers whom Williams would write
about until he died. They are always doomed to extinction, but they
can sing like nobody else. This tender act of resurrection by the
Redgraves, Nunn and company shows the songbirds just beginning to
find their voices.

MODEL CITIZENS IN WEB WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the past two years, computer users have
downloaded more pictures of Cindy Margolis from the Internet than
of any other human on this green Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that and a dollar will buy the 29-year-old Valley
native a halfway decent cup of coffee. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the value of fame on the Internet, where information,
and pinups, want to be free.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Margolis, who still lives in the Valley, is one of the first
Internet stars _ and she's grateful for what it has done for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great vehicle for becoming known,'' Margolis said.
``I can't thank the Internet enough. If I was going to be queen or
No. 1 in something, this is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been on greeting cards, pinup posters, even been one of
the hostesses on ``The Price Is Right,'' nibbling on the edges of
prominence. But nothing has pushed Margolis into prominence like
the Internet, where fans found her early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! Internet Life magazine crowned her the queen of the
Internet, saying fans have pulled down more copies of her pictures
than of anyone else during the past two years from places such as
America Online, her own personal site and the hundreds of fan sites
that have sprung up.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike some who have won a rather dubious sort of Internet
fame, not a single one of the Margolis shots was nude. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Margolis is trying to jump from new media to old ones such
as films, television and magazines _ and make a lot of money doing
it.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, she will host an hourlong special on the E! cable TV
channel about women _ well, babes _ of the Internet. It will focus
on Margolis and such other budding Net queens as Asia Carrera,
Danni Ashe, Jennie Ringley and Anna Voog.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of the standout stars of the new media,'' said Rob
Bernstein, a senior editor for Yahoo! Internet Life. ``If you go
online, you'll find hundreds and hundreds of sites devoted to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   All summer long, Margolis will be appearing as a celebrity video
jock on VH1, pushing herself and her site as much as the latest
music from Madonna and Babyface.
</P>
<P>
   She's beginning to pop up in magazines, most notably People,
which named her one of the world's 50 most beautiful people.
</P>
<P>
   She's getting movie roles, too, a couple so far this year plus
last year's ``Austin Powers,'' where she played one of the
identical &UR;  &LR; ``fembots,'' who could ``kill a man just by looking at
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolis proved even more of a man-killer in real life: When the
movie company gave away a chance to attend the premiere as
Margolis' date, there were 500,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   All this is going on just as Margolis launches a beefed-up
version of her Web site. Its premium memberships and product sales
are her best chance to see if the medium that made her famous can
also make her rich.
</P>
<P>
   Melodie Calvert, who produced the E! channel's special, said
Margolis has done well on the Net because few established stars in
other media knew how to take advantage of its characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Hollywood celebs are a little bit ignorant of the
Internet and didn't focus on the fans as much,'' Calvert said.
``Cindy is starting to figure out how to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! Internet Life's Bernstein said the Internet generates
fame in an odd way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate office water cooler,'' Bernstein said.
``What you find on the Net is all these bizarre grass-roots groups
where something just takes off. Cindy Margolis is like that. There
are a lot of models now jumping on the Net with their own sites,
but she was one of the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas Heller, a friend of Margolis' fiance who heads the online
event production arm of iXL Inc. in Westwood, is helping Margolis
translate fame to cash. He said she is popular on the Net because
she is a product of the Net, one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing that really fuels Cindy's success,'' Heller
said. ``She was one of the first (starlets) to have a home page.
She did the chat rooms. She worked it. She's definitely one of
them. I don't know anyone else like her on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolis is a pleasant, vivacious woman of medium height,
friendly and outgoing, with a ready and warm laugh. And while she
enthuses about the fan base she's built out of the electrons of the
virtual world, she's also modest about how it happened. It's all a
matter of good timing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just got in at the beginning, when things were
getting started,'' Margolis said.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis grew up in Encino, attending Birmingham and Taft high
schools before finishing at a now-defunct private school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She got her first big break when her business-class project at
California State University, Northridge, turned into a
greeting-card line featuring her modeling shots. She left school
behind after two years and set up the card company in the family
basement.
</P>
<P>
   The cards led to pinup posters, then a call from America Online,
which wanted to post one of her shots on the service so its members
could pull down a copy of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them a picture, and then AOL called the next day to say
it had been downloaded 72,000 times in the first 24 hours,''
Margolis said. That opened her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned all I could about the Internet,'' Margolis said. ``I
didn't even know who AOL was when I started. It brought me into the
'90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, she saw the Internet as a way to promote her other
ventures, not a way to become famous or make money directly.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bernstein's magazine called to tell her she was Queen of
the Net, with her pictures the most popular download of anyone's in
1996. According to Ron Bel Bruno, another Yahoo! senior editor who
compiled the figures, the competition wasn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had more than 700,000 downloads,'' Bel Bruno said. ``Brad
Pitt, the No. 1 man, had less than half that. She placed far ahead
of Teri Hatcher, Sandra Bullock, a lot of others. It was really
shocking, because she's not well-known outside the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   That led Margolis to create her own modest Internet site at
www.cindymargolis.com. Though her fame was growing as fast as her
medium, she still hadn't figured out to make it work financially.
</P>
<P>
   When she was the top download again for 1997, Margolis joined
with iXL, Heller's company, to beef up her site. This time, she
said, she thinks she's got it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I won again this year, I figured I had to step it up and
have this be a big business,'' Margolis said.
</P>
<P>
   The site will sell merchandise such as posters, computer
accessories, calendars and the like, and offer ``virtual
signings,'' where fans can buy personalized autographed gear
online.
</P>
<P>
   Her revamped Web site will give subscribers access to a ``weekly
live online event,'' featuring Margolis in a chat room, possibly
with live video and audio, Heller said. A quarterly session open to
all comers is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 1 million people registered on Margolis' old site, and
Heller said he hopes to persuade up to 30,000 of those to pay for
memberships to join her new one.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis said she wants to use the Internet's technologies to
create an ``intimate'' connection with fans. That means
electronically answering questions and requests from members and
sending personalized autographed pictures.
</P>
<P>
   One option she's not currently pondering, however, is nude
shots. The line will still stop where her bikini does.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ways she could make a lot of money is if she posed
nude,'' Heller said. ``But in no way is that in the near future of
her plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say she would never strip some day, say, for a
shot in a big movie with a love scene involving a certain hunky
young actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Brad Pitt? I'm there,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Margolis' fan base, she'll still have to fight for
attention against the hundreds of millions of other World Wide Web
pages on the Internet. So Heller plans to make deals with so-called
``content aggregators,'' the big sites that depend on big draws
like Margolis to sell advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is iXL's position in the industry. Heller's
group produces the chat rooms and live concerts carried on many of
the biggest Internet sites, such as the Globe, Talk City and AOL's
Entertainment Asylum. Heller will book her on those shows and reap
the cross-promotional benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making it up as we go along, but I'm making an educated
guess as we go along,'' Heller said. ``I think we have the right
talent, the right technology to make it work.''

HE GOES FROM `SIMPSONS' FAN TO FOX STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When Wilmer Valderrama was living in Venezuela _
and failing English class _ he'd tune in whenever he had a chance
to watch his favorite television show, ``The Simpsons.'' The
Spanish language version, of course.
</P>
<P>
   When he moved to Van Nuys 4{ years ago, Valderrama continued to
tune in on his favorite cartoons _ using the translation function
on his television set to hear it all in Spanish, of course.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Valderrama will have to stay tuned to Fox for at
least another half-hour on Sunday nights to catch what no doubt
will be another one of his favorite shows. The one !ital!he's!off!
on. He's landed one of the starring roles on ``Feelin' All Right,''
a comedy that will take a look back at the high jinks of the '70s;
it is scheduled to air at 8:30 p.m. Sundays as part of the Fox
network's 1998-99 season lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I especially love `The Simpsons`,'' Valderrama said. ``I also
love `The X-Files.' They are two of the best shows, and I am in the
middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama plays Fez, a foreign exchange student. It's not
exactly that much of a stretch for the 18-year-old Taft High School
junior who still speaks with a heavy accent.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Miami and raised in his parents' native Venezuela,
Valderrama suddenly found a new reason why he should have paid
closer attention in English class when his family relocated to Los
Angeles and he had to make his way at Mulholland Junior High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, I didn't even know how to say, `Hi',''
Valderrama said. ``That is how pathetic my English was. I used to
have to walk around with a dictionary in my little tight pants.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, tight pants. Valderrama still adheres to many of
his Venezuelan sensibilities, especially fashion. He refuses to don
the baggy pants that infect American youth.
</P>
<P>
   As an 18-year-old, Valderrama is not required to have a tutor on
the set. He plans to continue high school by having his sister
Marilyn, 17, another budding actor, bring his assignments to him
after the show's production begins later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his dictionary-toting days that Valderrama decided
he wanted to be an actor. That became a punch line around
Mulholland Junior High, but it is Valderrama who is getting the
last laugh. Girls that wouldn't look at him a couple of months ago
now want to get to know the school's newest star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, `In your face','' he said, speaking of those who
mocked him before his big break.
</P>
<P>
   His first professional break was a Spanish-language Pacific Bell
commercial. But aside from some school plays and auditions for TV
and movies, there were few bites _ until ``Feelin' All Right''
called.
</P>
<P>
   He was shocked to hear he landed the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out, I couldn't speak for like an hour and a half,''
Valderrama said. ``I just busted out crying. It is like a little
American dream. It's a huge accomplishment. I have only been here a
short time and to accomplish something like this at this age _ and
my parents are able to see me succeed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We were having a staff meeting and I asked a basic question.
After the meeting, my manager told me that he didn't want to
embarrass me in front of the others, but my question was stupid. He
feels he's a hero because he reprimanded me in private, but I'm
annoyed over the criticism itself. What do you think? E.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: In Management 101, your manager gets half credit. He gets an
A for providing negative feedback in private, and an F for the
feedback itself.
</P>
<P>
   The best managers today adhere to the adage that there is no
such thing as a stupid question. It is not as if managers should be
seeking so-called stupid questions, but it is through the
opportunity to ask any question that innovation and creativity are
fostered.
</P>
<P>
   Your manager's actions can totally extinguish the employees'
desire to think, take some mental risks, and approach problems in
new and different ways. Even if you ask the most ridiculous
question in the world, it is entirely possible that your question
will generate some related ideas that can truly lead to more
effective problem-solving. After all, some of the greatest ideas,
concepts and inventions started as arguably stupid questions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, even if your question made absolutely no sense, the
way that you were treated is ultimately going to prevent your
associates from asking their own risky questions, and who is to say
what creative ideas may be lost forever as a result? It's time for
your manager to go back to Management 101.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So much of what I've been reading lately advises job-seekers
to wear a tie to a job interview. Many of the companies I'm looking
at are very casual, and I wonder if I'm going to look out of place
wearing a tie. What do you think? J.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although work has definitely become more casual in many
sectors, being too casual in the interview process can cause a
casualty. In general, it makes sense to wear a tie to a job
interview, even if the people you meet at the company seem to
wonder why you are wearing a piece of colorful fabric around your
neck. The fact is that many interviewers expect applicants to wear
ties, and you can send an unintentionally smug or lackadaisical
message by arriving without one.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are many work environments and jobs in
which it is the tie that sends the wrong message. In such settings,
a tie can cause the applicant to look too stodgy or self-important.
</P>
<P>
   If you look carefully at the industry, the company, and the
specific job you are seeking, you should be able to gather some
insight as to whether you need to wear a tie. And, if you know
people who work for the company, you can check with them. If all
else fails, you can always call the company, mention that you are
going to be coming in for an interview, and ask if it is a
tie-optional affair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Upon receiving my college degree, I returned home to find a
tough job market for my field. Consequently, I took a temporary,
full-time position while continuing my job search. I am being
bombarded with lectures and advice by numerous co-workers who think
they have the answers to my job-search woes. I wish these
know-it-alls would understand that not all college grads have a
choice of where they want to work. What do you suggest? K.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: The most important step for you to take is to stop focusing
on your co-workers and start focusing on your career. Your
co-workers probably feel badly that you spent four years in
college, only to have to settle for a stopgap job until you find
something better. In fact, it sounds like all they really want to
do is help you.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you need to look at what you are doing for
yourself. If you have a real strategy to get your career on track,
it will be much easier for you to listen to what your co-workers
may be saying. However, if you feel stuck, then all of their
comments are going to be that much more annoying.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, something about your behavior is calling for
help, and your co-workers are responding to it. In terms of getting
real help, there are career placement centers, job counselors,
industrial psychologists, employment agencies and search firms, and
university programs that can help you either find a more satisfying
position, or slightly redirect your career path toward an equally
fulfilling objective. There are many outstanding opportunities for
recent college graduates, but you need to give yourself the
opportunity to pursue them.

   440&AMP;ADD  LATINO GROUP URGES MINORITY
COMMUNITY TO SHUN ALCOHOL, TOBACCO MONEY
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to funding cultural events,
cash-strapped minority groups have often depended on the Marlboro
Man to ride to their rescue.
</P>
<P>
   But the non-profit Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco (LCAT),
which has persuaded Washington's annual Latino Festival to kick the
habit of accepting tobacco and alcohol sponsors, wants minority
organizations to rethink the consequences of accepting these gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The council said at a news conference Tuesday it hoped the
Latino festival, expected to draw half a million people from across
the nation to the national capital July 25 and 26, would ``set a
precedent'' of shunning tobacco and alcohol money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, we are sending a loud, clear message to the alcohol
and tobacco industries to stop selling poison to our children,''
Richard Levinson, spokesman for the American Public Health
Association, said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Huerta, director of cancer prevention at Washington
Hospital Center, noted that 440,000 Americans die of
tobacco-related illnesses each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (tobacco companies) are killing 1,200 people every day.
They need a new crop _ that's our community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most large Latino organizations, as well as major
African-American groups, accept financial support from the tobacco
and alcohol industries.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so has put minority groups in a bind, said Rev. Alpha
Estes Brown of the American Cancer Society. They ``inadvertently
contribute to the demise of their communities through silence or
indifference, not wanting to offend the generosity of their
benefactors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Kwok, executive director of the Organization of Chinese
Americans, admitted there was ``tremendous pressure'' to take
tobacco and alcohol money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken the funds, but have used it appropriately,'' she
said. The organization recently accepted $35,000 over two years to
put out a directory of Asian Pacific American organizations that
was largely funded by Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kamasaki, senior vice president of the National Council
of La Raza, the largest Latino civil rights organization, said La
Raza receives about 2 percent of its roughly $13 million budget
from tobacco and alcohol sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is undeniably true there are other sources of money,'' he
said. ``My point is, a lot of that money comes with strings
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the freedom granted by tobacco and alcohol companies for
use of the money makes it hard to turn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't carry out other people's agenda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Carraro, spokeswoman for Philip Morris U.S.A., said that
the industry's marketing techniques are simply tailored to each
community's preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Latinos are just as capable of making life decisions
as any other group,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that Hispanic males are more likely to
experience drinking problems than African-Americans or whites.
Also, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis are leading causes of
death among Latinos, according to LCAT.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Chairman Jeannette Noltenius, is why LCAT wants to
curb the ``systematic targeting'' of minorities by the tobacco and
alcohol industries.
</P>
<P>
   Noltenius said the council's purpose was ``not to criticize
Latino and other minority groups,'' but to encourage them to probe
new sources of funding to cover the cost of their events.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped comprehensive national tobacco legislation
pending in the Senate would allocate funds for minority
organizations to help them cut dependence on the tobacco and
alcohol money.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: OF SCULPTURE AND THE PAST REVIVIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The announcement said simply, ``Ellsworth Kelly:
Sculpture for a Large Wall, 1957,'' a title that didn't prepare me
for a reunion with an old friend. But there it was, alarmingly
visible through the window of the Matthew Marks Gallery on 522 West
22nd St.: the portal to the city of my youth.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, an immense aluminum construction created by Kelly for
the Transportation Building in downtown Philadelphia, which remains
on view through Saturday, has been a joy of the spring season.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening, Marks, who rescued the sculpture from
demolition, mentioned that I was the first person he'd met who had
seen the piece at its original site when it was relatively new. My
memory of it is vivid indeed. Everyone has an age of discovery, and
mine began at the age of 10 when I figured out how to catch the
suburban commuter train to downtown Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Philadelphia was a place where a woman once sued Josephine
Baker because during her act Baker used to throw fruit out into the
audience, and this woman claimed she'd been hit on the head by a
flying pineapple, I think it was. Philadelphia, in other words, was
a town where Josephine Baker could throw fruit out into the
audience and people would just sit on their hands. If things were
so grim downtown, imagine what the suburbs were like.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 30-minute ride from the suburb where my parents lived
to Suburban Station, an underground terminal tucked beneath the
city's asphalt skin. There was more than one route to the surface.
Mine detoured through an inconspicuous stairway that led up to the
lobby of the new Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby had that mildly sweet, peach-melba smell of
well-tended hotels, as well as racy carpets streaked with green,
orange and pink. A bookstore in the lobby always seemed to be
displaying the latest best seller by Jack Paar. Then, from the
Sheraton, you could pass into the lobby of the Transportation
Building next door.
</P>
<P>
   These two buildings were parts of Penn Center, a massive
redevelopment of Philadelphia's downtown core. Planned by Edmund
Bacon, the nation's leading city planner in the postwar decades,
the complex of offices and hotels was the largest development the
city had seen since the 1920s. Penn Center was not a critical
success.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Kahn, whose design for the area had been rejected,
commented that if the plan had been submitted by a first-year
architecture student, the grade would be zero. Later, Penn Center
was reviled as a prime example of disastrous modern city planning:
lamentable in the spare geometry of its buildings, its disregard
for the vitality of the traditional street.
</P>
<P>
   All true, no doubt, but it was great nonetheless to have such a
fine group of modern lobbies. People passing through lobbies like
these must certainly be on their way to doing modern things.
</P>
<P>
   I guessed they must be doing advertising, this being the most
modern occupation I could imagine. They were creating ads for
Campbell's soup or Smirnoff vodka. And when they arrived in the
morning, they wore Martin Balsam hats of trim charcoal gray with
narrow brims, wide bands and a little feather stuck in them.
</P>
<P>
   One corner of the building contained a Greyhound bus terminal.
In those days, the place didn't give the impression that buses were
for poor people. These buses, remember, had Scenicruiser service.
And airports then were still just landing fields. The aura of
transportation was both democratic and transcendent.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's wall sculpture was installed over the elevators, and
opposite these, framed by glass, were the doors to the city. As you
walked through the lobby, you selected yourself to be part of the
city, to be a lover of modern art, and to see modern art and the
city as two aspects of the present. The desire to join that present
was the impulse that drove you through the door.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was 33 when he received this commission. It came his way
in 1956 through Richard Kelly (no relation), a lighting designer he
met one night in a New York City bar.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was first hired to design a group of seven brass window
screens for the Transportation Building's Post House Restaurant.
The lobby project followed. Kelly was paid $200 for his work, and
gained the antagonism of his client, the building's developer, who
disliked the sculpture so much that he refused to illuminate it at
night. The client might have thought he'd been hit by a flying
pineapple, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog essay, James Meyer writes about Kelly's youthful
desire to collaborate with architects. While living in Paris in the
early 1950s, he sought out Le Corbusier to discuss such
collaborations, and there are discernibly Corbusian aspects to the
Philadelphia sculpture: the machine fabrication, the primary
colors, the elemental geometric shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly understood that he risked having his work interpreted as
design rather than art. In fact, he was dismayed one day to find
that the management of the Post House had taped its menu to one of
his brass screens. A few years later, the screens were thrown out
with no more ceremony than if they'd been a set of Venetian blinds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I was too uneducated to wonder whether the lobby sculpture was
art or design or to know that the distinction mattered. For me, the
piece mainly represented novelty.
</P>
<P>
   At the Franklin Institute, the science museum a few blocks away,
novelty came in the form of a room-size Univac computer. At Penn
Center, it arrived as 104 pieces of anodized aluminum, stretched
out on parallel metal bars to a length of 65 feet. Yet on some
inarticulate level I sensed that the sculpture, while novel,
corresponded to familiar patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, George Balanchine choreographed his great masterpiece
``Agon.'' Lincoln Kirstein, writing about the ballet some years
later, described Balanchine's work as a process of uncovering.
Creativity, on the human level, is simply what might be called an
uncovering of commentary on innumerable facts of measure and order
(parts of which may include disorder: chaos, hazard, cruelty,
injustice and death).
</P>
<P>
   Kirstein's viewpoint, while mystical, is nonetheless a useful
one for examining art in an urban context. In choreographing
``Agon,'' Balanchine used a 17th-century manual of French court
dances to reveal what the classically trained body could do in
movement, and he also revealed something essential about
20th-century New York: the city's harmonies and distortions, the
playfulness and anxiety of relationships in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Center, whatever its defects, was also an uncovering _ it
disclosed a city gripped at once by hope for change and fear of it
_ and so was Kelly's wall sculpture. In the abstraction of their
forms, both projects revealed the city's transition from industrial
production to symbolic analysis, to use Robert Reich's phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's piece showed what some aluminum scraps could become when
arranged and painted. Beyond that, the sculpture revealed
distinctly urban kinds of movement, as different as the walking
styles of pedestrians in the streets outside.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mondrian's New York paintings, it revealed how a color, a
shape or a gesture _ of buildings, people, cars, shop windows _ can
catch the eye, hold it for a second, and then lose it to other
shapes and colors, or combine with them in changing rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the piece revealed the movement of the eye itself _
restless, curious, delighted or dissatisfied _ and the power of
retinal movement to trigger ideas. Like a Rorschach blot, then, it
ultimately revealed the self. And suggested, in its context, that
revelation of self is not a small part of a city's business.
</P>
<P>
   The collisions, surprises, the Walk/Don't Walk (dis)connections
_ flying pineapples _ arouse aspects of the psyche that might
otherwise remain submerged.

 NEW DIRECTOR FOR LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The general director of the Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
was named Tuesday as the new director of the Lincoln Center
Festival on the eve of the summer program's third season.
</P>
<P>
   The new director, Nigel Redden, 47, who served as executive
producer of the Lincoln Center Festival in 1995 and has been
running it since January, replaces John Rockwell, who left at that
time to return to The New York Times as editor of the Arts and
Leisure section. The appointment places Redden at the helm of two
of the United States' leading arts festivals. He will remain as
general director of the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are complementary in a lot of ways,'' Redden said. He
said he saw no conflict between Spoleto, an offshoot of the
original Italian ``Two Worlds'' festival, taking place in May and
June, and the Lincoln Center Festival, in July.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a special tie to Lincoln Center. His wife, Arlene
Shuler, is the center's senior vice president for planning and
external affairs.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's Lincoln Center program, which Redden inherits
essentially from Rockwell, consists of 111 performances of 36
events, from a 19-hour Chinese Kunju opera, ``The Peony Pavilion,''
to a cyberworld ``Faust'' by La Fura dels Baus of Barcelona, Spain;
a tribute to Leonard Bernstein; two plays by the Gesher Theater of
Tel Aviv, Israel, with simultaneous translation from the Hebrew;
and the complete organ works of Bach. The festival runs from July 7
to 26.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are budgeted at about $9 million a season, with
about $6 million to be raised from benefactors. Last season,
however, cost $10.6 million, Lincoln Center officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Redden said he was already working on the 1999 and 2000 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center, and Beverly
Sills, the chairwoman, praised Redden's understanding of the arts
and his ``practical know-how.'' He has also worked at the Santa Fe
Opera and the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Redden marks another act in an unusual pas de deux
that has taken him back and forth between Spoleto and Lincoln
Center. He was Spoleto's general manager from 1986 to 1991, when he
left following a dispute with the organizer of the festival, the
composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Menotti himself left Charleston in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Redden was named consultant and several months later
executive producer of the Lincoln Center Festival, then being
planned under the direction of Rockwell, who had been European
cultural correspondent when he left The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Redden left Lincoln Center in late 1995 to return to Spoleto in
Charleston as general director. He returned to Lincoln Center in
January as artistic consultant to lead the festival after
Rockwell's return to The Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a bad penny,'' Redden said Tuesday.

RONALDO DISPATCHES MOROCCO, 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   NANTES, France _ Ronaldo took a step toward fulfilling his
ambition Tuesday, a week after the start of the World Cup finals
and more than two months after his previous goal for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The planet's most famous 21-year-old finally converted his first
World Cup goal to spark the Brazilians to a 3-0 victory over
Morocco, clinching a berth in the second round as the top team in
Group A. They will meet the second-place team in Group B in Paris
June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Before the World Cup started, Ronaldo had talked of challenging
the tournament record of 13 goals set by France's Just Fontaine in
1958. But he was seldom involved in the action during Brazil's
opening 2-1 victory over Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed suddenly in this match. Possibly Ronaldo was
inspired by the arrival at Stade de la Beaujoire of his girlfriend
Susana Werner, an aspiring model/soccer player known as Ronaldinha.
More likely, Ronaldo's success is attributable to the improved
understanding among his teammates, the ineffective defending and
inexperienced goalkeeping of Morocco, plus his dynamic bursts of
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil entered the field with a different attitude,'' Brazil
coach Mario Zagallo said. ``We played a more joyful game. I was
glad to see a smaller team like Morocco play an interesting, joyful
game also. We are especially satisfied to be in first place in our
group _ that was the first objective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians were able to penetrate early with quick
combinations. They dislodged the defense with enterprising runs and
adventurous, unpredictable passes. Leonardo had an offside goal in
the opening minutes. The Moroccan defenders became spread. And
Rivaldo nearly caught goalkeeper Driss Ben Zekri out of the goal
with a 45-yard blast from the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Rivaldo had possession in a similar position less than a minute
later. This time, Ben Zekri held his line, instead of taking the
necessary risk of cutting the attacking angle. That allowed Ronaldo
room to speed past the offside trap and take a perfect, angled
through ball from Rivaldo to score.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco continued to battle, though. Ronaldo retreated quickly
into defense to stop Abdeliha Saber seconds after the goal. Said
Chiba then left an 8-inch cleat gash on Ronaldo's left thigh with a
reckless challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco had few chances as Brazil's defense concentrated on
stopping Mustafa Hadji, and Ronaldo helped set the tone by
retreating into defending positions. But in the final minutes of
the first half, Youssef Chippo broke through the midfield and fell
while attempting to shoot from the edge of the penalty arc. Russian
referee Nikolai Levnikov issued a caution to Cesar Sampaio for a
foul, prompting a strong protest from Dunga. With Dunga
gesticulating wildly, Bebeto entered the conflict, leading Leonardo
to step between his teammates like a boxing referee.
</P>
<P>
   Levnikov added two minutes of injury time, and allowed the
Brazilians a final possession, which they converted as Bebeto and
Cafu set up Rivaldo for a 2-0 edge.
</P>
<P>
   The next score came five minutes into the second half as
defender Abdeliha Saber slipped under token pressure from Ronaldo,
who then went past a defender and Ben Zekri and centered for
Bebeto.
</P>
<P>
   The predominantly Brazilian crowd began calling for substitutes
Denilson and Edmundo in the first half. But Zagallo waited until
midway through the second half to make his first change _ Doriva
for Sampaio, who is disqualified for the Norway match in Marseille
Tuesday. Edmundo replaced Bebeto soon after. Denilson finally
entered for Rivaldo with three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo avoided debating with Egil Olsen, the Norway coach who
guided his team to a 4-2 win over Brazil in Oslo last year and
recently said that if he coached the Brazilians they would never
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything about the other team,'' Zagallo
said. ``I don't want to know about the other team, only about my
team. For me, it was not a surprise that we improved. In my
experience, Brazil is capable of doing this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won anything, yet. We've only finished first in the
group. Until we win the championship, we haven't done anything.''

   MANZANAR-NATIONAL-SITE (LONE PINE, Calif.) &UR;  &LR; _ The stone sentry

stretch of scrub off Highway 395 was the largest outpost between
Los Angeles and Reno, the place where 10,000 Japanese-Americans,
most of them United States citizens, were brought from their homes
and businesses along the West Coast against their will in the mass
hysteria that followed Pearl Harbor. By Todd Purdum.

   ELDERLY-PAIN-STUDY (WASHINGTON) _ Researchers studying elderly
cancer patients in nursing homes have found that many are severely
undertreated for their pain and more than a quarter of those who
complain of pain _ especially minorities and the oldest of the old
_ are given no pain medication at all. The study, the largest of
its kind, is all the more troubling, experts say, because as
hospital stays grow shorter and the elderly population increases,
more and more old people with cancer are living out the end of
their lives in nursing homes. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. &QL;

   GM-LABOR (DETROIT) _ The strikes now crippling General Motors,
while partly about short-term job security and workplace safety
disputes, reflect a larger struggle over whether America's auto
industry will become more like Brazil's. General Motors' operations
in Brazil have copied Japanese manufacturing practices on a huge
scale, and have become the company's most profitable, efficient and
flexible. When General Motors introduced new mid-size sedans in the
United States and Brazil two years ago, a Kansas factory took seven
months to make the switch while the Brazilian factory reached full
production in just three months. By Keith Bradsher.

FIKRETE GABRE, ENTREPRENEUR AND ETHIOPIAN ACTIVIST; AT 42

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fikrete Gabre, 42, an innovative Ethiopian entrepreneur and
community activist who had been living in Amherst, Mass., died June
9 while staying with family members in California. Her death was
attributed to complications from hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Zato, a village in southwestern Ethiopia, Ms. Gabre was
best-known for developing Siljo Sauce _ a traditional African blend
of ginger, garlic, and other spices which she made and marketed to
raise funds to create the first water system in her
drought-stricken hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Donating 20 percent of profits, she raised thousands of dollars
and generated considerable publicity for her village before a
severe case of hepatitis forced her to reduce her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; From a family of 14, Ms. Gabre came to the United States in
1974. A military dictator had closed all the local schools and she
wanted to get a college education. She eventually earned bachelor's
and master's degrees in labor relations at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst and a second master's degree, in social
work, at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In California, she also organized the first multicultural,
multilingual Ethiopian Community Resource Center in Oakland, which
she directed from 1983 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   With help from many Massachusetts residents, she launched her
Siljo Sauce project in 1991. Drought had devastated her village and
social progress, particularly for women, was being blocked by the
all-consuming search for water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water,'' she observed, ``is the lifeline for every living
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her mother, W-Maryan Ayemo of Zato, Ethiopia; four
sisters, Boge of Los Angeles, and Ceebo, Zenebeh, and Sheyae, all
of Addis Ababa; and four brothers, Tsedek of Nova Scotia, Berhanu
of Addis Ababa, and Abera and Solomon, both of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fikrete talked her mind. She was a ball of energy, constantly
doing things, creating things. She had such a huge heart for
everybody,'' said her sister Boge. ``We will carry her dreams.''

`KATYA KABANOVA': A JANACEK REPRISE AT GLYNDEBOURNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLYNDEBOURNE, England _ Britain is wet. The uncloned sheep on
the hills and meadows around the garden do not seem to mind, but
chalky mud from the paths of Glyndebourne clings to the black shoes
of the gentlemen in evening clothes at 4 in the afternoon, and
ladies pick up their long skirts to run from the next shower.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere matches the uncertainty that hangs over the
place, with the coming departure both of the opera festival's music
director, Andrew Davis, and of its chief executive, Anthony
Whitworth-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But the show goes on. One of Glyndebourne's big successes in the
last decade has been its sequence of Janacek performances, achieved
with outstanding singers, excellent conductors and a fine
production team, headed throughout by the director Nikolaus
Lehnhoff, whose emphatic groupings and heightened realism suit this
composer. ``Katya Kabanova'' was being played again Sunday evening,
and again hit home.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias Hoheisel's designs and Wolfgang Goebbel's lighting put
drably dressed people inside lurid landscapes and interiors: The
Kabanov home has violent magenta wallpaper, while the evening love
scene takes place against a sky that turns from orange through
tangerine to purplish gray. The inanimate world proclaims what most
of the characters dare not reveal: how much heat and vividness they
contain.
</P>
<P>
   The coloring also fits well with the music, especially with
Yakov Kreizberg in the pit to enforce the score's power and
determination. The best singers can stand up to his orchestra's
precise onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Amanda Roocroft is consistently vital and warm as
Katya, the one person in the drama who does reveal herself, and
pays the consequences. Kudrjas' emotionalism is more ironical, and
is captured beautifully by Timothy Robinson, a young lyric tenor
who sings with ease, elegance and a smile. Impressively acted
performances come from Helga Dernesch as the dominating Kabanicha,
Katya's mother-in-law, and Neill Archer as her weakling son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' the other opening production this year, is
altogether more disappointing, and especially so when it comes as
the first installment in a Mozart-da Ponte triptych to be conducted
by Davis and staged by Graham Vick.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' contribution, two nights ago, was rough at the edges.
Maybe this was because there is a lot of roughness, as well, in
Vick's production. Set in a rehearsal room, the work loses a lot of
its dramatic interest, quite apart from the fact that it looks
lifeless and bare.
</P>
<P>
   Because what we see is a semiperformance by modern young people,
the shades and ambiguities of characters playing roles are ironed
out and the corsets of courtliness untied. Games and moments of
passion alike are overplayed; points are made brutally and
physically. Vick has some nice ideas about the long-term damage of
pretense, but they need a more sophisticated production around
them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The singers, too, might have been coarsened by all the activity
they had to indulge in. Barbara Frittoli gave, nevertheless, a fine
account of Fiordiligi's big second-act aria, and Katarina Karneus
as Dorabella kept alive the sisterly relationship by playfulness
and deferral. Given the opportunity to stand aside from the
rambunctiousness, Alan Opie was a marvelous Don Alfonso: wise,
good-humored, entertained and entertaining, his singing as light as
a feather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katya'' closes on Sunday, but performances of ``Cosi'' go on
until the beginning of July, alternating with Handel's
``Rodelinda.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   OSAKA, Japan _ This spring, Suguru Takamatsu, one of 814 new
employees of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., took his destiny
into his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Takamatsu, 25, declined to join the ranks of the Japanese salary
men who rarely think about financing their retirement until their
employer hands them a fat check at the age of 60. Instead, he
elected to have his retirement benefits, along with other perks the
company would normally provide over the course of his career, paid
to him directly as he advances at Matsushita.
</P>
<P>
   The budding engineer plans to invest them on his own, taking
advantage of the new opportunities promised by financial
deregulation. ``There is no guarantee that I'll keep my job at
Matsushita until I retire,'' Takamatsu said. ``There might be
layoffs, or I might change my mind, find a better job or better
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen closely. Takamatsu's choice _ and Matsushita's decision
to let him make it _ may seem like a tiny thing, but in it you can
hear the cracking of the iron links that have traditionally chained
Japanese employee to employer for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give more opportunities to our employees to select
their course,'' said Atsushi Murayama, managing director of
personnel and general affairs at Matsushita, the electronics titan
that markets products under the Panasonic and National names. ``We
accept that some will seek work later outside the company, but
that's the reality of the changes in Japanese business and in
Japanese society.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Matsushita _ long considered one of the most
conventional big businesses in Japan _ gave new recruits a choice
of three retirement plans, knowing full well that it was striking a
blow against an employment system that has been the backbone of the
industrial complex that made Japan a global economic power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished, not just surprised,'' said Hiroyuki Matsui,
a manager at the Nikkeiren, the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations. ``The management style of Matsushita is very, very
traditional, with more or less a family-style relationship to
employees, so it's difficult to understand why they have introduced
this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With a note of disapproval, he suggested that newly minted
college graduates lack the preparation to make the choices
Matsushita is giving them. ``It is impossible to judge the success
of this program for 20 to 30 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Matsushita is not alone in taking what are bold steps by
Japanese standards. Ever so gently, corporate Japan is trying to
reduce its reliance on lifetime employment by tinkering with the
rigid, seniority-based salary system. While this movement has been
going on for a while, it is now picking up momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have introduced management ranks to merit-based
pay systems in an effort to reduce the relevance of seniority.
Fujitsu has gone the furthest, announcing recently that merit would
determine the pay of all 47,000 employees in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are even fiddling with the semiannual ``bonus,''
a label that implies a link to performance but in Japan refers to a
twice-yearly payment negotiated by the unions. Toyota Motor Corp.
has started calling the bonuses ``lump-sum payments'' in hopes that
someday it can give real bonuses to employees whose work is
exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   Amid today's hard times and rising unemployment, early
retirement is becoming more common, if not more publicly
acknowledged, and companies are brazenly cutting overtime pay and
other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese-type management system, such as the seniority
system or lifetime employment, cannot be continued,'' said Isao
Nakauchi, chairman, president and chief executive of Japan's
largest retailer, Daiei Inc., which is grappling with a huge debt
burden and a slowdown in consumption.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Nakauchi or any other executive here thinks
lifetime employment doesn't have its place in Japanese industry.
Everyone is well aware of the benefits of having a core group of
committed employees. ``Employment stability is still the biggest
obligation an employer has,'' Matsui said.
</P>
<P>
   Murayama of Matsushita agrees _ to a point. ``If we lose that
totally, we won't have success competing with America,'' he said.
``But those types of people who elect big businesses like
Matsushita because they're looking for a stable, steady,
comfortable environment, they make me a little uneasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita, a pillar of Japan Inc., has been cautiously chipping
away at the traditional mold. The salaries of its 11,000 managers
are determined by merit, not seniority, and it is negotiating with
its union over a similar plan for the rest of its 83,000 employees
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it introduced a performance-based stock option plan
for management, and it is seeking a cost-effective way to push the
mandatory retirement age to 65 from 60. With its low birth rate,
Japan will eventually face a labor shortage that could be partly
addressed by reversing the trend toward early retirement and
extending working life _ seniority-based pay makes older employees
too expensive. If birth rates do not increase, the population will
plummet from 125 million today to a stunning 55 million by the year
2100, according to government forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need team spirit, yes, but at the same time we need
creative, independent thinkers who want to work outside the team,''
Murayama said. ``To those people, the uniform pay system is
something frustrating, something that gets in the way of human
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita's retirement plan, however, seems to be somewhat of a
novelty in Japan. Japan has nothing like a 401(k) program, and the
notion of self-directed investment for retirement _ an idea that
has taken hold in the United States _ is as alien as the thought of
wearing shoes in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most Japanese are well aware that they will
probably have to pay for a good portion of their retirement
themselves because, all things remaining the same, the government
pension fund is likely to run dry in 2025.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for Matsushita, it is hoping the new program will attract a
higher caliber of job applicant. ``One of our frustrations has been
that we can't recruit above-average students so easily,'' Murayama
said. ``The traditional pay system is regarded as limiting to
creativity, so those creative people we want to attract look
elsewhere for a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The new retirement program gives recruits a choice of three
plans. They can, as Takamatsu did, opt to have pension benefits
paid out to them as they go; they can have a portion paid out and
leave a portion under the company's administration, or they can
choose the traditional, lump-sum-on-retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the traditional system, workers normally get a partial
payment if they leave a company before retirement, but job
switching has been rare, and with lifetime employment the norm,
openings scarce. And while Matsushita guarantees a respectable 7.5
percent return on workers' retirement money, some employees think
they can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Tomohiko Hasegawa, who graduated from Meiji University this year
with a law degree, chose the conventional system. It's not that
Hasegawa, a 23-year-old lawyer hoping for an international posting
with Matsushita in the future, isn't interested in managing his own
money. But he figures he can do that by setting aside a portion of
his salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no plans to switch jobs, so why shouldn't I participate
in the company plan,'' he said. ``I'm planning to stay for a long
time.'' Much to Matsushita's surprise, however, 39 percent of its
new employees opted for the nontraditional plans.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them were women like Yuka Kitadai, 22, who often do not
view their careers as lifetime endeavors. Ms. Kitadai, who
graduated from Keio University, chose the plan that pays her the
retirement allowance portion of her total benefits package but
allows her to participate in programs for housing loans and other
company-sponsored investment options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to use it now,'' she said. ``I thought I
could invest it myself or use it to travel and learn some other
languages on my own.'' While she's aware that as a novice to
investing, she may lose the money, Ms. Kitadai said she was
prepared to take that chance. She does not expect to be laid off,
but she wants to be ready just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I want to start learning another language
is because I think I'm going to have to protect myself with my own
skills,'' Ms. Kitadai said. ``That way even if I got laid off by
Matsushita, I could use my skills to find another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kitadai was among the 31 percent of new employees who opted
for ``Plan B,'' which pays out retirement allowances along with the
semiannual bonus but allows participants to invest in various
company savings plans at attractive rates, take part in the
company's stock purchase plan and qualify for special loans for
their children's education and scholarships. Under that plan, a new
employee who makes less than $1,478 a month would receive $597 a
year in retirement pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plan A,'' the more radical of the company's three retirement
plans, was selected by 8 percent of new employees, who had to have
a specialty like law or engineering to qualify; such people would
presumably have more job options in the future. They chose to forgo
participation in company savings, housing and stock programs in
exchange for additional compensation: a new employee earning less
than $1,478 a month gets $1,418 a year in advance retirement
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Kitadai, Shinichi Yamane, a graduate of Ohio State
University, opted for Plan B. He liked it because it offered him
the chance for some extra cash but also protected a bit of his
future by allowing him to participate in various company benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought choosing Plan A was a little risky, but I also
thought it might be better to get some of the money in my younger
years rather than when I'm too old to enjoy it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yamane, a 28-year-old electrical engineer, will join the
semiconductor development division when his initial training is
finished. He said he planned to use the additional money that will
come with his first bonus on a new stereo, clothes, perhaps even a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Like Yamane, Takamatsu agreed that his choice, Plan A, raised
the stakes for him considerably, but he was sanguine. ``There are
no guarantees anymore here,'' he said. ``I have to take
responsibility for my own future.'' &QL;

GETTY DAGUERREOTYPE EXHIBIT: TINY WINDOWS, ON THE PAST, SHUTTERS
OPEN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes groundbreaking inventions come along when
the world is not quite ready for them, and then they languish a
while.
</P>
<P>
   When the transistor was developed in 1947, it was thought to
have only a few technical applications; The New York Times stuck
its announcement of the discovery in a radio column. Within 10
years, the inventors were awarded a Nobel prize, and commercial
applications _ transistor radios for one _ were ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   The man who developed the mini-computer, which was smaller than
a mainframe and cost a mere several hundred thousand dollars, said
when the first reports of the PC came out that there would never be
any use for an individual computer in the home.
</P>
<P>
   But other discoveries are so immediately recognized, accepted,
and applied that it seems like the world had been waiting for them
all along. The daguerreotype is the archetypal case: it was perhaps
the most rapidly accepted and disseminated invention in history. In
1839, shortly after his process was announced to the world, Louis
J.M. Daguerre wrote an instruction manual. Within three months, 29
editions were published in six languages.
</P>
<P>
   Now, through July 12, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles,
which owns one of the most important daguerreotype collections in
the world, has more than 125 examples from its holdings on view, as
well as a display of studio and darkroom equipment from the
collection of Matthew Isenburg. The show was organized by Weston
Naef, curator of photographs, with Julian Cox, Michael Hargraves,
and Jill Finsten, of the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the daguerreotypes, small black-and-white photographs on
polished silver plates, have never been shown before, and a fair
number are brilliant and/or historic. The museum has also published
a book about its collection and the history of daguerreotypes,
``The Silver Canvas,'' by Bates Lowry and Isabel Barrett Lowry, who
are husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   On view is a gripping, anonymous portrait of Edgar Allan Poe
that prompted Poe to say on seeing it: ``My life seems wasted. The
future looks like a dreary blank.'' Seldom does a personality so
indelibly inscribe itself on a surface; seldom does a sitter allow
pain, perplexity, and defeat to register so clearly. Racked by
drugs and alcohol, Poe died four months after the picture was
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, is John Jabez Edwin Mayall's mammoth-plate image
(about 12 by 10 inches) of London's Crystal Palace in 1851, a grand
record of the first structure to enclose so large a space in glass
and metal. The building's size is made clear not just by a couple
of people in it but by one of the elm trees that soared beneath its
arched glass vault. At a time when technological advances flew so
fast that they jostled one another, this engineering feat so
impressed Prince Albert that he commanded Joseph Paxton, the
designer, to lead the opening procession, the only time anyone ever
preceded the queen.
</P>
<P>
   The Crystal Palace no longer exists. At the moment of its
demolition in 1941, this photograph acquired a new historic
importance. And as to history, photographers were already recording
what they knew to be important occasions _ in short, news _ on the
little slices of silver-coated copper that Daguerre prescribed.
Witness a picture at the Getty of a convention in Cazenovia, N.Y.,
in 1850, attended by Frederick Douglass, to protest the proposed
Fugitive Slave Law.
</P>
<P>
   Or a photograph taken in 1847 by Southworth and Hawes, the
Boston daguerreotypists, of one of the earliest operations using
ether. Eight doctors and an anesthetist in frock coats and vests
stand about an unconscious patient, their hands bare because the
transmission of disease and infection was not yet understood. The
daguerreotype, used primarily for portraits and requiring long
exposures and lots of light, was nonetheless pressed into service
for one of photography's great enterprises, the recording of events
the moment, or close to the moment, they happen.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Photography leaped into history just as the writing of history
was changing, and the new medium made a significant contribution to
that change. Historians in the 19th century increasingly relied on
primary documents, the lives of people from less-than-aristocratic
classes and direct observation. By the third quarter of the century
it was clear that eye-witness newspaper reporters had forever
altered a profession once modeled on Thucydides, Tacitus, and oral
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs were another reminder that drawings and written
accounts of the past were not necessarily accurate. Even history
painting as an idealized, generic summary of a major event, a genre
once the most revered of artistic categories, was giving way by
mid-century to more specific scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Photography in fact inaugurated a new kind of history, the
family history in picture form. Oh, royalty and the aristocracy had
had personal, rather limited pictorial histories _ a couple of
centuries of forebears looking cossetted and imperial on the walls
of the family manse. Photography gave the middle classes the family
album, but not until the late 1850s, when smaller and cheaper
photographs, like the cartes des visites, drove the
daguerreotypists out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty has an unusual collection of 92 daguerreotypes (29 are
on display) by a wealthy amateur, one Jean-Gabriel Eynard, who made
what amounted to a family album without an album. His servants
posed, his worldly goods and evidence of his achievements sat still
beside him when he took self-portraits, and children grew up before
his lens.
</P>
<P>
   Daguerre regarded the medium as an art, a claim disputed at the
time but hard to deny now in the face of the Getty exhibition. One
of its most artful images is a splendid bit of pornography entitled
``Two Nude Women Embracing'' by an unknown French photographer.
These full-frontal nudes, arranged with voluptuous grace, caress
and regard each other lovingly before a mirror that reflects the
back of one of them. The photograph belongs to the same realm of
erotica as Gustave Courbet's later painting of two intertwined
women, a triumph of fleshy luxury.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, daguerreotypes can be more ``artistically''
displayed in museums today than ever before; certainly the public
can view them in a way unanticipated by their makers. In their
heyday, in the 1840s and 1850s, there was both an intimacy and a
prologue attached to viewing daguerreotypes. Most plates, enclosed
in cases, were small enough to be readily held in the hand. The
viewer had to open the case, then turn the mirrored surface until
the light struck it at the proper angle, when the image
miraculously appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber optic technology has changed all that. Daguerreotypes can
now be temporarily removed from their cases and hung or propped in
glass display cases like small paintings, their images fully and
instantly visible. The only drawback is that they must sit a
certain distance behind the glass front of the case, making it is
impossible to scrutinize them through a magnifying glass as
19th-century viewers loved to do.
</P>
<P>
   When the daguerreotype was invented, it was one of those
discoveries that the world had indeed been unknowingly waiting for.
Lithography had already accustomed people to an abundance of
printed images. Science was depending ever more heavily on visual
evidence. Art was striving for the most exact realism possible.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences in Europe were enamored of illusionistic spectacles.
Daguerre, a painter and set designer before he succeeded in his
photographic research, had made an enormous reputation with his
Diorama, a theater that presented his large, elaborately devised
paintings. Through ingenious use of paint and light, these seemed
to change from day to night, from unpeopled to crowded.
</P>
<P>
   The daguerreotype, though smaller, devoid of color and reversed
(unless the lens was fitted with a reversing prism), was an even
more convincing illusion of reality. A pre-modern populace, already
yearning for a semblance of the world, rushed to embrace the new
invention.
</P>
<P>
   And embrace it the public did, in enormous numbers. Human beings
have reacted strongly to approximations of reality since an image
was first drawn on the wall of a cave, but by the time photography
became a practical matter, philosophy, culture, and technology had
combined to boost reaction to fever level. A burning need for the
kind of redactions of the world the new medium offered was
discovered as soon as the medium was. Image hunger is rather like a
tapeworm: once it gets into the system, it demands constant
feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new process of photography was fully understood, some
thought it must be magic. ``The Silver Canvas'' quotes an American
poet who, in 1840, longed to see the daguerreotypes that he thought
the sun had been taking since the dawn of the world, including
pictures of Adam and Eve strolling about the garden. He was doomed
to disappointment, and yet the sun would bring him amazing sights
he never would have seen by other means.
</P>
<P>
   It would bring them to us too, and with the aid of fiber optics
_ invention does go on _ some of those still appear in all their
miniature glory at the Getty right this minute.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the members of De la Guarda aren't hanging
around, they're yelling and bouncing off the wall. Literally. Most
of De la Guarda's ``Villa Villa,'' which opened on Tuesday at the
Daryl Roth Theater on Union Square, takes place with the performers
overhead, swinging from the ceiling while harnessed to long
tethers. First they appear as speeding shadows behind a ceiling
scrim, like celestial messengers whizzing across a fluorescent
firmament. Then dangling heads break through from above, and the
true mayhem begins.
</P>
<P>
   If the cast of ``Stomp'' reworked Cirque de Soleil in a mosh
pit, it might turn out something like ``Villa Villa,'' which was
first performed by De la Guarda in its home city, Buenos Aires. The
65-minute work is staged without a stage, as the audience stands in
a room like a crowd at a rock club; the music makes its way up to
rock-concert volume, moving from pearly New-Age prettiness to hints
of gamelans and African thumb pianos to pounding drums and howling
voices.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the cast joins the audience on the floor, dancing
to a big beat as if the space were a disco; women from the cast
also surf the crowd, held overhead like teen-agers at a
Lollapalooza Festival. Now and then, De la Guarda's crew herds
spectators out of the way to make room for a flying performer or
movable platforms, where water pours onto the performers (sometimes
spilling onto the audience) and cast members fling their bodies
against noisy sheet-metal floors as if they were on trampolines.
</P>
<P>
   With the tethers, the cast ignores gravity. Two women chase each
other up and around a vertical wall; two men race around a balcony
with their bodies parallel to the floor. A man and a woman, on
separate tethers, pursue each other in midair, finally holding
hands as their momentum carries them into a spinning circle; groups
mesh and metamorphose overhead. Troupe members are indefatigable
and apparently feel no pain. In one segment, a suspended woman is
slammed repeatedly into a wall of fabric, moaning a satisfied
``ah'' after each impact.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an underlying theme in ``Villa Villa,'' it's about
resilience. Most of the performers are dressed in business clothes,
and they're acting out high-speed, stylized, dimensionally skewed
versions of daily events: pursuit and cooperation, romance and
domination. And all it takes to survive in their whiz-bang universe
is the determination to get up afterward and keep on moving.

LONG BONDS DROP A FULL POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Giving back much of its previous day's gains, the
Treasury market on Tuesday posted one of its biggest one-day losses
in nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar weakened and overseas equity markets improved their
tone, so some traders moved from Treasuries into shares abroad.
However, domestically, equity prices were still under pressure, and
longer term, analysts expect Treasuries to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond dropped a full point to a price of 106 26/32,
sending its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, up to
5.65 percent, from 5.58 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Economic statistics released Tuesday point to a still vibrant
business advance and a lift in trend rate inflation, according to
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
Indeed, the 0.3 percent May rise in consumer prices unnerved many
market participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But while 0.3 percent may be an overstatement of the average
monthly increase in the CPI over the remainder of the year,'' he
said, ``at the same time, inflation is not likely to be as
favorable as the very tame 0.1 percent average of the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond yields are now in a new, lower range, but there is a
growing debate as to whether the long Treasury bond could move
below 5.50 percent on a sustainable basis with monetary policy on
hold and the Fed having a bias toward tightening, and yet without
any clear-cut evidence of a long-lasting slowdown in economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production was up 0.5 percent in May, and coupled
with some upward revisions to the prior two months it produced the
first rise in capacity utilization since November. Housing in May
remained healthy, although the level fell modestly from April.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate bond calendar is heavy. Among the large issues in
the pipeline is a $3.45 billion, eight-part offering Wednesday from
Niagara Mohawk Corp. that is rated speculative and is the largest
junk deal of the decade, second only to RJR Nabisco's $4 billion
plus in the 1980s, according to MCM Corporatewatch's Data Services.
</P>
<P>
   Price talk ahead of Niagara's megadeal has the yield spread over
Treasury securities with similar maturities ranging from 125 basis
points, or hundredths of a percentage point, for a one-year issue
to about 287.5 basis points for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds are expected to be used to help pay for a restructuring
plan for the Syracuse-based utility; the plan was approved earlier
this year by New York state regulators.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (New York) _ The Drama Dept.'s quite enchanting
resurrection of ``As Thousands Cheer,'' the 1933 Irving Berlin-Moss
Hart topical revue, which is at the Greenwich House Theater. A
topical revue that is still funny. By Vincent Canby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SIDE-MAN-THEATER (Undated) _ After toiling for 20 years not
exactly anonymously but far from the bright lights of fame as a
freelance journalist, stand-up comic, playwright, screenwriter and
movie director, nobody is more surprised to see ``Side Man,'' a
memory play about jazz performers, land on Broadway than its
author, Warren Leight, 41. In jazz parlance, sideman refers to a
musician who works for hire on band jobs, who knows the standards
by heart and who can solo dazzlingly but also blend in with an
orchestra's sound. By Steven Drukman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of some films and their
suitability for children. This week: ``The X-Files''; ``Mulan'';
``Six Days, Seven Nights''; ``Can't Hardly Wait'' and ``Dirty
Work.''
</P>
<P>
   SODERBERGH-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ When Lady Luck smiles on a
26-year-old first-time director, she doesn't take it kindly that he
ignores her and heads out on his own path. But now, at 35, after
five well-crafted bleak flops, Steven Soderbergh has returned to
knock on her door with ``Out of Sight,'' an upbeat romantic film
starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. By Jamie Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKE-SIGNALS-FILM (Sliammon Indian Reserve, British Columbia) _
The new movie in which Evan Adams, 31, an American Indian actor is
a co-star, ``Smoke Signals,'' opens Friday. It is funny and
complex, as well as poignant, casting a new light on the Indian
sensibility. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   UKRAINIAN-DANCE (New York) _ The last time the Virsky Ukranian
National Dance Company visited New York, in 1988, Ukraine was part
of the Soviet Union and the troupe was beholden to its Moscow
sponsors. That is, it was strongly encouraged to perform Russian
dances along with Ukranian ones. This week Virsky, one of the
world's premiere professional folk troupes, returns to New York for
three performances at City Center, on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday
as part of a 38-city North American tour. And this time all the
dances are Ukranian. By Terry Trucco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PHYLLIS-CURTIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Phyllis Curtin, the estimable
American soprano, is a singer who has achieved notable success and
respect throughout the field but never quite the recognition she
deserves. This neglect is even more striking in light of two new
releases from Video Artists International featuring Ms. Curtin
recorded live during her prime years, in the 1960s. By Anthony
Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   GENEVA-OPERA-HOUSE (Geneva, Switzerland) _ While other cities
have lost their beloved 19th-century opera houses in the wave of
overgrown performing-arts centers, the board of the opera company
here bucked the tide. At the same time that it took necessary steps
to preserve the Grand Theatre, Geneva's elegant opera house from
1882, it developed a second house in many ways as good as the old
one. By Paula Deitz.
</P>
<P>
   GABRIEL-FAURE-MUSIC (New York) _ Music tells no stories, but it
is a sign of human behavior. John Philip Sousa tells the world that
Americans want to make friends. The music of Gabriel Faure tells us
that the French are private, lonely, tender, furtive, wistful. Five
concerts of Faure's music at the Kaye Playhouse recently were
generously American, just as the music remained elusively French.
By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   PROKOFIEV-MUSIC (Undated) _ Today, as composers are being told
to be more popular, Sergei Prokofiev may re-emerge as a role model
for the young and ambitious. The composer of the ``Classical''
Symphony, ``Peter and the Wolf,'' ``Lieutenant Kije'' and ``Romeo
and Juliet'' knew a thing or two about popularity. By David Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RINGO-STARR-MUSIC (Undated) _ For a musician who was once part
of the most influential band in pop, spending more than a decade
rekindling a career must be an intensely frustrating business. But
listening to ``Vertical Man,'' Ringo Starr's 12th post-Beatles
studio album, one has to admire the cheerful industriousness with
which he has tried to recapture the success of his early hits,
``Ringo'' (1973) and ``Goodnight Vienna'' (1974). By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DAGUERREOTYPE (Undated) _ The daguerreotype is perhaps the most
rapidly accepted and disseminated invention in history. In 1839,
shortly after his process was announced to the world, Louis J.M.
Daguerre wrote an instruction manual. Within three months, 29
editions were published in six languages. Now, through July 12, the
J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, which owns one of the most
important daguerreotype collections in the world, has more than 125
examples from its holdings on view, as well as a display of studio
and darkroom equipment from the collection of Matthew Isenburg. By
Vicki Goldberg.

SPORTY SEBRING JXI CONVERTIBLE ROOMY ENOUGH FOR THE FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In just two years on the market, the Chrysler Sebring
convertible has become the best-selling open-top car in the nation,
commanding one-third of all ragtop vehicle sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   There's good reason for that. This is the only affordable
convertible that provides roomy, comfortable seating for up to four
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some of its competitors _ such as the Ford Mustang and
Chevrolet Camaro _ have back seats, but they're mostly for show.
The dog fits back there, but not people.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sebring, you can put the top down and take the family for
a ride around the block or across the country. It even has a
decent-sized trunk, another unheard-of attribute in the realm of
ragtops. There is enough room for a couple of full-size suitcases
packed for an extended vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The previous Chrysler convertible, the LeBaron, enjoyed limited
success because it, too, was roomier than the average topless car.
But the styling was rather boring.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for the Sebring, whose sleek curves give the car a
futuristic look. Inside and out, the car is elegant without being
ostentatious. The Sebring uses Chrysler's ``cab-forward'' design
that minimizes engine-compartment space while maximizing interior
volume.
</P>
<P>
   New for 1998 is the Limited edition ($27,390 plus
transportation), which we tested. This is the best-equipped of the
three Sebring convertible models; the others are the base JX
($20,575) and the midlevel JXi ($25,040).
</P>
<P>
   Limited models come with all of the JXi features plus a
2.5-liter, single-overhead-cam, V-6 engine with AutoStick
transmission; four-wheel antilock brakes; traction control;
chrome-plated cast-aluminum wheels; leather interior with woodgrain
trim; special instrument cluster with ``electroluminescent''
lighting, and ``Limited'' exterior badging.
</P>
<P>
   The Limited's engine is rated at 168 horsepower, compared with
150 horsepower for the JX's 2.4-liter four-cylinder. The four-speed
AutoStick transmission allows for either fully automatic operation
or clutchless manual shifting.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats are very comfortable; in the Limited,
there is a padded center console that doubles as an armrest.
</P>
<P>
   Also new for '98 is Chrysler's ``Smart Key'' security system,
which operates like General Motors ``Pass Key'' system. A computer
in the car reads a chip in the key, and if the two don't match, the
vehicle is electronically immobilized. This is in addition to the
standard remote-control security system that includes an alarm and
panic-button feature.
</P>
<P>
   Sebring convertibles also now come with the next-generation,
depowered air bags on the driver and passenger side.
</P>
<P>
   Although this car carries the same name as the Chrysler Sebring
Coupe, it is not the same car. To make the convertible roomy enough
for families, Chrysler built it on the platform of the midsize
Cirrus sedan, one of the roomiest vehicles in its class.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep prices affordable, Chrysler builds the convertibles
in Mexico. Even fully equipped, the Sebring is far less expensive
that some of its European competitors, including the Saab 900, BMW
323/328 and Audi Cabriolet.
</P>
<P>
   Performance is better than that of the typical family sedan,
even if it isn't up to the level of such competitors as the
Mustang, Camaro and Trans Am. This car handles well, acceleration
is more than adequate, and except for some shakes and shimmies on
bumps, the vehicles feels as though it is very solidly constructed.
</P>
<P>
   The AutoStick transmission lets the driver control the shifting,
but without the bother of a clutch. While in the manual mode, the
transmission eventually will shift on its own if the driver
forgets, however. That prevents inadvertent over-revving of the
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is well laid-out, with easy-to-read instruments and
easy-to-reach controls. The ride is remarkably quiet with the top
up; wind noise is very mimimal.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the top is easy _ just pop the two latches over the
windshield and push the electric top switch. The rear window is
glass, rather than cheap plastic, allowing for excellent rear
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Standard amenities included power steering, power windows and
door locks, power heated mirrors, air-conditioning, stainless-steel
exhaust, AM/FM/cassette stereo with six speakers (remote CD changer
optional), fog lights, power trunk release, tinted glass, cruise
control, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel and shift knob, and
intermittent wipers.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 19 miles per gallon in the city and
29 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 16 gallons of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   PORSCHE, VW SUV: Germany's Porsche and Volkswagen are teaming up
to design a high-end luxury sport-utility vehicle that will be
built as both a Porsche and VW model, the trade weekly Automotive
News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Code-named ``Colorado,'' the new SUV is expected to debut in
2002 with an $85,000 price tag for the Porsche version and $55,000
for the VW. That would make it the most expensive VW ever.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle is expected to have permanent all-wheel drive; the
VW will have either a 10- or 12-cylinder engine. Volkswagen will
build the vehicles, the magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
   SMOG-EATING RADIATOR: Volvo's all-new, 1999 S80 luxury sedan
will feature a radiator coated with a special metal catalyst that
is supposed to convert atmospheric ozone into oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called smog-eating radiator will add about $50 to the
cost of the vehicle, Volvo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As air passes over the radiator, the catalyst converts about 75
percent of its ozone _ the primary ingredient in smog _ into pure
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The new, full-size Volvo goes on sale in October. It replaces
the 960 model.

GRANDPARENTS HAVE IMPORTANT `WORK' TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mama Ruby died suddenly the year I moved to Sacramento. She was
84 and had lived a full life. But growing up, I never imagined
living out my own life without her.
</P>
<P>
   I think about her now, remembering those thick signature braids
on her head, her sense of humor, her heart, and I wonder how I ever
got this far without her.
</P>
<P>
   Never a day passes that I don't remember her, but I was reminded
recently of the important role she played in my life, the important
role all grandparents play. I've wished a thousand times we could
just sit and talk like old times. I wished my own daughters, Asha
and Jamila, could know such moments.
</P>
<P>
   They have only one grandparent, their father's mother, and she
lives miles away in Illinois. Although they talk by phone on a
regular basis and exchange gifts through the mail, they've seen her
only four, maybe five times in the nine years since Jamila was
born.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many children, their grandparents are either dead or
live too far away for regular visits.
</P>
<P>
   And so I was delighted to read that the Texas Department of
Protective and Regulatory Services recently launched a program to
fill that void.
</P>
<P>
   Young at Heart matches residents 55 and older to act as
surrogate grandparents to children at Tarrant County day-care
centers. They provide a wide range of services, including rocking
infants, reading stories, gardening and creating art and music.
</P>
<P>
   At ages 7 and 9, my daughters are too old to benefit from such a
program, but officials estimate that there are more than 265,000
Texas children in child-care facilities who can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to realize that children not only need homes
and good families, studies show that when an adult gives a child
one-on-one attention, it makes a huge difference in the way that
child grows,'' said Jennifer Clark, Tarrant County's project
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   By providing children with surrogate grandparents, officials
hope to enhance their self-esteem and promote healthy brain
development. They also believe that simple physical contact like
recognition, touching, hugging or a pat on the head gives a child a
sense of comfort and feeling of acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of Young at Heart also extend to its volunteers,
providing them the opportunity to feel needed, to the child-care
facility and even to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm just trying to do a little good, if I can,'' said
88-year-old Inetta Schnitzer. ``I love the youngsters, and they
seem to respond to the way I help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnitzer, who spends her time reading to 4-year-olds, is one of
two seniors who volunteer at Children's World in Arlington, said
director Sylvia Dougharty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children love her, and the parents just go crazy about
her,'' Dougharty said of Schnitzer, who has two grown grandchildren
of her own. ``We couldn't have asked for a sweeter person.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said that more seniors like Schnitzer are needed. To
date, only 10 have signed on with the program. There are about 90
child-care centers across Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to have at least two volunteers at each
center,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the program, interested seniors must undergo a
criminal background check and attend a 1 1/2-hour-long orientation.
Seniors interested in volunteering may contact Clark at 640-9600,
Ext. 2014.

RUMORS ABOUT WAYLON JENNINGS' RETIREMENT HAVE BEEN GREATLY
EXAGGERATED
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BC-WAYLONJENNINGS-CD) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it was just because Waylon Jennings' contemporaries
seemed to be in decline during the past two years: Carl Perkins
died, Johnny Cash was found to have Parkinson's disease, Merle
Haggard had heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   So where was Waylon?
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, doctors suggested he take some time off due to
health issues including diabetes and heart bypass surgery, both
dating to the '80s. So he did. And suddenly, the outlaw legend and
Buddy Holly protege became the object of speculation. Would he
retire? Was he dying?
</P>
<P>
   The talk is the only thing that's bothering him now, he says. He
has a new album, ``Closing in on the Fire,'' released Tuesday. He
turned 61 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hanging in there,'' Jennings said during an interview last
week from his Nashville office, miffed at the mention of that
R-word, ``retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to borrow a line from an earlier Jennings hit,
``Maybe I'm used, but baby, I ain't used up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings still intends to do the occasional show. But with the
new album; a voice-over for a Nickelodeon children's series, ``The
Angry Beavers''; the re-release of his '93 kids' album, ``Cowboys,
Sisters, Rascals &AMP; Dirt''; an appearance in a new
``Highwaymen''-based movie; and a collaboration with Jerry Reed,
Bobby Bare and Mel Tillis, Jennings isn't lacking for things to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a lot busier than I intended to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is on Ark 21, an independent, eclectic-format label
based in Sherman Oaks, Calif., after years on RCA Records and
shorter stints on other labels, including MCA and CBS/Epic.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Copeland, Ark 21 chairman, said Jennings is ``as vital and
interesting today as when he first started,'' and praised his new
album as ``one of the best he's ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes collaborations with Sheryl Crow, Travis Tritt, Marty
Stuart, Sting, Mark Knopfler and Jennings' longtime friend, Carl
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, too, seemed pleased with the project, which includes
five songs he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His other projects are quite eclectic:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Old Dogs'' with Jerry Reed, Bobby Bare and Mel Tillis, which
will be telemarketed: ``That could set music back 20 years. Shel
Silverstein wrote all the songs, so they're great songs, but I
wasn't there when they passed out the songs, so I got all the dirty
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``Highwaymen'' movie project, called ``The Long Kill,''
isn't a true ``Highwaymen,'' Jennings said, because Johnny Cash
didn't participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get killed early, and then do the narration,'' he said.
``Willie started in on me about five or six years ago about this. I
did a great dying scene _ just kerplunk, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cowboys, Sisters, Rascals &AMP; Dirt'': ``A lot of that stuff is
about myself, and a lot of it is about kids I've known.''

<P>
   Ten billion. It's a number that will forever be associated with
Michael Jordan, as much as his NBA championships and his scoring
titles and his MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has had a $10 billion impact on the U.S. economy since
joining the NBA in 1984, according to an article in Fortune
magazine that was cited by virtually every media outlet in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan. Ten billion dollars. Married forever.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of reminds me of the famous stat about the TV audience for
the Oscars. Every year, we're told ``one billion viewers worldwide
tuned in for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever questions that figure _ or at least nobody did until
earlier this year, when Buzz magazine did some digging and found
that even if the entire populations of every country that receives
the telecast were glued to the set, the number of viewers would
fall far short of the magic one billion figure _ which was
conceived by an exuberant publicist years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so what. The myth is too strong to kill.
</P>
<P>
   We love round numbers. If the economists commissioned by Fortune
to help them estimate ``The Jordan Effect''' had come up with a
figure of, say, $9.654 billion - well, that's just not as enticing
as 10 billion, is it? Why not round it off and attract even more
free publicity for your magazine?
</P>
<P>
   I envy their savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to theorize about something like the total economic
impact of Air Jordan is to engage in a kind of nebular hypothesis;
it's impossible to determine an exact figure. But sifting through
the lengthy article and the charts and figures, I came across a
number of eyebrow-raising elements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fortune adds up the profits of 70 Jordan-related
books, his sports videos, the cologne and underwear he endorses and
the worldwide box office and video totals for his movie ``Space
Jam,'' and they come up with a figure of $701 million.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously if you were to subtract the production and marketing
cost of the movie; the salaries of hundreds of employees who make
the underwear, print the books, etc.; and the costs of publishing a
book, among other expenses, the figure would be considerably lower.
</P>
<P>
   You could do the same thing with each category _ from NBA
attendance to the value of the Bulls' franchise to TV revenues to
advertising dough, and you'd end up with a much lesser figure. But
it wouldn't be as much fun if Fortune had said Jordan's net
economic effect was something like $3 billion or even less.
</P>
<P>
   One also has to consider that some player _ or, more likely, a
number of players _ would have generated some of the money
attributed to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   If we lived in a Michael-less world (perish the thought!), Nike
would have made someone else their prime star, and Warner Brothers
would have found some other athlete to star in a movie with its
cartoon characters, the league would have sold jerseys bearing some
other player's name and number, and sportswriters would have
written books about other athletes.
</P>
<P>
   (Heck, maybe there'd be a Zippy Pippy cologne inspired by
Scottie Pippen, who knows.)
</P>
<P>
   The point is, not every one of these dollars can be attributed
solely to the Jordan factor.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the negative financial impact Jordan has wrought?
Why, earlier this month a study was released saying that workplace
chatter about the Bulls could cost the Chicago-area economy alone
more than $90 million!
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolate those figures over the years and factor in the
nationwide work stoppages that occur because of conversation about
Michael, and he's probably cost the American workplace a few
billion, easily.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention all the players who have been driven to
unemployment ... after being embarrassed on the court by MJ. And
the local eateries that don't do as well because of the presence of
Michael Jordan's Restaurant. And the sneaker companies that have
had to lay off employees after being stomped on by the Air Jordan
line.
</P>
<P>
   Oh but wait a minute. We haven't factored in the increase in
sales at bars, restaurants, liquor stores, catering businesses,
etc., that occurs every time the Bulls play.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have we included the salaries of the people on Jordan's own
payroll, the profits of his own restaurants and golf centers, the
positive effect he's had on the sport of golf, the rise in sales of
shaving cream and razor blades now that millions are emulating his
chrome dome look...
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. Brain cramp! Upon further review, I've decided the $10
billion figure provided by Fortune is exactly right.

   Ten billion. It's a number that will forever be associated with
Michael Jordan, as much as his NBA championships and his scoring
titles and his MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has had a $10 billion impact on the U.S. economy since
joining the NBA in 1984, according to an article in Fortune
magazine that was cited by virtually every media outlet in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan. Ten billion dollars. Married forever.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of reminds me of the famous stat about the TV audience for
the Oscars. Every year, we're told ``one billion viewers worldwide
tuned in for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever questions that figure _ or at least nobody did until
earlier this year, when Buzz magazine did some digging and found
that even if the entire populations of every country that receives
the telecast were glued to the set, the number of viewers would
fall far short of the magic one billion figure _ which was
conceived by an exuberant publicist years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so what. The myth is too strong to kill.
</P>
<P>
   We love round numbers. If the economists commissioned by Fortune
to help them estimate ``The Jordan Effect''' had come up with a
figure of, say, $9.654 billion - well, that's just not as enticing
as 10 billion, is it? Why not round it off and attract even more
free publicity for your magazine?
</P>
<P>
   I envy their savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to theorize about something like the total economic
impact of Air Jordan is to engage in a kind of nebular hypothesis;
it's impossible to determine an exact figure. But sifting through
the lengthy article and the charts and figures, I came across a
number of eyebrow-raising elements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fortune adds up the profits of 70 Jordan-related
books, his sports videos, the cologne and underwear he endorses and
the worldwide box office and video totals for his movie ``Space
Jam,'' and they come up with a figure of $701 million.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously if you were to subtract the production and marketing
cost of the movie; the salaries of hundreds of employees who make
the underwear, print the books, etc.; and the costs of publishing a
book, among other expenses, the figure would be considerably lower.
</P>
<P>
   You could do the same thing with each category _ from NBA
attendance to the value of the Bulls' franchise to TV revenues to
advertising dough, and you'd end up with a much lesser figure. But
it wouldn't be as much fun if Fortune had said Jordan's net
economic effect was something like $3 billion or even less.
</P>
<P>
   One also has to consider that some player _ or, more likely, a
number of players _ would have generated some of the money
attributed to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   If we lived in a Michael-less world (perish the thought!), Nike
would have made someone else their prime star, and Warner Brothers

cartoon characters, the league would have sold jerseys bearing some
other player's name and number, and sportswriters would have

Scottie Pippen, who knows.)

</P>

   And what about the negative financial impact Jordan has wrought?
Why, earlier this month a study was released saying that workplace

STUDY SAYS CALIFORNIA STUDENTS FACE POLLUTION THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Industrial air pollutants expose half of
California's schoolchildren, including many in the San Francisco
Bay area, to chemicals known to cause cancer, respiratory illness
and other diseases, according to a new study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay-area refineries operated by Tosco Oil Corp. and Shell
Oil Co. have the largest amounts of particulate and gaseous
emissions in the state, and are within a mile of five Martinez
schools, according to ``School Haze: Air Pollution Near California
Schools'' prepared by the Environmental Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Working Group, a national organization,
analyzed 1995 reports to the Environmental Protection Agency and
school attendance records in doing its research.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that in Fremont, the New United Motor
Manufacturing Co. (NUMMI), which emits carcinogens, reproductive
toxins and heavy metals, is within a mile of nine schools. NUMMI is
jointly owned by the General Motors Corp. and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Both NUMMI and Tosco say the emission reports are correct but
question the number of schools listed as within a mile of their
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have continuously reduced our toxic air emissions,'' said
Stuart Rupp, manager of environmental affairs at NUMMI. ``We're
building a new paint shop, which is going to be using new
state-of-the-art equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would reduce the emissions at one of two shops by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our models show that the risk at our fence line from toxic
chemicals is less than 1 in 1 million,'' Rupp said.
</P>
<P>
   A Shell spokesman, Mark Hughes, called the study ``a contrived
report targeting Martinez.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2.8 million California children were enrolled in 4,293
schools within one mile of an industrial emitter of the chemicals,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children represented more than half of the
enrollment in some 9,700 public and private schools in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say children are more susceptible than adults to
environmental contaminants. Their bodies are growing rapidly and
sensitive organs and tissues are developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children eat proportionately more food, drink more fluids and
breathe more air per pound of body weight. They play outside more,
and are more exposed to environmental threats ... They crawl on the
ground and floor and expose themselves to different hazards,'' the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental organization said the state has failed to
adequately monitor pollution near schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few children _ about one in 25 _ attended schools covered
by the existing network of air pollution monitors,'' the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing network of 189 state monitors misses the great
majority of schools where proximity to known pollution sources puts
students at increased risk of exposure to air pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The group surveyed six different types of pollutants:
carcinogens, heavy metals, reproductive toxins, particulate matter,
nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   It posted the list of schools within one mile of 1995 emissions
on the Internet at www.ewg.org/risk.
</P>
<P>
   Tosco's refinery near Martinez is the largest source of nitrogen
oxide, sulfur dioxide and other particulates in the state, and, the
study said, is within a mile of an elementary and high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report said how much is emitted, but it doesn't address
the risk of what is a safe level. The federal EPA and the state Air
Resources Board are currently developing a nitrogen oxide rule
right now. They're doing air modeling and studying the data and
trying to determine the health effects of nitrogen oxides.'' Tosco
spokesman David Kory said.
</P>
<P>
   Kory said one listed in the study is 4 miles away from the
Martinez refinery, not a mile.

FILM FESTIVAL EXPLORES THE BANALITY OF EVIL
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JIM YARDLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Movies perform all sorts of back flips to shock
people these days, which makes an early scene in the documentary
``Gerrie and Louise'' notable for its understated horror. The
film's central figure, Gerrie Hugo, once a commander of a South
African hit squad, is discussing torture.
</P>
<P>
   It is late at night, and Hugo is talking to the camera. He has
exposed atrocities of the old South African government and married
a crusading reporter, Louise Flanagan. Dragging on a cigarette, a
little woozy from beer, Hugo is a charming rogue, and he knows it.
What is less clear is whether he is a man whose conversion can be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Seduced by the camera, he cannot help but laugh as he describes
his old life, how he once attached electrical wires to the teeth of
a black prisoner. Every jolt of electricity triggered a small
explosion in the man's mouth. The power, Hugo admits, was
intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person was so submissive,'' he says with an incredulous
smile, ``that I could do that with him and still talk to him
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Films often trivialize evil. What makes ``Gerrie and Louise''
and many of the other films shown at the Human Rights Watch
International Film Festival distinctive is how they often manage to
shock by depicting only human complexity and its ragged, sometimes
awful edges.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which is in its ninth year, began on Thursday and
runs until June 25 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center in
Manhattan. Featuring 33 films from 19 countries, the festival
offers documentaries, dramas and satires of wildly different scope.
``Rezistans,'' a sweeping political history of Haiti, lasts 156
minutes; ``Two and a Half Weeks in Paradise,'' about the
dispossessed in Siberia, lasts 10.
</P>
<P>
   Because its ambitions are artistic and political, the festival
suffers inherent burdens. How can you truly measure success? If, as
Abraham Lincoln suggested, ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' helped trigger the
Civil War, what should be expected of a movie like ``An Ordinary
President,'' a wicked satire of the current president of Belarus?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it can be measured with a measuring cup: whether
a dictator has been felled,'' said Bruni Burres, the festival
director. ``What we've said all along is that these films
inspire.'' Some of them ``get lost,'' Ms. Burres conceded. ``Some
sit on shelves. But a lot don't.''
</P>
<P>
   One that did not was ``Calling the Ghost: A Story About Rape,
War and Women,'' which had its premiere at the 1996 festival and
earned the top award, the Nestor Almendros Prize. The film,
produced and directed by Mandy Jacobson, is the story of two
Bosnian women, a lawyer and a judge, who were raped at Omarska, the
Serbian concentration camp, in 1991. It was not the sort of film
destined for movie houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We constantly have this struggle between those of us who are
making these movies and those who are controlling the outlets over
what it is people want to see,'' said Ms. Jacobson, who lives in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But after its festival premiere, the film attracted the
attention of Home Box Office, which showed it on Cinemax. The two
women, Jadranka Cigelj and Nusreta Sivac, accompanied the film on a
25-city U.S tour and showed it at the Council on Foreign Relations
to an audience that included Richard Holbrooke, the former Clinton
administration envoy to Bosnia.

`GH' RAISES MONEY ON-AIR FOR PEDIATRIC AIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR;  In less genteel circles, it's known as putting
your money where your mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   While the cast of ``General Hospital'' has been singing, dancing
and emoting on screen at the show's annual Nurses' Ball, a talent
show to raise money for the fictional hospital's pediatric AIDS
wing, the cast and crew of the show also have been raising money
off screen for real-life AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, ``GH'' has contributed more than $109,000
to the nonprofit Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in
Santa Monica, where it's been used for research and emergency care
for AIDS patients, said Doreen Lane, the foundation's special
events manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of daytime shows that do something to
recognize those with AIDS and HIV, but `General Hospital' went one
step further,'' said Lane. ``Worldwide, there are 1,600 children a
day infected with the AIDS virus, and we need all the help we can
to educate people and find a cure. `General Hospital' has been very
generous in helping us do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``GH'' is one of a dozen or more daytime serials and talk shows
that mark the nationwide Day of Compassion, an annual remembrance
of those who have died and those living with AIDS and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth annual Day of Compassion is Friday, the day the fifth
annual Nurses' Ball begins airing on ``GH'' and also _ for the
first time _ on its year-old sister show, ``Port Charles.'' The
second half of the ball airs Monday on both shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``GH'' executive producer Wendy Riche said the idea for the
Nurses' Ball came from her own desire to see cast members' usually
unseen singing and dancing talents showcased. The first ball, in
1994, was so successful with cast members and viewers alike, she
decided to make it an annual event, and to tie it to the Day of
Compassion.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising effort came later, after ``GH'' broke ground in
1995 with the first story line in which a teen-ager died of AIDS
and another was HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   While some viewers complained that the long-running story _
which let the disease play out in real time _ was depressing and
changed the channel, others were riveted to their television sets.
They watched as young street kid Stone Cates (played by Michael
Sutton), who picked up the virus during sex with an infected drug
addict, was diagnosed, fought the disease, and died.
</P>
<P>
   Days before his death, he learned that he had passed the virus
along to his girlfriend, young Robin Scorpio.
</P>
<P>
   On the show, Robin (played by two-time Emmy winner Kimberly
McCullough) has battled the disease with daily drug cocktails,
practiced safe sex with a new boyfriend and talked to other teens
about how to avoid disease transmission.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Sutton and McCullough appeared in an ``After
School Special'' teaching kids about how AIDS is transmitted and
can be avoided; both actors and ``GH'' have received several awards
from AIDS groups praising the show's responsible portrayal of
effects of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been approached a lot to do public service announcements
to teach people about AIDS and make appearances and things,'' said
McCullough. ``And any chance I get, I do them because it's so
important to fight this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-screen fight against AIDS became even more poignant when
at the 1997 Nurses' Ball, the real-life death weeks earlier of
AIDS-infected actor Jon Hanley, who had helped stage the annual
ball, was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The money ``GH'' donated to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation _
which has an annual budget of about $9 million _ came from
royalties from ``Robin's Diary,'' a fictionalized journal of
teen-age Robin, and from the mail-order sale of the same kind of
Nurses' Ball T-shirts worn on the show by cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to donate to pediatric AIDS causes came from our
hearts,'' Riche said. ``Everybody here feels so proud of the
opportunity to contribute through the Nurses' Ball. It's become a
very important week in the lives of the cast and crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the royalties from the book keep rolling in, T-shirt
sales were shelved this year because of the complexity of staging
the Nurses' Ball on not one, but two soaps, on two days. Viewers
get a bonus, though: three hours of the Nurses' Ball instead of the
usual two, plus events surrounding the ball on Thursday and next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's ball, where 19 blocks from the national AIDS
Quilt decorate the ballroom, there'll be the usual touching
speeches, on-stage high jinks and _ show sources hint _ some
surprises that could be ... well, murder for one guest.

 NEW YORK: to Bosnia. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These women were basically able to confront the politicians on
why they were not doing anything,'' said Ms. Jacobson. Eventually,
British forces patrolling Bosnia under auspices of the United
Nations captured two men accused of rape and other war crimes at
the camp.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ``An Ordinary President'' and its ebullient director,
Yuri Khashchevatsky, won the festival's Almendros Prize. It, too,
is enjoying an unusual influence at home. A humorous but pointed
satire of President Alexandr Lukaschenko of Belarus, the film
exposes his hypocrisy in promising to root out corruption as he
profits from it. By flashing images of Stalin, Khashchevatsky makes
clear what sort of president he considers Lukaschenko to be.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the film has been seen in Belarus only once. In
January 1997, a small cable station in a remote town showed a
bootleg copy. As the final credits were rolling, local and national
police kicked open the locked doors of the television station and
seized the movie. Lukaschenko promptly banned it. Several months
later, two men broke into Khashchevatsky's studio and beat him
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't take anything except my scripts,'' said
Khashchevatsky, speaking through a translator during an interview
in Manhattan. He believes his attackers were sent by the
government, he said, adding, ``I have no other hypothesis.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ban, Khashchevatsky said, the extensive black market
in Belarus, developed during the Soviet era, has allowed him to
distribute about 150,000 video copies of the film. He estimated
that 800,000 of the 10 million people in Belarus have seen it.
Street vendors, he said, often hugged him and gave him free
bananas. He said he had made the film as a rejoinder to what he
called the misleading propaganda disseminated by the government on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this duel, they chose their weapons,'' Khashchevatsky said.
``So I decided that my response would be through a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Khashchevatsky, who obviously enjoyed tweaking the president,
nonetheless described the political impact of ``An Ordinary
President'' as limited. Its success, he said, may come in helping
people in Belarus ``have the feeling of opposition, even if it is
unformed,'' but no more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be able to say that this film is leading
Belarus to a new era,'' he said. ``But it is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturla Gunnarsson, the Canadian who made ``Gerrie and Louise,''
had not produced a documentary in 10 years when he was drawn to
South Africa in 1996 by the wrenching spectacle of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission. Charged with unearthing the facts about
government-sponsored murders of black activists, the commission,
which is still operating, promised immunity from prosecution for
anyone who came forward.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued with ``the bad guys'' and fascinated with exploring
the depth of forgiveness in South Africa, Gunnarsson said, he
interviewed several former soldiers in the South African Defense
Force before realizing that Gerrie Hugo was his story. Hugo had
violated the sacred creed of covert soldiers by going public,
revealing the complicity of the white government in operations
against blacks. He had also married Ms. Flanagan, who had written a
litany of exposes about government-sponsored killings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flanagan's ability to love and forgive Hugo, and Hugo's
ambivalent feelings about his own past, drew Gunnarsson to them, he
said. ``He would tell me stories that would make me an
accomplice,'' Gunnarsson said of Hugo. ``He would make me laugh,
and then I would stop because he was telling me things that were
gross human-rights violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Khashchevatsky, whose film was aimed at his native
Belarus, Gunnarsson said he did not make his film for South Africa.
``Gerrie and Louise'' has been shown on Canadian national
television and on CNN. The film is to be shown in 30 countries, he
said, but not South Africa, because of disarray at the national
broadcasting agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although political change has already occurred in South Africa,
Gunnarsson said he hoped his film would continue to draw attention
to what Hannah Arendt called ``the banality of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``We all know these kinds of human rights violations go
on. We all know apartheid is an evil thing. There's no news there.
But I wanted to know how these things happen. How do ordinary
people get involved?''
</P>
<P>
   He felt that through Hugo, ``you could begin to understand these
horrors and how people could do them, and that they're not
monsters,'' Gunnarsson said. ``They're just like you and me. It
leads you to the conclusion that evil is part of the human
condition.''

   A Chinese teen-ager disguises herself as a boy to take her frail
father's place in the Emperor's ragtag army and save her country
from the rampaging Huns. Based on a legend from the Northern Wei
dynasty (A.D. 386-534), this animated feature is part

</P>
<P>
   On a South Seas vacation with her boyfriend (Schwimmer), a New
York magazine editor (Ms. Heche) is called to Tahiti for a photo
shoot. Hiring a puddle-jumper of an aircraft and its raffish pilot
(Ford), she sets off, but the two run into a storm and crash-land
on a gorgeous but remote outcropping. There, remarkably well
outfitted on such short notice, they battle pirates, dine on
peacock, jump off a cliff and take a shine to each other. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Pirates gun down a yacht owner and assault the
castaways, but the film is more a comedy than a thriller. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Some of the outfits qualify as near nudity. Ford and Ms.
Heche's romantic attraction, aside from a smooch in the surf,
doesn't progress beyond talk. Schwimmer's character, on the other
hand, has an all-night tryst with a resort ``it'' girl (Ms.
Obradors), though this, too, is only alluded to and not shown. &QL;

<P>
   It's the night of high school graduation, and what better way to
wrap up the four years than a party? In a blowout at the home of a
girl whose parents are out of town, jocks mingle with nerds, bimbos
with stoners, homeboys with science geeks.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the crush, Preston (Embry) nurses his unrequited love for
the ex-cheerleader Amanda (Ms. Hewitt) who has just broken up with
Mike (Facinelli), the big man on campus. Meanwhile, hardheaded
Denise (Ms. Ambrose) finds an unlikely romance with Special K, the
white homeboy. A good time is had by all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE A few harmless scuffles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Sex is the air they breathe, and while there isn't any per

preteen-agers will like losers who triumph and arrogant jocks who
get their comeuppance. &QL;

   PG-13 81 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two childhood pals (Macdonald and Lange) who have become losers
in adult life form a company that specializes in revenge for hire.
They are motivated by a need for $50,000 to pay a doctor with big
gambling debts (Chase) to move their belligerent, sex-obsessed old
father (Warden) to the top of a heart-transplant list. That leads
to a plot by an unscrupulous real estate developer (McDonald) to
drive the tenants from a property he covets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Frat boys are beaten, clubbed and kicked by the police,
apartments are destroyed, and a deadly off-screen gunfight is
punctuated by screams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX A suggestion of off-screen homosexual rape; non-sexual
scenes involving prostitutes; an old man's raunchy sexual
recollections, reading matter and loud yearnings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Some. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-12 Though the atmosphere throughout is tasteless, they
may respond to some sight gags. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP The low humor seems intended for undemanding
adolescent boys. A few unsophisticated members of this group may be
amused some of the time. &QL;

MAKING THE CASE FOR PROKOFIEV AS HEAVYWEIGHT CONTENDER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)  (David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in
Portland, Ore.)  
 (For release Sunday, June 21)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, as composers are being told to be more popular, Sergei
Prokofiev may re-emerge as a role model for the young and
ambitious. The composer of the ``Classical'' Symphony, ``Peter and
the Wolf,'' ``Lieutenant Kije'' and ``Romeo and Juliet'' knew a
thing or two about popularity. His innate sense of how to please an
audience brought him early fame and allowed his music to reach
millions for whom classical music, let alone most of its
20th-century varieties, was a closed book.
</P>
<P>
   His popular touch was also a curse, an unaccountable and
unreliable resource that enslaved Prokofiev to the adulation of
audiences and the whims of critics and commissars who could shape
an audience's opinions. Yet despite a half-century of overexposure,
at least of the warhorses, and critical condescension, much of
Prokofiev's large body of work continues to attract performers and
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an eardrum-shattering recording of the five piano
concertos, with Alexander Toradze as soloist and the Kirov
Orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev (Philips 289 462 048-2; two
CDs), reveals unsuspected depth and passion in a composer who has
been either loved or despised for his facility, charm and
unmistakable melodic flair.
</P>
<P>
   In many accounts of his life and work, Prokofiev appears like a
sleepwalker in a minefield, semiconscious about art and politics.
Contemporaries described him as both unintellectual and
unemotional. His judgments about other music were philistine and
self-serving. Like other composers who achieved early success,
Prokofiev could not deal with failure, and he disowned fine works,
like the Second Symphony and the Fifth Piano Concerto, which failed
to please critics.
</P>
<P>
   This apparent lack of artistic integrity was paralleled by
character flaws in his personal and political life, which continue
to shadow his reputation, if not his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The music, too, has a somnambulistic quality. The first five
symphonies, for example, seem to have been written by five
different composers unfamiliar with one another's works. At the
same time, all of his music possesses a strong personality, which
is clearly audible even in his earliest works. But personality,
like popularity, was an unearned gift that seemed to mystify the
composer.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange act of pre-emptive self-deconstruction, Prokofiev
enumerated the content of his small yet potent bag of tricks:
Classicism, motorism, lyricism and grotesquerie. To these may be
added three Prokofiev trademarks: the mocking march, the ironic
gavotte and the sour waltz. He returned to these formulas
throughout his life, as if they were talismans. But his writings
about his own music rarely touch on more complex issues of musical
construction or expression.
</P>
<P>
   Such symptoms of superficiality have hurt Prokofiev's critical
standing, which has declined sharply while Shostakovich's has
soared. In Richard Taruskin's book ``Defining Russia Musically,''
which brilliantly re-evaluates Russian music from Glinka to
Schnittke, Prokofiev is blown away in a couple of lines of
surprisingly conventional wisdom: ``It is utterly characteristic of
Prokofiev that beneath the clangorous surface there always lay a
simple harmonic design and a stereotyped formal pattern straight
out of the textbook.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Prokofiev was an insincere hack. He lacked the
inventiveness and finesse of Stravinsky, the tragic sense of
Shostakovich.
</P>
<P>
   The unflattering comparisons are hard to counter. Where
Stravinsky's music can turn on a kopeck, Prokofiev clumsily inserts
an eight-bar vamp to get from one idea to another, or just bring
the music to a full stop. And instead of the gut-wrenching
bleakness so often evoked by Shostakovich, Prokofiev's music, when
it is emotionally effective, tends to be poignant, as in the close
of the ballet ``The Prodigal Son,'' rather than cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   Today Prokofiev stands as an erratic lightweight, perhaps the
greatest second-rate composer of the century but second-rate
nonetheless, with a gift for narrative and mood that gave him
pre-eminence in the forms of the concerto, ballet and movie music,
where broad strokes count for more than finesse or profundity.
</P>
<P>
   Toradze and Gergiev clearly intend to challenge that image.
Particularly in the first two concertos here, Prokofiev emerges as
a heavyweight, a contender.
</P>
<P>
   This recording has been long awaited, or long dreaded, ever
since Toradze won second prize at the Van Cliburn Competition in
1977, apparently over the dead bodies of many jurors. In Joseph
Horowitz's 1990 book about the competition, ``The Ivory Trade,''
Toradze appeared as an anti-establishment hero. Horowitz praised in
particular the ``traumatic intensity'' of Toradze's performances of
Prokofiev's Second Concerto, and the aptness of that phrase is
borne out here.
</P>
<P>
   Toradze's controversial status has only grown since Horowitz's
book appeared. Many musicians roll their eyes at the mention of his
name; for others, he is the real thing, a performer who goes beyond
the notes. While Horowitz's praise may not have swayed critical
opinion, Toradze's close alliance with Gergiev, the hottest
conductor of the day, may force even those who have dismissed him
out of hand to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   In a typically cannibalistic feat of marketing strategy,
Polygram Classics has released the Toradze set almost
simultaneously with a bargain reissue of the highly praised 1975
recording of the five concertos by Vladimir Ashkenazy, with the
London Symphony conducted by Andre Previn (London 452 588-2; two
CDs).
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two sets can be put simply by noting
that for Ashkenazy the Third Concerto seems like the centerpiece of
the five, but Toradze, in his own booklet note, gives the Second
the highest rank. These two works are like biblical brothers: one
light, the other dark; one smooth, the other hairy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Third, Prokofiev sleekly updated the Romantic concerto.
The soloist is no longer a brooding poet weighed down by yearnings
and dreams but an Olympic athlete leaping over hurdles ever higher.
In the two recordings of the Third, Ashkenazy still wins a gold
medal, and Toradze fails even to place, or else seems to be staging
a counter-Olympics with different rules.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the welter of notes in the Third, Ashkenazy always finds
the music with limitless resources of touch and expression.

   310&AMP;ADD  AUDIT SAYS 1996 DEMOCRATIC
CONVENTION BROKE LEGAL LIMITS
 &HT;     By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic Party exceeded the legal spending
limit for its 1996 convention in Chicago by roughly $700,000,
according to federal audit reports released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In return for taking $12.4 million in public funds, the
Democratic and Republican parties each promised not to spend any
other money on operating expenses for their national conventions to
nominate presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Staff auditors for the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
reported that the Democrats went over the limit when they charged
the convention's long-distance and local phone bills to the city of
Chicago and a privately funded host committee.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors found documents indicating that city's taxpayers
paid $126,510 and the host committee funded by Chicago-area
companies and executives paid $600,325 in phone bills run up by the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The host committee was co-chaired by Chicago Mayor Richard
Daley's brother, William Daley, a first-rate fund-raiser who was
later chosen by President Clinton to be secretary of commerce for
Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll need some time to study the report before we can
comment,'' said Kip Kolkmeier, an attorney for the host committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll contest the assertions of the audit before the full
FEC,'' said Tony Wyche, spokesman for the Democratic National
Committee. ``We believe the expenses were properly paid for by the
Chicago host committee.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FEC approves the report, the debt-laden DNC _ which has
already returned $120,000 of the taxpayer funds it received for the
1996 convention _ would have to repay another $565,000 to the U.S.
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, after reviewing a similar audit, the commission
voted to require the Republican Party to repay $1.7 for similar
spending overruns during its 1996 convention in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties disputed the auditors' findings, and they
have numerous chances for appeals to the commission and the courts.
Campaign expert Anthony Corrado of Colby College said the process
may take years.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have spending limits, if they are meaningless?'' asked
another analyst, Herbert Alexander of Silver Spring, Md., who has
been studying convention financing since 1960. ``This time both
parties got caught on the question of limits by FEC auditors, and
that is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The limit was designed to minimize the chances that big donors
to convention funding could corrupt presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the auditors said that at both 1996 conventions, the host
cities and host committees, which legally spent millions of dollars
to prepare and equip the convention halls, also paid some of their
operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Any action on the report by the commission would require four
votes. Because one seat is vacant, the commission currently
consists of three Democrats and two Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting scheduled for Thursday to discuss the audits was
canceled because not all the commissioners would be present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party wants to pay off, because both parties have
debts,'' Alexander said. In the end, ``there will probably be a
stalemate'' on the commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrado said today's ``extravaganza-oriented'' conventions aimed
at a television audience cost more than the old-fashioned
conventions, which were conducted for the benefit of party
activists within the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, conventions didn't have a wall of video monitors or
interactive capabilities or satellite linkages that let people at
the conventions be interviewed live by their home-town TV
stations,'' Corrado said.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC TO BUY PFIZER VASCULAR UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp. will spend $2.1 billion in cash to buy
the vascular devices unit of Pfizer Inc., outbidding several
competitors to gain a major market position in products used to
clear clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The sale follows Pfizer's decision in February to sell or spin
off its medical products businesses &UR;  &LR; and focus on its
pharmaceutical products, which include Viagra, the best-selling
male impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The unit, Schneider Worldwide, sells surgical stents, the
scaffolding used by physicans to prop open arteries, and
artery-clearing devices used in a procedure known as balloon
angioplasty. Such products are gaining in popularity because they
are used in minimally invasive procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is Boston Scientific's largest since early 1995,
when it began buying smaller marketers &UR;  &LR; of minimally invasive
surgical devices. With Tuesday's purchase, Boston Scientific has
spent $5.6 billion on 11 companies since early 1995, said Lawrence
C. Best, the Natick, Mass. company's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to like the deal. Boston Scientific shares
closed at 62 3/4, up 1 3/4, while Pfizer shares also rose 1 3/4 to
close at 109 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Schneider Worldwide had sales of $330 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some Wall Street analysts said that Boston Scientific was
paying a steep price _ more than six times sales _ to expand into
the stent market, but that the move was worth it. The stent market
is growing quickly, with a variety of American and foreign
competitors, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston Scientific had a choice: either pay more or get left
behind, so they had to suck it up and pay what looks like a big
price for Schneider,'' said Daniel T. Lemaitre, managing director
and medical device analyst at Cowen &AMP; Co. ``I think they did the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Boston Scientific, which hopes to get government &UR;  &LR; approval
of an internally developed stent next month, the Schneider purchase
provides a new technology, more than a dozen patents, and entry
into the growing cardiovascular stent market.  &UR;  &LR;  A key Schneider
product, called the Wallstent, &UR;  &LR; accounts for more than $100 million
of the unit's annual revenue. It is a tube inserted into patients
with clogged arteries in areas such as the groin, neck, and
kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Best said he expects Schneider's sales to jump to $500 million a
year in 1999, with 30 percent operating margins.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Boston Scientific outbid rivals, but
declined to name them. Earlier this month, several Wall Street
analysts said Boston Scientific was competing against several
companies including Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc. of Santa
Rosa, Calif., a leading stent developer.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider &UR;  &LR; employs about 2,200 worldwide, including 1,200 in the
United States. &UR;  &LR; Its global headquarters are near Zurich, with US
operations based in Plymouth, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can bring costs in the overall stent market down
and help bring the product costs of the medical procedure down,''
said Best.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, he added, will be dilutive to Boston
Scientific's 1999 earnings by as much as five cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boston Scientific earned $139.3 million, or 72 cents
a share, on revenue of $1.87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the $2.1 billion purchase, Best said, Boston
Scientific will borrow about half the total, with the balance split
equally between a forthcoming convertible debt offering and a
common stock sale planned later this year.

 UNDATED: and expression.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toradze's Third often sounds like a willful parody. Everything
is exaggerated. Passages marked forte or even mezzo forte are
pounded out fortissimo, and climactic moments threaten to split the
soundboard if not the keyboard. Allegro passages are played presto;
andante seems to mean adagio. Much of the passage work, so
carefully articulated by Ashkenazy without in any way damaging the
propulsive energy of the music, is either blurred or crassly
unshaped.
</P>
<P>
   Toradze seems to be giving a lesson in how not to play the
piece, or he is suggesting, unconvincingly, that the piece is not
the genial fingerfest that audiences usually take it for.
</P>
<P>
   Toradze's frantic travesty of the Third Concerto becomes more
comprehensible in light of his account of the Second, a work better
suited to his Romantic personality. In his notes, he explains that
the Second Concerto commemorates Prokofiev's friend Maximilian
Shmitgoff, the object of one of the composer's few profound human
attachments, who killed himself in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Toradze describes the piece as a tone poem that follows
Shmitgoff from the cradle to the grave. In this work Prokofiev not
only memorialized his friend but also, according to Toradze,
revealed a passionate and tormented soul, which he kept hidden in
most of his other music.
</P>
<P>
   This reading may seem naive, but it points to strengths in the
music that are often ignored. Prokofiev may not have constructed
music with Stravinskian precision, but he knew how to tell a story.
Whether or not the Second is a portrait of Shmitgoff, it turns its
soloist into a tragic protagonist who traces an emotional arc from
brooding melancholy to rage and finally to acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   In Toradze's hands the music is an epic shriek, which Prokofiev
amplifies in two huge piano solos that build up to the outer limit
of what a performer and an instrument can project, and beyond.
Typical of Prokofiev, these solos are not carefully nuanced. They
owe their power to sheer relentlessness, pushing performer and
listeners to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Toradze does nothing to disguise the music's cruelty; he
embraces its excesses with an over-the-top performance of an
over-the-edge concerto. The Second here seems to witness a horror
larger and fiercer even than the death of a dear friend; it earns a
place among the great tragic utterances of the century, like
Mahler's Sixth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Toradze and Ashkenazy shed contrasting lights on the other
concertos as well. Prokofiev wrote his First Piano Concerto when he
was just 21. Its audacity made him famous overnight. In Toradze's
hands the work is not just impetuous but also visionary. As he does
with the Second Concerto, he exploits the work's apparent weakness,
its obsessive restatements of its main theme, and turns it into a
strength, a statement of youthful fervor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, both Toradze and Gergiev snooze through the Fourth
Concerto, a work for left hand only, written, like Ravel's Concerto
in D, for Paul Wittgenstein, who refused to play it. Toradze's
unfocused reading seems to confirm Wittgenstein's judgment, but in
Ashkenazy's recording, with its greater sense of line, the piece
seems richer in emotional contrasts and far more adroit in
construction than any of its predecessors. Here Prokofiev was
already far along a path that took him beyond the bad-boy pose that
sparked the first three concertos.
</P>
<P>
   The later, Soviet, Prokofiev, is an even greater mystery than
the fledgling composer. Suddenly the crass young charmer began to
compose profound music, like the first Violin Sonata and the Sixth
Symphony. But these works were strewn, as if randomly, among more
typical crowd-pleasers like the Second Violin Concerto, the Fifth
Symphony, and a long list of Stalinist potboilers, the terra
blessedly incognita of the composer's output.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics today may wonder whether the heavier late works
are only superficially deep, the greatest Soviet artists took them
most seriously. While both Toradze and Ashkenazy reveal appealing
aspects of the Fifth Concerto, you have to hear the recently
reissued recording by Sviatoslav Richter, with the Warsaw National
Philharmonic conducted by Witold Rowicki (also from Polygram, on
Deutsche Grammophon 449 744-2; CD), to appreciate the much greater
economy, inventiveness and emotional complexity that Prokofiev
achieved as he turned 40. The awakened sleepwalker now commands
every second of the music.
</P>
<P>
   On the same disk, Richter performs the Eighth Piano Sonata, an
artistic peak before which every critical reservation you might
have about Prokofiev simply collapses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hazards of being popular is the illusion of intimacy.
Balletomanes and basketball fans put themselves on a first-name
basis with stars they have never met. Because Prokofiev was
popular, we may think we know him, but like Gershwin, he was a
master of disguise, even when he appeared to be most forthright.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes he gave away for his own work, the naive belief in
Classical forms, the apologies for stylistic sins may all have been
smoke screens, designed to make him look like a sleepwalker when he
was, in fact, a great chess player whose next move no one could
predict. We have not yet taken the full measure of the man or his
music.

DISINVITATION ASIDE, JUSTICE THOMAS VOWS TO ADDRESS BLACK LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The afternoon of July 29 in Memphis could prove an
exquisitely interesting if awkward moment; Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas has told the National Bar Association that he
intends to deliver a luncheon speech at its annual convention, even
though he has received a subsequent letter from some members
withdrawing the original invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of the National Bar Association, the nation's
largest group of black lawyers, have said that Thomas has told them
he expects to give his speech that day and does not accept the
legitimacy of the letter disinviting him.
</P>
<P>
   The members, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that
Thomas told them he was undeterred by a letter he received this
month withdrawing the invitation because the people who wrote it
were not those who first invited him.
</P>
<P>
   The passions aroused by the invitation to Thomas, a conservative
who has been an outspoken opponent of affirmative action,
demonstrate the strong feelings that he still evokes among fellow
blacks since his contentious confirmation hearings in 1991. His
determination to appear suggests, his supporters in the association
said, that he is ready to do battle with his opponents on the issue
of whether he should be denied a platform for his views.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also told the members that he had received many requests
from other members of the bar association urging him to keep his
scheduled appearance and defy his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas originally accepted an invitation to speak to the
17,000-member organization that was tendered early this year by
Justice Bernette Johnson of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Justice
Johnson is the current head of the association's judicial council,
a division composed of about 840 blacks who are present and former
judges on federal, state and local courts.
</P>
<P>
   But the invitation provoked a strong reaction among the judicial
group's 25 board members after they learned about it. Those members
then voted overwhelmingly to withdraw the invitation and send
Thomas a letter on June 4 doing so.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter contained several messages and a mixed signal.
While asserting that the executive council had withdrawn the
invitation, the letter also noted that Justice Johnson dissented
and believed the invitation could not be withdrawn without her
assent.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Thomas nor Justice Johnson would comment Tuesday. &QL;

US LOSS NO EMBARRASSMENT, BUT A LETDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It wasn't anywhere near as bad as it was the last time
the US men's soccer team played a World Cup opener in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Czechoslovakia in 1990 was a complete embarrassment,''
recalled midfielder Tab Ramos Tuesday. ``We got hammered. It was
5-1 and it could have been worse.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it was only 2-0 against a team of Germans who could be
holding the Cup over their heads next month. But what bothered the
Americans after they'd slept on Monday night's loss at the Parc des
Princes was (itals)how(unitals) they'd lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing to Germany in itself isn't a disgrace,'' said Alexi
Lalas. ``Lots of great teams have lost to the Germans. But the way
we lost, we feel we let ourselves down.''
</P>
<P>
   Up against the seasoned European champions, who've won three
Cups and reached five of the last eight finals, the Americans came
out timid and tentative. When Andreas Moeller squeezed a header
between Mike Burns and the goalpost in the ninth minute, they were
in shock. By the time the US began coming forward and creating
chances in the second half, the Germans were well in command.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks didn't cave and they didn't quit, but they didn't show
the world what they wanted _ that their second-round effort last
time wasn't just a matter of California home cookin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to win the World Cup, because we know that's
not going to happen,'' said Ramos. ``But we wanted to show we've
improved, and I don't think we did a good job of that. We looked
more like the 1990 team than the 1994 team _ and that's not
acceptable. I'll be honest with you: If we don't play better
against Iran, we're not going to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans can't beat the Iranians in Lyon Sunday, they're
finished and they admit it. And unless they win by at least two
goals, they could lose out on goal differential if they tie the
Yugoslavs in the group finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play for 3 points from the first second,'' said
coach Steve Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   So he's shaking up his lineup to get more scoring punch,
starting at least two of the three men he brought off the bench
against the Germans. Ramos, finally back in peak form after tearing
up the same knee twice in less than a year, will replace Ernie
Stewart in the midfield. And midfielder Frankie Hejduk, who had the
Americans' only serious scoring chance against the Germans with a
diving header, will step in for Burns.
</P>
<P>
   And though Sampson wouldn't say so Tuesday (``Nothing is for
sure yet''), odds are he'll start Roy Wegerle instead of Eric
Wynalda at striker in his 3-6-1 formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Iran, we have to put people on the field who will
attack and get behind their defense,'' said Sampson, who yanked
Wynalda in the 64th minute after he'd failed to strike sparks.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have never lit up the scoreboard (they produced
only one goal from the run of play in the 1994 Cup), but they've
been barren since their 3-0 demolition of Austria in April,
suffering shutouts in three of their last four matches.
</P>
<P>
   They had no illusions about beating the Germans, but what
bothered the Americans Tuesday was that they'd sat back until they
were in extremis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we started out playing for a 0-0 tie,'' said
midfielder Chad Deering. ``The first 15 or 20 minutes, we were
asleep out there. We put ourselves back on our heels and punished
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Moeller's goal had much to do with that. ``It changed the entire
dynamics of the game,'' said Sampson. But so did the mugging that
man-marker Jens Jeremies did on US playmaker Claudio Reyna all
night.
</P>
<P>
   After kneeing Reyna in the kidneys in the first 30 seconds to
leave a calling card, Jeremies knocked him off the ball every time
Reyna touched it. When none of his mates stepped up to take over
(until Ramos came in 20 minutes from time), the US attack went
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch Eurosport and they say, `Here's the best
scoring chance for the Americans in the first half,' and it's like
a cross from 30 yards out,'' mused Ramos, ``you know you've got a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While they would have liked to produce some decent film
highlights, the Americans are still where they figured they'd be
after one game _ 0-1 and probably needing to beat Iran, 2-0, and
tie Yugoslavia to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of us talked about it ... and said, `You know, we
could have played well and still lost, 3-0,''' said Ramos. ``We
lost to the Germans. So what? Everybody loses to the Germans. Let's
forget about it and think about Iran.''

POLL SHOWS BAY STATE ECONOMY OVERSHADOWING CHILD POVERTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A recent public opinion poll has found that
Massachusetts residents seriously underestimate the number of
children who are living in poverty in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 408 residents, only 24 percent correctly placed
the number of poor children under age 18 here at 200,000. Forty-one
percent guessed the number was much lower.
</P>
<P>
   Jetta Bernier, executive director of the Massachusetts Committee
for Children and Youth, said the overall optimism created by the
robust economy seems to be obscuring public awareness of the extent
of child poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a sense we are all doing pretty well,'' said
Bernier. ``But there is a population of children being left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for the Massachusetts Committee for
Children and Youth's Campaign for Children, a grassroots advocacy
organization, to gauge public attitudes on issues of child welfare.
The poll was conducted in March by DiNatale and Hock Research and
has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also measured public sentiment toward various proposals
for improving children's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When it comes to child sex abuse, most residents polled
favored tougher punishment _ the death penalty, longer prison
sentences and lifetime parole _ for both adult and adolescent
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant portion, 40 percent, still saw comprehensive
treatment as the best way to stop children from sexually abusing
other children. By contrast, only 20 percent believe treatment
would be effective for adult offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Latham, a forensic psychologist who works with violent
juveniles and child sex offenders, said the tendency by politicians
in recent years has been to emphasize punishment over treatment for
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the poll shows, as previous studies have, that a large
portion of the public believes that the younger an offender is, the
more effective treatment tends to be, Latham said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents surveyed said that they favored other measures that
could improve the lives of poor children and their families, even
if it meant the state or businesses would have to spend more money.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent indicated that they would be very supportive
of a law increasing the minimum wage by 50 cents per hour and
indexing the minimum wage to inflation; 62 percent favor a law
expanding after-school care for children from low- and middle-
income families; and 60 percent support a law guaranteeing child
care for all low-income families with at least one person working.
</P>
<P>
   There was less enthusiasm for other proposals. Fifty-five
percent said they would strongly back a law guaranteeing home
visits for all newborns of parents under age 21; 51 percent
supported a law that would require companies to pay the same
salaries to permanent and temporary workers who do the same job;
and 21 percent indicated strong support for a law providing public
assistance to families who pay more than 10 percent of their income
on property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Kay Khan (D-Newton), a member of a legislative
group pushing these and other proposals as part of a ``working
families agenda,'' said the poll results will unlikely sway any
votes in the Legislature, but were nevertheless heartening because
``it seems that people are becoming more sympathetic'' to the poor.

WIDENING THE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the Supreme Court to Congress, 'tis the season
to pick on the poor _ legally, economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of the current governmental retreat from major
efforts to help those Americans left behind in an affluent society
will be painful, both for individuals and the country.
</P>
<P>
   The morality and decency for which politicians crusade so loudly
these days should include public compassion for the least
advantaged among us. But that quality seems to be in distressingly
short supply.
</P>
<P>
   In this conservative era, extending a state-sanctioned helping
hand has become an unfashionable concept, except in President
Clinton's small progressive inner circle. Instead, poor folks are
supposed to learn responsibility by helping themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When a majority of the nine Supreme Court justices ruled Monday
that states can no longer finance legal services for the poor their
customary way, the clear suggestion was that the next step may be
to declare the programs themselves unconstitutional. A lower court
was left to deal with this prospect for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its inconclusive nature, the ruling is a serious blow to
lower-income families who cannot afford a lawyer to help with
common legal questions, from figuring out complicated Social
Security forms to disputes with landlords. Access denied is
inevitably justice denied.
</P>
<P>
   Through the now-discredited system, state programs annually
generated $100 million nationwide toward legal assistance for poor
clients. The money was supplemented at the federal level by the
Legal Services Corp, which has a budget of $283 million _ peanuts
on the scale of most government spending.
</P>
<P>
   If the state programs go, LSC is likely to go too. It is
something of a political miracle that it is still breathing at all.
Conservatives have been trying for two decades to kill it off. At
every opportunity they slash its budget further.
</P>
<P>
   The LSC got in trouble because its original goal of giving
indigent individuals access to the judicial process sometimes
segued into class-action suits seeking to transform public policy
affecting the poor in general. And some of the powerless people it
sought to help with taxpayer-financed legal advice, such as
undocumented immigrants, were not popular with those who like the
established order.
</P>
<P>
   From Capitol Hill, there is bad news for low-income families as
well. Senate and House Republicans are espousing tax revisions that
benefit the rich at the expense of the poor, targeting for budget
cuts major programs aimed at the poor and proposing to repeal
altogether certain benefits, such as some food stamp entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   This assault on the weakest Americans is cloaked in language
pandering to the strongest Americans, those with ample money to buy
advantages for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are differences in the Senate and House budget resolutions
that remain to be reconciled, and the president's veto threat hangs
in the air. Some proposals are still the whims of conservative
presidential and congressional candidates. But the trend is clear.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed flat tax would greatly lower the burden on the
wealthiest folks but increase proportionately that on middle- and
lower-income families. It is described as merely a desirable
simplification of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Block grants passing along to the states the governmental duty
to provide for the public good _ for programs such as
welfare-to-work _ are being funded at lower levels than when the
programs were a federal responsibility. The House budget projects
$10 billion over five years in Medicaid cuts, to be achieved under
cover of converting Medicaid, formerly a federal-state
responsibility, to block grants administered by the states.
Cost-cutting, however, is not acknowledged as the goal. Returning
power to local government is the theme.
</P>
<P>
   A move to slash food stamps for legal immigrants was defeated,
but other cuts in those benefits for the poor in different
categories are included in the new federal budget passed by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Estate and capital gains tax cuts in both House and Senate
budgets would primarily benefit only the very richest folks.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the House budget the earned income tax credit
for low-income working families would be reduced for those with
children and totally eliminated for those without children.
</P>
<P>
   This is in addition to the heavy hits that programs for
low-income individuals and families have already taken. According
to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis, 93 percent of
the mandatory program reductions enacted in the last Congress were
in those for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   To counter this tilt against low-income families, Congress is
peddling some legislative alternatives that are supposed to
compensate a bit. The favorite is to create vouchers so poor
parents can send their children to private and parochial schools, a
constitutionally questionable notion that Republicans keep trying
to slip into legislation in various guises.

   1STLEDE-310&AMP;ADD  AUDIT SAYS 1996 DEMOCRATIC
CONVENTION BROKE LEGAL LIMITS
 &HT;     Restores dropped word to make it ``$1.7 million'' in graf 9.
 &HT;     By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic Party exceeded the legal spending
limit for its 1996 convention in Chicago by roughly $700,000,
according to federal audit reports released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In return for taking $12.4 million in public funds, the
Democratic and Republican parties each promised not to spend any
other money on operating expenses for their national conventions to
nominate presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Staff auditors for the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
reported that the Democrats went over the limit when they charged
the convention's long-distance and local phone bills to the city of
Chicago and a privately funded host committee.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors found documents indicating that city's taxpayers
paid $126,510 and the host committee funded by Chicago-area
companies and executives paid $600,325 in phone bills run up by the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The host committee was co-chaired by Chicago Mayor Richard
Daley's brother, William Daley, a first-rate fund-raiser who was
later chosen by President Clinton to be secretary of commerce for
Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll need some time to study the report before we can
comment,'' said Kip Kolkmeier, an attorney for the host committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll contest the assertions of the audit before the full
FEC,'' said Tony Wyche, spokesman for the Democratic National
Committee. ``We believe the expenses were properly paid for by the
Chicago host committee.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FEC approves the report, the debt-laden DNC _ which has
already returned $120,000 of the taxpayer funds it received for the
1996 convention _ would have to repay another $565,000 to the U.S.
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, after reviewing a similar audit, the commission
voted to require the Republican Party to repay $1.7 million for
similar spending overruns during its 1996 convention in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties disputed the auditors' findings, and they
have numerous chances for appeals to the commission and the courts.
Campaign expert Anthony Corrado of Colby College said the process
may take years.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have spending limits, if they are meaningless?'' asked
another analyst, Herbert Alexander of Silver Spring, Md., who has
been studying convention financing since 1960. ``This time both
parties got caught on the question of limits by FEC auditors, and
that is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The limit was designed to minimize the chances that big donors
to convention funding could corrupt presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the auditors said that at both 1996 conventions, the host
cities and host committees, which legally spent millions of dollars
to prepare and equip the convention halls, also paid some of their
operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Any action on the report by the commission would require four
votes. Because one seat is vacant, the commission currently
consists of three Democrats and two Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting scheduled for Thursday to discuss the audits was
canceled because not all the commissioners would be present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party wants to pay off, because both parties have
debts,'' Alexander said. In the end, ``there will probably be a
stalemate'' on the commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrado said today's ``extravaganza-oriented'' conventions aimed
at a television audience cost more than the old-fashioned
conventions, which were conducted for the benefit of party
activists within the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, conventions didn't have a wall of video monitors or
interactive capabilities or satellite linkages that let people at
the conventions be interviewed live by their home-town TV
stations,'' Corrado said.

STITH FACES SENATE PANEL ON AMBASSADORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Charles R. Stith, the Boston civil rights
activist, moved a step closer Tuesday to becoming US ambassador to
Tanzania after appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Stith and 14 other ambassadorial nominees must wait for the
official committee vote on the nominations and for final Senate
approval. The next committee meeting has not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, it looks good. President Clinton nominated Stith for
the diplomatic post in March, and Senators John F. Kerry, a member
of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Edward M. Kennedy said
Stith is well-suited for the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend Stith has been dedicated to working for the
betterment of the dispossessed and disenfranchised in Boston, where
he ministered with spirit,'' Kerry said. ``It is most appropriate
that the president has nominated him to go to a country where he
can use his skills to help the people of Tanzania.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who introduced Stith at the hearing, also applauded
Stith's community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend Stith has worked tirelessly to develop ties between
Boston's African-American community and the city's business
leaders,'' he said. ``Boston is proud of him, and so am I.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith said he is eager to begin working to help Tanzania raise
its standing in the world market. Tanzania, which has a population
of about 29 million, is one of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tanzania is a valuable part of the administration's efforts to
forge new partnerships in Africa,'' Stith told the committee. ``It
is one of the most respected states in Africa and a longtime leader
in the international Non-Aligned Movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostonians know Stith for his flair in sermons and for his
leadership in civil rights issues. Stith was pastor of the Union
United Methodist Church in Boston for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Stith, who is national president for the Organization for a New
Equality, has said that if he becomes an ambassador he will resign
from the national nonprofit group, which helps economically
disadvantaged people. He also plans to step down as an advisory
board member of Fleet Financial Services Corp. and as director of
West Insurance Agency, both in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am new to the foreign service of the United States, but I am
familiar with the world of personal diplomacy and public service,''
Stith said. ``With the assistance of the United States and the
international community, I believe Tanzania can break the cycle of
poverty, which ensnares most of its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith, who helped build churches in Kenya as a college student,
said what he learned about African people when he lived there would
help him as ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by the many commonalities between Africans and
Americans, and I was inspired to enter the clergy as a means of
unlocking the human potential, which all people carry inside,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the nomination goes through as expected, Stith said he plans
to move to Tanzania's capital of Dar es Salaam by Labor Day. His
wife, Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith, an associate dean at the Harvard
School of Public Health, will also move but said she will probably
travel between the United States and Africa the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Stith said his children, Percy and Mimi, will attend college in
Tanzania.

OPEN DISPLAYS OF CHRISTIAN WORSHIP FLOURISHING IN CHINA

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANJING, China _ New Bibles stream forth from a computerized
printing press in this onetime southern capital at a rate of two
and a half million a year, for sale to Christians all over China.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening in 1988, the publishing company, a joint venture
of the government-approved Protestant Church and a global charity,
United Bible Societies, has shipped out 18 million inexpensive
Bibles, an astonishing turn in a country that only 25 years ago
tried to stamp out religion for good.
</P>
<P>
   The Bibles are quickly bought and eagerly used. In downtown
Nanjing on any Sunday morning at St. Paul's Church, one of the
city's seven legal Protestant churches, the pews overflow with more
than a thousand worshipers at each of two services, while hundreds
more watch from another building on closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   With hymns, a sermon and closing recitation of the Lord's
Prayer, the services here and at thousands of other churches around
the country have the rhythms of mainstream Protestant services
anywhere. Like many urban churches, this one has a preponderance of
older women, some of whom were Christian before the Communist
takeover in 1949, but around the country many men and women, young
and old, are embracing Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Such open, joyous displays of worship were unusual in the 1950s,
as the Communists reshaped China, and unthinkable during Mao's
Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976, when churches were burned and
those Christians who were not jailed could only hold clandestine
prayer meetings, and dared not own a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Bibles flow and churchgoers worship, at least scores
of Protestant and Catholic leaders live in labor camps or jails for
refusing to bow to government control. While the confirmed number
of imprisoned Christians appears to be lower than is often asserted
abroad, their travails are a telling sign that religion here is not
truly free.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, the head of the Washington office of Human
Rights Watch Asia told the Senate Foreign Relations last month that
his group was ``deeply concerned about official controls over
religious belief and practice in China and Tibet.'' He added, ``The
government singles out Christianity and Islam as two avenues for
subversion by `hostile foreign forces,' and views religion as `a
critical element of the nationalist movements in Tibet and
Xinjiang.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, security agents reportedly razed an unapproved
Catholic church in Fujian, while in Hebei, to the north, they
arrested a pro-Vatican bishop who was promoting his faith too
energetically. Last fall, the leader of a fervent born-again sect
known as the Weepers was sentenced to a 3-year term for disturbing
public order.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of other Christians who reject the official church must
practice their faith with a wary eye, and even those who embrace
the government cannot publicly proclaim or spread their faith as
they might wish to.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of religious persecution _ of Christians and also
Tibetan Buddhists and some Muslim groups _ has emerged as perhaps
the most potent human rights issue in Chinese-American relations,
one President Clinton cannot avoid as he prepares to visit Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the West point to the restrictions and repression as
evidence of systematic persecution, while the government's
defenders here point, instead, to the relative freedom most
Christians now enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the rising outcry abroad comes as Christianity in
China, especially evangelical Protestantism, is growing
explosively. Rev. Don Argue, recent president of the National
Association of Evangelicals in the United States, says China may be
experiencing ``the single greatest revival in the history of
Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that growth has occurred with official acquiescence, and
though they remain a small minority in a giant country, millions of
Chinese people like Zhang Linmei, a 32-year-old worshiper at St.
Paul's, find the same comfort in religion that Christians do
anywhere, without worrying much about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel life is meaningless in society at large,'' Ms. Zhang
said after services as she picked up her 5-year-old daughter,
dressed in her finest, from Sunday school. ``This is the only
reliable place in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation for religion is in many ways the best it's been
since 1949,'' said Richard Madsen, an expert on Chinese religion at
the University of California at San Diego. Though the government
still controls their growth and closely monitors their activities,
he said, the official churches enjoy more autonomy today than in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Even the illegal churches _ unregistered Protestant churches and
openly pro-Vatican Catholic groups _ function without serious
trouble in many places, Madsen and others say. But those who refuse
to pledge support to the government and its apparatus of religious
control, and those with unorthodox or ecstatic styles of worship,
can face harsh repression.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, there were fewer than one million Protestants here. In
1979, three years after the end of the Cultural Revolution when
Maoist mobs attacked churches and the homes of believers, only
three Protestant churches were open in all of China.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of Christians in China range from 15 to
40 million, out of 1.2 billion Chinese. Chinese church officials
say there are 12 million Protestants, and outside experts like
Madsen say the actual number may be at least 20 million and rising.
More than 12,000 official Protestant churches are open and, again
by official estimates, Christians without access to churches or
professional pastors meet in some 25,000 homes or other meeting
points. These estimates ignore groups that the government regards
as criminal, and are believed to understate the total.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The legions of Protestants include new converts like Xu Wenju, a
74-year-old widow in Beijing who first attended a large official
church in 1995 at the urging of a neighbor and, she says, found
spiritual sustenance. She was soon baptized and now says that she
feels healthier, and that her family has become more harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   It includes those born into Christian families like Dr. Wu, a
75-year-old retired doctor in Beijing who read the Bible at age 6
and has felt the urge to spread the Gospel ever since. Chafing at
the controls of the official church, he was jailed for a year and a
half in the 1950s, he said, and he still prefers a house church,
one of the illegal congregations meeting in dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 the police came to his house and took his religious
books and tapes, said Dr. Wu, who declined to give his full name.
But they left him his personal Bible, telling him, ``You can
believe, but you cannot preach.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials say Catholics now number four million, while outside
researchers say the true total may be closer to 10 million, with
many secretly accepting the Pope as the true head of their church.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar hybrid state of Christianity here reflects the
general obsession of the Communist Party with control: virtually
any organization, whether political or social or religious, must
gain party approval.
</P>
<P>
   The party is an officially atheist organization that asserts
that religion will eventually wither away. But in the meantime, in
a policy spelled out in the early 1980s, the government officially
guarantees freedom of religion _ within prescribed boundaries
including a required allegiance to the state, adherence to certain
styles of worship and limits on church construction, evangelizing
and the baptism of children, among other rules.
</P>
<P>
   For those willing to accommodate, the 1990s seem a golden time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, now is the best period ever for
implementing the policy of religious freedom,'' said Han Wenzao,
who as president of the China Christian Council is the national
leader of the official Protestant church and a prime link to the
Communist government. ``The criterion should be, is the word of God
being propagated or not? It is and it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Han, who is 75 and has his office in the Nanjing Union Seminary,
says he became a devout Christian at a missionary college though he
was never ordained. He helped create the official, ``patriotic''
Protestant church here during the rough period after the Communist
takeover in 1949, when, he says, it was politically necessary to
repudiate the ``imperialist'' sponsorship of foreign missionaries.
The willing believers joined in a generic, nondenominational
church.
</P>
<P>
   Han and other official leaders are bitterly denounced as ``fake
Christians'' by some who reject the notion of saluting an atheistic
state, and who often suffered terribly for their refusal to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Yuan Xiangchen, also known as Allen Yuan, 84, is one of the
best-known leaders of the house church movement. He simply says:
``The head of the church is not any agency or person. The head of
the Church is Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The official church is led by the Communists,'' he added.
``That's why we worship at home.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the government's greatest fears is the breakaway
emergence of an unorthodox sect that might seriously challenge
public order _ at the extreme, something like the Taiping Rebellion
of the mid-1800s, which began with a charismatic Christian sect
leader, and eventually conquered half of China, with Nanjing as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
   From the government's perspective, then, giving mainstream, if
limited, theological training to leaders of a budding rural church
is preferable to letting them forge their own paths, possibly into
what the government considers illegal cults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very free to spread the Gospel,'' said Zhu, who also
serves on local governmental bodies.
</P>
<P>
   And still the repression of some Christians continues, to
different degrees among the country's far-flung regions.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people in jails or labor camps for their religious
activity is a matter of dispute, but loose assertions abroad that
thousands are in prison appear to be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Two major human rights groups, Amnesty International, based in
London, and Human Rights Watch, in New York, both say _ while
admitting to deep uncertainties _ that they find solid evidence
only that scores of people are now in some form of long-term
detention for their Christian activities: dozens of Catholic
leaders, and a similar number of Protestants, are thought to be
held.
</P>
<P>
   Imprisonment is increasingly reserved for major organizers and
leaders, while brief detentions and fines have been the more common
penalty levied against illegal Christian groups, said Arlette
Laduguie of Amnesty International. But she warned that information
even on some recent large-scale crackdowns, like the arrests of
hundreds of Roman Catholics last year in Jiangxi Province as part
of a campaign against a powerful illegal movement, may not emerge
for many months.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom in
Washington and one of the sharpest American critics of China, said
that on the basis of various field reports her group believes that
at least 500 Christian leaders are serving sentences, while at
least another 500 followers are detained at any given time,
justifying her published statements that thousands are under
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The very drive for conformity is part of the problem, rights
advocates say. In its effort to define acceptable beliefs and limit
how religion can be publicly expressed, China violates
international standards of religious freedom as laid out in
international charters and resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to believe what you want and the right to publicly
manifest that belief when and where and with whom you want is
what's at stake,'' said Mickey Siegal, a researcher with Human
Rights Watch in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another problem altogether is discrimination even against legal
Christians, who usually cannot hold senior positions in government
or the vast state-run economy. This reflects a more fundamental
trait of China: high office is still almost entirely reserved for
members of the Communist Party, who are not supposed to adopt
Christianity or any other religion.

KENNEDY WEIGHING MOVE TO HIKE MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Senator Edward M. Kennedy has his way, the
bankruptcy bill rolling through Congress that would make it harder
for cash-strapped consumers to walk away from their debt will also
come with an increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is strongly considering attaching an amendment that
would raise the minimum wage by $1 over the next two years when the
Senate considers the bankruptcy legislation next month, his aides
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said President Clinton would support
Kennedy's effort, although he thinks the bankruptcy bill already
adopted by the House is ``rigid and arbitrary'' because it
establishes a means test to determine who could purge their debt
and who must repay it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president strongly supports an increase in the minimum
wage, so he'll certainly support the senator's efforts to move that
in a way that he thinks makes sense legislatively,'' said White
House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's maneuver could eliminate the possibility of a
presidential veto and perhaps stimulate broader Democrat support
for the first major overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is a high priority for Republicans in both the
House and Senate. Last week, 84 Democrats joined all the House
Republicans to adopt the bankruptcy bill by a 306-118 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bill's Democratic supporters were Representative
Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who broke ranks with the
Massachusetts delegation to vote in favor of the bankruptcy
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said he voted for the bill because ``people who can afford
to pay their debts ought to pay them.'' He also said he was
satisfied with changes made to the bill that would allow child
support and alimony payments to be given priority over credit-card
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would prevent individuals earning more than the
national median income ($50,000 for a family of four) from
declaring personal bankruptcy under Chapter 7 liquidation, which
erases most debts. Those earning above that cap would have to file
under Chapter 13 laws, which would require them to reorganize their
debts and establish a repayment plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version would place fewer restrictions on those
filing for bankruptcy but would give creditors greater power to
recoup what they are owed. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill
would not require those with higher incomes to undergo a means test
to determine whether they can file under Chapters 7 or 13
bankruptcy laws, but leave that to bankruptcy trustees.
</P>
<P>
   That bill was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last
month and is awaiting consideration by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Shaw, a spokeswoman for Senate majority leader Trent
Lott, said he is very interested in the bill and would bring it to
the Senate floor after the July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   She refused to speculate about what might happen if Kennedy
tries to attach his proposal to raise the current federal minimum
wage of $5.15 by 50 cents each year for two years beginning Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy spokesman Jim Manly said the senator opposes the
bankruptcy legislation, but if Republicans are intent on passing
it, then he wanted the minimum wage increase in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain symmetry here in a bill many suggest will
have an adverse impact on low-wage workers and workers' families
providing a useful vehicle for Senator Kennedy to try to provide
for a further increase in the minimum wage,'' Manly said.
</P>
<P>
   Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Senate minority leader Thomas
A. Daschle, said the minimum wage amendment was contingent on first
finding legislation to attach a proposal to protect the rights of
patients enrolled in Health Maintenance Organizations, a chief
Democratic legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   Frank predicted that Kennedy's amendment ``would probably not
kill the bankruptcy bill.'' Instead, he said it could shore up
Democratic support for bankruptcy reform or force Republicans to
consider the minimum-wage hike separately. ``I'm for both of
them,'' he said.

AN ENCHANTING REVIVAL OF TOPICAL SKETCHES FROM 1933
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, June 21.) 
 (ja) 
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The setting is Washington in March 1933: the economy
is deep into the Depression, the stock market is a wasteland, bread
lines are long and banks are closing. The nation totters.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert and Lou Hoover, the 31st president of the United States
and his wife, are rattling around the White House on the eve of the
day they must vacate the premises for the incoming Roosevelt
family. Herbert faces the move with equanimity, but Lou wants
revenge. She is planning to steal some White House silver and a
portrait of George Washington _ it's not as if there aren't plenty
more around the place.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert tries to cheer her: ``It could be worse _ I could have
been re-elected.'' She goads him. This being their last night, she
says, isn't there something he'd like to do that is not entirely
proper? There is, which leads to the rude, gleefully childish
blackout that ends the sketch titled ``Franklin D. Roosevelt to Be
Inaugurated Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of the numbers in the Drama Dept.'s quite
enchanting resurrection of ``As Thousands Cheer,'' the 1933 Irving
Berlin-Moss Hart topical revue, which is at the Greenwich House
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   A 1933 topical revue that's still funny? Yes. One of the
marvelous things about intelligently written, skillfully performed
revue material is that the humor can shine through in front of
audiences for whom the original associations have grown dim or,
perhaps, never existed at all. Watch children watching a sketch
whose point is utterly beyond them and they laugh at the right
places. Such comedy has a rhythm that can be as infectiously comic
as content, even when the subjects might be John D. Rockefeller
Sr., the five-and-dime heiress Barbara Hutton, Mahatma Gandhi,
Hollywood's morals czar Will Hays, unemployment and thievery at the
Automat.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder here is that you can delight in both the content and
the rhythm of ``As Thousands Cheer,'' which is presented with nutty
enthusiasm and sometimes vitriol as it sends up the American scene
at one of the darkest moments in the country's history. Directed as
a series of collegial, go-for-broke turns by Christopher Ashley,
whose credits include ``Jeffrey'' and the recent Encores production
of ``Li'l Abner,'' the show is a kind of tabloid version of the
original Broadway hit. It has been cut to run a breezy 75 minutes,
played without an intermission by a cast of six acting and singing
clowns, accompanied by a piano and a bass.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Atlantic Theater Company, which recently revived ``Once
in a Lifetime,'' the classic 1930 George S. Kaufman-Moss Hart
comedy, the Drama Dept. possesses an awareness of the theater's
historical past that deepens and illuminates the company's present
work. This was apparent six months ago in its ebullient, witty,
very original deconstruction of Harriet Beecher Stowe's ``Uncle
Tom's Cabin or Life Among the Lowly.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to search for the life within ``As Thousands
Cheer,'' the Drama Dept. is rediscovering the art of the revue as
it has evolved in the American theater from the days of minstrel
shows. Spawned in its present form in the years before World War I,
the intimate revue took over during the Depression, when soaring
budgets made the elaborate, Ziegfeld-type spectacles too risky to
produce. Revues have existed in all sizes and shapes from the
teens, '20s, '30s and '40s into the '50s: a glorious grab-bag kind
of theater, brainy beyond the aspirations of burlesque and
vaudeville, composed of sketches, songs and dances, sometimes with
a common theme and, most important, with a consistently skeptical
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   I think of London in 1947 and the first revue I ever saw,
``Sweetest and Lowest,'' a hilarious, very jaundiced look at life
in grimly austere, postwar Britain, starring an almost youthful
Hermione Gingold. A highlight: a sendup of Noel Coward's role as a
goodwill ambassador during the war (``While disguised as Mr.
Eden/He was smuggled into Sweden/Where he cleverly put on `Private
Lives'''). The cheeky effrontery of undergraduate humor, which I
then knew best, had been transformed into art.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1950s, television had already appropriated the
variety-show format of revues, and Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca
briefly made the entire country sketch comedy-conscious on ``Your
Show of Shows.'' Yet producers of theatrical revues persisted: Ben
Bagley with his ``Shoestring Revue of 1957,'' Julius Monk with his
brilliant, mini-scaled shows in whatever nightclubs were available,
and the indefatigable Leonard Sillman, whose ``New Faces of 1952''
was the most successful of all the ``New Faces'' shows he had been
producing since the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the discoveries of the 1952 edition were Ronny Graham,
Alice Ghostley, Paul Lynde and Eartha Kitt. As this show introduced
Ms. Kitt, she introduced what was to become one of her signature
songs, ``Monotonous.'' The most memorable production number,
choreographed for frenzy by Richard Barstow, was Michael Brown's
exuberant hoedown, ``Lizzie Borden,'' which has the refrain: ``Oh
you can't chop your papa up in/Massachusetts/Massachusetts is a
long way from New York!''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the priceless sketches: a Paul Lynde monologue in which
a man with a Rotarian's desire to please, though still heavily
bandaged and on crutches, relates what happened on the Trip of the
Month Club's African safari he took with his late wife; a vignette
about the Loman family in which Willy's frail, worried wife
implores her sons to pay attention, to become bank robbers like
their exhausted dad; and Ronny Graham's takeoff on Truman Capote,
who is lying in a hammock and talking (if I remember correctly)
about moss.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous material, some of it written by a writer then billed as
Melvin Brooks. He, of course, was also one of the contributors to
``Your Show of Shows,'' which used a platoon of talents that
included Neil Simon, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart and many others.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   What is it about these revues that makes them so irresistible?
</P>
<P>
   When they work, they capture the temper of the times with
brevity, with an accuracy that sometimes shocks and with a gift for
parody that restores sacred cows to human dimension. A blending of
first-rate sketches laced with songs as funny and melodic as
Berlin's for ``As Thousands Cheer,'' can be among the most bracing
of theatrical entertainments. We have let the genre go to seed.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed as if television would meet the demand
for sketch comedy, but then not even Sid Caesar could stick it out.
Television eats up material like an office shredder. The
incomparable Carol Burnett endured for 11 seasons and kept the
quality way, way up. ``Saturday Night Live'' has had its golden
moments, most of them many years ago. I think of an Edward R.
Murrow ``Person to Person'' sort of parody in which the
self-absorbed interviewer has his back to the television screen on
which his guest, who looks like Elizabeth Taylor, starts choking to
death on the chicken leg that has had her ravenous attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Live'' produced some great sketch actors: John
Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and the best of them all, the grandly and
subtly gifted Eddie Murphy. Remember his sketch about how white
folks behave on the bus to work when black folks aren't around?
Bells go off, music suddenly blares, saucily dressed waitresses
appear, to serve martinis and canapes. The imagined merriment is
nonstop and strictly segregated.
</P>
<P>
   The show still introduces good new performers but, in what could
be an attempt to affect a 1990s sort of cool, the sketches tend to
be resolutely without point. The idea is that to express passion,
even in a satirical way, is definitely un-cool.
</P>
<P>
   There have been suggestions that the revue sketch is dated
today, that audiences (especially television's) are not interested
in it and much prefer shows that feature stand-up comics. Yet the
range of subjects covered in stand-up is limited. It is usually so
self-referential (dating, the difference between men and women,
terrible sexual performance, parents, looks, weight) you might
suspect that the comics and their audiences have turned their backs
on the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, it's no wonder so few people bother to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The time may have come for the theater to reclaim the topical
revue. There is no shortage of writing talent available. Tick off
the names: Larry Gelbart, Neil Simon, Betty Comden and Adolph
Green, Terrence McNally, Wendy Wasserstein, A.R. Gurney,
Christopher Durang, Whoopi Goldberg, Paul Rudnick, Nicky Silver,
David Ives, Jane Wagner, Jon Robin Baitz, Douglas Carter Beane,
David and Amy Sedaris, John Leguizamo _ and they are just some of
the people we know about.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can see what a hit 1933 revue looks like as put
on by people whose parents might not even have been born when the
original production opened. ``As Thousands Cheer'' is a theme show,
each sketch or song supposedly torn from a newspaper headline of
the day. In this way it was something of a prescient parody of the
Living Newspapers that were to be put on under the sponsorship of
the Federal Theater Project, which was established by the Works
Progress Administration in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Living Newspapers, however, which examined housing,
health care, labor unions and the like, ``As Thousands Cheer''
mostly examines such issues as why a man might bite a dog and the
private personas of public people, usually behaving badly. The
Berlin score includes the steamy and funny ``Heat Wave'' and, for
an abrupt change of mood, the poignant ``Supper Time,'' which is
cued by a headline about a lynching and was sung in the original
show by Ethel Waters.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Drama Dept. cast are a delight. Some
highlights: B.D. Wong (Gandhi and the man who bites a dog), Kevin
Chamberlin (hilarious as the dog that's bitten and Hoover), Judy
Kuhn (Joan Crawford, Barbara Hutton), Howard McGillin (John D.
Rockefeller Sr., Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), Mary Beth Peil (Aimee
Semple McPherson, Mrs. Hoover), and Paula Newsome, who plays and
sings up a storm. Among her numbers are Berlin's superb ``Harlem on
My Mind'' and ``Supper Time.'' David Evans is on piano, Lou Bruno
on bass. This is a very good crew.
</P>
<P>
   Footnote to history: In her book, ``Irving Berlin: A Daughter's
Memoir,'' Mary Ellin Barrett reports that when ``As Thousands
Cheer'' was trying out io Philadelphia, Clifton Webb, Marilyn
Miller and Helen Broderick, the show's three white stars, refused
to share the curtain call with Ethel Waters. Berlin's reaction was
to suggest that this wasn't a show in need of curtain calls anyway,
and that they should be cut. At the next performance the cast took
its bows together.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `The Dying Gaul': &QL; 
 &LR;  Craig Lucas' fascinating new play, ``The Dying Gaul,'' closed
last Sunday night after a limited engagement at the Vineyard
Theater, where a scheduling conflict made any extension impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, but there are hopes that it will reopen in the fall for
the unlimited run it deserves. Or, to put it another way: ``The
Dying Gaul'' is even more theatrically imaginative and engaging
than Lucas' ``Prelude to a Kiss,'' the quirky fairy tale of a
modern love story seen on Broadway in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dying Gaul'' is quite different. It is also a love story
of sorts, but one in which anger and lust take a terrible toll, at
least in part through the magic of Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is Hollywood and the principal characters are
Robert, an aspiring screenwriter of mystical bent, in mourning for
his lover who has recently died of AIDS; Jeffrey, a bisexual
producer who buys Robert's first script and seduces him into a
mutually satisfying, supposedly no-strings-attached affair, and
Elaine, Jeffrey's wife, an intelligent, loving woman whose patience
runs out.
</P>
<P>
   The Vineyard production, staged by Mark Brokaw, was just about
flawless, with Tim Hopper as Robert, Tony Goldwyn as Jeffrey, Linda
Emond as Elaine and Robert Emmet Lunney as Robert's psychiatrist,
who is as important to Lucas' intricate plotting as the existence
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If Goldwyn appeared to stand out, it was because the role is so
scarily flamboyant; his colleagues were equally centered in their
performances. Adding to the classiness of the production: Allen
Moyer's serenely handsome, vaguely Japanese unit set, which
suggested Hollywood glitz as interpreted by a very expensive
decorator in a minimalist mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dying Gaul'' indicates that Lucas is writing better than
ever these days.

CHINA WARNS IT MAY DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ As if the falling yen were not causing enough
heartache in Asia, investors here and abroad are now fretting about
another potential crisis: the devaluation of the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
   China's finance minister issued a pointed warning Tuesday that
the Asian crisis could destabilize its currency. China has so far
refused to devalue the yuan, which is also called the renminbi,
even after a tide of devaluations swept through Asia last fall. But
there were new signs Tuesday that the persistent weakness in the
Japanese yen was sorely testing Beijing's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The finance minister, Xiang Huaicheng, said in an article
Tuesday in The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, that
China's struggle to meet its economic growth target could
``increase pressure on the stability of the renminbi.'' Later in
the day, China called on Japan to show the ``courage and wisdom''
to halt the yen's slide.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's statements were the latest in a chorus of complaints
by Chinese officials about the declining value of the yen. And they
have kindled fears throughout Asia that Beijing could be laying the
groundwork for a devaluation of its own. ``When so many Chinese
officials come out, they mean business,'' said Guonan Ma, co-head
of economic research at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong, ``If the
yen continues to fall, they will reach a breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most analysts still doubt that China plans to
devalue its currency in the short term. It is more insulated than
other Asian countries from the pressures of the global marketplace.
With President Clinton scheduled to arrive next week, China also
has compelling political reasons not to tamper with its currency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sheer number of statements by Chinese officials has
made investors nervous. The growth rate of China's economy is
slowing, exports are declining, and as the yen drops, pressure
increases to devalue the yuan. Some analysts think that a Chinese
devaluation would kick off a new wave of tit-for-tat devaluations
around the region _ leaving Asia's currencies in tatters and its
economies in an even more precarious state.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ill-considered devaluation could start another round of
instability,'' said Miron Mushkat, director of strategy at Indocam
Asia Asset Management in Hong Kong. ``China's devaluation would
push us back to square one.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed fears of a Chinese devaluation came on a day when
Asia's financial markets zigzagged sharply in the yen's wake. After
plunging on Monday to some of their deepest lows in years, stocks
rebounded Tuesday morning when the yen briefly strengthened against
the United States dollar. When it retreated Tuesday afternoon,
shares also dropped. At the end of the trading session, most of the
markets were down, though Hong Kong gained seven-eighths of 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The yen, after seesawing on rumors of Japanese government
intervention, traded at 144.56 to the U.S. dollar late in the day
here. (It settled later in New York at 143.47, an improvement from
146.15 late Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese yuan was unchanged at 8.2798 to the dollar, but only
after China's central bank intervened to support it. China also
lowered interest rates for dollar-denominated deposits, a step that
could foreshadow a general cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That would be welcomed by Chinese companies, which are battling
the now-familiar Asian affliction of slackening domestic demand,
tight credit and dwindling exports. But despite the persistent
rumors, it is far from certain that a devaluation would be a tonic
for China's mixture of economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several economists contend that it could hurt. For one,
it would seriously erode confidence in Hong Kong, which has been
struggling to shore up its own currency in recent days. Although
the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the American dollar, it is
psychologically supported by China, since last July the sovereign
authority.
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaints about the yen's value, it is also not
clear that it affects China all that much, at least not at current
levels. China and Japan have few overlapping export industries _
unlike, say, Japan and South Korea. ``People are making a link
between the yen and the yuan, but there is actually very little
link,'' said Dong Tao, a senior regional economist at Credit Suisse
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that China actually benefited from a slumping yen in
one respect. Beijing has an estimated $40 billion in foreign debt
denominated in yen. As the yen depreciates against the dollar,
China's debt burden lightens.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a weak yen hurts China insofar as it pulls the rest
of Asia into a deeper economic mire. Asian markets, including
Japan's, account for 43 percent of China's exports. And those
countries are buying fewer Chinese-made textiles, farm products,
toys or low-cost electronics. After increasing 20 percent last
year, China's exports declined by an estimated 1.5 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in exports will make it difficult for China to meet
its goal of 8 percent economic growth in 1998. Most economists now
expect Chinese output to grow 6 percent to 7 percent this year. The
slowing growth means mushrooming unemployment, and with it, the
possibility of social unrest. Some analysts said this could
eventually force Beijing's hand.
</P>
<P>
   A key difference between China and most other Asian countries is
that its currency is not fully convertible and is therefore not
vulnerable to speculative attacks. Unlike many of its Asian
neighbors, China is also running a comfortable trade surplus and
has $140 billion in foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   For China, whether to devalue its currency is in part a
political decision, according to some analysts. By maintaining a
stable currency, Beijing has become an island of calm in the Asian
economic storm. Mushkat of Indocam said China had inherited the
mantle of economic leadership from a troubled Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said the noises coming from Beijing were the sign of
a rising economic power beginning to flex its muscles. ``It's not
so much laying the groundwork but keeping their options open,'' he
said. ``China is playing the game, while Japan doesn't even
understand what the game is.''

GM, WORKERS AT ODDS OVER DIRECTION OF MANUFACTURING CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The strikes now crippling General Motors, while partly
about short-term job security and workplace safety disputes,
reflect a larger struggle over whether America's auto industry will
adopt the manufacturing techniques now being introduced at new
factories in countries like Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   GM's operations in Brazil have copied Japanese manufacturing
practices on a massive scale, and have become the company's most
profitable, efficient and flexible. When GM introduced new mid-size
sedans in the United States and Brazil two years ago, a Kansas
factory took seven months to make the switch while the Brazilian
factory reached full production in just three months.
</P>
<P>
   The last two presidents of GM's Brazilian operations, G. Richard
Wagoner Jr. and Mark Hogan, now run GM's North American operations
and are trying to apply Brazil's lessons here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take what we've learned in the manufacturing and
technology in Brazil and apply that in the United States, and
that's every bit my intention,'' said Hogan, GM's vice president
for small cars, in an interview last year in Sao Paolo.
</P>
<P>
   Outside suppliers in Brazil are assembling many of the parts for
new cars before delivering them to the assembly plants _ sending
partially assembled dashboards, for example, instead of
speedometers, gas gauges, radios and glove boxes. Automakers used
to bolt all these parts together inside an assembly plant, and GM
still does in the United States, even though this occupies a lot of
costly floor space and increases labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   But where GM sees efficiency, the UAW sees a threat. Many of
GM's moves in Brazil have reduced the number of people needed per
vehicle produced, particularly during final assembly. That has been
acceptable to Brazilian unions and workers because GM has been
steadily hiring employees as it builds more factories for a market
that has expanded briskly.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, GM's share of the stagnant American car
market has been shrinking for years and it has been steadily
closing factories as a result. So proposals to reduce employment
more quickly at the remaining factories have alarmed an already
angry United Automobile Workers union and its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly galling for the union is that GM is cutting back in
the United States even as it builds new assembly plants in Poland,
China, Thailand and Argentina along Brazilian lines.
</P>
<P>
   GM is ``ignoring their social contract with America, by
transferring jobs, technology and capital from the U.S.,'' said
Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes at two parts factories in Flint, Mich., have forced GM
to close 17 of its 29 North American assembly plants so far for
lack of parts. GM has temporarily laid off 71,700 workers,
including 2,300 on Tuesday at an assembly plant in Shreveport, La.,
that makes small pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of expanding overseas, GM has discovered that it
can operate far more efficiently than in the United States. That
has been particularly true in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The differences in GM operations start with the shape of the
factories: they are L-shaped or T-shaped in Brazil, while GM's
factories in the United States still tend to be gigantic squares,
with each side as long as several football fields. The advantage of
the Brazilian design is that it offers more exterior walls for
loading docks, which allows outside suppliers to produce more of a
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has been asking its suppliers for years to deliver
partially assembled sections of cars, and it dramatically reduces
the number of assembly plant workers that are needed. GM's
operations in the United States have been slow to learn from the
company's 13-year-old joint venture to build cars with Toyota in
Fremont, Calif. But many of the GM managers from that joint venture
have gone on to Brazil, including Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been quietly talking to the UAW about building a
Brazilian-style factory with lots of loading docks in the United
States. The company is also trying to expand the role that outside
suppliers play even at existing American factories with few loading
docks. Other automakers are undertaking similar experiments,
including Volkswagen at one of its Brazilian factories and
Mercedes-Benz at factories in France and at a non-union factory in
Alabama. Ford and Chrysler are moving in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   But while American automakers' assembly plants in the United
States are entirely unionized, most suppliers are not, and that
upsets the UAW. The suppliers' employees do not pay union dues and
commonly earn a third less than the $20 an hour paid to UAW
members.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shoemaker, one of the many thorny issues in the
Flint strike has been GM's desire to have metal stamping equipment
there maintained by outside contractors instead of UAW workers.
</P>
<P>
   GM's labor contracts effectively bar it from dismissing UAW
workers. But the company has tried for years to avoid replacing
workers who retire, and will have even less incentive to hire new
workers as it copies the Brazilian model here. That alarms UAW
members who want jobs for their children.
</P>
<P>
   GM's factories in Brazil have also embraced Japanese labor
practices, with workers and managers eating together and with GM
providing extensive information to the workers about how each
segment of an assembly line is doing in terms of productivity and
safety.
</P>
<P>
   A few GM factory managers have taken the same approach in the
United States, but many factories retain a strong caste system in
which white-collar and blue-collar workers stay apart while
managers provide little information to assembly line workers.
</P>
<P>
   GM's high profits in Brazil have suffered this year as the
country's economy has slowed. But GM continues to invest heavily
there, contending that the market is growing and the Brazilian
operation's efficiency should be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, GM has delayed investments in some American
factories, including those struck in Flint, while demanding that
the workers put in longer hours or make other changes to improve
productivity. The UAW contends that inadequate investment and poor
management is to blame for lagging productivity, not the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current negotiations in Flint focus on narrow
issues of work rules and investment at GM auto parts factories in
Flint, the workers see the strike in international terms. ``GM is
done with America,'' said Glenn Reynolds, a 57-year-old metal
stamping worker on strike in Flint, as he left his local union hall
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   GM insists that none of the foreign assembly plants being built
will be used to ship cars back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For now, GM's international expansion has mostly hurt American
workers by limiting exports from the United States. GM has been
shipping Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicles from Sao Jose dos
Campos, Brazil, to Russia, for example, even though GM's Blazer
factory in Moraine, Ohio, is much closer. &QL;

RINGO OUTDISTANCES HIS PAST, FINALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 21)  
 (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a musician who was once part of the most influential band in
pop, spending more than a decade rekindling a career must be an
intensely frustrating business.
</P>
<P>
   But listening to ``Vertical Man,'' Ringo Starr's 12th
post-Beatles studio album, one has to admire the cheerful
industriousness with which he has tried to recapture the success of
his early hit albums, ``Ringo'' (1973) and ``Goodnight Vienna''
(1974).
</P>
<P>
   His last effort, ``Time Takes Time'' (1992), should have done
the trick: it was bright, energetic and pleasantly Beatlesque, but
it disappeared without hitting the charts.
</P>
<P>
   In sound and spirit, ``Vertical Man'' (Mercury) has much in
common with ``Time Takes Time.'' There are Beatles references, both
overt (a remake of ``Love Me Do'') and oblique (the combination
mellotron sounds, a la ``Strawberry Fields Forever,'' and sliding
strings, in the style of ``I Am the Walrus,'' on the otherwise
bluesy ``King of Broken Hearts'').
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both of Starr's surviving former band mates play on the
record: The crying slide guitar sound that has been George
Harrison's post-Beatles signature adorns a few tracks, and Paul
McCartney contributes bass and backing vocals to others. ``I'm
Yours,'' the closing ballad, has a George Martin string arrangement
reminiscent of ``Good Night,'' the song Starr sings at the end of
the Beatles' White Album.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Vertical Man'' is not merely a retread of Beatles' styles.
There is a grittiness, a density and a fluid eclecticism that is of
the '90s, not the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a consistency that has been lacking in Starr's work
until now. Typically, his recordings have been parties of guest
appearances, with different ensembles on each selection, and with a
few of Starr's modest creations mingling with songs written for him
by more compositionally accomplished friends.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the guest vocal and instrumental contributions are
plentiful: in addition to Harrison and McCartney, the roster
includes Joe Walsh, Alanis Morissette, Steve Tyler, Ozzy Osbourne,
Tom Petty, Steve Cropper and Brian Wilson. But the guest shots are
rarely the focus; mainly, they embellish performances by a core
band that includes Starr on drums (solid and unostentatious as
ever), Mark Hudson and Steve Dudas on guitars and bass, and Jim Cox
on keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also collaborated in the writing of 11 of the album's 13
songs with Hudson, Dudas, Dean Grakal and, in one case, Mark
Nevins.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they have catchy melodies that tiptoe around Starr's
vocal limitations and cater to the slightly nasal quality and good
humored phrasing that give his singing its distinctive, homey
charm. Peace, love and understanding, in both personal terms (``I'm
Yours'' and ``What in the World'' are straightforward love songs)
and with a mildly political undercurrent (in the pacifist
``Mindfield,'' for example).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of taking life in stride _ the impulse that drives ``La
De Da,'' a folksy singalong with the refrain, ``que sera, whatever,
la de dah'' _ threads through several songs as well.
</P>
<P>
   All told, this is a tightly crafted, appealingly upbeat album,
and clearly meant as entertainment rather than innovation. That
said, the new songs are immeasurably more sophisticated than ``Love
Me Do,'' which Starr included partly to redress the fact that a
session drummer had replaced him on a 1962 Beatles recording and
partly to assert his right to sing Lennon-McCartney songs beyond
the few he sang with the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's straightforward rocking version pulls the song away from
its blues roots, but that is a far more pleasing approach than
McCartney's 1989 remake, the disco-tinged medley ``P.S. Love Me
Do.''

SUPERMARKETS SUE TO EASE LIQUOR LICENSE LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' supermarket industry Tuesday promised
more competitive prices for beer and liquor if its court challenge
to a state law prohibiting anyone from owning more than three
liquor stores is successful.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Stop &AMP; Shop, Roche Bros., and BJ's Wholesale Club, the
supermarkets said a Prohibition-era law restricting how many liquor
licenses a company can hold violates the Sherman antitrust law and
means retailers have little leverage in negotiating deals with
liquor wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now retailers have no buying power and no clout,'' said
Christopher Flynn, executive director of the Massachusetts Food
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The US District Court suit, which follows an unsuccessful effort
by former Governor William F. Weld to eliminate the liquor license
cap, would dramatically change the way liquor is sold in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, wholesalers sell their products to about 3,000
package store owners across the state, none of whom can operate
more than three stores. The overall number of liquor licenses
permitted in the state is also tightly restricted, with licenses
allotted in each community using a population formula.
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket suit does not challenge the state's authority to
limit the overall number of liquor licenses, only a store's right
to acquire more than three of them. In other words, the number of
individual liquor store competitors would probably decrease, not
increase, if the suit were successful and chain stores buy up
licenses for their outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Hurley, the owner of Canterbury Liquors in Sandwich and a
prominent figure in state package store associations, said he
doubted the court challenge will prevail. If it does, he said,
consumers would ultimately be the losers.
</P>
<P>
   In Sandwich, for example, there are currently five liquor
licenses. If the supermarket suit is successful, Hurley said the
local Stop &AMP; Shop and A&AMP;P would probably each buy licenses from one
of the existing liquor stores and then use their deep pockets to
drive the remaining package stores out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they gain control, they will raise prices,'' he
predicted. ``And this example would be duplicated throughout the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley said supermarkets also tend to carry only the most
popular beers and wines, so selection would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, of the Massachusetts Food Association, said Massachusetts
has some of the highest prices in the nation for beers and wines,
in part because of the archaic restrictions on liquor license
ownership. He said supermarket chains and warehouse clubs, if
allowed to acquire more liquor licenses, would have more clout in
negotiating lower prices with wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley said the power of wholesalers to restrict price
competition was dramatically curbed in January when a federal judge
struck down on antitrust grounds a law regulating the way
wholesalers set prices.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called price posting law required wholesalers to announce
their prices each month and allowed them to match, but not beat,
the prices of competitors. Hurley, who filed the lawsuit, said
wholesalers can now adjust their prices at any time and undercut
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the verdict, Hurley said the price of Gordon's Vodka and
Baccardi Rum have dropped about $1 per 1.75-liter bottle. He said
jug wines have also dropped about a $1 per bottle. Beer prices have
not fallen because beer wholesalers have strict franchise
agreements that tend to restrict competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Stasiowsky, president of the Massachusetts Wholesalers of
Malt Beverages, said his group supports the three-store limit
because smaller package stores do a better job of regulating
alcohol sales than supermarket chains that sell a wide variety of
products.
</P>
<P>
   He also disputed Flynn's statement that beer prices in
Massachusetts are among the highest in the nation. Stasiowsky said
prices here are higher because of the state's bottle deposit law.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Sullivan, chairman of the Alcoholic Beverages Control
Commission, the state agency sued by the supermarkets, said it is
his job to enforce the laws on the books until those laws are
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the state limits retailers to only three liquor
licenses, he said it was done ``to protect the public safety and
common good.''

FIKRETE GABRE, ENTREPRENEUR AND ETHIOPIAN ACTIVIST; AT 42

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fikrete Gabre, 42, an innovative Ethiopian entrepreneur and
community activist who had been living in Amherst, Mass., died June
9 while staying with family members in California. Her death was
attributed to complications from hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Zato, a village in southwestern Ethiopia, Ms. Gabre was
best-known for developing Siljo Sauce _ a traditional African blend
of ginger, garlic, and other spices which she made and marketed to
raise funds to create the first water system in her
drought-stricken hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Donating 20 percent of profits, she raised thousands of dollars
and generated considerable publicity for her village before a
severe case of hepatitis forced her to reduce her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; From a family of 14, Ms. Gabre came to the United States in
1974. A military dictator had closed all the local schools and she
wanted to get a college education. She eventually earned bachelor's
and master's degrees in labor relations at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst and a second master's degree, in social
work, at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In California, she also organized the first multicultural,
multilingual Ethiopian Community Resource Center in Oakland, which
she directed from 1983 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   With help from many Massachusetts residents, she launched her
Siljo Sauce project in 1991. Drought had devastated her village and
social progress, particularly for women, was being blocked by the
all-consuming search for water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water,'' she observed, ``is the lifeline for every living
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her mother, W-Maryan Ayemo of Zato, Ethiopia; four
sisters, Boge of Los Angeles, and Ceebo, Zenebeh, and Sheyae, all
of Addis Ababa; and four brothers, Tsedek of Nova Scotia, Berhanu
of Addis Ababa, and Abera and Solomon, both of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fikrete talked her mind. She was a ball of energy, constantly
doing things, creating things. She had such a huge heart for
everybody,'' said her sister Boge. ``We will carry her dreams.''

KERRY OFFERS PROPOSAL ON TEACHER TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BY JORDANA HART AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ National and state education leaders Tuesday embraced
many of US Senator John F. Kerry's proposals to grant public school
principals more authority to hire and fire teachers, though teacher
union officials warned he was scapegoating their members even as
they fostered school reform.
</P>
<P>
   Those union officials said they would join Kerry in pushing the
many states that still have cumbersome tenure and
teacher-certification processes to join the reform movement,
provided that teachers get a proper method to appeal unjust
firings.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's ideas on education were outlined in a 45-minute speech
Tuesday to some 125 educators, state legislators and college
students at Northeastern University. The speech, which was national
in scope, was intended to be Kerry's first major address to set the
tone for a possible presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The speech called for dismantling both the seniority systems
that protect unqualified teachers, and certification procedures
that prevent teaching by people without an education degree.
</P>
<P>
   State reform advocates said the senator's proposals may have
raised eyebrows in states just launching their own reform efforts,
but not in about a dozen states at the front line in education.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the firing of teachers no longer has to go
through the time-consuming process of a school committee vote. Now,
principals and superintendents have greater power to remove them.
In most cases, firings then go to binding arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry ``was really articulating many of the initiatives in
Massachusetts as models for the rest of the country,'' said state
Senator David Magnani, a Democrat who is former co-chair of the
Massachusetts legislature's education committee and attended
Kerry's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is in the midst of a billion-dollar education
overhaul launched in 1993. It has made hiring and firing of
teachers easier, and allows professionals without teaching degrees
into classrooms _ so long as they get a waiver from the state Board
of Education and work toward teacher certification.
</P>
<P>
   National teacher union leaders said that a majority of states
have alternative certification processes for professionals to
become teachers. But they also acknowledged that many of those
programs are cluttered with red tape.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials also applauded Kerry's decision not to support a
school-voucher program that many Republicans back. They said they
would help work instead toward a widespread system of public school
choice.
</P>
<P>
   But James Peyser, a Massachusetts Board of Education member who
supports vouchers as well as charter schools, said he was
disappointed that Kerry didn't support a voucher system like the
one that won court approval in Milwaukee last week. The Wisconsin
plan allows students to choose private and parochial schools at
public cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not even willing to go as far as a limited system for
poor children or children stuck in failing schools,'' Peyser said.
``He was basically saying, `Give us more time to get public
education right.' What he fails to realize is that there are
children in schools who are not being served and who will be lost
unless something is done for them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry met with a series of education leaders in the past several
months as he prepared his speech, including Boston Public Schools
Superintendent Thomas Payzant and heads of the state and national
teachers unions.
</P>
<P>
   It was those union leaders who felt their organizations were
cast in a villianous light in many parts of Kerry's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would look very favorably to the fact that he has tried to
be creative in his thinking on improving public schools,'' said
Mary Elizabeth Teasley, director of government relations for the
National Education Association, the nation's largest teacher union.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the other side of the coin, we are not pleased with his
swipes at teachers unions,'' she said. ``The NEA and our new
president, Bob Chase, has embraced new unionism and cooperation
instead of conflict. We did not understand the broad-brush swipes
at teachers unions. It surprised us.''

WIDOWER URGES MEXICO TO EXTRADITE MAN WANTED IN FLORIDA KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.S. congressman called Tuesday for renegotiation
of the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty as the husband of a slain
Florida woman picketed the Mexican Embassy, saying his wife
``screams out from the grave'' for her alleged killer's return to
the United States to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they were sympathetic to the concerns of
James Bellush, who held a news conference on the embassy steps. But
Mexican officials said they could not interfere with the due
process of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this person to be tried fairly,'' said Jose Antonio
Zabalgoitia, a Mexican Embassy spokesman. ``The Mexican government
has no interest whatsoever in protecting a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   But an angry Bellush countered: ``Talk is all the Mexican
government does.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Marine, Bellush urged Americans to boycott Mexican
goods until Jose Luis Del Toro Jr., 22, is returned to Florida to
face a first-degree murder charge in the death of Sheila Bellush,
who was shot and slashed to death at her home in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man needs to be on a plane today. I'm tired of waiting,''
Bellush said. ``My wife, she screams out from the grave for him to
be extradited immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Bellush gave birth to quadruplets in 1995, when she lived
in San Antonio. She was killed Nov. 7, 1997, in Sarasota, just
weeks after the family had left Texas for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, an American citizen from San Antonio, was captured in
Mexico after the slaying. Two other San Antonio men, Samuel
Gonzales, 27, and Daniel Rocha, 29, also were charged in Florida
with in connection with the Bullush murder.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the motive in the brutal killing was a
complex murder-for-hire scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales pleaded guilty to solicitation to commit murder. He was
sentenced to 19 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha has implicated Sheila Bellush's first husband, Allen
Blackthorne, in the death. Blackthorne, through an attorney, has
denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Florida prosecutors dropped their intent to seek the death
penalty in their case against Del Toro last year in exchange for
Mexico's cooperation in extradition. Mexico does not recognize
capital punishment on moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But once Mexico's Foreign Ministry agreed to extradite Del Toro,
he appealed the decision, claiming his constitutional rights in
Mexico were being violated.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said the appeal could take weeks or months to
resolve, although they expressed confidence that Del Toro's capture
and incarceration in Mexico City will pass judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the delays have prompted spirited conversations
among Mexican officials, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Rep.
Dan Miller, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Miller _ who represents the Sarasota area _ called on the
Clinton administration to renegotiate the U.S.-Mexico extradition
treaty ``so that the possibility of capital punishment will not
interfere with the timely extradition of criminal suspects from
Mexico to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has filed a resolution in the House seeking a
renegotiation of the 1978 treaty signed in Mexico City by former
President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro is being held in the East Jail in Mexico City until his
appeal is heard and a decision is rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Bellush, who was 35 at the time of her death, was the
mother of six children, including two daughters from her previous
marriage to Blackthorne. James Bellush has since moved the children
to Sussex County, N.J., to be with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Bellush's body was found in her Sarasota home by one of
her daughters.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rocha, a golfing partner of Blackthorne's, sought a plea bargain
with Florida prosecutors. He released a statement from Gonzales
that implicates Blackthorne in his former wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales' statement accused Blackthorne, a San Antonio
businessman, of hatching the murder-for-hire scheme following a
bitter divorce and child custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Bellush family's move from Texas to Florida,
Gonzales told Texas Rangers, Rocha offered a $10,000 bounty for the
return of Blackthorne's daughters ``with no questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales told Rangers he repeated the offer to his cousin, Del
Toro, during a meeting in which Rocha was present.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Bellush's death prompted an international manhunt for Del
Toro, who was featured on the television program, ``America's Most
Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   His abandoned car was found in Austin, Texas, just days after
the slaying. Among the items investigators found in the car were a
.45-caliber handgun, a Sarasota hotel receipt and written
directions to Bellush's Florida home.

MUSIC MOVED BY THE SPIRIT THRIVES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEZ, Morocco _ In a palatial home in this ancient city, the
musicians of Said Guissi's Aissawa band sat on couches in a
semicircle, just doing their jobs. They were singing and drumming
and clapping, praising Allah and the Sufi masters and piling
syncopation on syncopation.
</P>
<P>
   As the rhythms multiplied, musicians raised straight six-foot
trumpets overhead, trading deep, dissonant antiphonal blasts.
Despite the presence of tourists, the Moroccans in the room treated
the music seriously. It wasn't just a house party: it was a
ceremony, from the Aissawa Sufi brotherhood that dated back to the
17th century.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the Moroccans stood up and let the music drive them
to frenzied, flailing dances, with their eyes rolling back in their
heads and their arms and legs working furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Friends stood by to guide the dancers away from people and
furniture; as one woman flew into a trance, with her long hair
streaming in all directions, her friend grabbed her feet to remove
her high heels. And when a song ended, the dancers collapsed like
marionettes let loose. ``The music takes you over completely,''
said one dancer after his trance. ``It is a healing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aissawa ceremony took place the same week as the fourth Fez
Festival of World Sacred Music, a series of concerts that
encompassed whirling dervishes from Turkey, Greek Byzantine chants,
Javanese gamelan, Irish chants, Iraqi classical maqam, Andalusian
Jewish songs, American spirituals, Spanish medieval cantigas,
Indian ragas and Sufi songs from Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   For all its variety, the festival was limited to music of
monotheism: Christianity, Judaism and Islam. It could have covered
an even broader terrain, from the stasis and clangor of Tibetan
Buddhist chanting to the drumming and dancing of West African
Yoruba ceremonies, and Fez festivals in coming years may do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   But even with its limitations, it was a festival whose time has
come, and perhaps a harbinger of similar gatherings elsewhere;
Music Village, an established world-music organization based in
London, is planning an ecumenical festival for 1999 called Sacred
Voices.
</P>
<P>
   The audience is snowballing for spirituality and the music that
expresses it. Spirituality is a loose and open-ended term; it has
been applied to Trappist monks and to people who meditate for a few
moments between cutthroat negotiating sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Books about magic and angels scale the best-seller list; pop
hits like Joan Osborne's ``One of Us'' ponder theological
questions. And music billing itself as spiritual, whether it's
Gregorian chant or Arvo Part's mystical minimalism or vaguely
exotic New Age noodlings, is increasingly available and clearly
profitable. When Madonna discovers spirituality, as she did on her
current album, ``Ray of Light,'' something is definitely in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Individual spiritual impulses are a private matter, but during
the 1990s they have added up to a longing for the sacred that seems
to span much of Western culture. As the year 2000 approaches in the
Western calendar, a sense of premillennial reckoning has many
people convinced that something is missing from our earthbound,
materialistic lives.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a religious revival at the end of every American
century, and as the 20th hurtles to a close, many people are
seeking magic, security or higher purpose. Where technology and
prosperity have turned out to be extremely mixed blessings,
spirituality promises a sense of wholeness in an atomized culture:
a healing thing.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual music, particularly from faraway, unfamiliar places,
also stokes multicultural longings: the idea that another culture
may have figured out something that's unknown or forgotten at home.
Artists in all fields have spent much of the 20th century learning
from what they used to call the ``primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacred art, not least sacred music, preserves ancient ways that
may yet have something to teach, or at least spur creative
misinterpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Music provides an especially appealing gateway to spiritual
feelings, if not necessarily spiritual ideas. Its impact is
nonverbal and immediate, more directly absorbed than complex
systems of belief.
</P>
<P>
   On recordings, music is portable, easy to separate from its
original context and ready to be appreciated on esthetic rather
than doctrinal terms. Meditative styles can become soothing
background music, a respite from the pace of ordinary life and the
attention-grabbing jolts of most pop. And hard-driving,
high-powered sacred songs, like the qawwali of Nusrat Fateh Ali
Khan, can double as party music.
</P>
<P>
   Sacred music offers qualities that are increasingly rare across
modern culture: an unhurried pace, a sense of certainty and a
strong, selfless passion. People often use art (and music in
particular) to compensate for something missing from their lives,
achieving in the symbolic realm what eludes them in reality.
</P>
<P>
   For secular consumers, a CD of sacred music can be a short cut
to the solace and stability provided by a longstanding tradition.
Like swallowing a handful of vitamins instead of cooking a
nutritious meal, the music provides some of the spiritual
nourishment without the time-consuming effort of learning a
philosophy or, for that matter, making the leap of faith. Enjoying
the music is the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to the many musicians who perform sacred music for
non-initiates, just having listeners' attention can be enough. The
performers are convinced that the music's properties can benefit
everyone who hears it, whether or not they understand the nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Even for nonbelievers, the knowledge that a musical work is tied
to a ritual _ not just an evening's performance _ gives it a
certain gravity, a kind of cultural and historical seal of
approval. Music that has long been used for rituals has been
market-tested, so to speak; it carries the proper texts, paces the
ceremonies correctly and, in some styles, changes the physiology of
receptive listeners.
</P>
<P>
   For outsiders, music that combines devotion with curative
purposes, like Aissawa, can be a painless and beautiful form of
alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In purely musical terms, there is nothing to set sacred music
apart from the secular. Sacred music can be as kinetic as Shinto
ceremonial drumming or as motionless as a chanted ``om''; it can be
as elaborately contrapuntal as a Bach Passion or as stark as a
cantor's unaccompanied line.
</P>
<P>
   It can be flamboyantly improvisational, like gospel singing, or
as fixed as the Verdi Requiem. Some sacred music is directly
functional, like the chants that originally marked off segments of
a monk's day from matins to evensong, or the Brazilian candomble
that summons the Afro-Brazilian deities known as orixas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   And some, like the Persian tradition of maqam, is concert music
built around mystical poetry, reflecting on the experience of union
with the divine rather than attempting to generate it.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, sacred music has three roles. It supplicates,
praising a deity (or deities) and requesting mercy and good
fortune. It meditates, seeking a mental state that carries singers
and listeners outside themselves to be directly receptive to the
divine. And it celebrates, making a joyful noise that tells the
world about the glories of faith.
</P>
<P>
   These three roles are not discrete; they mingle and fluctuate,
changing with every musical language and sometimes within a single
sacred work. The music and words can reinforce basic teaching,
cultivate awestruck devotion and channel it toward physical
release.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the efforts lavished on sacred pieces by composers
through the centuries, the music is not an end in itself; it is a
vehicle for the renewal of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Certain elements are shared by many kinds of sacred music: the
drones that fill resonant spaces like cathedrals and Sufi shrines,
the use of extended duration, the melismatic lines that use the
full flexibility of the human voice and the repetition that drives
a text into memory or can lead listeners to meditation or dancing.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sacred musics that don't use those elements,
secular musics that do and whole idioms _ like roots reggae _ that
can use exactly the same musical setting for a profession of faith
or a romantic come-on.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on local cultures and basic principles, some religious
musics try to leave behind earthy elements like catchy tunes and
propulsive rhythms. Plato, the Puritans and mainstream Islam have
all viewed music with distrust, lest its seductive powers distract
weak minds from loftier thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   But many other persuasions have accepted the power of music as a
gift from above, as the expression in sound of natural (or divinely
ordained) mathematical laws that govern the overtone series,
resonance and consonance. In many faiths, there is no doctrinal
separation between the sensual and the sacred, and listeners can
dance their way to transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   Sacred and secular composers have raided each other's treasures
through the centuries, imbedding folk tunes at the core of medieval
cantus firmus masses or annexing gospel call-and-response for
``What'd I Say.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockers like Jerry Lee Lewis savor their own blasphemy;
preachers like Al Green redefine soul love songs as gospel
dedicated to a higher love. Proselytizers are forever lifting
recent pop styles and attaching pious lyrics, though labeling as
``sacred'' the music of soft-rockers like Bob Carlisle or grunge
rockers-come-lately like Creed pushes the word past any useful
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The sacred music that matters is inherently conservative,
connected to a tradition that words and music proudly uphold. Where
icons are revered, there's no place for iconoclasm; where revealed
truths have been handed down through centuries, there's no great
premium on innovation.
</P>
<P>
   European composers writing for the church have generally evoked
archaic styles, using long-established structures and subordinating
some of their own willfulness to recognize links with past
generations. As a result, sacred music evolves at its own
deliberate speed _ rapidly in the case of gospel, glacially for
many kinds of chant _ and tends to stand outside secular trends.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas filter in from outside, but slowly and cautiously. For as
long as faith prevails, sacred music doesn't worry about
obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Music deals with the control of time, and secular idioms are, by
and large, content to entertain and manipulate listeners for as
long as the music is performed. But sacred music evokes a different
kind of time: the continuity of rituals performed regularly through
centuries, repeating in a weekly or monthly or annual rhythm, a
time frame larger than individual perception.
</P>
<P>
   Where most secular music tries to transfix listeners in the
present, sacred music promises to carry us beyond it. Past and
future are both implicit in sacred music, as they are in every
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an innate human need for ritual, or for something to
carry us beyond the everyday? In the 19th century, Richard Wagner
and others sought to elevate art to the status of religion, and in
modern Western culture many people are as likely to seek the
sublime in a piece of secular art as in a religious service.
</P>
<P>
   Many kinds of performances seek to fill such a need, with or
without theology attached, borrowing qualities of sacred music like
repetition and extended duration. Some people find a ritual
intensity in complete presentations of Wagner's Ring cycle; some go
out and dance all night to house music at a club, losing themselves
in an overwhelming beat. But that beat is punctuated by voices that
are reminders of gospel zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, what draws outsiders to sacred music is the voices,
the sounds of human beings determined to embody something greater
than themselves. Vocals are almost a constant in sacred music,
whether carrying a prescribed text or expressing wordless devotion,
as if deities in every faith demand human witnesses to connect the
earthly and the divine.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions (like the recent series of gospel
steel-guitar recordings on Arhoolie), but nearly every sacred
tradition treats belief as a personal vow, not something that can
be attested to with instruments as proxies.
</P>
<P>
   Sacred voices can be magnificently individual, like Aretha
Franklin testifying or Alim Kassimov, a singer from Azerbaijan,
turning devotional poetry into finely turned, soaring melismas full
of incandescent fervor and pinpoint control.
</P>
<P>
   Other singers carefully and selflessly execute their music, like
chanting Buddhist monks or like the women of Anonymous 4, bringing
their otherworldly purity to medieval counterpoint. Style, creed
and era aside, the music presents itself with something that has
almost disappeared from the arts: humility before the power of
God(s), inspiration and time. Even for skeptics, the music itself
is something to believe in.

FIKRETE GABRE, ENTREPRENEUR AND ETHIOPIAN ACTIVIST; AT 42

<P>
   Fikrete Gabre, 42, an innovative Ethiopian entrepreneur and
community activist who had been living in Amherst, Mass., died June
9 while staying with family members in California. Her death was
attributed to complications from hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Zato, a village in southwestern Ethiopia, Ms. Gabre was
best-known for developing Siljo Sauce _ a traditional African blend
of ginger, garlic, and other spices which she made and marketed to
raise funds to create the first water system in her
drought-stricken hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Donating 20 percent of profits, she raised thousands of dollars
and generated considerable publicity for her village before a
severe case of hepatitis forced her to reduce her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; From a family of 14, Ms. Gabre came to the United States in
1974. A military dictator had closed all the local schools and she
wanted to get a college education. She eventually earned bachelor's
and master's degrees in labor relations at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst and a second master's degree, in social
work, at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In California, she also organized the first multicultural,
multilingual Ethiopian Community Resource Center in Oakland, which
she directed from 1983 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   With help from many Massachusetts residents, she launched her
Siljo Sauce project in 1991. Drought had devastated her village and
social progress, particularly for women, was being blocked by the
all-consuming search for water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water,'' she observed, ``is the lifeline for every living
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her mother, W-Maryan Ayemo of Zato, Ethiopia; four
sisters, Boge of Los Angeles, and Ceebo, Zenebeh, and Sheyae, all
of Addis Ababa; and four brothers, Tsedek of Nova Scotia, Berhanu
of Addis Ababa, and Abera and Solomon, both of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fikrete talked her mind. She was a ball of energy, constantly
doing things, creating things. She had such a huge heart for
everybody,'' said her sister Boge. ``We will carry her dreams.''

ANALYSIS: NIGERIA'S NEW LEADER MOVES QUICKLY TOWARD REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the moment Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar was named last week to
succeed the late ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigerians began
speculating whether a reformist era might be at hand after years of
ruinous dictatorship. After all, Abubakar was long reputed to be a
prim professional among Nigeria's politicized and immensely rich
generals.
</P>
<P>
   With his order Monday to release a core group of the country's
political prisoners, including an internationally respected former
head of state, Abubakar sent the first clear signal of his
intention to bring about an overhaul in the way his country is run.
And, more than that, he conveyed a sense of urgency in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Though the general's position is precarious, Western diplomats
and Nigerian analysts say he has decided to move decisively and not
wait to consolidate his power. To delay, they say, would risk
falling victim to powerful enemies at opposite extremes of his
country's no-holds-barred politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Abubakar had no choice but to move forward if he
wanted to salvage his country and protect himself,'' said one
Western diplomat. ``To have postponed making difficult decisions
about democracy and prisoners, or to defer the issue of a
transition to civilian rule, would have been to play the game of
his enemies. The army would have devoured him itself, and failing
that there would have been a major risk of a civilian uprising.''
</P>
<P>
   On one side, Abubakar faces his own army, an institution whose
top officers have grown fat on years of power, and many of whose
younger leaders have climbed the rungs of power awaiting their turn
at the trough.
</P>
<P>
   As army chief of staff, Abubakar had no direct command over the
mechanized units that typically determine who holds or takes power
in the country. Moreover, the new head of state had none of the
huge personal wealth of his predecessors, having avoided the kinds
of army jobs that allow top brass to dole out lucrative contracts
to other officers, siphoning off kickbacks and purchasing staff
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Nigeria's large and well-developed opposition
was emboldened by the death of Abacha, who had a reputation as the
most iron-fisted leader his country of 105 million people had ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   And because Abacha and his military predecessors had so
regularly flouted their pledges to restore democracy or arrange
transitions to civilian rule, Abubakar could promise little that
would make a dent in the distrust of a hardened political class.
</P>
<P>
   For many veterans of Nigeria's democracy movement, the only
politically acceptable tactic is to take on the army head on, and
with the army divided, they feel the future is now.
</P>
<P>
   People both inside and outside the army say that Abubakar's best
hope _ and decisive test _ of engineering a viable transition
toward civilian rule is to work with the perceived winner of the
country's only previous democratic elections, in 1993, Moshood K.O.
Abiola, who was imprisoned by Abacha and remains in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In an arrangement that would recall for many the release of
Nelson Mandela from a South African prison in 1990, this scenario
goes, Abubakar would involve Abiola in negotiations aimed at easing
the military out of power, much as Mandela helped negotiate a soft
landing for South Africa's apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say whether this hope will come about in
Nigeria, and many hurdles remain.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar's first gesture upon taking power in an unusual
post-midnight swearing in ceremony, less than 24 hours after
Abacha's death, was to commit himself to his predecessor's
previously declared but widely discounted deadline for an Oct. 1
handover to an elected civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts of the Nigerian military say that this pledge was
intended more as a bid to outflank the army, whose powerful
factions are known to be opposed to any democratic change, than an
effort to placate a deeply skeptical civilian opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The new leader's second hurdle, these analysts say, was to
prevent a showdown between pro-democracy groups sworn to carry out
a series of protests linked to the fifth anniversary last Friday of
the national elections that the military annulled after the
apparent victory of Abiola, a millionaire businessman from the
country's south.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the opposition to cancel Friday's demonstrations were
ignored, but security forces were relatively restrained in putting
them down, marking a major change from the wanton brutality of the
Abacha years.
</P>
<P>
   With the threat of strife defused, Abubakar then freed the
former head of state, the retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, and seven
other prominent prisoners, buying him international praise and a
more sympathetic attitude from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A clash between an overzealous army and the June 12 protesters
would have badly undercut Abubakar,'' said Walter Carrington, a
former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria. ``The restraint that the army
showed and the subsequent release of the prisoners suggests
strongly that the new leadership has gained control over hardliners
in the army. What we will likely see now is a progressive release
of more and more political prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the country's most important political prisoner is
Abiola, the jailed presidential candidate. And ultimately, both the
opposition and much of the outside world's judgment of Abubakar
will depend on his handling of Abiola, whose claim to the
presidency is considered by most to be legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the opposition demands now, almost no one in Nigeria
expects the military to simply surrender power to Abiola. For one
thing, Nigeria's military high command is dominated by northerners,
including the new head of state himself, who after years of control
are wary of an outright takeover by southerners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many in the south, and even beyond, no credible
elections in Nigeria can be organized until the nation comes to
terms with the cancellation of Abiola's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Regional and ethnic antagonisms like these could scuttle any
negotiated arrangements with Abiola. But for now many Nigerians
suspect that discussions may already be under way to secure his
release in a negotiated framework, providing him some recognition
and perhaps a large role in transitional arrangements, while
keeping the field open for other candidates in a fresh election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no point in pretending that Abiola didn't win an
election any longer,'' said one senior Nigerian military adviser
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``What will have to be worked
out is an arrangement with Abiola that allows the country to move
forward.''

   NEW YORK _ The American Film Institute announced the winners
Tuesday night in a contest for the 100 best American films of all
time. And the winner was ... the perennial favorite, ``Citizen

GIVE ME A GAME I CAN PUT MY HANDS AROUND

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now seems as good a time as any for all red-blooded Americans to
take the pledge. So please rise, stand at attention, and place your
hand over your red card:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I, (state your name), as American as an episode of
Springer
</P>
<P>
   Do hereby swear loyalty to the sports that made my country great
</P>
<P>
   And promise from this day forward to never utter the word nil
</P>
<P>
   And while I will always encourage my children to play any sport
that pleases them, be it indigenous to our country or something
imported
</P>
<P>
   I will forever remind them that it is the birthright of all
Americans
</P>
<P>
   To pick up a ball, any size and any shape, with their hands (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   About now, the dozens of soccer fans in this audience have
already reached for the yellow card in their pocket and are holding
it up to my face.
</P>
<P>
   I do not blame them. They are the Sons of Pele and Maradona, and
every minority group deserves to be treated with respect. They are
harmless cult members, and one should seek to understand the root
of their obsession in the course of avoiding it.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup began in France a week ago and will continue on
into July, with the whole world allegedly watching the biggest
sporting spectacle on the planet. An asteroid the size of Macedonia
could hit the earth today, and one feels certain that the world's
soc-ocracy would insist the tournament go on for the greater good
of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   The point here has less to do with those we've angered than the
uncounted millions of Americans who go through life never thinking
very seriously about soccer.
</P>
<P>
   It is galling that those locked up in soccermania look upon
those of us who aren't as heathen. They cluck at us for being
narrow-minded, xenophoboic or just plain stupid for not getting
caught up in this event.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is a fine sport. It's great for kids to play, because it
emphasizes fitness and does not discriminate. I enjoy watching
World Cup games, because I know that the teams involved, with one
or two exceptions like the Etats-Unis, represent the best players
in the world. It's great theatre.
</P>
<P>
   But I do not want to be upbraided if my attention span is short
and I decline to get caught up in the hysteria. Neither the sport
nor the World Cup requires the presence or enrollment of the United
States of Apathy for its worldwide success.
</P>
<P>
   Americans did not grow up playing soccer the way other countries
did, which is the most obvious reason why many of us do not care.
In Brazil, Europe and elsewhere, children were given a ball at the
age of 3 and encouraged to kick it.
</P>
<P>
   America's children took to other things and made them their own.
The country imported cricket and turned it into baseball. It felt a
country bristling with energy would find it more entertaining and
physical if players ran the ball more often than they kicked it,
giving birth to our version and obsession of football.
</P>
<P>
   (It is telling that a country as large as ours can not field a
team that's competitive with a country, Germany, that's roughly the
size of Massachusetts. Let me be the latest to also note that the
big U.S. win in the '94 World Cup, against Colombia, came as a
result of an own goal, and the poor lad who scored it was
assassinated.)
</P>
<P>
   In the process of baseball or football taking root, no one in
America felt the need to call foreigners stupid for not caring
about baseball or football. But the opposite is true; we're
considered dullards for not embracing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is part of the soc-ocracy, because corporate
America -- Coke, Nike, Fedex, Master Card, ABC/ESPN -- never misses
a chance to co-opt an event and turn it into cash. In their own
way, they are the worst practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   For example: An ad for Master Card Tuesday during ESPN's
coverage used fleeting images of soccer fans dressed in party
regalia and the words ``faith, hope and glory'' to get its message
across. The spot ended with an aside that the company is a
``supporter of the beautiful game.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-line message: soccer beauty, and shame on all of us
who aren't smart enough to have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Next time someone says TV is benign, slap his antennae.
</P>
<P>
   I can see a day when America gets excited about soccer -- 1999,
when the Women's World Cup is played on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the birth of gender equity in the '70s and the
opportunities afforded women, every sports-inclined daughter has
probably played soccer at some stage of her life. With baseball and
football essentially prohibited, soccer was given a chance to
become part of a female athlete's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. soccer team stands on even terms internationally, too,
since the organization of women's play is relatively young.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, there isn't anything soccer offers that a
red-blooded American can't find somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Low-scoring games? We've got hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime shootouts? We've got extra innings and sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   International talent? We've got Toni Kukoc, Chan Ho Park and
Junior Seau.
</P>
<P>
   Hooligans? We've got Dennis Rodman and base brawls.
</P>
<P>
   And at last check, there hasn't been a single murder of an
athlete as a result of a baseball, football or basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   We're a hands-on country, and I see no reason to apologize for
it.

TEXAS MURDER MAY NOT FALL UNDER US HATE STATUTE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As hateful as the brutal murder of James Byrd Jr.
was last week in Jasper, Texas, federal authorities may not be able
to prosecute the slaying as a hate crime, lawmakers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law on hate crimes requires prosecutors to prove
not only that a crime was racially motivated but also that the
victim was engaged in an activity specifically protected under the
statute, such as going to school or work, serving on a jury or
using public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy and the other lawmakers said the short
list of activities protected under the law has prevented hate crime
prosecutions in many racially motivated crimes in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the limitations, federal prosecutors are fighting
bigotry with one hand tied behind their backs,'' Kennedy said at a
news conference as he called on Congress to pass a stronger hate
crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper police said Byrd, 49, a disabled grandfather and amateur
musician, was walking home from a family party when he accepted a
ride from three white supremacists in a pickup truck. The three men
allegedly beat Byrd, chained him to the back of the truck and
dragged him more than two miles on a paved country road, tearing
him to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence indicates the murder was racially motivated,
Jasper police said. But the county prosecutor, Guy Adam Gray, who
wants to seek the death penalty in the case, said the killing may
not qualify as a capital crime under Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Jasper police summoned the FBI to investigate the
slaying as a possible hate crime, which could be punishable by the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy and several other lawmakers said the current
law is so restrictive that Byrd, by accepting a ride from the white
supremacists, may not have been engaging in an activity that is
specifically protected under the federal hate crime statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be no federal jurisdiction to prosecute those
responsible'' for Byrd's murder, said Representative John Conyers
Jr. of Michigan, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee. ``And the fact is, there should be federal
jurisdiction over crimes so hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that Kennedy, Conyers and others filed last year
would permit federal prosecutors to pursue hate crime charges if
they believe cases are motivated by the victim's race, color,
national origin or religion. The list of protected activities would
be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which is scheduled for a hearing July 8 before the
Senate Judiciary Committee, would also expand the hate crimes law
to cover crimes motivated by a victim's gender, sexual orientation
or disability.

STUDY FINDS ELDERLY RECEIVE LITTLE PAIN TREATMENT IN NURSING HOMES

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Researchers studying elderly cancer patients in
nursing homes have found that many are severely undertreated for
pain and more than a quarter of those who complain of pain,
especially blacks and the oldest of the old, are given no pain
medication, even aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the largest of its kind, is all the more troubling,
experts say, because as hospital stays grow shorter and the elderly
population increases, more and more old people with cancer are
living out the end of their lives in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The research involved 13,625 cancer patients in five states,
including New York. It found that patients older than 85 were about
half as likely to be treated for pain as those between the ages of
65 and 74, and that blacks were half as likely as whites to receive
pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, nursing home staff and in-house doctors may
give up on patients who they know are going to die,'' said Dr.
Giovanni Gambassi, a main author of the study in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association. ``There is no
acceptable excuse for not treating pain appropriately in terminally
ill patients.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the American Nursing Home Association, which
represents 11,000 nursing homes across the country, said the new
study raises ``legitimate issues that bear close scrutiny.'' But
the spokesman, Tom Burke, also complained that nursing homes were
being unfairly singled out, saying the problem of undertreatment of
pain cuts across all areas of medicine. ``I'd be hard-pressed to
think a nursing home would do better than an oncology ward,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts do not fully understand why the very old and minorities
are more vulnerable to having their pain left untreated, but
several theories are circulating, said Dr. Kathleen Foley, chief of
the pain and palliative care service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York City. One is that outright prejudice is
at work, particularly in the case of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Another, she said, is that these patients ``are used to being in
pain and suffering and therefore don't complain about it.'' A third
is that they don't want to be impaired by the side effects of
medication. In addition, experts say that nursing home workers are
poorly trained to recognize pain.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Dr. Foley and other experts in end-of-life
care have long complained that their colleagues underestimate and
undertreat pain and that patients' quality of life could be vastly
improved if doctors paid attention to this problem.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, patients themselves have taken up the cause;
fear of dying a protacted, painful death has fueled the movement to
legalize assisted suicide, which in turn has brought the issue of
pain management, also called palliative care, out of the medical
fraternity and into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But while the lack of attention to pain has been well-documented
in a variety of medical settings, including hospital oncology
wards, only a few small studies have examined the problem in the
nation's nursing homes. That is why the new study, conducted by an
international team of Italian, British and American scientists, is
so important, Dr. Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new information, original information,'' she said.
``It is, for the first time, defining the epidemiology and the
ethnography of pain in the elderly population.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There are 19,000 nursing homes in the United States, and experts
who study life inside them say they are particularly ill-equipped
to care for patients in pain. Many nursing home patients,
particularly the very elderly, are demented and unable to tell
those responsible for them how they feel. As a result, nurses and
nurse's aides must rely on other indicators like moaning, writhing
and crying to determine when a patient is pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the nursing home, there is not a lot of knowledge about how
to manage pain,'' said Dr. Mathy Mezey, a gerontologist and
professor of nursing at New York University. ``Most of the staff
has not been prepared in good palliative care, and that is both the
nursing home staff and the primary care physicians who are managing
the residents.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, most nursing homes do not have on-site
pharmacies that would allow them to dispense pain medication
easily. And many do not have the facilities to store addictive
narcotics like morphine, which must be kept under lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   For their study, Gambassi and his colleagues examined patient
evaluations collected by the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration from 1,492 nursing homes in New York, Kansas, Maine,
Mississippi, and South Dakota. From 1992 to 1995, the years covered
by the study, more than 360,000 new patients in these nursing homes
were given detailed evaluations when admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Of those patients, the researchers identified 13,625 to study,
all older than 65 and all diagnosed with cancer or other ailments.
The vast majority, 89 percent, of the patients were white, and 59
percent were women.
</P>
<P>
   While pain is often a daily fact of life for patients with
cancer, the study found that pain often went unrecorded among the
nursing home patients. In an interview, Gambassi said the study
found that from 25 to 40 percent of the patients experienced ``some
degree of pain on a daily basis,'' a figure he believes reflects
both the inability of nursing home staff to diagnose pain in
patients unable to speak, as well patients' reluctance to complain
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oldest patients are sometimes reluctant to report pain for
a variety of reasons,'' he said. ``There is fear that reporting
pain would take physicians' time away from their cancer. And
somebody might believe that pain is just a natural part of aging,
that there is nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4,003 patients who were diagnosed as having pain, 26
percent were given no medication at all. Sixteen percent were given
a simple analgesic, such as aspirin or Tylenol. Thirty-two percent
were given codeine or other weak pain relievers, and 26 percent
received morphine.
</P>
<P>
   The older the patient, the less likely he was to receive strong
medication, the study found. Among patients who received morphine,
for instance, 38 percent fell between the ages of 65 and 74. Just
13 percent were older than 85.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Gambassi said, cannot be explained by biology.
``There is no physiological reason to believe that as you age, you
feel less pain,'' he said. ``That is definitely not true.
Eventually, it is the opposite _ you feel more pain'' with age.

DAILY FRENCH IN FRANCE POSTCARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paris is many things, right? Like what?
</P>
<P>
   City of light? OK, I'll buy that. The sun, when it peeks through
the imposing clouds, doesn't set until nearly 10 p.m. But we seem
to get much more rain than sunshine, so maybe ``city of falling
water'' is more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   City of romance? Previous trips tell me this is true, but I can
assure you there is very little romance in the press center at
Porte de Versailles or in my hotel room at Gare de L'est, where I
seem to spend the vast majority of my time. Lots of, uh, romantic
fare on TV, when every channel isn't devoted to soccer.
</P>
<P>
   City of arrogance? The Parisian attitude, well documented ---
and believe me, I can tell you tales --- seems to have disappeared
for the World Cup. People are helpful, friendly, and my refrain of
``Parlez vous Anglais?'' gets a far more positive response than it
has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   City of fine cuisine? I'm not so sure about this. The crepes are
great, and I do like the Chinese restaurant next to my hotel, but
the French fare seems to rely a little too heavily on undercooked
--- or even raw --- beef and heavy, heavy sauces. The baguettes are
wonderful, oui, but is there such a thing as sit-down dining for
less than $25?
</P>
<P>
   City of monuments? The French, it is said, hated the Tour
d'Eiffel when it was unveiled, but I never get tired of looking at
it. The Arc d'Triomphe, when lit up in gold after dark, is a
beautiful site. Sacre Coeur on Montmarte, which reminds the Gauls
of a big, fluffy marshmallow, is beautiful from afar. The Palais
Royale and the Louvre make the Rue de Rivoli one of the world's
great thoroughfares. Throw in the Hotel Invalides (where Napolean's
tomb, among other things, resides), Notre Dame (the most famous of
gothic cathedrals, although inferior to Chartres), Ste. Chapelle
(nothing on the outside, but incredible stained glass indoors), La
Defense (a wonderful, modern structure, sort of a huge, hollow
square meant as a counterpoint to the Arc d'Triomphe) and dozens of
other imposing structures, and you could spend weeks just looking
at buildings.
</P>
<P>
   City of shopping? I suppose, but it's not like I've got the time
or the cash (or the room in my luggage) to acquire more stuff. I'll
leave this one for someone else to decide.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about Paris, I've found, is how easy it is to
get around. The Metro is Europe's most comprehensive subway
(although it would be nice if it ran after 1 a.m.), the bus system
is easy to use (and offers an inexpensive way to see the town), and
the taxis are relatively inexpensive.

SERB LEADER PLEDGES TO HOLD TALKS ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin, his country teetering on the
brink of economic meltdown, needs cash. And Yugoslavian strongman
Slobodan Milosevic, waging a brutal crackdown in Kosovo but wary of
Western military intervention, needs time.
</P>
<P>
   As the conflict in the mainly Albanian southern Serbian province
intensified, both leaders Tuesday made strides toward getting what
they need, but appeared to make little headway on ending the crisis
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a Kremlin meeting with Yeltsin, Milosevic promised to hold
talks with moderate Albanian leaders in Kosovo and accepted other
conditions set by the US and other Western nations to head off
military intervention by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement may buy Milosevic some time. But the Serbian
leader flatly refused the West's main demand, the withdrawal of
Serbian security forces who have been conducting what Western
nations say is ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
make up 90 percent of the population of around two million.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders hailed as a breakthrough the results of the
meeting, held one day after NATO staged a massive show of force in
the skies over Kosovo's borders with Albania and Macedonia. That
brought angry protests from Moscow, which opposes the use of force
against Serbia, and which has loudly protested NATO's eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But while maintaining its prickly opposition to the West's
military alliance, Russia badly needs a bailout from Western
lending organizations to help stem a financial crisis that has seen
stocks dive 60 percent since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian analysts, like Georgy Bovt of the newspaper Segodnya,
have wondered how long the Kremlin can keep up a foreign policy
that appears to fly in the face of Western objectives while at the
same time negotiating for a reported $10 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting helped answer that question. Nominally, it was
called so that Yeltsin, acting on behalf of Moscow's Western
allies, could exert some of the influence Russia is said to hold
over its fellow Slavic, Orthodox Christian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Russia's influence over the Serbs has been widely
recognized as minimal since the outbreak of violence in the former
Yugoslavia in 1991, the same year of the Soviet Union's collapse.
Instead, a more plausible reason for Tuesday's Kremlin meeting with
Milosevic was to allow the embattled Yeltsin to raise the tattered
banner of Russia's status as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Russia, the Kosovo problem cannot be solved,'' Yeltsin
said on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   A Kremlin spokesman said President Clinton had called Yeltsin to
congratulate him on the successful negotiations with Milosevic. But
in Washington, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was more
cautious, and suggested that the option of a Western military
intervention was ``still on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some progress but (Milosevic) did not meet the
primary points that the Contact Group raised,'' Albright said,
referring to the grouping of Russia, the US and other European
nations who are trying to regulate the Yugoslavia crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic promised to allow international aid agencies access to
Kosovo villages cut off by the fighting, and agreed to resume
negotiations with a moderate Kosovo Albanian leader. But Milosevic
said that his troops were targeting ``terrorists,'' not civilians,
and ruled out a withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no reasons or grounds for the Yugoslav army not to
be on the territory of Yugoslavia,'' he told reporters in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   That stance, unacceptable to the West, is strongly supported in
Russia's parliament, which will likely issue a statement condemning
NATO's show of strength in the Balkans when it convenes Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But is far from clear how widespread popular indignation over
Kosovo is in Russia. Domestic economic matters, rather than foreign
policy, is what makes Russian blood boil these days.
</P>
<P>
   The Western nightmare about Russia is that an economic collapse
could bring to power ultranationalists who would reverse years of
post-Cold War cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, despite the Yeltsin administration's
uncomfortable political stance on Kosovo, economic assistance is
still in the cards. As Gordon Brown, British Chancellor of the
Exchequer, said last week: ``Russia's economic stability is vitally
important to all our interests.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS MEMBERS CALL FOR STRENGTHENING FEDERAL HATE CRIMES LAW
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of Congress members called Tuesday for
passing legislation that would strengthen the federal government's
authority to prosecute hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The members held a news conference following news reports of a
black man being dragged to death behind a truck near Jasper, Texas,
a black man in New Orleans reporting that a group of whites dragged
him for 2 1/2 blocks before setting him free, and a black teenager
in Belleville, Ill., reporting that three white youths dragged him
by his shirt until the cloth ripped and he went under the wheels of
a car they were driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the events near Jasper, Texas, have made all too clear,
racism and racial violence continue to plague our nation,'' said
Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who appeared with Sens. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. ``As
a nation and as a people, we must renounce violence and embrace the
teachings of non-violence. We must renounce racism and embrace
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation, which lawmakers said would be
considered in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees as soon as
next month, would remove several obstacles in prosecuting hate
crimes, said Michael Lieberman, counsel for the Anti-Defamation
League, a Washington-based civil rights advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law requires that prosecutors prove a victim was
chosen due to race, religion or nationality. Under the proposed
legislation, this definition would be expanded to include victims
who were selected because of gender, sexual orientation or
disability.
</P>
<P>
   And under the proposed legislation, prosecutors would no longer
have to prove that the victim of a hate crime was engaged in a
federally protected act such as voting at the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The need for a new law is not just in the recent attacks, but in
the rising number of crimes committed based on someone's race,
Wyden said. In 1996, there were 8,759 such crimes reported to the
FBI, a 9 percent increase over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate and bias have left an ugly mark on society,'' said Wyden.
``We're trying to close the loopholes in the federal law. It just
seems to be that if you beat a woman or attack a disabled person or
bash a gay person, you ought to face the federal government. This
is intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a longtime champion of legislation that would expand
the federal authority to combat hate crimes, said he expected an
uphill fight to pass legislation. He predicted that some members
would oppose it on a constitutional basis, and others would oppose
it because it protects groups such as homosexuals who some
lawmakers believe should not be given special protection.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always those who will find something to oppose,''
Kennedy said, following the press conference. But he said that he
hoped that the recent racial attacks in Texas, Illinois, and
Louisiana would persuade both chambers that the time has come to
pass a strong measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes tear at the heart and soul of our country, and we
need to do all we can to combat them,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would go a long way toward plugging the
holes in the current law, said Christopher Edley, professor of law
at Harvard University. Strengthening the law would make it easier
for the federal government to step in an prosecute cases like the
one in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government issued indictments in only 40 out of the
8,759 incidents of hate crime in 1996, in large part because of the
restrictions placed on federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, racist groups have opted to operate in a more
clandestine manner, Edley said. The proposed legislation would
remove barriers keeping federal and state law enforcement officials
from working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial hatred and related violence is like a cancer without
visible tumors; you can't always see where its going,'' Edley said.
``That's why this legislation is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis sees it, the legislation is important because it taking
a step toward recognizing that ``racial hatred threatens not just
the victims of hate crime, but each and every one of us.''

<P>
   Fikrete Gabre, 42, an innovative Ethiopian entrepreneur and
community activist who had been living in Amherst, Mass., died June
9 while staying with family members in California. Her death was
attributed to complications from hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Zato, a village in southwestern Ethiopia, Ms. Gabre was
best-known for developing Siljo Sauce _ a traditional African blend
of ginger, garlic, and other spices which she made and marketed to
raise funds to create the first water system in her
drought-stricken hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Donating 20 percent of profits, she raised thousands of dollars
and generated considerable publicity for her village before a
severe case of hepatitis forced her to reduce her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; From a family of 14, Ms. Gabre came to the United States in
1974. A military dictator had closed all the local schools and she
wanted to get a college education. She eventually earned bachelor's
and master's degrees in labor relations at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst and a second master's degree, in social
work, at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In California, she also organized the first multicultural,
multilingual Ethiopian Community Resource Center in Oakland, which
she directed from 1983 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   With help from many Massachusetts residents, she launched her
Siljo Sauce project in 1991. Drought had devastated her village and
social progress, particularly for women, was being blocked by the
all-consuming search for water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water,'' she observed, ``is the lifeline for every living
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her mother, W-Maryan Ayemo of Zato, Ethiopia; four
sisters, Boge of Los Angeles, and Ceebo, Zenebeh, and Sheyae, all
of Addis Ababa; and four brothers, Tsedek of Nova Scotia, Berhanu
of Addis Ababa, and Abera and Solomon, both of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fikrete talked her mind. She was a ball of energy, constantly
doing things, creating things. She had such a huge heart for
everybody,'' said her sister Boge. ``We will carry her dreams.''

&HT;        DENVER SERVICE CENTER WORKERS TO BE SLASHED, PARK DESIGNS
PRIVATIZED
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 16 -- Half of the Denver Service Center's
workers will lose their jobs and 90 percent of the center's park
design work will be contracted out under a plan released Tuesday to
streamline the government agency responsible for building a
$785,000 outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting a five-month study, the National Academy of
Public Administration (NAPA) determined that the center is riddled
with inefficiencies, poor management and has almost no
accountability -- which has cost millions of dollars of taxpayer
money.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakewood-based Denver Service Center is in charge of
designing and contracting all major National Parks Service
construction projects -- supervising and building everything from
monuments to toilets in the parks. Last year, the center became the
subject of notoriety and scrutiny after designing and supervising
the construction of a $785,000 two-hole toilet in Pennsylvania and
a $681,000 2,030-square-foot home for a Park Service employee.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was commissioned by Congress at a cost of
$400,000, recommended that the center contract out 90 percent of
its design work, all of which is currently done in-house.
</P>
<P>
   To carry this out, the center will have to cut about 250 of 500
full- time equivalent (FTE) employees in fiscal 1999, which begins
in October, said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, who chairs the House
Appropriations subcommittee in charge of the Parks Service. An FTE
is an accounting method for combining full- and part-time workers
into a standardized 40-hour work week. This means at least 250
Denver Service Center employees and perhaps more could lose their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Regula and National Parks Service Director Robert Stanton
endorsed the plan. The Parks Service ``intends to fully implement
their recommendations on improving the National Park Service
construction program,'' Stanton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recommendations of the panel points the way for us to trim
excessive cost controls by contracting with private sector
architectural and engineering firms, and by adopting
industry-accepted standards,'' said Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   The changes -- including the job cuts -- will be included in the
Department of the Interior appropriations bill that will be
unveiled today(Wednesday), Regula said, calling the report ``an
excellent blueprint for us to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended that the center adopt standardized
designs rather than custom designing each building and fix problems
with project management to insure accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, park superintendents would be responsible
for specific construction projects, increasing their authority and
training.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fragmented management and lack of accountability that
led to the dramatic overspending in cases like the infamous
outhouse, said Royce Hanson, who chaired the panel that wrote the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everyone's in charge, no one's in charge,'' said Hanson,
a professor of political economy at University of Texas at Dallas.
``The fragmentation of responsibility makes it difficult to
pinpoint the person who is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson said the panel did not know exactly how much money could
be saved under the new plan, but estimated savings of at least 10
percent of construction project costs for the Parks Service.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he could not estimate how much the Pennsylvania
outhouse should have cost, only saying that if the new system were
in place, they would have saved ``a lot.''

FINAL OUTCOME ERASED LEGAL ERRORS IN WOODWARD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG   AND JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It wasn't pretty and mistakes were made, but the trial
of Louise Woodward ultimately ended with a decision that was
legally justified, Massachusetts' highest court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court's 46-page decision is a dissertation
on what went wrong with the trial, but in the final analysis the
justices determined that any errors of law were rendered harmless
by the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court correctly evaluated a case where there was plenty of
error to go around,'' said Boston lawyer Morris Goldings. ``The
system has a way of correcting its own errors, sometimes
fitfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC said Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel erred when he
granted a defense request that the jury be barred from considering
the less serious charge of manslaughter. The jury found Woodward
guilty of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Zobel, the high court ruled, was able to right his own wrong by
later reducing the jury verdict to manslaughter _ which the SJC
suggested was the appropriate verdict because there was no evidence
of prior abuse by Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there was no evidence in this case of repeated caretaker
abuse, the judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that
the jury verdict of murder was not proportionate with convictions
in other cases,'' Justice Margaret H. Marshall wrote for the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Woodward and her lawyers last year to ask Zobel
to prevent the jury from considering the manslaughter option was a
moment of high legal drama.
</P>
<P>
   That so-called ``all or nothing strategy'' was based on the
belief the prosecution didn't present enough evidence to warrant a
murder conviction. Without the manslaughter option, the defense
gambled that the jury would be forced to return a not guilty
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC, however, said it has historically ``declined to
penalize defendants who adopt an all-or-nothing strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one of Woodward's lawyers Tuesday said he would
reconsider the strategy if given a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We engaged in a strategy that resulted in conviction of
second-degree murder,'' said Harvey Silverglate. ``If you ask me,
`Would I do it the same way again?' I would have to have my head
examined, wouldn't I? ... I doubt very much we would do it the same
way again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the SJC determined that the manslaughter conviction was
appropriate, the court made it clear it was not exonerating
Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not view the judgment against Woodward as a light
matter,'' Marshall wrote. ``She stands guilty of causing an
infant's violent death. The outcome of this criminal trial most
assuredly was not an acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC decision also was seen as a strong endorsement of the
broad and powerful discretion given to trial judges in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trial judge has lots of discretion to basically do the right
thing,'' said Boston College Law School professor Robert Bloom, who
wrote ``Constitutional Criminal Procedure.'' ``The judge has a
responsibility in every criminal case, regardless of the jury's
decision, to seek justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, challenges to cases in which a judge reduces a verdict
in Massachusetts are rare. Since 1979, 10 reductions were appealed
and seven of those were upheld.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC decision Tuesday was not without its detractors,
including three of the court's seven justices who issued a
dissenting opinion on whether or not the sentence for Woodward was
too lenient. Zobel sentenced Woodward to the 279 days she had
already spent in prison awaiting the outcome of her trial.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John M. Greaney, writing for the dissenters, said Zobel
moved too quickly to sentence Woodward after throwing out the
jury's verdict, ``resulting in a sense of unease that permeated the
proceedings that followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters also concluded it appeared that Zobel
``identified himself with Woodward's cause, compromising the
public's confidence in the integrity and impartiality of our
courts.''

 &HT;    Tuscon cable buy solidifies Cox strength in Southwest
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In its second major purchase in the past two months,
Cox Communications has bought several cable TV systems in Arizona,
including one in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company is buying the systems, which have a
total of 115,000 subscribers, from Tele-Communications Inc. The
other systems are in Sierra Vista and Pima County, which includes
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The deal closed late Monday evening, with approval of the change
in ownership by the Tucson City Council. The council's approval
came on the last day the deal could go through.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is buying the Tucson system with proceeds
from another sale and needed to close the purchase Monday to take
advantage of tax credits associated with those proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase makes Cox Communications the largest cable operator
in Arizona, where it already owns the Phoenix system. With 578,000
subscribers, the Phoenix system is the company's largest.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also anchors Cox Communications' position as the
largest operator in the Southwest. It has 1.4 million subscribers
in the region now, including 484,000 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   That number will swell to more than 1.8 million with the
addition of Tucson and Las Vegas, a $1.33 billion deal announced in
May. It's expected to close at the end of the year, giving Cox
Communications an additional 319,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Las Vegas will bump Cox Communications up to
fifth place from sixth among the largest cable TV operators.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson purchase is part of a Cox Communications strategy to
concentrate subscribers in large clusters. Other clusters are in
Virginia, including Hampton Roads and Roanoke, and New England. The
Southwest is the company's biggest play.
</P>
<P>
   The many of the cities in this region are considered among the
fastest-growing in the region. They include Las Vegas, Phoenix and
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region has tremendous residential and commercial growth,
which makes it very attractive to us,'' said company spokeswoman
Ellen East. ``This deal strengthens our presence in the Southwest,
where the majority of our customers are.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications plans to begin immediately upgrading Tucson
to a digital system, said East. That will enable the company to
offer, at an additional price, Cox Digital TV. The service enables
the transmission of many more channels and a sharper picture, among
other things.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications has named Gretchen Shine to oversee its new
systems in the Southern tier of Arizona. A 14-year veteran of Cox
Communications, she most recently managed the company's system in
Roanoke, Va.

   ATLANTA -- The little Marietta company with a funky computer and
a unique way of doing business won lots of national media
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half since the debut of Monorail the computer and
Monorail the company, the executives have kept up the marketing
chutzpah, but the market didn't buy in as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Monorail Chairman Doug Johns _ a former chief of Compaq
Computer's PC division who populated his start-up with industry
veterans _ predicted he would sell an astounding 1 million
computers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Monorail was a ``virtual company.'' Fewer than 50 people work at
its Marietta headquarters. Most of the basic parts of doing
business _ computer assembly, delivery, phone-in technical support,
on-site support and accounts receivable _ are contracted to other
companies in other cities. The company hit the market with an
all-in-one desktop unit that took up a fifth the space of most
systems, offered acceptable power and cost a smidgen under $1,000.
Best of all, it got its bargain box to stores months before the
industry's giants could break the same price ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But Monorail's advantages of timing were fleeting. Competitors
stormed the under-$1,000 computer market, and the overall industry
began a brutal wave of price slashing.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Phelps, the CEO of Monorail's original assembly contractor,
said he produced only about 20,000 units before his own Kansas
City, Mo.-based company went bankrupt. Monorail disputes Phelps'
figures as too low, but declined to say how close sales compared to
Johns' projection.
</P>
<P>
   Not close at all, said Phelps. ``They hit the market and
basically fell flat on their face ... They couldn't sell the thing.
Here they were supposed to be marketing gurus.''
</P>
<P>
   James Chatz, an attorney representing unsecured creditors of
Phelps Technologies, says his clients are struggling to unload
leftover Monorail components _ a difficult task because some of the
equipment is customized. ``We have about 100,000 pink keyboards
that we never could sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Monorail, meanwhile, says it was Phelps Technologies that
repeatedly left it without enough computers to put on store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Monorail lost what had been one of its biggest
breaks: a foothold with major national retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We committed a few cardinal sins,'' said Monorail marketing
chief Andrew Watson. He recalled Sunday advertising circulars that
pitched Monorail computers when there were no units available.
Monorail officials found themselves apologizing over and over again
to some of the nation's biggest retailers and distributors for not
coming through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part about it,'' Watson said, ``was that we had
millions of dollars in orders from the biggest, most powerful, most
influential channels in the PC distribution business, and we
couldn't fulfill them.''
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA hasn't carried the brand on its store shelves for
months. Neither has Circuit City. But Watson said relationships
remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   A Circuit City spokesman declined to comment. CompUSA's Carol
Elfstrom said Monorail officials ``are focused on being more
competitive, and they are focused on their manufacturing process. I
think that slowed them down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   While Monorail computers were aimed at first-time computer
owners, businesses and schools were more likely to want the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Watson said, ``Don't get the wrong idea. We had a good
year in '97.'' He declined to release the private company's
financial results, but said Monorail's sales exceeded the top
figure posted by any of the hot growth companies highlighted in a
recent report by Business Week magazine. That would put its sales
over $145 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Monorail is bulling forward in an attempt to tackle perhaps
the most competitive and crowded segment of the PC world:
mini-tower desktop systems.
</P>
<P>
   This time Monorail and its distributors are targeting
businesses, abandoning the company's niche for desktop units
costing under $1,000. Monorail officials say the original
all-in-one design isn't big enough to handle more powerful innards
and bigger displays now demanded by customers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Monorail announced two new additions to its line of
full-sized mini-towers, with suggested retail prices of $1,499 and
$1,799.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we are structured to do,'' Watson says. ``We _
unlike anybody else in this business _ are structured to play in a
market that is deteriorating so fast that nobody else is making any
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson says the new Monorail mini-towers are 20 percent cheaper
than units of comparable quality offered by giants such as Compaq
and Dell. The computers will be assembled by Monorail's new
assembly contractor _ its third in 18 months _ Huntsville,
Ala.-based SCI Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Once dramatically unique in price and look, the new Monorails
are neither, analysts say. And in an industry where prices are in
free fall, ``it is really hard to use price as a strategy,'' says
Cameron Duncan, a hardware analyst with ARS in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not in a good spot,'' says Stephen Baker of PC Data,
a market research firm based in Reston, Va. Computer markets are
consolidating into a few dominant suppliers with broad product
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult in this environment to be a small PC
manufacturer with high aspirations,'' Baker says. ``It's nice to be
new and different, but if you don't get to be new and different and
real big real quick, you are in trouble, because the rest of the
market targets what you are doing and blows it away.''

 &HT;    Two public utility groups oppose federal appointment
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Two Washington-based public utility groups are
opposing the impending appointment of an attorney with Southern
Co.'s law firm to two federal commissions charged with working out
longstanding water disputes between Georgia, Florida and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the
American Public Power Association wrote the White House recently to
raise conflict-of-interest questions about Thomas Jensen's
appointment as alternate federal commissioner for the two panels.
</P>
<P>
   The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint and
Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river basin compact commissions were
created by Congress last year to reach agreements on allocation of
water from those river basins among Florida, Alabama and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The NRECA and the APPA said Jensen should not be appointed
because he is a registered lobbyist for Atlanta-based Southern Co.
and the Alliance for Power Privatization, a Washington-based
advocacy group formed by investor-owned utilities, the two groups
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, an attorney with the Washington office of Atlanta-based
Troutman Sanders, dismissed the charges Tuesday. ``It's regrettable
that they did not check their facts prior to sending their
letter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen said he is registered as a lobbyist for Southern and the
Alliance for Power Privatization only because his law firm
represents and lobbies for them. But he added, ``I have never
lobbied for either of them and have never represented them on the
types of issues that will come before the commissions.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the
American Public Power Association, which are lobbying organizations
and often at cross-purposes with Southern, noted the utility
holding company has nine hydroelectric projects under the
jurisdiction of the new commissions, and the alliance ``continues
to advocate the sale of the federal power facilities, including
those facilities on these river systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups are against such sales because they would jeopardize
power supply arrangements or the very existence of their member
utilities. Former U.S. Rep. Lindsay Thomas (D-Ga.), now president
of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, recently was named to the
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa
river basin compact commissions. He said the controversy over
Jensen may indicate the importance of the commissions, which will
attempt to sort out environmental, transportation, irrigation and
electric power issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody and their brother is concerned about this,'' said
Thomas, who will attend his first commission meeting June 29-30 in
Montgomery.

     CLINTON TELLS MRS. KING HE CAN'T CREATE
PANEL TO PROBE ASSASSINATION
 &HT;     By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton told the widow of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. on Tuesday that he could not create a panel to
reopen the inquiry into the civil rights leader's assassination 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton told Coretta Scott King that the question of
whether to reopen the case would remain under review at the Justice
Department and that the administration would act on the advice of
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are awaiting the response of the Justice
Department,'' said Minyon Moore, deputy assistant to the president
for political affairs, who attended Tuesday's 45-minute Oval Office
meeting between Clinton and Mrs. King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, I think it has given her the opportunity to
speak directly to the president about her concerns, unfiltered, and
we'll just have to see where we go from here,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King said after the meeting that she would continue to
press for a new investigation into her husband's death, saying she
did not believe convicted assassin James Earl Ray acted alone in
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to ignore this thing for years, but it didn't go
away,'' said Mrs. King, flanked by three of her children _ Martin
Luther King III, Dexter Scott King and the Rev. Bernice King _ who
accompanied her to the meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a family that believes in truth and we believe in, also,
forgiveness,'' said Mrs. King. ``And we believe that there is a
moral order and that somehow, in the long run, that the truth will
win out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King said she had hoped the president would consider
empaneling a federal commission to investigate new evidence she
claims supports the theory that Ray, who died in prison this year,
did not act alone in the murder of King and possibly wasn't even
the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for me to appreciate the fact that one lone
person could engineer what he did, in terms of his escape and what
I know about him not being a good shooter ... and the fact that he
was able to get out of the country and all that,'' Mrs. King said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton believed in a conspiracy theory, she
replied, ``We didn't discuss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, gave no indication that he would empanel a
commission, as Mrs. King has sought, modeled after the South
African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is reviewing
apartheid-era human rights abuses in exchange for immunity for
perpetrators who come forward to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president just said he would have to see what his options
are,'' Mrs. King said. ``There are such things as laws, and,
legally, what is possible to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she was satisfied with the pace of the Justice
Department inquiry _ which began after she met in April with Reno _
Mrs. King said ``I know these things take time and my assumption is
that we will be hearing something in the not-too-distant-future.
... That's about what we can expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who died in April at age 70, pleaded guilty in 1969 to
King's assassination at a Memphis hotel on April 4, 1968. Ray later
recanted his confession.
</P>
<P>
   The King family went to the White House bearing gifts for
Clinton _ the book ``A Knock at Midnight,'' inspired by the late
King's work; an audio tape of his speeches, and a video of sermons
preached by his daughter, Bernice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shared with the president a very intimate look at who
they were as a family and what this tragedy has done to them,''
said Moore. ``He was certainly very attentive and listened very
carefully.''

a unique way of doing business won lots of national media
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half since the debut of Monorail the computer and
Monorail the company, the executives have kept up the marketing
chutzpah, but the market didn't buy in as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Monorail Chairman Doug Johns _ a former chief of Compaq
Computer's PC division who populated his start-up with industry
veterans _ predicted he would sell an astounding 1 million
computers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Monorail was a ``virtual company.'' Fewer than 50 people work at
its Marietta headquarters. Most of the basic parts of doing
business _ computer assembly, delivery, phone-in technical support,
on-site support and accounts receivable _ are contracted to other
companies in other cities. The company hit the market with an
all-in-one desktop unit that took up a fifth the space of most
systems, offered acceptable power and cost a smidgen under $1,000.
Best of all, it got its bargain box to stores months before the
industry's giants could break the same price ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But Monorail's advantages of timing were fleeting. Competitors
stormed the under-$1,000 computer market, and the overall industry
began a brutal wave of price slashing.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Phelps, the CEO of Monorail's original assembly contractor,
said he produced only about 20,000 units before his own Kansas
City, Mo.-based company went bankrupt. Monorail disputes Phelps'
figures as too low, but declined to say how close sales compared to
Johns' projection.
</P>
<P>
   Not close at all, said Phelps. ``They hit the market and
basically fell flat on their face ... They couldn't sell the thing.
Here they were supposed to be marketing gurus.''
</P>
<P>
   James Chatz, an attorney representing unsecured creditors of
Phelps Technologies, says his clients are struggling to unload
leftover Monorail components _ a difficult task because some of the
equipment is customized. ``We have about 100,000 pink keyboards
that we never could sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Monorail, meanwhile, says it was Phelps Technologies that
repeatedly left it without enough computers to put on store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Monorail lost what had been one of its biggest
breaks: a foothold with major national retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We committed a few cardinal sins,'' said Monorail marketing
chief Andrew Watson. He recalled Sunday advertising circulars that
pitched Monorail computers when there were no units available.
Monorail officials found themselves apologizing over and over again
to some of the nation's biggest retailers and distributors for not
coming through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part about it,'' Watson said, ``was that we had
millions of dollars in orders from the biggest, most powerful, most
influential channels in the PC distribution business, and we
couldn't fulfill them.''
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA hasn't carried the brand on its store shelves for
months. Neither has Circuit City. But Watson said relationships
remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   A Circuit City spokesman declined to comment. CompUSA's Carol
Elfstrom said Monorail officials ``are focused on being more
competitive, and they are focused on their manufacturing process. I
think that slowed them down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   While Monorail computers were aimed at first-time computer
owners, businesses and schools were more likely to want the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Watson said, ``Don't get the wrong idea. We had a good
year in '97.'' He declined to release the private company's
financial results, but said Monorail's sales exceeded the top
figure posted by any of the hot growth companies highlighted in a
recent report by Business Week magazine. That would put its sales
over $145 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Monorail is bulling forward in an attempt to tackle perhaps
the most competitive and crowded segment of the PC world:
mini-tower desktop systems.
</P>
<P>
   This time Monorail and its distributors are targeting
businesses, abandoning the company's niche for desktop units
costing under $1,000. Monorail officials say the original
all-in-one design isn't big enough to handle more powerful innards
and bigger displays now demanded by customers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Monorail announced two new additions to its line of
full-sized mini-towers, with suggested retail prices of $1,499 and
$1,799.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we are structured to do,'' Watson says. ``We _
unlike anybody else in this business _ are structured to play in a
market that is deteriorating so fast that nobody else is making any
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson says the new Monorail mini-towers are 20 percent cheaper
than units of comparable quality offered by giants such as Compaq
and Dell. The computers will be assembled by Monorail's new
assembly contractor _ its third in 18 months _ Huntsville,
Ala.-based SCI Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Once dramatically unique in price and look, the new Monorails
are neither, analysts say. And in an industry where prices are in
free fall, ``it is really hard to use price as a strategy,'' says
Cameron Duncan, a hardware analyst with ARS in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not in a good spot,'' says Stephen Baker of PC Data,
a market research firm based in Reston, Va. Computer markets are
consolidating into a few dominant suppliers with broad product
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult in this environment to be a small PC
manufacturer with high aspirations,'' Baker says. ``It's nice to be
new and different, but if you don't get to be new and different and
real big real quick, you are in trouble, because the rest of the
market targets what you are doing and blows it away.''

 &HT;    Two public utility groups oppose federal appointment
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Two Washington-based public utility groups are
opposing the impending appointment of an attorney with Southern
Co.'s law firm to two federal commissions charged with working out
longstanding water disputes between Georgia, Florida and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the
American Public Power Association wrote the White House recently to
raise conflict-of-interest questions about Thomas Jensen's
appointment as alternate federal commissioner for the two panels.
</P>
<P>
   The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint and
Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river basin compact commissions were
created by Congress last year to reach agreements on allocation of
water from those river basins among Florida, Alabama and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The NRECA and the APPA said Jensen should not be appointed
because he is a registered lobbyist for Atlanta-based Southern Co.
and the Alliance for Power Privatization, a Washington-based
advocacy group formed by investor-owned utilities, the two groups
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, an attorney with the Washington office of Atlanta-based
Troutman Sanders, dismissed the charges Tuesday. ``It's regrettable
that they did not check their facts prior to sending their
letter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen said he is registered as a lobbyist for Southern and the
Alliance for Power Privatization only because his law firm
represents and lobbies for them. But he added, ``I have never
lobbied for either of them and have never represented them on the
types of issues that will come before the commissions.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the
American Public Power Association, which are lobbying organizations
and often at cross-purposes with Southern, noted the utility
holding company has nine hydroelectric projects under the
jurisdiction of the new commissions, and the alliance ``continues
to advocate the sale of the federal power facilities, including
those facilities on these river systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups are against such sales because they would jeopardize
power supply arrangements or the very existence of their member
utilities. Former U.S. Rep. Lindsay Thomas (D-Ga.), now president
of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, recently was named to the
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa
river basin compact commissions. He said the controversy over
Jensen may indicate the importance of the commissions, which will
attempt to sort out environmental, transportation, irrigation and
electric power issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody and their brother is concerned about this,'' said
Thomas, who will attend his first commission meeting June 29-30 in
Montgomery.

MARKETS POST MODEST GAINS AS INVESTORS GO BARGAIN HUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Major stock market indexes were modestly higher
Tuesday as investors looked for bargains but shunned many
multinational companies with exposure to Asian markets. Instead,
they sought technology issues, which have been battered recently by
some of the same concerns that are now hurting the conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Nasdaq composite index rose 37.37 points _
erasing Monday's 29.30 point decline, to 1,753.12. The 2.18 percent
gain was the largest percentage increase in the technology-heavy
barometer since March 6.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom and Microsoft were the leading gainers in the index.
</P>
<P>
   One of the day's most active issues, Dell Computer, rose 5.9
percent, or 4 23/32 points, to 84 31/32. The stock has fallen
almost 14 percent from its recent closing high of 98 1/4 on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were also higher as oil prices rose on news that
several leading oil producers again agreed to cut production to
lighten worldwide oversupply.
</P>
<P>
   After a 207-point plunge Monday, the Dow Jones industrial
average, which seesawed between gains and losses throughout the
session, closed up 37.36 points, at 8,665.29.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, Merck and Chevron led the index higher, as
buyers selected stocks with positive news _ such as the oil shares
_ or which they believed would not be severely hurt by the turmoil
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was up 10.58 points, to
1,087.59.
</P>
<P>
   Calmer overseas markets helped stave off further declines,
analysts said. In Asia, the dollar fell sharply against the yen
after Japan's central bank indicated it might enter the market to
support the currency.
</P>
<P>
   No intervention took place, however, and the American currency
made up some of its lost ground, closing at 143.47.
</P>
<P>
   While the benchmark Japanese Nikkei 225 index fell 0.71 percent,
most Asian stock markets were higher. European markets rose as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But after Monday's sharp selloff, some analysts were unimpressed
by the market's limited gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an attempt at a rally, but it was very uninspiring,''
said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
``It doesn't appear there's much confidence coming back to the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ask, `Does it appear the stock market has reached a
near-term bottom?' The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM proved the biggest drag on the Dow, pulling 8.97 points out
of the blue-chip index. IBM closed at 110, down 2 1/4. Merrill
Lynch analyst Steven Milunovich on Tuesday lowered second-quarter
earnings estimates for the personal computer maker, citing concerns
about weak computer sales, declining revenue in Asia and the strong
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   This year IBM, like many other technology companies, has been
plagued by weakening demand and Asia's worsening economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   IBM warned in January that first-quarter profits would take a
hit due to the strength of the dollar and slowing Asian demand for
its products.
</P>
<P>
   And when Coca-Cola reported first-quarter earnings in April, it
attributed a 13.2 percent drop in earnings to the negative effect
of Far Eastern currency fluctuations and warned that similar
currency problems would affect second-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the dollar's recent strength caused Merrill Lynch
analyst Douglas Lane to reduce his earnings estimates for the
beverage company, which derives about 80 percent of its profits
from outside of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, as the Asian financial crisis was unfolding, shares
of a number of multinational companies, including Coca-Cola,
Gillette, Eastman Kodak and Polaroid, fell on fears that the
dollar's strength would hurt earnings. Each of those issues closed
lower Tuesday. &QL;

YUGOSLAV LEADER MAKES CONCESSIONS ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: budgeted earlier as BOSNIA-MILOSEVIC; see also KOSOVO-U.S.) 
(BL) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic promised
Tuesday to make a series of concessions over Kosovo to forestall
military action by the West. But he stopped short of meeting one
key demand: the withdrawal of Serbian security forces accused of
attacking ethnic Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of closed-door meetings here with top Russian
officials, the Yugoslav leader announced his promises _ including
access for relief groups and international monitors as well as
arrangements for refugees to return _ in a joint statement with
President Boris Yelstin.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, who are also eager to head off NATO air
strikes, were quick to cast Milosevic's promises as an important
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from clear, however, whether Milosevic's pledges were
merely tactical or whether he was genuinely prepared to ease the
repression in Kosovo, whose population is predominantly ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   And Western officials said that Milosevic had only met NATO part
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some progress,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said. But she added that that Milosevic ``did not meet the
primary points that the Contact Group raised.'' Western diplomats
at NATO headquarters said that the alliance was continuing to work
on military options. But the threat of military action has, in
effect, been deferred. The Contact Group, which monitors events in
the Balkans, includes Britain, Germany, France and Italy as well as
the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant press conference in an ornate Russian Foreign
Ministry mansion, Milosevic denied that Serbian forces had ever
harmed ethnic Albanians. ``There was no kind of ethnic cleansing,''
Milosevic said. ``In the latest actions it was declared by the
security forces there were no civilian victims at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of international observers have painted a very
different picture. They say that at least 250 ethnic Albanians have
been killed in the fighting and at least 65,000 have been forced to
abandon their homes in the separatist province.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has condemned the Serbian
crackdown as ``ethnically driven violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's talks took place a day after NATO conducted air
exercises over the Balkans in an effort to pressure him to end the
crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He met with Yeltsin on Tuesday and then engaged in several hours
of talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev and other top Russian aides as the two sides sought
to cobble together a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Kosovo crisis, the Kremlin has had conflicting
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Yeltsin has an interest in maintaining good
relations with the West, especially since Moscow wants billions of
dollars in Western loans to help overcome its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian officials also acknowledge that Milosevic has gone
too far in Kosovo. Primakov, for example, went along last week with
the demand by his fellow foreign ministers in the so-called
``Contact Group'' on the Balkans who insisted that Milosevic
withdraw security forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians see solidarity with their fellow Slavs in
Yugoslavia as a useful card to play in Russian domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also believe that Milosevic is defending an
important principle when he says that he is entitled to take firm
steps to insure that Kosovo remains part of Serbia. Russia has its
own regions of ethnic tension and is not eager to invite
international scrutiny or intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Primakov enjoys playing a pivotal role in world affairs
and is no friend of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO countries have threatened measures including military
intervention if Milosevic does not stop the Serbian offensive
against ethnic Albanians. And the newspaper Izvestiya bluntly
outlined one of the main purposes of Tuesday's meeting: ``Russia is
trying to save the Serbs from NATO bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of lengthy negotiations, Primakov claimed a major
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this opens up a real possibility to resolve the
situation,'' Primakov said at a joint news conference with
Milosevic. ``In many ways, the ball is now in the court of the
Kosovo Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials will be monitoring the situation in Kosovo for
the next several weeks to see if the Serbs keep their promises.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has, in fact, promised to take some noteworthy steps.
In the joint statement, he agreed there would be no restrictions on
the work of international organizations, such as the International
Committee of the Red Cross, or on international monitors. And he
promised to allow refugees who had fled Kosovo to return.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to continue talks with ethnic Albanians on
``forms of autonomy,'' though he spurned the idea of doing so with
the help of international mediators. Western officials are worried
that any talks will stall without international supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The Western-dominated ``Contact Group'' had demanded that
Milosevic recall intelligence and army units sent to Kosovo for the
crackdown. Security forces inside Kosovo, they insisted, should be
confined to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, Milosevic refused to take the initiative and
instead put the onus on the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``As terrorist activities subside, security forces will reduce
their presence outside the areas of their permanent deployment,''
Milosevic's joint statement with Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees crossing into Albania from Kosovo on Tuesday reported
attacks on mountain refugee camps by Yugoslav army helicopters, but
there was no independent confirmation of those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav president told reporters Tuesday that his position was
intended to protect the principle of Serbian sovereignty over the
Kosovo region. He revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no reasons or grounds for the Yugoslav army not to
be on the territory of Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said. ``Any
withdrawal of units of the Yugoslav army from any part of
Yugoslavia is out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's statement also showed some of the contradictions in
the Russian stance.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who sat at Milosevic's side throughout the press
conference, joined the ``Contact Group's'' call for the withdrawal
of Serbian security forces. But the Russian foreign minister then
endorsed the far weaker measure Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seemed to enjoy his verbal jousts with the press
Tuesday. To the obvious discomfort of his Russian hosts, he
occasionally lapsed into English to respond to Western reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When Western reporters pressed Milosevic about the violence in
Kosovo, he shot back that Albanian ``terrorist groups'' had
launched reprisals against ethnic Albanians who refused to support
them.
</P>
<P>
   As Milosevic ended his remarks, Primakov cut off the session,
reminding the Yugoslav president that he was late for a visit with
the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic seemed ready for another round of sparring and
wrapped up the news conference with an invitation to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, next time, if you want longer talks, you
come to Belgrade,'' Milosevic said. ``You are invited, all of
you.''

DEBATE OVER HOMOSEXUALITY ERUPTS OVER GOP LEADERS' COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey touched off
new debate over homosexuality Tuesday when he said the Bible ``is
very clear'' in holding that it is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican was asked if he agreed with remarks made
Monday by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., likening
homosexuals to people who have problems with alcoholism, sex
addiction or kleptomania. Armey was also asked if he thinks
homosexuality is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Replying that he does, Armey said, ``The Bible is very clear on
this. In fact, I can give you a reference if you like _ one of many
_ but it is very clear on this. Now, both myself and Senator Lott
believe very strongly in the Bible. ... I abide by the instructions
that are given to me in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited what he said were several references to the
homosexuality in the New Testament books of Romans, Timothy and
First Corinthians.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' comments prompted Sen. Paul Wellstone, a
liberal Democrat of Minnesota, to fire back on the Senate floor
Tuesday, saying being gay or lesbian is genetically predetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone added that in light of the Republican leaders'
remarks, the Senate should debate the issue and vote on the
languishing nomination of gay rights advocate James C. Hormel to be
ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative senators blocking the nomination of Hormel, 64, a
San Francisco philanthropist and Democratic Party donor, have
accused him of being a gay activist who would try to carry out a
homosexual agenda in Luxembourg, a predominantly Catholic nation.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone asked that Lott's comments on homosexuality be
included in the public record and said the statement ``takes us
back quite a ways from where we are. We ought to bring it to the
floor so we can have an honest discussion,'' Wellstone said. ``The
Majority Leader is entitled to his opinion... and he is entitled to
his vote. But the rest of us are entitled to our opinions and our
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute quickly moved to the White House when President
Clinton's press secretary, Mike McCurry. said Lott and other
conservatives who have kept Hormel's nomination from going to the
Senate floor for seven months are doing so because they are
``backward in their thinking ... because they have views that are,
to put it charitably, quite out of date. ... They're refusing to
move forward on that nomination because he's gay.''.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott has refused to bring Hormel's nomination up for a vote,
saying it would take too much time. Hormel was approved, 16 to 2,
in November by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but his
appointment has been put on hold since then by conservatives
including Sens. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.,
and Robert C. Smith, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's comments came in an interview on ``The Armstrong Williams
Show'' on the America's Voice cable television network.
</P>
<P>
   Williams asked Lott whether he considers homosexuality a sin and
the senator replied, ``Yeah, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You should still love that person. You should not
try to mistreat them or treat them as outcasts. You should try to
show them a way to deal with that problem, just like alcohol ... or
sex addiction ... or kleptomaniacs. There are all kinds of
problems, addictions, difficulties, experiences of things that are
wrong, but you should try to work with that person to learn to
control that problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that ``in America right now there's an element that
wants to make that alternative life style acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization which
Hormel help to found, said Lott's and Armey's comments are
``another sign that the extreme right wing has a stranglehold on
the Senate and now the House leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Stachelberg said the comments are an indication that the
politics of Gary Bauer, who heads the conservative Family Research
Council, and James Dobson, who has a conservative Christian radio
show, are rubbing off on the Senate and House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Lott's comments ``seem to suggest'' that his
beliefs about homosexuality are what's holding up Hormel's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not a sign of the direction of the Republican
party,'' Stachelberg said. ``I hope it's not open season on gay
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott spokeswoman Susan Irby declined to comment on Stachelberg's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of the American Psychiatric Association, the
American Psychological Association declared in 1975 that it no
longer considered homosexuality a mental disorder. Some scientific
studies have found differences between the genes and brain
structures of homosexual and heterosexual people.

REPUBLICAN ATTEMPT TO BAN BILINGUAL VOTING MATERIALS DENOUNCED 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican attempts to enact voter identification
laws and ban bilingual voting materials were denounced Tuesday by
the League of Women Voters as nothing more than an effort to keep
ethnic and racial minority voters away from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In a blistering critique of GOP-sponsored amendments likely to
be offered during House consideration of campaign finance reform
legislation this summer, the league said the measures would only
``promote discrimination'' against Hispanic, Asian and other
minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the proposed . . . amendments would discourage voter
participation, create obstacles for new citizens and citizens with
disabilities, and encourage discrimination against ethnic and
racial minorities,'' said League of Women Voters' senior lobbyist
Mary Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   She said some of the amendments had already been rejected at
least twice by Congress, but keep coming back again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems to never end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks made the comments in a news conference with Democratic
Party leaders and various Hispanic and Asian groups that also
condemned the amendments as ``a crass political attempt'' to
prevent minority citizens from participating in the elections
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the amendments are a calculated strategy on the part of
the Republican Party to prevent people from registering to vote,''
said Colorado Gov. and Democratic National Committee Chairman Roy
Romer.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments drawing the most fire would set up a federal
office to ``verify'' voter citizenship through Social Security and
immigration records, ban bilingual materials at polling places,
require photo identification of voters at the polls, allow states
to drop voters from the rolls for not voting, and repeal the
mail-in voter registration provision known as the motor voter law.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, Brooks said the amendments would in effect abolish
Voting Rights Act protections and violate privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders plan to offer the restrictions as amendments
to campaign finance reform legislation now being debated in the
House, although opponents of the amendments say they have nothing
to do with the issue of changing the way candidates raise and spend
money in elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about campaign reform, free and fair elections . . .
and honest elections. It's as much about voter registration as it
is campaigns,'' said Michelle Davis, press secretary to House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've spent all this time calling for a fair and open debate
(on campaign finance legislation) and now that they've got it, they
don't want it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of campaign finance reform, said the amendments
are designed to kill any attempt at overhauling the laws that
govern political contributions and are aimed as well at
``suppressing the Hispanic and Asian vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want us to be informed, they don't want us to be
registered, and they certainly don't want us to come out and
vote,'' said Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. ``Instead of trying to
proselytize voters in the Latino and Asian communities, they are
trying to intimidate them.''

HABITAT WORKERS BATTLE TEXAS HEAT, AIM AT 100-HOUSE EFFORT 

</HEADLINE>

1998c. Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As Wade and Shalina Gibson watched their dream house
materialize before their eyes, they found it hard to put their
emotions into words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream and when it's there . . . it's like you're
in shock. I really can't describe it,'' said Shalina Gibson, a
25-year-old mother of two who is seven months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting. It's a blessing. It's unbelievable,'' Wade
Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gibsons joined approximately 6,000 volunteers in Habitat for
Humanity's Jimmy Carter Work Project. Building began at dawn Monday
on 100 homes at several sites in Houston's Second and Fifth Wards,
which will be completed by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Carter project, the largest attempted in the United
States, is enormous compared to the project's first year in 1984,
when 42 volunteers labored to renovate an apartment building in New
York. For each project, Carter and wife, Rosalynn, work
side-by-side with volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working with tools ever since I was a small boy on
the farm,'' Carter said Monday on a site where 35 homes are being
constructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a sacrifice for me to come here. It's a real
pleasure,'' said Carter, clad in a straw hat and tool belt while on
a break from construction.
</P>
<P>
   Tasks included framing, installing windows and doors and
beginning the roofing, said the Rev. Michael Shirl, executive
director of Houston Habitat for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers work in two shifts: 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., or 4 p.m. to 9
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shift volunteer Art Moser of Mishawaka, Ind., led a
group of college students from a Habitat group in the South Bend,
Ind., area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a satisfaction that you've helped somebody out. I hope
someday if any of my grandchildren or great-grandchildren need any
help, there will be someone to help them. I think we need to give
back to our fellow man,'' said Moser, who has helped build more
than 25 houses in his 12 years with Habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Group member Julie Duba, a junior at St. Mary's College in Notre
Dame, Ind., heard about the project while writing a paper for class
on Habitat for Humanity, an ecumenical organization that builds
affordable housing for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see how it would be done in such a short time,''
said Duba, who worked on her first Habitat house last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The day had minor glitches. Some volunteers boarded the wrong
bus en route to construction sites. A short-lived power outage
slowed progress on a few houses. One woman bumped her head while
putting up a wall and was taken to a hospital for examination. And
the Houston heat took its toll on some workers, especially those
who are not from this area.
</P>
<P>
   Some volunteers were not surprised at Tuesday's high of 98
degrees, with a heat index of 103 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much knew it was going to be hot,'' Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   Duba of St. Mary's College agreed. ``It's a bit warmer than I
thought (it would be), but it's beautiful, so I'm not
complaining,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Miller, the project's medical director, said: ``A lot
of people are having a lot of trouble with the heat. With the
humidity, they are getting overheated.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical personnel and volunteers made aggressive efforts to keep
heat-related illnesses at bay, Miller said. The more intensive
construction work, like framing and shingling the houses, occurred
early in the day. The preparation paid off the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had any unanticipated events, no surprises,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers drank water, misted it onto themselves with spray
bottles, and soaked towels and handkerchiefs in an effort to keep
cool. Not all managed to beat dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a little dehydrated,'' said volunteer Bruce
Hollenbeck of Garden Grove, Calif., as he sat in the first aid
trailer's air-conditioned comfort. ``I just didn't drink enough
water fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Difficult as the work proved for some, the volunteers maintained
a can-do spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a second wind,'' said volunteer Betsy Chamberlain.
``I'm out of shape. I don't hammer and nail all day. The
combination of the heat and humidity is very tiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chamberlain and others said they enjoyed the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating to see (houses) go up,'' she said, glancing
at the house she was helping build. ``This morning, there was
nothing but concrete here. I think it's a wonderful effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said, ``What I find absolutely amazing is the intensity
and enthusiasm with which people are working.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of glitches, project construction is running smoothly,
according to Shirl. ``We're on schedule. I feel good about where we
are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping to talk after installing a window, Wade Gibson told why
he and his wife wanted to own a home so badly. The family rents an
apartment, and it is nearly impossible to obtain repairs on it.
Drug dealers frequent the streets, and there is no security, making
it impossible for the Gibsons to allow their 7- and 2-year-old
daughters to play outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he will own a home, Wade Gibson said he can wash his
car in the driveway and play outside with his children. His wife,
Shalina Gibson, also has plans for their new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much I want to do. I really want to start working
on my yard, put some plants out there, some flowers. I want to make
it really pretty,'' she said. ``I'm ready to move in.''

VAN BOXMEER INTERESTED IN DUCKS' JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Mighty Ducks begin their search for a new head coach,
they might want to look in their own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Ice Dog coach and general manager John Van Boxmeer said Tuesday
he is very interested in speaking to Mighty Duck general manager
Jack Ferreira about the vacancy created by the Monday firing of
Pierre Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize this is a tough decision for Jack,'' Van Boxmeer
said. ``No, I haven't been a head coach in the NHL. But I have been
an associate coach in the NHL (from 1990-92 with the Buffalo
Sabres). My record of wins and losses speaks for itself. I think I
have an excellent track record with star players, No. 1, and No. 2,
with European players. I think those are two big factors in today's
NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   And clearly, they are two big factors for the Ducks, who have
superstar wingers in Paul Kariya and Finland's Teemu Selanne.
Ferreira, attending NHL general managers meetings in Washington,
could not be reached for the comment he probably wouldn't have
given in response to questions about prospective candidates. But at
Monday's news conference announcing Page's firing, Ferreira who has
not set a timetable for making a decision did not rule out hiring a
coach lacking NHL experience.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira said, ``We want what every team in the NHL is looking
for in a hockey coach: respect from the players, someone who is
strategically sound, someone who will show consistent improvement
in the club and someone who develops young players. All of this
adds up to one thing: winning. We want to win and get back to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, after the Ducks reached the playoffs for the only
time in their five-year history, Coach Ron Wilson was fired with
little explanation. This season, Wilson led the Washington Capitals
to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in their history, and
Page coached a problem-plagued Duck team to a 26-43-13 record, 13
points out of the last playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Van Boxmeer, meanwhile, has a sparkling record
in 12 years as a minor-league head coach. In three seasons with the
Ice Dogs, his record is 139-75-32, and the last two years, he has
led them deep into the IHL playoffs. He won the IHL's Coach of the
Year award with the Ice Dogs in 1996-97, a decade after coaching
the Rochester Americans to the AHL championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Duck job has special appeal for Van Boxmeer because his
wife, Judy, is from Orange County, and he is not interested in
moving her and the couple's children Ashley, 13, and Henry, 10 to
another city in pursuit of an NHL opportunity. Van Boxmeer lives in
Orange, a quarter-mile from Ferreira and a 15-minute drive from the
Pond, and he said he feels quite worthy of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Listing current and past NHL coaches, Van Boxmeer said, ``I've
coached against Pat Burns, Barry Melrose, Marc Crawford, Terry
Murray, Colin Campbell, Terry Crisp and Pierre Page. My teams have
beaten all these guys. It's not like I haven't coached against guys
in the NHL. I have, and I've had success against them. The fact
that I've never gone out and marketed myself for a job has kept me
at the position I'm at. I'm still not marketing myself, but this is
the job I'm interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   But will Ferreira be interested in Van Boxmeer? It remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer said he was planning to notify Ice Dog owner Barry
Kemp of his interest in the Ducks' job (Kemp has said he expects to
eventually lose Van Boxmeer to an NHL team), and then to contact
Ferreira. Van Boxmeer said he did not contact the Ducks about their
opening a year ago, the one that was filled by Page.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons to believe Van Boxmeer could have a shot at
the Ducks' job. And there are reasons to believe he might not.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side is his winning record, the relationship he
developed with Ferreira a year ago when the Ice Dogs and Mighty
Ducks had a limited affiliation, his role developing numerous young
players at the minor-league level, and the fact that Van Boxmeer
would be willing to work at a salary that Disney would find more
palatable than what it would cost to hire available big-ticket
items such as former Colorado coach Crawford and former Buffalo
coach Ted Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, for instance, earned $800,000 this season at Colorado,
and is believed destined to be hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs.
Page was fired after one year of a three-year deal that paid him
$500,000 a season, and unless he is hired elsewhere will receive $1
million more from the Ducks over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer, who recently signed a two-year extension with the
Ice Dogs, has three years remaining on his contract and is believed
to earn about $175,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing against Van Boxmeer, however, is the fact that Ferreira
the only general manager in the Mighty Ducks' history may be down
to his last coaching hire, and may not view Van Boxmeer as the
safest possible choice because he hasn't been an NHL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just like an interview,'' Van Boxmeer said.

STARR LASHES OUT OVER MAGAZINE ARTICLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the defensive for the third day, independent
counsel Kenneth Starr lashed back Tuesday at a magazine editor,
saying his article ``borders on the libelous'' when it accuses the
prosecutor of illegally leaking grand jury information about the
Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 19-page letter, Starr ``categorically and unequivocally''
denies any legal or ethical breaches and accused Steven Brill of
``a fundamental misunderstanding of the law and a misrepresentation
of the facts'' surrounding the prosecutor's discussions with
reporters about the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You challenge this office at a fundamental level _ alleging
that we would commit crimes to uncover crime,'' Starr wrote. ``I
categorically and unequivocally reject the charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the inaugural issue of his media affairs
magazine Brill's Content, Brill, a lawyer and donor to Democratic
candidates, accuses Starr of violating a federal law prohibiting
disclosure of evidence gathered by a grand jury or information
gained from persons who are potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your reckless and irresponsible attack borders on the
libelous,'' Starr wrote to Brill.
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutor is quoted in the article justifying
discussions he and top deputy Jackie M. Bennett had with reporters
about the investigation into whether President Clinton or his aides
engaged in a cover-up of his alleged sexual relationship with
Lewinsky or an encounter with Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, fired off
his own letter, this one to Starr repeating earlier accusations
that the prosecution team have violated laws and ignored ethical
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caught flat-footed by the Brill article, you've attempted to
shift your ground,'' Kendall wrote to Starr. ``You accuse Mr. Brill
of misinterpreting, but not misquoting, and that's highly
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar point was made by Brill after he read Starr's letter.
``I am pleased that Judge Starr again does not dispute any of the
quotes attributed by me to him,'' the lawyer-editor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that Judge Starr sincerely believes in his view of
the law, just as I believe that other lawyers and judges have and
will continue to disagree with him,'' Brill said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has asked U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to
sanction Starr and his deputies for violating her order barring
grand jury leaks. Monday night, Johnson summoned members of Starr's
staff, the president's legal team and lawyers for Lewinsky for a
half-hour, closed-door discussion about leaks in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr, Brill and Kendall swapped correspondence, two top
aides to President Clinton made return appearances before the grand
jury investigating allegations of a presidential affair and
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, Clinton's deputy chief of staff, was questioned
for two hours. Podesta was involved in efforts to help Lewinsky _ a
former White House intern who later worked at the Pentagon _ find a
job outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying Tuesday was Nancy Hernreich, chief of Oval
Office operations, who spent almost four hours behind closed doors
with the grand jury. Hernreich has been summoned for questioning at
least four other times.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NANTES, France _ The nation of Iran recently made an emphatic
statement to the rest of the world: It is dangerous, unpredictable
and explosive.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're talking soccer, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the whole point to this Iranian World Cup
expedition, an intriguing trip to a different kind of international
spotlight and, many Iranians here hope, a different kind of
perspective about their enigmatic and controversial country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to play good, fair soccer, strong soccer,'' Iranian
coach Jalel Talebi said. ``Every game here for us has special
meaning. We want to be sportsmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will be difficult separating sports and politics
for this embattled nation, particularly Sunday when Iran faces the
United States, a nation with which it has had no economic or
political relations for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is the great hope for many Iranian players and a
large contingent of followers who have made the trip to France for
Iran's first World Cup appearance since 1978. A hope for peaceful
soccer solutions to a longtime problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans think of us as animals,'' said Hedayaed Azim, an
Iranian soccer fan who traveled with the team to Paris. ``Why?
There is too much thinking around the world that we cannot coexist
with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, particularly in the West, there seems to remain a widely
held belief that Iran is a nation of radical fundamentalists,
religious fanatics and terrorist sympathizers. It is, of course, a
sentiment founded in Iran's political history, which might have
been defined in 1979 when Islamic revolutionaries took 52 Americans
hostage in Tehran and held them for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran's players all were either children or young teens when
the hostage crisis took place and now say they wish Iran's image
could be different as they progress through France '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do nothing about what has happened in the past,''
Iranian midfielder Alireza Mansourian said. ``But it is there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, what was there for the Iranian World Cup team
was an impressive if ultimately unrewarded effort against
Yugoslavia. It was a small step toward at least giving the world a
different kind of image about its country.
</P>
<P>
   A soccer image.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a soccer-loving nation without a doubt. Thousands of
Iranians have descended upon France this month, wearing the colors,
chanting the cheers and scooping up tickets at a feverish pace.
</P>
<P>
   On Paris streets and in Lyon cafes, Iranians are happily
intermingling with all others, including Americans. The most
popular tourist site among the Iranians: Euro-Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket brokers quoted in L'Equipe, a French daily sports
newspaper, were asked in Sunday's editions about the best customers
they have come across thus far at the World Cup. Brazilian and
English fans were considered the front-runners. Iranian fans ranked
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tickets? Tickets?'' they can be heard asking strangers along
the Champs Elysees in Paris, the Bellecour plaza in Lyon and the
Grand Station in Saint-Etienne.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no outlaws here,'' Azim said. ``Just football
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the hostage crisis, Iran was in fact considered the best
of all the Asian and Middle Eastern soccer countries. It was a
1970s power on the world level, winning three consecutive Asian
Championships, beating Brazil in the 1972 Olympics and qualifying
for the World Cup in 1978. And its fans were widely considered
among the world's most enthusiastic and loyal.
</P>
<P>
   After 1978, however, the Iran-Iraq war brought the game to a
virtual standstill in Iran. Then came the hostage crisis and a
U.S.-led diplomatic blockade of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Iran became a great villain to much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   With so many political issues at stake, it did not attempt to
qualify for the 1982 World Cup. It then was not allowed to play any
home qualifying games for the 1986 World Cup and was eliminated
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the game again dominates nearly every sidewalk
conversation as the team has returned to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is so huge in Iran, and everyone is excited about the
World Cup,'' said Aras Nouamouz, a former Houston Hotshots player
and Iranian national-team member still living in Houston.
Nouamouz's father, Nasser, is Iran's 1998 World Cup team manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the players and to my mother (Monday), and they
said everything about the World Cup is being covered,'' Nouamouz
said. ``People are staying at home to watch every game. There is no
business, no activity anywhere, just the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   There are five daily sports newspapers in Iran, and all sent
numerous reporters to France. The national television network also
is broadcasting every World Cup game, not just those involving
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   And before the team departed Tehran for France, there was a
send-off rally for the players that drew more than 70,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what kind of team we would have, because there
is not any World Cup experience on the team,'' Nouamouz said. ``But
there is talent, and there is emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran played a fast, furious game in its opener against
Yugoslavia, a team many expect to move deep into the tournament.
The Iranians pressed the ball offensively and played tough
straight-up defense against the creative Yugoslavian goal-scorers.
</P>
<P>
   The statement made was clear. This is a dangerous team again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a difficult team to get through,'' Yugoslavia's
Sinisa Mihajlovic said of Iran. ``They were tough and faster than
we expected to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran had at least three legitimate scoring opportunities slip
away in the 1-0 loss, and when it was over, the Iranian players
shook hands with their opponents, smiled and waved to the crowd at
Stade Geoffrey in Saint-Etienne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know that we are humans, like everyone
else,'' Mansourian said. ``We love soccer, and we play soccer for
the sport of it. It is our national game. We want to prove that
this is a friendly game and that we love to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Iran is one of the last remaining enemies of the
American government. Relations are anything but friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's USA-Iran match in Lyon will have huge political
overtones, for sure. It figures to be one of the most watched games
of the World Cup's first round, if not the entire tournament.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. players have been saying for months that they will approach
the match only as a game and let others discuss the political
issues. After Sunday's nice effort against Yugoslavia, the Iranian
players were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it will be a good game,'' said Kohodad Azizi, the
Asian soccer Player of the Year in 1997 and arguably Iran's best
player. ``We want it to be like any other game, well-played and not
looked at from a political view.''
</P>
<P>
   But Azizi later added, ``Our people are sensitive to the team
that we are playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government will be involved in the game against the
U.S., too, whether the players like it or not. Already, Iranian
government officials reportedly have accounted for the majority of
tickets allocated to the nation for Sunday's game. Thus, there is
great demand for black-market tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Iranian soccer federation also made clear
the importance of the game recently when he announced, ``We cannot
lose to the Americans. We are better than they are, and we will not
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Azizi: ``Maybe the government says that but not the
players. We want to have fun and play a good game. We do not want
to shame ourselves or our country. But we want it to be about
soccer, not politics.''

MARKET PLACE: RUMORS ABOUND ABOUT A MERCK MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co. is close to a $4 billion windfall that has the
pharmaceuticals industry buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   Astra AB, the Swedish drug giant, is expected to announce within
days that it is buying Merck's share of the joint venture formed by
the two companies in 1994, according to people close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, Astra-Merck, is primarily a marketing vehicle
created to sell Astra's ulcer drug, Prilosec, in the United States.
Successful though the unit has been _ last year Prilosec was the
nation's best-selling drug, with revenue of $2.3 billion _ Astra is
more interested in finding a full-fledged merger partner as the
patent for Prilosec approaches expiration.
</P>
<P>
   Haakan Mogren, Astra's chief executive, announced in March that
he wanted to merge his company, which is about a fifth the size of
Merck in market capitalization, with one of equal size. But before
starting a new relationship, he needs to split with Merck, since
their joint venture has the right to sell Astra's drugs in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Merck's next move is less certain. According to stock analysts
and others close to the deal, Astra will pay Merck about $1.5
billion up front and $12 billion more over 10 years for its 50
percent stake in the venture. In a separate deal, DuPont agreed
last month to pay Merck $2.6 billion in July for its stake in their
joint venture, DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co.
</P>
<P>
   So even without the billions to come in over the next decade
from Astra, Merck will soon have $4 billion in mad money.
</P>
<P>
   While theories about what it will do are about as numerous as
the pills Merck makes, Merck has said only that it is in
discussions with Astra and that it intends to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   Merck could stay the course and sink the $4 billion into
research and development, on which it spent $1.68 billion last
year. This strategy, albeit dull, would be true to the company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Merck, it will be business as usual,'' said Stephen Scala,
a pharmaceutical-stock analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co. ``I definitely
can't see the company making a merger or acquisition. Merck is very
insular.''
</P>
<P>
   A second theory is more intriguing. Patents on several Merck
drugs, generating $5 billion in annual revenue, will expire in 2000
and 2001, leaving the company vulnerable to generic knock-offs. The
company could use its $4 billion bounty to buy drugs still under
development and market them as its own.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of a revenue fall-off, Merck has added four
drugs this year: Propecia, for baldness; Singulair, an asthma
medication; Aggrastat for acute angina, and Cosopt, a glaucoma
drug. Maxalt, a drug for migraine headaches, is expected to be
released during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is far from convinced these five drugs will be the
sales miracle Merck predicts. CIBC Oppenheimer estimates that they
will have combined sales next year of $835 million, several billion
short of the drugs they will replace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Merck could use the money to buy back shares as
part of its buy-back program, but the company has enough cash for
that,'' said Neil Sweig, who tracks pharmaceutical stocks for
Southeast Research Partners. ``More than likely, they will buy
products from other companies and shepherd them through the Food
and Drug Administration to bolster their product pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be good news for capital-hungry biotechnology
companies with promising compounds under development.
</P>
<P>
   A third notion has the whole industry salivating. Merck, with a
Marine-like sales force, could merge with another U.S. drug
company.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Gilmartin, Merck's chief executive, is not known for
razzle-dazzle. Merck, with $23.6 billion in sales, posted an
earnings gain of 19 percent, to $4.6 billion, last year. With
numbers like that, Merck's stock should be the envy of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But its shares have gained 29 percent in the last 12 months,
underperforming a number of other drug makers. Lofted by Viagra,
its popular impotence pill, Pfizer has seen its share price
increase 95.3 percent in the same period. Four other drug stocks _
Warner-Lambert, Schering-Plough, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Alza
Corp. _ have all jumped more than 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. drug industry lacks a dominant player. After American
Home Products acquires Monsanto, the merged company will be the
leader, but will control only 6.9 percent of the domestic market
for prescription drugs, according to IMS Health, an industry
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Merck could create a King Kong in the industry, though it might
have to make several acquisitions to do it. Analysts mention
Johnson &AMP; Johnson as a possible merger partner for Merck, noting
they have similar shares of the U.S. prescription-drug market and
similar corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the companies would have U.S. pharmaceutical sales of
$11.3 billion, nearly double that of American Home Products and
Monsanto. Johnson &AMP; Johnson, along with its popular consumer-health
products Tylenol and Neutrogena shampoo and soap, has Risperdal, an
anti-psychotic, and Propulsid, a gastrointestinal drug, each of
which is expected to generate more than $1 billion in sales
worldwide this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this particular combination appears to be a long shot, as
does the entire merger theory. Gilmartin firmly denies that he
intends to merge, saying that he expects his company to outperform
the industry without any help.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing to note is that we don't know how Gilmartin views
the industry,'' Scala of Cowen said. ``He may believe it is going
to perform bleaker than we do. If he believes the industry will
grow mid-to-high single digits each year, then Merck could
outperform it.''

DOCTOR-OWNED MANAGED CARE PLAN COLLAPSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Pa., La., Kan., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sobering blow to the many doctors who want to recapture
control of their patients' care, the California Medical Association
is shutting down the managed care company that it and 7,500 of its
member physicians created to take on the state's big health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After two and a half frustrating years, three chief executives
and $11 million in losses, the CMA's managed care company,
California Advantage, will file for bankruptcy Wednesday, said
Steven Fleisher, a lawyer for the CMA. The business will be slowly
liquidated while the company's insurer fulfills the terms of its
existing contracts for patient care, some extending until next May.
</P>
<P>
   California Advantage never came close to enrolling the 10
percent of the state's population, or 3.3 million people, that its
management set as a 10-year goal early last year, or even the
40,000 it said it needed to break even. It is going out of business
with about 6,000 subscribers _ less than one for each physician
investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a noble and worthy venture,'' said Dr. Jack Lewin, a
family practitioner who is executive vice president of the
28,000-member association. ``Everybody liked the philosophy of
putting patients first and profits second.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort failed, Lewin said, in part because doctors would not
invest enough to sustain it and because, offering subscribers easy
access to thousands of specialists throughout the state, it tended
to attract those who were the sickest and costliest to treat.
</P>
<P>
   But unrealistic expectations and poor planning were factors,
too, said Peter Boland, a health care consultant in Oakland, where
California Advantage had its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a very well intentioned and very naive strategy,''
Boland said of California Advantage's effort to go after the
state's entire market at once on an investment of just a few
million dollars. ``It's a sobering event: one of the country's
biggest medical organizations fails miserably.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alarmed at HMOs' usurping doctors' prerogatives and cutting
their fees, the medical societies of at least a dozen states, and
tens of thousands of their member physicians, have been forming
organizations like California Advantage to manage patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ventures have just begun operating and are too new
to have proved themselves. One that became a prototype, MD Health
Plan, was established in Connecticut in 1986 on an investment of
$6.9 million by the Connecticut State Medical Society and 3,000
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   In time, MD Health Plan became the state's second-biggest
managed care company, with 161,000 subscribers. But in 1995 its
physician owners sold it to a conventional HMO for $101 million,
nearly 15 times the original investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physicians were criticized for being greedy,'' said
Timothy Norbeck, executive director of the State Medical Society.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason for the sale, Norbeck said, was a shortage of
capital _ $10 million to $30 million _ that he said MD Health Plan
had needed to expand and remain competitive with the big HMOs then
crowding into the state.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, insufficient capital was a factor in the demise
of California Advantage. The California Medical Association created
the organization in January 1996 with $7.5 million: $1,000 from
each of 7,500 physician investors. CMA officials say in hindsight
that this was half of what they needed, and some experts say that
even that may be an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Brown, chairman of a similar organization in
Pennsylvania that began enrolling members late last year, said
4,000 physicians had invested $5,500 each, or $22 million.
Investing a third as much, the California doctors tried to tackle a
much larger state.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for more money as the shortage became apparent, the
California Medical Association hit a wall of indifference among its
member physicians, many of whom worked for HMO competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you invest $1,000?'' Dr. Robert Reid, the association's
president, asked in letters to the 35,000 active and retired
members.
</P>
<P>
   The request was largely futile. ``We had only 2,000 responses to
that,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   The association also turned to big corporate investors, but it
did not want to sell a majority interest in the plan and yield
physician control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't find one that would come in with a minority
interest,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other blows. Early last year, for example, California
Advantage began competing against a score of managed care
organizations for the state-sponsored pooled coverage of
small-business employees. Offering easier access to specialists
than most HMOs, it succeeded in capturing about 6,500 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But those subscribers were generally older and sicker than
others, and their premiums did not cover the cost of their care.
Within a few months, the plan's insurance company, which was liable
for the added cost, terminated its policy, and California Advantage
dropped out of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians in other states, including Pennsylvania, Louisiana
and Kansas, are investing more in new doctor-owned plans than the
California doctors did, and face less acute competition from
established HMOs. So their medical societies expect better luck.
</P>
<P>
   But physicians of another big state, New York, have decided that
the stakes are too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told we would have to raise on the order of $60
million to create an HMO,'' said Dr. Charles Aswad, chief executive
of the State Medical Society. ``That makes it a bit too risky for
physicians to get into.''

BRAZIL BEATS MOROCCO 3-0 TO ADVANCE TO 2ND ROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ Ronaldo keeps falling behind his quota of goals
for this World Cup, but now it is official that he will have at
least two more games in which to increase his output.
</P>
<P>
   Quite ambitiously, in his statements before the World Cup began,
the Brazilian star had aimed toward the World Cup record of 13, an
admirable project for a seven-game tournament. Tuesday night he
scored his first, as Brazil defeated Morocco, 3-0, to become the
first team to qualify for the second round.
</P>
<P>
   After being held out of the 1994 World Cup championship at age
17, Ronaldo feels he has some catching up to do. His first goal was
dedicated to his mother, Sonia, and he has announced that he will
dedicate his second to his fiancee, Susana Werner; the third to his
father, Nelio, and the fourth to the mother of his fiancee. In case
he should match the World Cup record, set by the Frenchman Just
Fontaine in 1958, Ronaldo has already filled out the entire list of
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of tightened defenses, a glut of 13 goals is
hardly likely, but at least Brazil got untracked after the tight
2-1 victory in the opener against Scotland, when the Brazilians
were rescued by an own goal by a Scottish defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We entered the field with a better attitude tonight,'' said
Mario Zagallo, the coach, who has been part of all four Brazilian
World Cup titles. ``We were a more happy, more joyful, more
efficient team tonight, and I am happy to see a smaller team play
such interesting football.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an air of anticipation for this game because Morocco
plays an open, Latin-American style under the French coach, Henri
Michel. One of its best players is El Moustafa Hadji, 27, who plays
for La Coruna in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had seen him play without knowing what nationality he
was, I would have sworn he is Brazilian,'' Aldair, the veteran
defender, had said. This was high praise indeed for Hadji, who said
he decorates his 5-year-old son's room with photos of Ronaldo, who
is 6 years younger than Hadji.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our soccer is very technical, like that of the Brazilians,''
Hadji said.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroccan fans and Brazilian fans had formed a bond in the
ancient streets of Nantes, and particularly on the sandy artificial
beach installed behind the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul. The
rapport did not carry onto the field, with Morocco playing a
physical and sometimes chippy game, committing 25 fouls to Brazil's
12.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Said Chiba raked his cleats rather
gratuitously along Ronaldo's left thigh. Later, somebody ripped the
right side of Ronaldo's shorts. However, grabbing at his clothing
could not hold back the highly paid star from Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth minute, Rivaldo advanced a soft pass for Ronaldo,
who turned on the speed and tapped the ball into the goal. Brazil
scored again two minutes into extra time, starting with a gorgeous
advancing pass by Bebeto to Cafu, the tall defender, who took the
ball down the right side, and then sent a low rolling pass in front
of the goal for Rivaldo, who knocked it softly into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes into the second half, the Moroccan defender
Abdelilah Saber was sloppy dribbling up the field, and Ronaldo
burst on him with lethal purpose and stripped him of the ball. Then
Ronaldo evaded Youssef Rossi and sent a pass to Bebeto, who surely
would have resigned from the sport if he had missed, which he did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we were disturbed by the ball movement by Brazil,''
said Michel, who was making a homecoming, having once worked in
this city.
</P>
<P>
   By beating Michel, the Brazilians exorcised a bit of ancient
history. In 1986, Michel was the coach of France in a victory over
Brazil in the World Cup, when Zico, known for his cannonball shots,
missed a penalty kick. Zico is now an adviser to the Brazilian
team.
</P>
<P>
   Start spreading the sand in front of Notre Dame for the
artificial beach soccer field. As the winner of Group A, Brazil
will play in the Round of 16 in Paris on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   But first the Brazilians must play Norway on Tuesday in the
third game of this round, which has an impact on other teams, as
Michel noted, ``because Brazil must beat Norway'' for Morocco to
get through. The Brazilians will not have their powerful defender,
Cesar Sampaio, who picked up his second yellow card Tuesday night
and must sit out the Norway game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget that we haven't won anything, and that we will
start again at zero,'' Zagallo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians are always a good bet to score goals, any time,
anywhere. And Ronaldo has his dedications to fulfill.  &QL;

U.S., MEXICO ANNOUNCES PLAN TO RESCUE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM
DANGER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Acknowledging that illegal immigrants are risking
their lives to get across the border, U.S. and Mexican officials
Tuesday announced a plan to steer illegals away from danger, rescue
them if they get into trouble and better identify them in case of
death.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, said Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner, speaking in Washington, D.C., ``will
enable us to work together with the Mexican government to make the
border safer for both migrants and law enforcement officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement comes at a time of record-high
temperatures in Texas, the kind of heat that contributed to the
deaths nearly 1,200 illegal immigrants between 1993 and 1996,
according to a University of Houston study released last summer.
More than 800 of those perished along the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Four areas will be given immediate attention, including Kenedy
County in South Texas, a stretch of heavily traveled brush country
that has proved deadly to immigrants in recent years. Two perilous
crossing spots were identified in Southern California and one in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is the INS crackdown along the U.S.-Mexico border
that in large part has caused the problem U.S. officials now seek
to address. More manpower, from Brownsville to San Diego, Calif.,
has forced illegal immigrants to seek alternative, often unsafe
routes.
</P>
<P>
   The UH study found that two-thirds of the victims drowned, most
in the Tijuana River and the Rio Grande. But stretches of desert
and brush country such as the terrain found in Kenedy County have
been plenty inhospitable. Two years ago, 19 people died of exposure
there trying to evade a Border Patrol checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexican officials have criticized the United States for
initiatives such as Operation Rio Grande, which provides more
border enforcement in South Texas, ambassador to the United States
Jesus Reyes-Heroles said the latest effort will ``protect the
rights and safety of immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists, who only weeks ago criticized the INS
amid an Amnesty International report that accused the agency of
sexually assaulting migrants and denying them medical treatment,
were generally supportive. Still, some remained wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement sounds nice coming from Washington, D.C.,''
said Nicholas Rizza, national refugee coordinator for Amnesty
International. ``But often, these things don't translate in the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Though certain border locales have previously launched public
service efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from swimming
dangerous channels or trekking vast deserts, Tuesday's announcement
is the first bi-national effort and the first one to be coordinated
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to naming a border safety coordinator, the INS
intends to use the Civil Air Patrol to fly over the unforgiving
stretches of California, Arizona and Texas where immigrants
sometimes cross. The agency will also install lights along the All
American Canal near El Centro, Calif., where so far this year 27
immigrants have drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Border Patrol intends to train its agents in land
and water rescue and stock its trademark vehicles with drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort will enable us to make the protection of human
life the highest priority of our border activities,'' said Gus de
la Vina, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol. He added that the
initiative will make safety a priority for law enforcement officers
as well.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Mexico intends to set up a toll-free hot line for
its citizens who fear their friends or relatives might have
encountered danger crossing the border. Hot line officials would
then contact U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As dangerous as rivers and deserts can be, unscrupulous
smugglers are often the biggest problem facing illegal immigrants.
Recognizing this, Mexico has posted warnings at heavily trafficked
areas along the international boundary.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is offering up to $5,000 for information
leading to the arrest and indictment of traffickers who steer their
clients around checkpoints such as the one in Kenedy County along
U.S. 77 and into dangerous terrain, such as the area where the 19
people died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since last October in the McAllen, Texas, sector, the Border
Patrol reports 21 immigrant deaths, mostly from drowning and
dehydration, and more than 100 rescues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people are women and children,'' said Joe Garza,
chief of the McAllen Border Patrol sector. ``They're not equipped
to be in the brush. They're not in condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The identities of illegal immigrants who perish along the border
have long been a source of mystery for U.S. authorities, who
sometimes bury them in anonymous graves. But U.S. and Mexican
officials Tuesday agreed to cooperate in trying to identify the
dead and notify their families.

 &HT;    Speed techniques of Seagrave keep players on, and off, toes
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Falcons have hired Loren Seagrave's Atlanta-based
company, Speed Dynamics, in an effort to improve the team's speed.
</P>
<P>
   Seagrave has worked with some of track's best athletes,
including 1996 Olympic 100-meter gold medalist and world
record-holder Donovan Bailey of Canada and sprinters Ben Johnson,
Andre Cason, Gwen Torrence and Sandra Farmer-Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   Seagrave and his wife, former world-class 400-meter hurdler
Kathy Freeman Seagrave, teach running technique and use a variety
of methods to improve speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, coaches have been saying run on your toes; athletes
interpret that to mean point your toes (down),'' Seagrave said.
``If you can point your toes up (as the foot strides forward), then
you can cock your ankle, and it serves more as a spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reprogramming their nervous systems to take the strength
they get in the weight room and apply it more efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagrave began working with the Falcons 14 weeks ago. He'll be
on board at least through training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a half-step, maybe a full step faster,'' wide receiver
Terance Mathis said. ``We're learning to get our feet under us for
more explosion. It's helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft choice Keith Brooking made his first
appearance at passing camp and recovered a fumble from rookie
running back Ken Oxendine on his first play of 11-on-11 drills.
Brooking was working at weakside linebacker. ... Jeff Hullinger and
Jeff Van Note, who will be the radio voices of the Falcons on 640
AM and 105.7 FM, were at practice. ... Fullback Bob Christian
practiced a little for the first time since Thursday's knee injury.
Receiver Todd Kinchen (back muscle) missed his second straight
practice. ... Falcons president Taylor Smith and head coach Dan
Reeves, who also holds the title of executive vice president of
football operations, were involved in meetings Tuesday morning with
another group of developers. They will meet with more developers
today. Team officials are listening to ideas on how to proceed with
the Falcon Inn Motel, which will close on Sept. 1, and about 15
acres around it. Ultimately, the decision could affect next year's
training camp. A one-year move might be necessary if there is
construction on the grounds. Several possible scenarios include the
sale of the motel and surrounding property. No decision is
imminent, however, as the family of late Falcons owner Rankin Smith
awaits the appraisal of his Suwanee property. That's not expected
for a few weeks. ... Local free agents dot the roster. Wide
receiver Corey Allen of Georgia said, ``So far, it's pretty much
what I expected, except there's no way you could be prepared for
all this running (in post-practice conditioning).'' Valdosta State
defensive end Richard ``Schad'' Freeman, who had 14 sacks and 71
tackles last season, has been working with the linebackers.
Freeman's former college teammate, safety Brad Trout, has been
practicing with deep snappers.

   Traditional cart for Martin
</P>
<P>
   Because of handling difficulties and safety concerns with the
one-seater vehicle that Casey Martin had been experimenting with in
U.S. Open practice rounds, the USGA decided Tuesday to allow him
use of a traditional golf cart through the conclusion of the
tournament. He may drive the cart on the fairway, the same as the
one-seater. ``I'm not going to be doing curly-Q's in the rough or
anything,'' Martin said. ``Although I'd like to mat it down a
little.'' During a practice round Monday, two varieties of the
smaller, lighter cart broke down and were ineffective on slopes of
the Olympic Club. ``I think the single-rider cart is the right idea
, but I don't think it's there yet,'' said Martin, who suffers from
a circulatory disease in his right leg and won a lawsuit for the
right to ride in competition. ``I'm excited that we're going with
the regular cart. (The one-seater cart) was definitely a (safety)
issue on severe terrain.'' ... Martin not only hung in there
Tuesday during a practice round with his former Stanford teammate,
Tiger Woods, he won 12 skins to Woods' six. ``Yeah, I was taken for
some cash today,'' Woods admitted. Joking on the range afterward,
Martin said, ``Tiger didn't know what hit him. Now he says I've got
an advantage (with a cart) since I beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Par could be a good score
</P>
<P>
   Scott Simpson, the 1987 champion at Olympic, said he would take
3-under par again for 72 holes and be quite thankful. Tom Watson is
predicting that the winning score in the U.S. Open, where par is
70, will be over that. Defending champion Ernie Els won't go that
far, but suggests that maybe 4 or 5 under will win. Said Watson,
who finished a stroke behind Simpson in 1987, ``It's going to be
difficult to shoot around par here.'' The main reason? Watson said
Olympic's rough, which is grotesquely thick and up to seven inches
long, is ``the most difficult I've ever seen in a U.S. Open. ...
When you hit the ball in the rough at Colonial (where Watson won
last month), you could still get the ball on the green. You hit the
ball in the rough here, you're lucky to move it 50 or 60 yards.''
Chipping or flopping from the heavy stuff, Watson generally is
recognized as the best in the world, and he's not hoping for
anything closer than a 15-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   From across the pond
</P>
<P>
   England's Lee Westwood, who won at New Orleans on the PGA Tour
this spring, and Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, are Europe's top
U.S. Open contenders. It's an annual occurrence for Montgomerie,
who has come close three times and failed. It's the first serious
contention for Westwood, 25, after back-to-back wins on the
European Tour earlier this year. ``I think the way I'm playing, if
I play well this week, then I can win it,'' he said. ... Atlanta's
Danny Yates, 48, has been named captain of the 1999 U.S. Walker Cup
in matches against Great Britain and Ireland on Sept. 11-12. ``I'd
hoped if I lived long enough something like this would happen one
day,'' said Yates, who plays out of Atlanta's Peachtree Golf Club.
``This is such a humbling honor when I think about the people who
have been captain in the past.''

 &HT;    AGI names Gittens its regional director
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Angela Gittens has landed on her feet.
</P>
<P>
   The former general manager of Hartsfield International Airport,
who was ousted by Mayor Bill Campbell when he chose not to
reappoint her, is joining Airport Group International as its
regional director of North America. She will be based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   AGI, known until 1995 as Lockheed Air Terminal, performs airport
services for airlines, such as fueling, ground handling and cargo
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This achieves several things,'' said Gittens, whose departure
sparked criticism of the mayor's office. ``I get to stay in the
business, I get to stay in Atlanta and I also can get involved in
an early trend in the corporatization of airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, AGI has been buying airports internationally as part
of a privatization trend. It owns five airports in Australia, three
in Bolivia and soon one in London. In the United States, AGI
manages several airports including those in Columbus, Ohio; Albany,
N.Y.; and Burbank, Calif. AGI's major competitor worldwide is the
British Airports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bullock, AGI's senior vice president of operations, said
Gittens was hired as part of a company effort to recruit top
aviation managers. He got to know Gittens when he was executive
director of the Orlando airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela has significant leadership experience at two of the
largest and best-run airports in the country, Atlanta and San
Francisco,'' he said. ``She is extremely well-respected in the
industry, and she has tremendous interpersonal skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Gittens said her management will exclude Atlanta for one year. A
city ordinance prevents former employees from doing business with
the city for a year. Once that year is up, she said her
jurisdiction would include Hartsfield, where AGI has several
contracts to run two ramp control towers and provide ground
services.

 &HT;    Aching back holds Els back
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Ernie Els is known for making it all look so
easy. The swing is long and graceful and repeats so effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out all those observations this week. Instead of peaking
into the U.S Open as defending champion, Els is creaking. Lower
back spasms that pushed him out of the Buick Classic last week have
clouded his status for the Olympic Club. The affable South African
might contend. He might convulse. Each day is unsettled. He
slouches slightly in an interview room chair, admitting that
sitting is the worst part and, sorry, but the discussion might have
to be brief.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, he's miserable. After playing a practice round
Tuesday _ his first 18 holes since the previous Tuesday _ Els could
not hit balls for fear of inflaming his lower back. He has gone
from contender to question mark, and it's killing him to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's the wrong timing for me to get this kind of
injury,'' Els said.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the parade of players who have sought treatment from
Columbus physical therapist Tom Boers, Els is in less pain than
last week, when the left side of his lower back ``kind of seized up
a little and went into spasm,'' but hardly able to play with his
normal confidence. Boers put him on a strengthening and exercise
program similar to those of his other patients, Davis Love III and
Fred Couples. Now it's wait-and-watch and hopefully not wince.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the healing process now,'' Els said. ``I know I have
the right guy working on it, and if I can just get through the next
couple of weeks without doing too much damage to it, I'll be all
right. ... Last Thursday I could barely swing through the ball.
Today I could feel it, but the pain was a lot less.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully for Els, this is Olympic and not Oakland Hills.
Although monster-length holes exist, like the 609-yard, par-5 16th
and the 468-yard, par-4 17th, long hitters such as Els will use a
driver on perhaps five holes. Els is hoping that being able to hit
long irons on several occasions off the tee might reduce his
chances of reinjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to put the ball in play and take it from there,''
he said, ``and it might work to my advantage, you never know.
Beware of injured golfers, as they say sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, who travels worldwide as much as anyone in golf, might have
to reduce his schedule beyond the majors. Fitting his 6-foot-3 body
into an airplane seat is hardly ideal for his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom said it's from traveling,'' Els said. ``The golf swing
isn't all that bad for you if you don't overwork it.''

FINAL OUTCOME ERASED LEGAL ERRORS IN WOODWARD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG   AND JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It wasn't pretty and mistakes were made, but the trial
of Louise Woodward ultimately ended with a decision that was
legally justified, Massachusetts' highest court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court's 46-page decision is a dissertation
on what went wrong with the trial, but in the final analysis the
justices determined that any errors of law were rendered harmless
by the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court correctly evaluated a case where there was plenty of
error to go around,'' said Boston lawyer Morris Goldings. ``The
system has a way of correcting its own errors, sometimes
fitfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC said Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel erred when he
granted a defense request that the jury be barred from considering
the less serious charge of manslaughter. The jury found Woodward
guilty of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Zobel, the high court ruled, was able to right his own wrong by
later reducing the jury verdict to manslaughter _ which the SJC
suggested was the appropriate verdict because there was no evidence
of prior abuse by Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there was no evidence in this case of repeated caretaker
abuse, the judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that
the jury verdict of murder was not proportionate with convictions
in other cases,'' Justice Margaret H. Marshall wrote for the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Woodward and her lawyers last year to ask Zobel
to prevent the jury from considering the manslaughter option was a
moment of high legal drama.
</P>
<P>
   That so-called ``all or nothing strategy'' was based on the
belief the prosecution didn't present enough evidence to warrant a
murder conviction. Without the manslaughter option, the defense
gambled that the jury would be forced to return a not guilty
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC, however, said it has historically ``declined to
penalize defendants who adopt an all-or-nothing strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one of Woodward's lawyers Tuesday said he would
reconsider the strategy if given a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We engaged in a strategy that resulted in conviction of
second-degree murder,'' said Harvey Silverglate. ``If you ask me,
`Would I do it the same way again?' I would have to have my head
examined, wouldn't I? ... I doubt very much we would do it the same
way again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the SJC determined that the manslaughter conviction was
appropriate, the court made it clear it was not exonerating
Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not view the judgment against Woodward as a light
matter,'' Marshall wrote. ``She stands guilty of causing an
infant's violent death. The outcome of this criminal trial most
assuredly was not an acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC decision also was seen as a strong endorsement of the
broad and powerful discretion given to trial judges in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trial judge has lots of discretion to basically do the right
thing,'' said Boston College Law School professor Robert Bloom, who
wrote ``Constitutional Criminal Procedure.'' ``The judge has a
responsibility in every criminal case, regardless of the jury's
decision, to seek justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, challenges to cases in which a judge reduces a verdict
in Massachusetts are rare. Since 1979, 10 reductions were appealed
and seven of those were upheld.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC decision Tuesday was not without its detractors,
including three of the court's seven justices who issued a
dissenting opinion on whether or not the sentence for Woodward was
too lenient. Zobel sentenced Woodward to the 279 days she had
already spent in prison awaiting the outcome of her trial.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John M. Greaney, writing for the dissenters, said Zobel
moved too quickly to sentence Woodward after throwing out the
jury's verdict, ``resulting in a sense of unease that permeated the
proceedings that followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters also concluded it appeared that Zobel
``identified himself with Woodward's cause, compromising the
public's confidence in the integrity and impartiality of our
courts.''

   With the introduction earlier this month of Metro Jet, a
low-fare service, U S Airways is trying to beat Southwest Airlines
at its own game. Metro Jet is competing with Southwest on routes
between Baltimore and four cities: Cleveland; Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.; Manchester, N.H., and Providence, R.I. None of the routes
overlap with U S Airways' regular service.
</P>
<P>
   A ticket on Metro Jet between Baltimore and Fort Lauderdale
starts at $163 one way with no restrictions, or $194 round trip
with a seven-day advance purchase and one-day stay. There are
several flights daily on each route.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, not surprisingly, expressed some skepticism about the
venture. ``We have one of the lowest cost structures in the
industry, and US Airways has one of the highest,'' said Linda
Rutherford, a spokeswoman for the airline. ``It will be interesting
to watch how successful the airline is at not only providing the
service but also remaining profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, Metro Jet plans to add flights between Baltimore and
Miami, Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., and Jacksonville, Fla. On Aug.
3, Orlando, Fla., is scheduled to follow. The all-coach flights use
Boeing 737-200s, with seat assignments made on the day of
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers who are members of U S Airways' frequent-flier
program will get one free round-trip Metro Jet ticket when they
take eight round-trip or 16 one-way Metro Jet flights, in addition
to earning miles. Those who do not want the free ticket can get
double miles instead. U S Airways expects to have 20 planes
dedicated to the service by the end of the year and 54 by the end
of 1999.

   Laptop Lane, a new company operating office centers at airports,
is preparing to open at Seattle-Tacoma Airport on June 25. SEA-TAC
is the second location for the Seattle-based company. The first, at
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, opened in May,
and an Atlanta center is planned for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., the centers contain private,
individual offices, each equipped with a Micron desktop computer;
connections for a traveler's laptop; access to a high-speed
Internet line; a laser printer; a plain-paper fax machine, and a
multiline phone.
</P>
<P>
   Each office has a glass door that can be locked. The cost is
$8.95 a half-hour, with extra fees for long-distance calls or
long-distance faxes. (Local calls and faxes are free.) Additional
services, for a charge, include black-and-white or color copying
and a color laser printer. For now, the service is on a first-come,
first-served basis.
</P>
<P>
   Travel-Agency Fees
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of member agencies responding to a recent
survey by the American Society of Travel Agents are now charging
fees for their services. In a 1995 survey, the ratio was just 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most (84 percent) of the agents charging fees said they began
doing so after the major airlines cut their commissions last fall.
Some of the services for which fees are most often charged are
transactions involving special coupons and promotions; refunds or
exchanges; issue of at least some airline tickets; cancellations,
and trip planning or research. Of the agencies charging service
fees for airline tickets, the average fee is $10.37.
</P>
<P>
   Though the society did not break down the survey results by
agency clientele, James Ashurst, a spokesman for the American
Society of Travel Agents, said the organization believed the survey
reflected the average member agency, for which business travelers
make up 30 percent to 40 percent of sales. Smaller agencies are
less likely to charge fees _ 53 percent of those with sales under
$1 million said they did so, compared with 68 percent of those with
sales of $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Door to Terminal Door
</P>
<P>
   Super Shuttle, the door-to-door van service that began carrying
passengers last month on shared rides in New York between Manhattan
and Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport, plans to
start serving Newark International Airport in New Jersey on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's seven-passenger vans pick up and drop off
passengers between 23rd and 126th streets in New York City. Average
fares are $14 to La Guardia, $15 to Kennedy and $17 to Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix-based company serves more than a dozen other regions
around the United States, including Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver and Philadelphia. The toll-free
reservation number is (800) 258-3826.
</P>
<P>
   Super Shuttle says pick-up requests need to be made at least
three hours in advance. No reservations are taken for airport
arrivals; passengers go to the ground transportation desk and catch
the next available van.

FUEL CELL WILL SUPPLY POWER TO N.Y. TEST HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic showing how a fuel cell works is being sent to
NYT graphics clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.) 
(th) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, an energy technology called a
fuel cell will supply all the power to a suburban house, another
sign that fuel cells are on the verge of acceptance as an
economical alternative to traditional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of fuel cells _ which convert liquid fuel into
electricity through a chemical reaction rather than combustion _
has been around for more than 100 years. But until recently, fuel
cells were so expensive that it was practical only for NASA's
specialized use on space missions. But the cells being tested now
are powerful, flexible and reliable enough to work as an affordable
earth-bound energy source.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a team of engineers will cut off the electricity
the local utility company provides to a brick ranch-style house in
Latham, N.Y., and switch on a back-porch component that looks more
like a home central air-conditioning unit than the small chemical
plant it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in the past few weeks include the first commercial
sale of a fuel cell for remote power (to the New Jersey Department
of Transportation, for a traffic warning sign) and the first
street-ready car powered by a fuel cell (built by students at
Humboldt State University in California). And in April, Ford put
$420 million into Ballard Power Systems, a fuel cell company in
Vancouver, B.C., in which Daimler-Benz already has a major
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Energy Department, which is helping to pay for
the test in Latham, say they have high hopes that within a few
years thousands of homes will be drawing electric power from fuel
cells powered by natural gas or propane, cutting pollution and
consuming less fuel than conventional energy production.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, we've seen significant breakthroughs,'' said
Energy Secretary Federico Pena in a telephone interview. ``We're
going to see fuel cells in homes, cars and other uses much sooner
than we had predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reicher, the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and
renewable energy, said, ``The launch of a fuel-cell-powered house
is up there with the introduction of the electric refrigerator, the
room air-conditioner and the fluorescent light.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made fuel cells more practical has been improvements in
the gossamer-thin components, which look like plastic food wrap or
aluminum foil, that are used to turn a basic chemical reaction _
the combination of oxygen and hydrogen to make water _ into the
basis of an energy revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the fuel cell being used in house in Latham and
being studied for use in automobiles is called a proton-exchange
membrane. When a hydrogen atom _ one proton and one electron _ is
pressed against that membrane, the proton passes through and the
electron is left behind. That creates a positive charge on one side
of the membrane and a negative charge on the other; wire them
together, and the result is a flow of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Leonard, the program supervisor for fuel cells at
California's South Coast Air Quality Management District, one of
many government agencies eagerly watching the research, said:
``Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is a simple process that
takes electricity. Combining them to make water and electricity,
well, you don't get much simpler than that. I don't think there are
many doubters.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Michael Walsh, a mechanical engineer who is a
consultant to the company running the Latham test, Plug Power, and
who lives in the house five days a week with, among other devices,
a stereo, a personal computer and a clock radio that wakes him in
the morning. They will operate the same, whatever the electricity
source, he said, and people inside the house ``won't know whether
we are running on the grid or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the breakthroughs, fuel cells are still much too
expensive for everyday use. The car companies, which would probably
be the biggest users of an efficient fuel cell, say that they still
cost roughly 100 times more per horsepower than an internal
combustion engine does. Chrysler, for example, figures that each
car-sized fuel-cell stack it buys costs $170,000. And running
houses on fuel cells is substantially more expensive than relying
on power from conventional utility plants.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power will not say what its prototype cost, arguing that
the figure is about as relevant as the cost of producing the first
automobile of a model year; it is astronomical but allows the
production of thousands more units at lower cost. Plug Power
predicts that it can commercialize fuel cells for houses by 2000,
at a cost of $3,000 to $5,000 each. Detroit Edison, a part-owner of
Plug Power, plans to purchase 30,000 to 50,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey company, H-Power, also hopes for mass sales. In
March it made what it describes as the first ever unsubsidized,
fully commercial sale of a fuel cell that will supply energy for a
trailer-mounted highway sign, the kind that are commonly used to
warn of construction projects along the roadway. The company will
supply 65 of them for $759,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an arms-length sale, with no subsidies, with a warranty
and all the aspects of a commercial sale,'' said Arthur Kaufman, an
executive at H-Power.

YUGOSLAV LEADER MAKES CONCESSIONS ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to expand 5th graf)  (Eds.: budgeted earlier as BOSNIA-MILOSEVIC; see also KOSOVO-U.S.) 
(BL) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic promised
Tuesday to make a series of concessions over Kosovo to forestall
military action by the West. But he stopped short of meeting one
key demand: the withdrawal of Serbian security forces accused of
attacking ethnic Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of closed-door meetings here with top Russian
officials, the Yugoslav leader announced his promises _ including
access for relief groups and international monitors as well as
arrangements for refugees to return _ in a joint statement with
President Boris Yelstin.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, who are also eager to head off NATO air
strikes, were quick to cast Milosevic's promises as an important
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from clear, however, whether Milosevic's pledges were
merely tactical or whether he was genuinely prepared to ease the
repression in Kosovo, whose population is predominantly ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that Milosevic had only met NATO part
way. Western diplomats at NATO headquarters said the alliance was
continuing to work on military options. But the threat of military
action has, in effect, been deferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some progress,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said. But she added that that Milosevic ``did not meet the
primary points that the Contact Group raised.'' Western diplomats
at NATO headquarters said that the alliance was continuing to work
on military options. But the threat of military action has, in
effect, been deferred. The Contact Group, which monitors events in
the Balkans, includes Britain, Germany, France and Italy as well as
the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant press conference in an ornate Russian Foreign
Ministry mansion, Milosevic denied that Serbian forces had ever
harmed ethnic Albanians. ``There was no kind of ethnic cleansing,''
Milosevic said. ``In the latest actions it was declared by the
security forces there were no civilian victims at all.''
</P>
<P>
   International observers have painted a very different picture.
They say that at least 250 ethnic Albanians have been killed in the
fighting and at least 65,000 have been forced to abandon their
homes in the separatist province.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has condemned the Serbian
crackdown as ``ethnically driven violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's talks took place a day after NATO conducted air
exercises over the Balkans in an effort to pressure him to end the
crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He met with Yeltsin on Tuesday and then engaged in several hours
of talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev and other top Russian aides as the two sides sought
to cobble together a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Kosovo crisis, the Kremlin has had conflicting
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Yeltsin has an interest in maintaining good
relations with the West, especially since Moscow wants billions of
dollars in Western loans to help overcome its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian officials also acknowledge that Milosevic has gone
too far in Kosovo. Primakov, for example, went along last week with
the demand by his fellow foreign ministers in the so-called
``Contact Group'' on the Balkans who insisted that Milosevic
withdraw security forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians see solidarity with their fellow Slavs in
Yugoslavia as a useful card to play in Russian domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also believe that Milosevic is defending an
important principle when he says that he is entitled to take firm
steps to insure that Kosovo remains part of Serbia. Russia has its
own regions of ethnic tension and is not eager to invite
international scrutiny or intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Primakov enjoys playing a pivotal role in world affairs
and is no friend of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO countries have threatened measures including military
intervention if Milosevic does not stop the Serbian offensive
against ethnic Albanians. And the newspaper Izvestiya bluntly
outlined one of the main purposes of Tuesday's meeting: ``Russia is
trying to save the Serbs from NATO bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of lengthy negotiations, Primakov claimed a major
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this opens up a real possibility to resolve the
situation,'' Primakov said at a joint news conference with
Milosevic. ``In many ways, the ball is now in the court of the
Kosovo Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials will be monitoring the situation in Kosovo for
the next several weeks to see if the Serbs keep their promises.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has, in fact, promised to take some noteworthy steps.
In the joint statement, he agreed there would be no restrictions on
the work of international organizations, such as the International
Committee of the Red Cross, or on international monitors. And he
promised to allow refugees who had fled Kosovo to return.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to continue talks with ethnic Albanians on
``forms of autonomy,'' though he spurned the idea of doing so with
the help of international mediators. Western officials are worried
that any talks will stall without international supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The Western-dominated ``Contact Group'' had demanded that
Milosevic recall intelligence and army units sent to Kosovo for the
crackdown. Security forces inside Kosovo, they insisted, should be
confined to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, Milosevic refused to take the initiative and
instead put the onus on the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``As terrorist activities subside, security forces will reduce
their presence outside the areas of their permanent deployment,''
Milosevic's joint statement with Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees crossing into Albania from Kosovo on Tuesday reported
attacks on mountain refugee camps by Yugoslav army helicopters, but
there was no independent confirmation of those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president told reporters Tuesday that his position
was intended to protect the principle of Serbian sovereignty over
the Kosovo region. He revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no reasons or grounds for the Yugoslav army not to
be on the territory of Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said. ``Any
withdrawal of units of the Yugoslav army from any part of
Yugoslavia is out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's statement also showed some of the contradictions in
the Russian stance.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who sat at Milosevic's side throughout the press
conference, joined the ``Contact Group's'' call for the withdrawal
of Serbian security forces. But the Russian foreign minister then
endorsed the far weaker measure Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seemed to enjoy his verbal jousts with the press
Tuesday. To the obvious discomfort of his Russian hosts, he
occasionally lapsed into English to respond to Western reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When Western reporters pressed Milosevic about the violence in
Kosovo, he shot back that Albanian ``terrorist groups'' had
launched reprisals against ethnic Albanians who refused to support
them.
</P>
<P>
   As Milosevic ended his remarks, Primakov cut off the session,
reminding the Yugoslav president that he was late for a visit with
the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic seemed ready for another round of sparring and
wrapped up the news conference with an invitation to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, next time, if you want longer talks, you
come to Belgrade,'' Milosevic said. ``You are invited, all of
you.''

RULING DISMAYS WOODWARD JURORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jurors who served on the Louise Woodward case expressed
bitterness and frustration about a Supreme Judicial Court decision
Tuesday which upheld a reduced verdict and sentence for the former
British au pair.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, who says she has received dozens of threats from all
over the country, asked not to be identified, but read a statement,
expressing her anger toward the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jury of 12 individuals, of whom I was one, found Louise
Woodward directly and solely responsible for the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen on Feb. 4, 1997,'' she said. ``I am
repulsed by the many people, Judge Hiller Zobel included, who were
more concerned with the prospect of Ms. Woodward's temporary loss
of freedom, than they were with an innocent baby's loss of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The juror would later say during a telephone interview that
``nothing about this case makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   During Woodward's trial last year, the defense instructed the
12-person jury to either find Woodward guilty of first- or
second-degree murder and not to consider manslaughter, believing
jurors would be hard-pressed to find the then 18-year-old guilty.
But the jury came back with a guilty verdict, sending shockwaves
around two continents.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Zobel reduced the jury's second-degree murder
conviction to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Colwell, another juror in the case, said he still
strongly believes Woodward is guilty of the child's death but feels
comfortable that the Supreme Judicial Court in its opinion upheld
her guilt and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the punishment may be less than what she deserved,'' he
said. ``The fact that she only spent 279 days (in jail), in my
opinion, is not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   One alternate juror, who also asked not to be identified, said
he was happy with Tuesday's decision and always thought jurors made
the wrong decision in convicting Woodward of murder.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the alternates, who he described as
analytical-minded people _ some engineers and one attorney, would
have fought for a not guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Alternates were designated after all the testimony and before
the start of deliberations. ``There was a lot of pressure,'' he
said. ``I will never, and I mean never, serve on a jury again.''

SENATE VOTES TO LIMIT LAWYERS' FEES IN TOBACCO SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what could be a crucial week on tobacco
legislation, the Senate voted on Tuesday by the narrowest of
margins to limit lawyers' fees in suits against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came shortly after Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, scheduled a meeting of all Republican senators for
Wednesday morning to decide whether to stop debate on the tobacco
bill and bring the legislation to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment added to the extensive tobacco bill provides that
lawyers who took the greatest risk and were involved in cases
before 1995 could collect as much as $4,000 an hour. But the
allowable fee would drop on a sliding scale so that those who enter
cases after Tuesday could not charge more than $500 an hour. As
matters now stand, some lawyers could make tens of millions of
dollars from tobacco suits that have been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who were in this litigation early,'' said Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., the sponsor of the amendment, ``the reward they
have earned is considerably larger than the awards that will be
earned by those who got into this litigation very late in the game
when it was obvious that the litigation was going to be settled for
large amounts of money or litigated successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's amendment was approved, 49 to 48. Two earlier
amendments to restrict lawyers' fees that were rejected, one last
month and one last week, did not distinguish between lawyers who
brought suits early and those who became involved late.
</P>
<P>
   The question of lawyers' fees is a highly partisan one and goes
far beyond the tobacco issue. For years, trial lawyers have been
among the Democrats' most loyal and generous supporters.
Republicans, on the other hand, depend more on business interests
for political support. These interests fear damage suits generally
and are especially worried that trial lawyers will use the windfall
from tobacco suits to finance suits in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the tobacco legislation said that they hoped the cap
on legal fees would enhance the prospects of Senate passage of the
bill soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation's chances are bleak in the House, where
Republican leaders have said that they are unalterably opposed to
the Senate bill. They have not offered a measure of their own. But
they seem to favor dealing with teen-age smoking with the
low-budget, approach of ``Just Say No'' that the Reagan
administration took to drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The main interest of President Clinton, who favors strong
anti-smoking legislation, is to get virtually any bills passed by
the Senate and House so a conference committee will have an
opportunity to work out a final bill. Conference committees are
where the White House has the most influence because that is where
the threat of a presidential veto becomes most meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Democrats are almost unanimously in favor of
ending the debate on the tobacco bill, a procedure called cloture
that requires 60 votes in the 100-member Senate for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are split on the question. If Lott proposes cloture,
considered the prerogative of the majority leader, enough
Republicans will probably go along to approve it. If that happens,
the bill will almost surely be passed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have voted solidly against cloture motions on the
tobacco bill proposed by Democrats, considering them challenges to
the Republican leadership.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lott has expressed serious personal reservations about the
tobacco legislation, as have many other Republican senators. But
Lott has also said repeatedly that the Senate needs to move on to
other important bills like those that provide the money to run the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief sponsor of the tobacco
bill, said Tuesday that he hoped the resolution of the issue of
lawyers' fees would provide the impetus for the Republican
leadership to support cloture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we made a decision on this bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have said that they will prevent the Senate from
dealing with any other issue until the tobacco bill is voted up or
down, and they seem to have the votes to sustain that threat.
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining contentious amendment, McCain said, involves
whether to end the government's price-support program for tobacco
growers and what kind of assistance to offer the farmers and
communities whose economies are dependent on tobacco. Debate on
those matters began on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the bill stands now, it would raise cigarette prices by at
least $1.10 a pack, give the government new authority to regulate
cigarette advertising and marketing, and impose penalties on the
tobacco companies if the rate of teen-age smoking did not fall to
specified levels.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also give a tax break to married couples with
incomes below $50,000 a year and create a new anti-drug program.
</P>
<P>
   Voting on the amendment to limit lawyers' fees was stretched to
40 minutes, about twice as long as normal, as the two sides tried
desperately to switch votes to tilt the issue their way.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who had voted against the
amendment, was prevailed on by the Republican leadership to change
his vote, providing the one-vote margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Healy, a spokesman for Smith, said he was persuaded that
the bill would go down to defeat without a limit on lawyers' fees
and that this was his last chance to vote on such limits.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five Republicans and four Democrats voted for the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Forty Democrats and eight Republicans voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Voting ``present'' because of family conflicts were Lott, whose
brother-in-law is the main lawyer in Mississippi's suit against the
tobacco industry, and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., whose husband's
law firm is involved in tobacco cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., who recently had heart surgery, was
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote was probably the final one on lawyers' fees in
this round, but the matter will doubtless come up again before any
tobacco bill is enacted.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In their suits against tobacco companies, many states and
individuals retained private lawyers on a contingency basis,
meaning that the lawyers got nothing if they lost in court but were
entitled to a percentage of the damages if they won or if the suit
was settled.
</P>
<P>
   No one anticipated how large those fees might be. In Texas, for
instance, the industry settled with the state for $15.3 billion,
and the contract calls for lawyers to receive 15 percent. Lester
Brickman, a professor at the Cardozo Law School at Yeshiva
University who helped draft the Gorton amendment, was hired as an
expert by the state of Texas. He concluded that the lawyers' fees
would amount to $92,000 an hour based on their work product and the
percentage claimed. But under the amendment, the lawyers would
receive about $2,000 an hour based on the fact that the lawsuit was
filed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would allow lawyers who began litigation before
1995, when many put up their own money to pay for the suits and
when the prospect of winning seemed remote, to collect up to $4,000
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Those who became involved between the beginning of 1995 and
April 1997, when secret negotiations began between the tobacco
companies and state attorneys general, could get up to $2,000 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who started cases between April 1997 and Tuesday could
charge $1,000 an hour, and those who sign on after Tuesday could
get no more than $500 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Brickman estimated that the amendment would result in lawyer fee
reductions of tens of billions of dollars in coming years. He said
that he believed that the biggest losers would be lawyers in
Florida and Texas who were seeking to enforce contingency
agreements with states as well as those lawyers who filed tobacco
cases in the last year.

3 BRITONS CONVICTED AFTER VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLES, France _ There were no bottles and cans hissing
menacingly through the air outside the Stade Velodrome on Tuesday.
No clashes between the fans of England, the fans of Tunisia and no
thrill-seeking local teen-agers on the Prado Beach.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 48 hours of hooliganism and vandalism, which
resulted in scores of injuries, 88 arrests and so far three
convictions, relative calm returned to France's second-largest
city. The question now is whether the trouble is over or simply in
remission.
</P>
<P>
   England will play at least two more games in this World Cup _ in
Toulouse next Monday and in Lens on June 26 _ and its fans, both
the peaceful majority and the bellicose minority, have every
intention of watching their favorite team in person.
</P>
<P>
   Some will not get the chance. Two Britons, Graham Whitby and
Christopher Anderson, both 27, were given three-month prison
sentences on Monday. James Shayler, a 32-year-old British roofer,
was given a two-month sentence. After their terms, all three will
be banned from entering French territory for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the French Interior Ministry also deported five Britons
and one Tunisian because of their actions on Sunday night when the
violence was at its worst in the old port of Marseilles. Sixteen
more of the rioters were to appear before a Marseilles tribunal
late Tuesday and at least 20 more, including 12 minors, will be
judged at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   What can Toulouse and Lens learn from Marseilles' long and
unpleasant weekend? Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse, has
already postponed the city's annual music festival, which was
scheduled for Sunday, the night before the England-Romania game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of exposing thousands of young people to
this sort of danger,'' Baudis said. ``I don't want to see the
squares of Toulouse turned into battle grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   From Thursday through Monday, bars and restaurants in Toulouse
will close at 11 p.m. The city's two large video screens, where
fans without tickets watched the first two matches in Toulouse,
will be shut down for the England match to avoid the sort of
altercations that occurred at the Prado beach on Monday during the
England-Tunisia game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give hooligans a staging ground for their
activities,'' Baudis said. ``That's what they're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional 180 police officers will supplement the 1,300 who
were already scheduled to be in Toulouse for the match.
Reinforcements also will be sent to Lens.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just a question of numbers. Several shopkeepers
and bar proprietors in Marseilles said police officers sometimes
stood by waiting for orders while damage was being done or fighting
was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very attentive, and the police who were in some
cases spread out needed to be quicker to react,'' said Dominique
Vlasto, a spokesman for the Marseilles tourist office.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Gaudin, the mayor of Marseilles, said, ``The error
we made was not to want to give the image of Marseilles as a city
under siege.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that about 400 English fans caused the trouble, many of
them not known hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these people, you must take the initiative,'' he said.
``Afterward, it's nearly impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Britons crossing into France or other continental European
nations are required to show passports at the border, which in
theory should make it possible to identify known hooligans before
they arrive. In practice, there are many ways to slip across
European borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came from everywhere,'' Vlasto said. ``We saw some
arriving in cars the same morning. Some were already in France and
came alone, some in small groups. It's very tough today in Europe.
The border controls are not as strict as before. Perhaps it needs
to be done more seriously upon arrival, but how can you refuse
English people if they are not known troublemakers?''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the disturbances in Marseilles, French officials
were in no mood to give the benefit of the doubt. Police held 58
Scottish supporters for four hours Tuesday after the group arrived
in Bordeaux for the match between Scotland and Norway. The group,
reportedly identified after a tip was received from Scottish
police, crossed into France from Spain and had no tickets for the
match.
</P>
<P>
   The fans reportedly were allowed to watch the match on
television under surveillance and then were to be escorted back to
the border. Several German fans were also arrested in Paris on
Monday night before the match between the United States and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   If England were to finish second in its group, an entirely
feasible prospect, and then win its second-round match, it would
play in Marseilles again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens,'' Gaudin, the Marseilles Mayor said, ``I
would ask the French republic to put all possible means at our
disposal to avoid any more problems.''  &QL;

TEXAS MURDER MAY NOT FALL UNDER US HATE STATUTE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As hateful as the brutal murder of James Byrd Jr.
was last week in Jasper, Texas, federal authorities may not be able
to prosecute the slaying as a hate crime, lawmakers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law on hate crimes requires prosecutors to prove
not only that a crime was racially motivated but also that the
victim was engaged in an activity specifically protected under the
statute, such as going to school or work, serving on a jury or
using public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy and the other lawmakers said the short
list of activities protected under the law has prevented hate crime
prosecutions in many racially motivated crimes in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the limitations, federal prosecutors are fighting
bigotry with one hand tied behind their backs,'' Kennedy said at a
news conference as he called on Congress to pass a stronger hate
crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper police said Byrd, 49, a disabled grandfather and amateur
musician, was walking home from a family party when he accepted a
ride from three white supremacists in a pickup truck. The three men
allegedly beat Byrd, chained him to the back of the truck and
dragged him more than two miles on a paved country road, tearing
him to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence indicates the murder was racially motivated,
Jasper police said. But the county prosecutor, Guy Adam Gray, who
wants to seek the death penalty in the case, said the killing may
not qualify as a capital crime under Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Jasper police summoned the FBI to investigate the
slaying as a possible hate crime, which could be punishable by the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy and several other lawmakers said the current
law is so restrictive that Byrd, by accepting a ride from the white
supremacists, may not have been engaging in an activity that is
specifically protected under the federal hate crime statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be no federal jurisdiction to prosecute those
responsible'' for Byrd's murder, said Representative John Conyers
Jr. of Michigan, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee. ``And the fact is, there should be federal
jurisdiction over crimes so hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that Kennedy, Conyers and others filed last year
would permit federal prosecutors to pursue hate crime charges if
they believe cases are motivated by the victim's race, color,
national origin or religion. The list of protected activities would
be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which is scheduled for a hearing July 8 before the
Senate Judiciary Committee, would also expand the hate crimes law
to cover crimes motivated by a victim's gender, sexual orientation
or disability.

ADVERTISING: NETWORKS EXULT OVER FLAT SALES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT  c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That loud sound you may have heard in recent days was
a collective sigh emanating from the top executives of the four
major broadcast television networks, who have been able to sell
about as much advance commercial time for the 1998-99 prime-time
season as they did for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Four _ ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC _ have sold an estimated
$6.05 billion to $6.1 billion worth of commercial time during the
up-front market, so called because the time is peddled to
advertisers before a season begins. That compares with $6 billion
to $6.05 billion sold ahead of the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   And if the definition of broadcast TV is expanded to include the
two new ``weblets'' _ the UPN and the WB _ the up-front market rose
to approximately $6.4 billion to $6.5 billion, compared with $6.25
billion to $6.3 billion in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a year where everybody walked away from the table
happy,'' said Paul Schulman, president of the Paul Schulman Company
division of Advanswers Media Programming in New York, a unit of
Omnicom Group that buys broadcast TV time for marketers. ``It was a
good up-front for all.''
</P>
<P>
   In many industries, of course, flattish sales would be cause for
concern rather than celebration. But broadcast television, besieged
by viewer defections and beset by competition from cable networks
and even the Internet, is happy to have won by not losing, escaping
the steep declines that had been forecast before the start of the
up-front selling period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much better story for the network business than we had
thought,'' said Joseph Abruzzese, president for network sales at
the CBS unit of CBS Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``To keep the money in network television after a banner year
last year is important,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Nesvig, president for sales at the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit
of the News Corp. in New York, had a one-word response when asked
his feelings about how broadcasters fared in the up-front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phew!'' he said, laughing, then continued: ``Maybe we
shouldn't be breaking out the party hats and the champagne. We're
all looking for ways to improve our business. But given what's
happening, the erosion in audiences, it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency media executives, who face Abruzzese, Nesvig and their
counterparts across the negotiating table, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the networks would have liked to have seen better
numbers because neutral is not generally where you want to stay,''
said Michael Kassan, president and chief operating officer at the
Western International Media unit of the Interpublic Group of
Companies in Los Angeles, a significant buyer of TV time. ``But
it's better than reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   And given the myriad difficulties confronted by broadcast TV,
said Steve Sternberg, senior partner at TN Media in New York, a
unit of True North Communications, ``stability equals growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the up-front market began, there had been widespread
predictions _ many from agency media executives hoping to jawbone
prices lower _ that sales would decline significantly from 1997-98,
perhaps by as much as $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into this marketplace, the broadcast networks were
supposed to be hit with a major correction,'' said Joe Mandese,
editor of The Myers Report, a media newsletter. ``But it didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing the perception that broadcasters would suffer was
the strength of demand for commercial time on the cable networks,
whose up-front market continues this week. Mandese is projecting
that cable will have ``its greatest up-front sales season ever,''
racking up as much as $2.7 billion, a gain of 15 to 20 percent from
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   That cable boom is fueled in part by sophisticated new
computerized media plans, known as optimizers, used by agencies and
media services to buy TV time more efficiently and effectively. The
conventional wisdom was that the optimization process would draw ad
dollars from the broadcast networks to cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optimizers gave buyers a slight edge in the negotiations this
year,'' said Kassan of Western. ``But at the end of the day, they
helped the broadcast networks demonstrate that they still have the
biggest reach of any media.''
</P>
<P>
   So if TV is good, to quote the slogan used last season by ABC,
broadcast TV may not be so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Co., sold
about $1.5 billion in the 1998-99 up-front market, on par with last
season despite the network ending 1997-98 with the largest ratings
falloff of any major broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' sales totaled about $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, roughly
even with last year _ also a good showing given CBS's problems with
developing hits to attract younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the stage set for a good scatter,'' Abruzzese said,
referring to the sale of commercial time that occurs during the
season, and ``there are huge opportunities in the fourth quarter''
as CBS resumes broadcasting National Football League games and its
coming prime-time schedule is promoted far more prominently to male
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the General Electric Co. unit that sold the most commercial
time in the 1997-98 up-front market, repeated that feat for 1998-99
with a total of $2.15 billion, compared with $2.1 billion last
season. Sternberg of TN Media predicted that the NBC drama ``E.R.''
may be the only series during the 1998-99 season to get a 30 share
in the Nielsen ratings _ that is, 30 percent of the TV sets in use
when ``E.R.'' is on will be tuned to ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox sold $1.15 billion in the up-front market versus $1.1
billion in the up-front last season. Fox finished the 1997-98
season behind only NBC in ratings among viewers ages 18 to 49, the
demographic group most prized by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The best showing in the 1998-99 up-front was made by the WB,
owned by Time Warner Inc. and the Tribune Co. Thanks to the ability
of WB hits like ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Dawson's Creek''
to appeal to teen-age viewers _ ``an audience that's hard to reach
everywhere else,'' Sternberg said _ WB sold $250 million to $300
million in commercial time for the coming season, compared with
$125 million to $150 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates for the UPN, a unit of Viacom Inc., varied the most
for any network, ranging from a low of $100 million to a high of
$180 million. UPN is overhauling its schedule for 1998-99.

   BOSTON _ Jurors who served on the Louise Woodward case expressed
bitterness and frustration about a Supreme Judicial Court decision
Tuesday which upheld a reduced verdict and sentence for the former
British au pair.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, who says she has received dozens of threats from all
over the country, asked not to be identified, but read a statement,
expressing her anger toward the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jury of 12 individuals, of whom I was one, found Louise
Woodward directly and solely responsible for the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen on Feb. 4, 1997,'' she said. ``I am
repulsed by the many people, Judge Hiller Zobel included, who were
more concerned with the prospect of Ms. Woodward's temporary loss
of freedom, than they were with an innocent baby's loss of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The juror would later say during a telephone interview that
``nothing about this case makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   During Woodward's trial last year, the defense instructed the
12-person jury to either find Woodward guilty of first- or
second-degree murder and not to consider manslaughter, believing
jurors would be hard-pressed to find the then 18-year-old guilty.
But the jury came back with a guilty verdict, sending shockwaves
around two continents.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Zobel reduced the jury's second-degree murder
conviction to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Colwell, another juror in the case, said he still
strongly believes Woodward is guilty of the child's death but feels
comfortable that the Supreme Judicial Court in its opinion upheld
her guilt and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the punishment may be less than what she deserved,'' he
said. ``The fact that she only spent 279 days (in jail), in my
opinion, is not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   One alternate juror, who also asked not to be identified, said
he was happy with Tuesday's decision and always thought jurors made
the wrong decision in convicting Woodward of murder.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the alternates, who he described as
analytical-minded people _ some engineers and one attorney, would
have fought for a not guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Alternates were designated after all the testimony and before
the start of deliberations. ``There was a lot of pressure,'' he
said. ``I will never, and I mean never, serve on a jury again.''

NORTH KOREA SAYS IT WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND EXPORT MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea declared Tuesday that it would continue to
develop missiles and sell them abroad, rejecting U.S. suggestions
that it curb its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue developing, testing and deploying missiles,''
the official Korean Central News Agency said in a dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Japan and other countries have long been
concerned by the North Korean missile program. North Korean
missiles deployed at home can already strike much of Japan, and
officials say the recent Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests have
highlighted the risks of the spread of missiles that might be
fitted to carry nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and South Korean officials are scheduled to meet next month
to discuss proposals to ease the economic embargo against the
Communist government of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea has urged that the
American sanctions be lifted. But the United States has been
cautious and has hinted that one criterion for easing sanctions
might be a North Korean willingness to curtail its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday North Korea rejected that idea, saying that it might
freeze its program, but only after the United States had lifted the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States really wants to prevent our missile
export,'' the news agency said, ``it should lift the economic
embargo as early as possible and make a compensation for the losses
to be caused by discontinued missile export.''
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be its most public acknowledgment of its
willingness to export missiles, the agency added, ``Our missile
export is aimed at obtaining foreign money we need at present.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea said that its missiles were defensive, intended to
protect the country from U.S. missiles, and that because of the
embargo it has few ways of earning currency other than exporting
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodong missiles developed by North Korea are similar to the
Soviet Scuds and can apparently reach much of Japan, although
probably not Tokyo, and could in theory carry a nuclear warhead,
military experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts disagree about whether the missiles are accurate
enough to pose much of a military threat. But Japanese civilians
are not much reassured by the possibility that the missiles might
miss the military bases that they are presumably aimed at.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has also been developing a missile, the Taepodong,
that would have a much greater range, of 2,000 to 3,000 miles. But
some experts said they believed the missile would need years of
development before it could be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has held periodic talks with North Korea,
trying to work out an agreement under which the North would curb
its missiles program. But the talks have not proceeded very far,
and some diplomats said the North would be willing to give up the
program only for a far greater economic and diplomatic price than
Washington is willing to pay. &QL;

LIBERALS SCRAMBLE TO COUNTER PRIVATIZATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that conservatives and Wall Street are
winning the ideological battle over Social Security's future,
liberal Democrats, unions and left-leaning interest groups are
scrambling to reverse the momentum toward the adoption of private
investment accounts and come up with politically appealing
proposals of their own.
</P>
<P>
   No longer able to assume that Social Security is so sacrosanct
that to fiddle with it would be political suicide, Democrats and
liberal advocacy groups said they intended to offer detailed
alternatives and become more aggressive in pointing out the risks
and drawbacks of moving from a collective to a more individualized
system.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep. Earl
Pomeroy of North Dakota, among others, are drafting legislation
intended to address Social Security's long-term financing problems
without resorting to private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy, who has been designated by the House Democratic
leadership to develop their position, has settled on a plan that
would allow the Social Security system itself to invest in the
markets, allowing beneficiaries to reap the presumed benefits
available on Wall Street without shifting the risks or potential
payoffs directly to individuals. Kennedy is considering a similar
approach but has not yet made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is planning a grass-roots effort to educate its
members about the issue and battle against both private accounts
and proposals to increase the retirement age as part of any fix.
</P>
<P>
   And liberal research groups and lobbying organizations _
including some that have not so far been heard from on the issue _
are stepping up their efforts to make their positions known. The
National Organization for Women, for example, plans to make defense
of the Social Security system a priority this year because women
are particularly dependent on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a major push by well-funded organizations who
are getting money from Wall Street and elsewhere to promote Social
Security privatization and are doing so by promoting an exaggerated
sense of crisis,'' said Roger Hickey, the co-director of the
Institute for America's Future, an advocacy organization that is
trying to coordinate a liberal response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have liberal groups who are pretty satisfied with
Social Security, who don't perceive major problems and who have
been slow to recognize a major threat,'' Hickey said. ``It does
appear that the privatizers have a jump on the debate. But that
won't last for long.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Liberals have been on the defensive almost since the moment that
President Clinton called in January for a year-long national debate
on how to prepare Social Security for the looming retirement of the
baby-boom generation, which by 2032 will leave the retirement
program short of the money needed to pay all promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The calls to look for a solution in the financial markets come
at a time when Americans have grown increasingly sophisticated
about and comfortable with investing, either on their own or
through employer-sponsored retirement programs like 401(k) plans.
With the market booming and the economy humming along, placing some
portion of Social Security taxes into stocks and bonds clearly
seemed attractive to many people.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Democrats said, the conservative approach holds out
the promise of specific rewards for individuals. The liberal
approach is a tougher sell, they said, calling for a commitment to
a more generalized good, that of providing retirement security _ as
well as disability and death benefits _ to everyone no matter what
unexpected circumstances befall them or what happens in the
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the political environment also created challenges for
liberal Democrats. Because Clinton adopted the role of honest
broker in the debate, precluding the White House from taking any
position, many Democrats were hesitant to appear too partisan over
an issue that will ultimately require support from both parties to
address. Groups like the American Association of Retired Persons,
perhaps the most powerful grass-roots force for maintaining Social
Security's basic structure, also took their cue from Clinton and
went to great lengths not to bash any potential solutions,
including private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservative groups were mounting an all-out campaign
in favor of private accounts. On Capitol Hill, Republicans endorsed
a variety of proposals _ and jubilantly watched the Democratic
ranks fracture as Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, and others said they would back limited private
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of private accounts said their approach was winning
on the merits and had increasingly broad support. But opponents
said early enthusiasm for the concept in general terms would give
way to a realization that the specific tradeoffs necessary to bring
about such a change would be controversial and result in a
substantial drop in support for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of private accounts are highlighting the potential
risks of a sustained market downturn and the substantial costs of
administering millions of individual accounts. And they are
increasingly rallying around the idea of having the Social Security
system rather than individuals invest in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach is supported by the American Association of
Retired Persons and by unions, among other groups, and it will be
the centerpiece of the plan that Pomeroy hopes to introduce in a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the approach's advantages is that it avoids one of the
biggest problems associated with moving to private accounts _ the
need to make up for the money that would be diverted from payroll
taxes into the personal accounts. Because the payroll taxes levied
on current workers are needed to pay benefits to current retirees,
diverting a portion of them into private accounts requires
privatization proposals to rely on some combination of additional
benefit cuts and new sources of revenue such as projected federal
budget surpluses to fill the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Collective investment would avoid that problem, thereby
requiring less in the way of benefit cuts. Although it would create
the potential for other problems, including the possibility that
the government's investment decisions would have a huge effect on
the financial markets and even on individual stocks, supporters of
the approach said it was far superior to private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll achieve higher investment returns,'' Pomeroy said,
``without the downside of imposing on Social Security beneficiaries
the individual risks that come with investing in markets.''

COURT BROADENS SUITS ALLOWED OVER AIR BAGS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's highest court ruled Tuesday that a
person injured in a traffic accident may sue the automobile
manufacturer for not installing air bags, even if the car was made
before the safety devices were required by law.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision by the State Court of Appeals, New York leaps
into a growing and controversial legal arena with broad
implications not just for the auto industry but also for all areas
of product liability. Auto makers and industry groups say the
standard set by the Court of Appeals and by courts in other states
could prompt a torrent of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The decision involves a lawsuit filed by Jason Drattel over
injuries suffered by his wife, Caryn, in an accident in Matawan,
N.J., on Nov. 19, 1991. She was driving her 1991 Toyota Tercel when
it was struck head on by another car.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drattel, an accountant who was then 29 years old and the
mother of a 4-month-old boy, suffered permanent brain damage, her
lawyers said. They contended that she would be unable to work or to
care for herself or her son for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling sends the case back for trial to State Supreme
Court in Brooklyn, where it was originally dismissed. It will be up
to a trial jury to determine whether Toyota knew that air bags
would make its cars safer, and reasonably could have been expected
to install them before they were mandated by law.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Tetherow, a spokesman for Toyota, said, ``We are
confident that Toyota will prevail at the trial of the action and
that the jury will find the Tercel automobile, without an air bag,
was a proper and safe vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of lawsuits over the absence of air bags have
ever gone to trial, with at least two producing out-of-court
settlements. Only one such suit, in New Hampshire, has gone to
trial since that state's high court dealt with the issue, and in
that case, the jury decided for the car maker.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the ninth state whose highest court has ruled on
whether auto makers can be held liable for the absence of air
bags.The first such case was decided three years ago, when New
Hampshire ruled against auto makers, according to lawyers who track
the issue, and since then, top courts in New York and four other
states _ Ohio, Arizona, Indiana and Texas _ have permitted lawsuits
over the absence of air bags. Pennsylvania, Mississippi and Idaho
have rejected such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   That disagreement among the courts and the national significance
of the dispute could make the issue ripe for review by the U.S
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question this issue will go to the
Supreme Court to resolve the discrepancies,'' said Arthur Bryant,
the appellate lawyer for Ms. Drattel. ``The prestige of New York's
court adds impetus to that because it will influence other states'
courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drattels lived in New Jersey at the time of the accident,
and bought the car in New Jersey, but later moved to Brooklyn,
where they still reside. Under New York's law venue rules, they
were able to bring the case against the Toyota Motor Corp. before a
New York court because they lived in the state when they filed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the New York case is the scope of the federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Act, the law that sets standards for vehicles sold
in the United States. The act specifically pre-empts states from
enacting a law on any aspect of auto safety ``which is not
identical to the federal standard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals, in a 6-1 decision, concluded Tuesday
that the pre-emption did not prevent lawsuits in state court that
are based on a claim that auto makers should have adhered to a
higher safety standard than is required by the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1993 that federal law mandated air bags in all
new cars sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's very significant because automobiles are
one of the most widely used products, and one that probably causes
more injury than any other product,'' said Mark Geistfeld, a law
professor at New York University who specializes in product
liability.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority in Tuesday's ruling, Judge Joseph
Bellacosa said, ``Toyota could have installed an air bag even
though it was not required to do so by federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, this injured plaintiff should not be deprived of
the opportunity to establish in an appropriate court of law,'' he
continued, ``that Toyota should have included a driver's-side air
bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Judith Kaye, and Judges Vito Titone, George Bundy
Smith, Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick and Richard Wesley concurred.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Howard Levine, the sole dissenter, wrote, ``Federal
standards are `minimum' standards only in the sense that they
present a floor (and not a ceiling) of product safety performance
for automobile manufacturers, but are in fact both a ceiling and a
floor as to a state's power to impose safety standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In the safety act, he wrote, Congress intended to set uniform,
nationwide standards for auto safety, knowing that state-by-state
variations would harm the industry.

A MAKESHIFT OPERA HOUSE COMES TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 21)  
 (bl)  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ While other cities have lost their beloved
19th-century opera houses in the wave of overgrown performing-arts
centers, the board of the opera company here bucked the tide. At
the same time that it took necessary steps to preserve the Grand
Theatre, Geneva's elegant opera house from 1882, it developed a
second house in many ways as good as the old one, and for that
matter, almost as old.
</P>
<P>
   When the stage machinery of the Grand Theatre developed
dangerous cable problems in 1996, the administration was forced to
close the house for a year to make repairs. ``Not only were we
faced with depriving our audience of an entire opera season, but
250 people would have been out of work,'' said Guy Demole, the
president of the theater's board. Opera, as anyone who knows of the
accomplished performances and innovative productions here will
realize, is integral to the social and cultural fabric of the city.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, an ingenious solution suggested itself. The
Canton of Geneva had acquired an unused power plant, a Beaux-Arts
structure from 1886 on an island in the Rhone River, which runs
through the city, and officials offered it as a possible location
for a temporary opera house. Within 13 months, and in time for the
current season, Bernard Picenni, a 42-year-old Geneva architect,
transformed the old building into a gem of a new opera house, which
exudes youth and gaiety.
</P>
<P>
   Without disguising the building's original purpose _ two blue
turbines are left as decoration in the grand foyer _ Picenni
inserted an auditorium of simple, serviceable materials. It feels
magically aloft on the river, which shimmers with reflected light
outside the tall arched windows until, just before the opera
begins, red velvet shades are lowered to block it out.
</P>
<P>
   The Batiment des Forces Motrices, as the power plant is called,
was long important to the city as an inexpensive and ecologically
sound source of hydraulic energy, derived from regulating both the
level and the force of Lake Geneva as it narrows into the Rhone. In
its heyday, the plant was responsible for channeling drinking water
throughout the canton and providing energy to factories and
workshops, notably those of the many watchmakers. The city's
symbol, the Jet d'Eau, a 460-foot plume of water that graces the
harbor, originated in the 100-foot geyser that discharged excess
energy next to the plant after hours and on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Situated at the end of a tree-lined promenade in the middle of
the Rhone, the plant is a long L-shaped structure of rusticated
stone, with the short segment of the L forming a bridge to the city
square, which serves as the entrance plaza to the building. Stage
scenery is delivered across a small bridge through the rear
entrance on the island. The high, arched facade on this side,
facing the lake, is appropriately crested with a statue of Neptune,
the god of the sea, and ornately decorated with stone reliefs of
wheels, gears and pistons, symbolic of its former life.
</P>
<P>
   With a flock of swans swirling around its edges, the building,
with its Baroque-revival character, actually seems more suitable to
an opera house than to a power plant, especially when it is
illuminated at night, with the arched windows and water-level
vaults reflected in the water.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed in the 1880s by Theodore Turrettini, an engineer
whose passion for electricity led him on several occasions to call
on Thomas Edison. In his honor, the 985-seat performance space in
the plant, has been named Theodore Turrettini Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Although Picenni left the entrance areas and the grand foyer in
their original condition, with rough concrete floors and cranes
positioned overhead, Turrettini Hall was constructed of beech and
mahogany as meticulously as if it were a violin resting in its
case. The contemporary freshness of pale woods and red velour seats
is reinforced by the industrial shell, including the original steel
trusses overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Picenni said he purposely selected inexpensive materials, so the
procedure could be reversed in the future, though that appears to
be an unlikely scenario in view of the hall's popularity and
surprisingly good acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   At a performance of Offenbach's ``Orphee aux Enfers'' this
season, the complexity of scaffolding in the set for the underworld
scene, with multiple stairways and slides, demonstrated the new
house's capacity for elaborate mechanical scenery. The orchestra
pit, like the one Wagner designed at Bayreuth, has been placed
partially under the stage, and seats 65 musicians from the
Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, which plays as the opera orchestra.
On a tour backstage, a visitor could see how cleverly dressing
rooms and costume storage areas were arranged on the lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foyer, with its long, sleek bar of sheet metal and
wood, has become a fashionable place on its own, not only at
intermission but for banquets and balls and other civic occasions.
Standing in this immense space next to the remaining turbines
washed in blue light gives one the impression of being in the
engine room of a glamorous ocean liner at sea as the river outside
flows swiftly by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the project has raised the morale of the whole
city by creating a new confidence in its future,'' said Demole. The
conversion, he explained, was achieved without opposition and with
two-thirds of the financing coming from private sources.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this development, the surrounding neighborhood was
known chiefly as a center of countercultural arts programs,
particularly those located in a building across the square from the
main entrance, called the Factory. The presence of the opera house
has introduced an interesting mix, enlivening the area and its
night life in new ways. Cafes and bistros on slightly run-down
streets, for example, have suddenly become trendy spots for dining
after performances.
</P>
<P>
   The season ends this month, and the company returns to the
1,500-seat Grand Theatre in the fall. But it will continue to use
Turrettini Hall and will produce about 40 evenings of opera,
concert and ballet next season. The hall has worked too well to be
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, Demole envisions performances by the Comedie
Francaise, theater groups, dance companies, soloists, chamber music
groups and jazz ensembles. This dynamic new performance space has
quickly recovered the particular grandeur and charm associated with
traditional 19th-century opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Opera Takes a Plunge,'' a headline in the Journal de
Geneve read at the opening, but Renee Auphan, the company's general
director, got it just right when she called the outcome ``a genuine
coup de theatre.''

<P>
   (EDITORS: FIRST FOUR GRAFS CAN BE CUT)
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and the French have a good time disliking each
other these days. We push too hard and eat processed cheese. They
are arrogant, with little to be arrogant about, and have bad
symphony orchestras. Our movies are vulgar, theirs boring.
</P>
<P>
   Witnessed here are two separate ideas of what makes human
behavior decent and worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are big on rectitude and moral fiber, or like to think
they are, and are offended when the French regularly cut in line in
front of them. The French live largely for how things look, feel,
smell and sound; they are morally distressed by fish sticks.
</P>
<P>
   This sensuousness extends to the mind. For if a lot of their
daily philosophizing adds up to little, there is the elegance of
the argument even when the premises are pure foolishness. The
French are good at finding faultlessly reasoned justifications for
behaving badly, while we just blunder into sin.
</P>
<P>
   Music tells no stories, but it is a sign of human behavior. John
Philip Sousa tells the world that Americans want to make friends.
The music of Gabriel Faure tells us that the French are private,
lonely, tender, furtive, wistful. The guarded eloquence of Faure's
pieces is not that far away from the spirit of French daily life
and what is most touching about it: touching, that is, once we get
past our own values and begin to enter other people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   Five concerts of Faure's music at the Kaye Playhouse recently
were generously American, just as the music remained elusively
French. I heard the last two: one, an evening of songs; the other,
a collection of piano pieces and the Piano Quintet in D minor.
Chamber music, instrumental pieces and more songs occupied the
other events. The crowds I saw were respectable: not big yet larger
than I expected them to be.
</P>
<P>
   During a long life (from 1845 to 1924), Faure wrote few big
pieces. He seemed almost embarrassed by the riches of symphonic
sound. The composer worried about his public reputation and gained
a big one later in life, but much of his music sounds as if it did
not want to be heard at all. It retreats from the listener. It does
not present itself; we apprehend it.
</P>
<P>
   Listening on a Monday evening to Kurt Ollmann and Margaret
Lattimore sing the collections, ``Mirages,'' ``La Chanson d'Eve''
and ``Le Jardin Clos,'' one's ear kept turning to Steven Blier's
piano parts. In them, Faure creates a paradox: teeming harmonic
adventure wedded to a studied monotony. Patterns played at the
beginning of a song tend to persist to the end. The rhythms do not
change much.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, indeed, is a sense of calm, a curious kind of
musical domesticity, an assurance that this music, and we with it,
are at home and will not stray far. For if sonata form is a
traveler's art, thriving on structured changes of scene, Faure's
constructions are like the proverbial drop of water seen through a
microscope: stationary but filled with life. In refutation to
Beethoven, Brahms and other great voyagers, Faure offers us the
variety of sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside this serenity is the life of Faure's harmony, which
seems to change directions at almost every measure. We continually
ask two questions of it: Where are you going? How are you going to
get back? Yet somehow it remains upright, a cat turning a dangerous
fall into a four-point landing. The vocal part, as Blier suggested
between songs, is not necessarily the star of a Faure song; rather,
it looks down on the piano from its higher perch, acting as
commentator and observer.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersing songs by Roussel, Debussy and Ravel on the Monday
provided powerful commentary on Faure's lonely art. Roussel offered
cheerful entertainment. Ravel's ``Peacock'' radiated delicately
with show business. ``Le Promenoir de deux amants'' was pure
seduction; in it, Debussy is private but not lonely. He talks to
the objects of his desire; Faure talks to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Never effusive, he became even more reclusive in old age. In
``Mirages,'' the String Quartet and the Piano Trio, any traces of
hazy sensuousness are burned away. The absence of extreme highs and
lows had at least something to do with the composer's increasing
hearing problems, which left only the middle ranges of sound fully
comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Faure's music intrigue us? In part, it is its
flirtatiousness. If Aretha Franklin gets unequivocally to the
point, Faure's music never lets us forget that powerful musical
passions, however secretive, are there. Revealing a little and
hiding the rest has always been the best aphrodisiac, and we should
never forget that the composer is remembered in life as an
attractive and amorous man.
</P>
<P>
   Ollmann's lightly carried baritone found the right balance for
Faure's songs. Ms. Lattimore's mezzo-soprano is fundamentally too
big and bright for this music, but she reined herself in as best
she could and worked admirably to do the right thing. Leon Bates'
piano-playing on the next evening was discretion itself and acted
always in Faure's best interests, even though his collection of
nocturnes, barcarolles, preludes, and smaller pieces made quite an
earful for a single sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Bates, the Portland String Quartet worked ardently at
the D minor Quintet, a wonderful piece previously unknown to me.
The Portland players were a little undone by the physical
challenges of the finale and tended everywhere to be effusive to a
fault. Their heart-on-sleeve approach might have made this retiring
Frenchman a little uncomfortable, but then we Americans are like
that.

EAPPEN SUIT SEEKS TO BLOCK WOODWARD PROFIT IN TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seventy eight minutes after the state's highest court
ruled that Louise Woodward faces no further criminal consequences
in the death of Matthew Eappen, a discouraged but resolved Sunil
Eappen filed a wrongful death suit in Boston's US District Court
against the former au pair.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fredric L. Ellis, the Eappen family lawyer, the
primary reason for filing lawsuit was to prevent the British
citizen from profiting from the tragic events. The 20-year-old
reportedly has had numerous of book offers, and the civil suit
specifically requests that a judge prevent Woodward from spending
any money she makes.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks compensatory damages and unspecified
punitive damages for the wrongful death of Matthew. A hearing on a
request for an injunction will be held this afternoon before US
District Judge William G. Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is right and there is wrong,'' said Deborah Eappen
Tuesday. ``It is wrong for her to profit in any way from what she
did to Matty. What she did was so wrong, for her to benefit
financially would be so wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a criminal case where the prosecution must prove the
charge beyond a reasonable doubt, the plaintiffs in a civil case
need only show by ``preponerance of evidence'' that Louise was
responsible for Matthew Eappen's death. In a civil case, only 51
percent of the evidence is needed to win, in a criminal there must
be proof ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Eappen lawyers win, there is no guarantee that
Woodward would be forced to obey an award because British courts do
not always honor the decisions of other countries' courts. They
would still have to go before an English court, according to law
professors consulted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, family members said the Eappens were intent on filing the
case to take all steps necessary that Woodward does not profit from
the story, and if money was made, it would go to child abuse
prevention. The formation of a Matty Eappen Foundation was
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do all we can so this never happens again,'' said
Deborah Eappen. ``If there is any financial gain from this case it
should all go toward educating people about child abuse, about
shaken baby syndrome. There is so much denial we need to get over.
I hope the foundation can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their claim that Woodward has, or will, peddle the
story of her arrest and imprisonment, lawyers for the Eappens
included copies of newspaper stories from here and abroad
describing possible book and movie deals Woodward and her mother
were negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   One of Woodward's lawyers, Andrew Good, denied Tuesday that
Woodward had made any deals to sell her story. Last fall, after
being freed from prison by Middlesex Superior Court Judge Hiller
Zobel, Woodward said selling her story would be ``distasteful and
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   And to drive home the point that the market for Woodward's story
is vast, the lawyers included a fat footote listing some two dozen
books spawned by another infamous criminal trial: the O.J. Simpson
murder case.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Simpson wrongful death suit _ which followed
Simpson's acquittal on criminal charges that he murdered his
ex-wife and a friend _ the Eappen suit would be much easier to win,
legal experts say, because Woodward has been convicted of
involuntary manslaughter. Thus, unlike the Simpson case, the issue
of who is responsible for Matthew Eappen's death would not need to
be relitigated.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's lawsuit was prepared in advance, the Eappen's lawyers
said, awaiting the SJC decision. They said they wanted to wait
until a decision was made so it would not interfere with the SJC
appeal. The suit does not name the EF Au Pair agency, which helped
pay for Woodward's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the lawsuit try to retrieve a significant asset of
Woodward's: the estimated $200,000 collected by supporters in
England. Ellis said he was not going to pursue the trust fund ``for
strategic reasons'' saying only ``it does raise some complexities
to do that.'' Hours after the civil suit was filed, Woodward was
served with a summons naming her as the defendent in the suit while
at a friend's home in Marblehead.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction and civil lawsuit are the Eappens' best chance at
preventing Woodward from profiting from her story by selling movie
or book rights. A Massachusetts law prohibiting such a move was
repealed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In England, newspapers and television stations are barred from
paying convicted felons for the rights to their stories, except
when there is overriding public interest. But Massachusetts, like
the majority of states, does not have a law barring convicted
felons from profiting from their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the US Supreme Court struck down New York's so-called
``Son of Sam'' law as an unconstitutional infringement on the right
of free speech. The law was written to stop serial killer David
Berkowitz from selling his story to a publisher. Massachusetts
modeled its version of the law after New York's. In the wake of the
SJC decision, Britain's Press Complaints Commission, said it is
``now up to editors to decide whether to pay Louis Woodward for her
story after considering the ... code of practice.''

<P>
   SAPPORO, Japan _ Kimihiko Shimada's footsteps echo against the
marble floors as he crosses the hall of the Therme International
Hotel, a grand resort with everything from fake palm trees reaching
up 11 stories to a roller coaster water slide.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the hotel does not have is guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult time for us,'' said Shimada, a
manager who will soon have to start looking for a job, as 240
former employees at Therme did. ``Of all the employees, only half
have found new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The resort complex is a casualty of Japan's growing economic
troubles, which are nowhere more stark than here on the northern
island of Hokkaido. The city of Sapporo, home to the 1972 Winter
Olympics, is one of the most pleasant in Japan, and the entire
island is an invigorating kaleidoscope of woods, mountains, and
fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   But the unemployment rate of 4.7 percent _ compared with a
national average of 4.1 percent _ is the highest in Japan and
indeed a record in the country's postwar era. So some people are
wondering if its problems will drift south to the rest of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, we can't deny that the same thing could happen
in other regions of Japan,'' said Yasuyuki Hamada, an economics
professor at Hokkaido University. ``For now, though, Hokkaido is
facing a special phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The special problems arise in part because Hokkaido is a symbol
not only of Japan's economic troubles, but also of the reasons for
them. More than other parts of the country, economists say, it
epitomizes the traditional Japanese distaste for entrepreneurship
and fondness for government spending and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   A manufacturing backwater, Hokkaido has relied on government
handouts, and it is full of smoothly paved but barely used roads,
bridges and tunnels whose main purpose seems to have been keeping
the construction industry plump. Hokkaido is also one of the
regions of Japan that has been the slowest to modernize and link up
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   So it is a far cry from the pioneering mentality that
characterized the island a century ago, when Hokkaido was Japan's
new frontier. Now it is a prime example of what Japanese refer to
as nareai, the incestuous ties that link politicians and
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls between the local government and private companies
here are thin, and there isn't much of a competitive spirit,'' said
Akihiro Fujimura, who runs the corporate data department at Tokyo
Shoko Research, an investment research company. ``People here
always say that when the snow melts away, the national government
budget money comes to Hokkaido.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hokkaido's main plan for dealing with the current
recession is not reassuring, at least for those who believe that
Japan must undergo a painful economic restructuring to regain
competitiveness. Hokkaido's plan seems to be to hold out until
money starts rolling in this month from the central government's
$114-billion fiscal stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
   Tadakazu Kobayashi, executive director of the government's
economic policy planning office in Sapporo, treats the central
government stimulus package as the centerpiece of the region's
revival plan. The money, he said, should come to Hokkaido as soon
as Parliament passes the legislation in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already preparing the bidding and the ordering, and if
necessary we will pay the bill before the project is finished,'' he
said. ``At the time of contract, we can make a down payment for the
entire price.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobayashi seemed much less concerned with figuring out what
projects to spend the money on than with the fact that the money
was in the pipeline. He said the government would be able to pay in
advance to get the money moving, and he added, ``I think the cash
will start circulating and the companies will start paying
salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Hokkaido has been devastated ever since the collapse last fall
of its main bank, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the island's largest
employer and formerly one of Japan's 20 largest banks. That
bankruptcy led to a chain of failures at large companies that had
been kept alive by sympathetic financing from the bank, known as
Takugin.
</P>
<P>
   Takugin's efforts to support the local community in thick and
thin are typical of banks across the country, which are
contributing to their own demise by supporting dying industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main bank system, with the peculiar role of banks which
support industries, has to go,'' said Akio Mikuni, who runs his own
credit rating company.
</P>
<P>
   As in the rest of Japan, the government in Hokkaido is trying to
spread the recessionary pain very thinly. Bonuses are being shaved
to save jobs, and the result is that there are no corners crowded
with the homeless, no vast layoffs, no streets marked by boarded-up
storefronts. Here in Hokkaido, as elsewhere, the Japanese people
seem to be taking their recession with relative aplomb, at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   But some signs of distress are hard to disguise. The nation's
currency is tumbling. New construction around Japan has virtually
stopped, so cement mixers sit idle together in parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers are being edged out of unproductive posts, others
keep moving from job to job as the companies around them fold, and
most college graduates are not getting offers for work. Companies
are also toppling at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
   Few in Japan have faced the challenge of looking for a job in a
recessionary economy. And only now is the realization setting in
for people like Nobutaka Suzuki, 24, a construction worker who has
been looking for work for two months in Sapporo. His challenge is
even more pressing because he and his wife have one toddler and
another child due in August, so that his job search has become a
family mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be fooling around anymore,'' Suzuki said, holding his
toddler, as his wife turned away in shame. ``It's very bleak.''

   BOSTON _ The highest court in Massachusetts upheld a reduced
sentence for British au pair Louise Woodward on Tuesday, handing
down a 4-3 decision that effectively ends the criminal case
followed by millions on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling left Ms. Woodward, who was convicted last fall of
killing a baby boy in her care, finally free to go home, though not
free of the pain of her case.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the infant, Matthew Eappen, immediately filed a
civil suit against Ms. Woodward in federal court, seeking
unspecified damages and asking that she be prevented from making
deals for interviews or books that would let her profit from their
child's death.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from both sides was as sharp and divergent as it
has been throughout the case, with her attorneys and supporters
declaring the young woman had finally been vindicated and
prosecutors lamenting what they viewed as a miscarriage of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward, in seclusion in a house in Boston, had no comment
but is believed to be planning to return to her home in within
days.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court took up Ms. Woodward's case last fall
after prosecutors appealed a decision by Judge Hiller B. Zobel of
superior court to alter a jury's verdict that convicted the au pair
of second-degree murder and sentenced her to life. Declaring that
the penalty was too harsh, the judge reduced the conviction to
manslaughter and the life sentence to the time already served, 279
days.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the judge declared that he was seeking a
``compassionate conclusion'' to the case and that the initial
sentence had been too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors immediately appealed, seeking reinstatement of
the original verdict and arguing that Ms. Woodward had received a
fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling Tuesday, the justices were unanimous in their
view that Judge Zobel had acted within the discretion allowed him
by law to reduce the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenting minority contended that her sentence should
be reconsidered. The three justices argued that Judge Zobel had
acted too hastily by issuing the sentence on the same day in which
he reduced her conviction. The minority opinion also said that a
new judge should consider barring Ms. Woodward from earning money
from her story, and from caring for children.
</P>
<P>
   Though the high court's decision left Ms. Woodward relieved that
she could finally go home, her lawyers said, it also left her
disappointed because it rejected her appeal for her conviction to
be thrown out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louise Woodward maintains her innocence, as she always has and
always will, `` said Andrew Good, one of her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Though civil action may continue for months if not years, the
criminal side of the case ``is now over,'' said Thomas Reilly,
Middlesex County district attorney, adding: ``One thing is clear.
The truth is clear. The truth about what happened to Mattie Eappen
and who is responsible for his death. The truth of this case is,
always will be, that Louise Woodward killed Mattie Eappen. Twelve
jurors said so. The trial judge said so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward was initially charged with assault after she made
an emergency call to report the injury to Matthew Eappen in Newton,
Mass., on Feb. 4, 1997. The charge was upgraded to murder after the
infant died five days later at Children's Hospital in Boston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward's defense team continues to assert, however, that
the scientific evidence in the case indicates that the infant was
killed by the sudden re-bleeding of an old head wound and that his
death could have been accidental. They plan to pursue the creation
of an independent scientific tribunal to examine the medical
evidence, defense lawyer Harvey Silverglate said.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``The Nanny Murder Trial'' by Court TV, the Woodward case
had riveted viewers in both the United States and England as it
wended its way forward last fall, seeming to tap into the deep
anxiety that working parents feel when they commend their child to
a virtual stranger's care; and when the jury found Ms. Woodward
guilty of second-degree murder on Oct. 30, it became provoked
outrage in England.
</P>
<P>
   When the verdict was reduced to manslaughter by Zobel, he said
that he believed Ms. Woodward had acted out of ``confusion,
inexperience, frustration, immaturity and some anger, but not
malice,'' in the legal sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court ruling said Zobel made a serious
error of law, but then affirmed that he had acted well within his
rights when he sought to correct it. That error was his decision to
accede to the go-for-broke request of Ms. Woodward's lawyers that
the jury be allowed to consider only whether she was guilty of
murder, not manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The gambit failed, and Ms. Woodward was convicted of murder and
sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole only
after 15 years. But then Zobel overturned that verdict, and that
was his right, the high court said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The minority opinion savaged Zobel for his actions, however,
saying. ``It appears that the judge identified himself with
Woodward's cause, compromising the public's confidence in the
integrity and impartiality of our courts.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, supporters of Ms. Woodward in Elton, her hometown in
northwest England, said they were delighted at the news she was
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long wait is over,'' said the Rev. Ken Davey, chairman of
the trustees of the fund that raised $490,000 for Ms. Woodward's
appeal. ``I am sure Louise will be very pleased with the verdict
and she will be longing to get back and get her life back to
normal, or as normal as possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But not everyone felt the way Davey did. Many people in Britain,
originally swayed by the vociferous campaigns several tabloids
waged on Ms. Woodward's behalf during her trial, began to change
their minds about the case when they saw television clips showing
the people of Elton drunkenly celebrating at the local pub when she
was released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   And in Elton itself, stung by the criticism, there have been
recent murmurings of dissent against Ms. Woodward and her family.
Earlier this week, Jean Jones, a longtime family friend and an
early leader in the campaign to free Ms. Woodward, said that the au
pair's mother, Sue, ``rode roughshod'' over those trying to help
her family and became increasingly obsessed with the money being
raised.
</P>
<P>
   `The money became God,'' Ms. Jones told Sky News there. ``She
was the most ungracious person I ever met in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' remarks came soon after Elaine Whitfield Sharp, a
former member of Ms. Woodward's defense team, accused the Woodwards
of falsifying a $15,000 invoice purporting to show that Ms.
Whitfield Sharp had charged the au pair room and board at her house
in a Boston suburb. According to Ms. Whitfield Sharp, however, Ms.
Woodward had stayed free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Miller, the member of Parliament who represents Elton,
said that the Woodwards had been unfairly subjected to
trans-Atlantic `'smear stories'' in recent weeks. `'The people
opposed to Louise in the U.S. were undoubtedly behind some of
these,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the question of whether Ms. Woodward plans to make money
off the tremendous publicity surrounding the case, rumors have been
swirling, particularly in the British media, of impending deals for
interviews and books. But Ms. Woodward's lawyer, Andrew Good, said
Tuesday that as far as he was aware _ ``and I am very aware'' _ she
had made no such deals.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since Ms. Woodward was released, something else
has changed as well: Deborah Eappen, the mother of the late Matthew
and an older boy, Brendan, became pregnant again and, in late May,
gave birth to another son, Kevin Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens have also established a foundation in Matthew's
name, based in Chicago and overseen by Ms. Eappen's brother, to
educate the public about child abuse, focusing in particular on
``shaken baby syndrome,'' the set of injuries that experts say
afflicted Matthew and result from extremely rough handling and
shaking.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit against Ms. Woodward, filed by Matthew Eappen's
father, Sunil, is seeking unspecified damages, said John O. Mirick,
the lawyer handling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Louise goes home, publishes a book and makes millions out
of the situation, that's a factor a jury can take into account,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward is expected to leave for home within days, as soon
as the outcome of her case is finalized and she receives her
passport back from state officials. District Attorney Thomas Reilly
said his office would do nothing to delay her departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her out of the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She returns home both a trial-television star and a convicted
killer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court decision noted: ``We do not view the
judgment against Woodward as a light matter. She stands guilty of
causing an infant's violent death. The outcome of this criminal
trial most assuredly was not an `acquittal.' ''

 &HT;    They took their shot and built successful companies

<P>
   ATLANTA -- The winners in this year's Ernst &AMP; Young's
Entrepreneur of the Year regional contest prove that gambling pays
off. Some left cushy jobs to go solo. Two went without salaries for
nearly a year. They manage everything from medical information to
prisons to child care, and they supply a range of products. The 10
winners, from eight companies in metro Atlanta and Nashville, were
honored Tuesday at a dinner in Buckhead. Six of the eight are from
Georgia. ``The thing that struck me in all of these cases were the
personal sacrifices and the personal risk everyone takes. That was
probably more important than the financial status,'' said Joseph
Sansone, a judge in the contest and chairman of Norcross-based
Pediatric Services of America, a national winner in last year's
contest. ``Anybody can run a business that's successful, but to
take a new idea and to sell it under some adverse conditions and a
lot of skepticism and stick with it ... is a true measure of an
individual's entrepreneurship.''
</P>
<P>
   Such awards do not guarantee immunity from problems. One winner,
Premiere Technologies of Atlanta, saw its stock plunge 28 percent
last week after company officials told investors to expect a
quarterly loss. Another winner, Corrections Corp. of America, is
fending off a lawsuit from shareholders attempting to block its
merger wtih Prison Realty Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Profiles of the winners
</P>
<P>
   The regional winners are ``a very diverse group this year in
terms of the types of industry, the stage of development,'' said
Gerry Wilson, Southeast area director of Entrepreneurial Services
at Ernst &AMP; Young. ``Some were fairly young and some were more
mature. All of them are highly successful.''

<P>
   Doctor R. Crants was helping television stations get their
federal broadcasting licenses when a former West Point roommate
suggested an unheard-of idea: running prisons like a business. The
idea led to Corrections Corporation of America, a $463
million-a-year business that has 11,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Crants, who has a law degree from Harvard, was raised on a
Seneca Indian reservation in upstate New York. CCA, of Nashville,
has had its share of controversy. It also has had its share of
firsts: It built the world's first private juvenile center in 1996.
The company manages prisons throughout the United States,
Australia, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.

   Identical twins Sean and Scott Smith went eight months without
pay and worked from their three-bedroom apartment to launch
Coalition America Inc. They say their Atlanta-based health-care
information management company is a high-tech cure for
administrative bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very dynamic industry, but a very low-tech
industry,'' said President Sean Smith. ``There's a lot of paper
that gets pushed from one side of the desk to the other. I want to
bring efficiency to the entire industry through technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the brothers' thinking three years ago when they left
Medical Review Systems, a medical bill review company.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition America helps employers find the best preferred
provider organization, then creates and manages that plan for its
clients.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old pair built a business that has 50 employees and
$7.6 million in revenues. Clients include Corning, Jeld-Wen and
Western Southern Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're evolving into an information and technology company,''
Sean Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Going into business with his twin was a logical choice, he said.
``We share the same ideals. If you're going to go into business,
it's nice to have a partner you know well.'' Scott Smith is vice
president of the company. Sean Smith is the point person on
strategies and managed care contracting; Scott Smith knows computer

Pensacola, Fla., as a network of plasma donation centers for the
collection of anti-D antibodies. The antibodies help Rh-negative
women have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-D remains the Clarkston-based firm's flagship product. The
company also collects and produces antibodies used to test for and
to treat such diseases and infections as AIDS, rabies, rheumatoid
arthritis and hepatitis. During the 1980s, Penninger foresaw two
trends: the need to develop a range of anti-D vaccines and to
remain a big player in the blood-typing diagnostics business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Penninger acquired a company that could clone and
produce antibodies. Anti-D and the cloned antibodies now account
for about 42 percent of sales and 65 percent of gross profits.
</P>
<P>
   Penninger brought in cellular immunologist Harold Tenoso and
Russ Plumb, vice president of finance. As president and chief
executive, Tenoso moved the company to Atlanta, completed an

 &HT;    Dog plays one more for Florida
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When the Georgia and Florida all-star football teams
gathered for a welcome dinner on the roof of the Metro Atlanta
Chamber of Commerce on Sunday night, only one player received a
gracious reception from the opposing squad.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, William Witherspoon of Panama City, Fla., was a welcome
sight for several Georgia players, who will join him this fall in
Athens as University of Georgia freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon is one of just two Florida players in Saturday's
Georgia-Florida All-Star Game in the Georgia Dome who will return
to the Peach State to play college football. Six Georgia all-stars
will play at schools in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Florida and Florida State fans in Panama
City,'' Witherspoon said. ``So there was some (flak) for choosing
Georgia, but they all understood that it was my choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon, a 6-foot-3, 215-pound inside linebacker, chose the
Bulldogs over Florida, Florida State, Tennessee, Duke and Notre
Dame. He was a key in Georgia's nationally ranked recruiting class,
after the Bulldogs lost starting linebackers Brandon Tolbert and
Greg Bright to graduation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Hardin, his coach at Rutherford High,
Witherspoonis a lot like former Florida All-American Kevin Carter,
who plays with the NFL's St. Louis Rams. Hardin, who coached Carter
at Tallahassee's Lincoln High nearly seven years ago, says both
players were outstanding defensive ends before he moved them inside
before their senior seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the exact same makeup,'' Hardin said, ``and I'm not
just talking about as a player. I'm talking about a young man who
was president of the student body, homecoming king, prom king ...
and probably the best all-around athlete in the state of Florida,
hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon, who also played tight end, earned state
player-of-the-year honors from USA Today. On defense, he had 125
tackles with four interceptions. On offense, Witherspoon added 15
receptions for 356 yards and 10 touchdowns. He probably will play
on both sides of the ball Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His skills transcend football. This spring, after placing in the
top three in four events at a district track meet in Jacksonville,
Witherspoon traveled to Daytona Beach for the state weightlifting
championships the next day. He lost nine pounds in 12 hours to
qualify for the 199-pound weight division, then won the state title
by benching 375 pounds and lifting 285 in the clean and jerk.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Witherspoon appears ready to help at Georgia this
fall, although he concedes that he probably needs to add 15 pounds
before freshmen report on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind taking a redshirt year if I had to,''
Witherspoon said. ``I wouldn't mind playing my freshman year if I
was really needed. But there's that inexperienced feeling you have
moving up to the college level from high school. I think I'm a
pretty adaptable person.''

 &HT;    GM and UAW at a stand still
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
are making no progress in settling two Michigan parts-plant
strikes, which have now erased 60 percent of the company's vehicle
production and idled 4,500 workers in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes in Flint by 9,200 UAW members at a metal-stamping
plant and a Delphi instrument panel and engine parts plant have
caused GM to close or partially shut down 17 of its 29 North
American assembly plants. Parts shortages from the Flint strikes
have forced nearly 71,000 GM workers to be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, about 4,500 GM employees in are out of work at five
area plants. The local layoffs include about 3,900 workers at the
Moraine truck assembly plant; 323 at two Dayton brake plants; 158
workers at GM's Vandalia air bag plant; 73 hourly employees at the
Kettering suspension parts plant; and 27 workers at GM's Delphi
Chassis plant on Home Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   GM on Tuesday also informed 470 hourly workers at the Moraine
Engine plant that they would be working half-days due to the Flint
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   More plant closures and layoffs in the Dayton area and across
the nation are expected today. Analysts estimate the strike is
costing GM at least $40 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   With negotiators exchanging barbs at the metal plant Monday
night and union leaders expected to leave in a day or two for a UAW
convention, a settlement seems unlikely by Friday. By then, 95
percent of the automaker's car and truck output would be halted,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a long summer for those strikers,'' said Michael
Robinet, an auto industry consultant with CSM Forecasting in
Farmington Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Union and company officials said Monday the walkout appears
likely to last into July. If the Flint strikes aren't settled by
June 26 U.S. workers, idled by the walkouts, will not get their
union-won ``holiday pay'' for the first week of GM's annual
two-week plant shutdown, which starts June 29.
</P>
<P>
   GM's UAW contract classifies the second week of the break as
mandatory vacation, for which workers received pay in a lump sum
earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of auto workers from other U.S. plants, including 200
UAW members from the Dayton brake plants, are expected today to
joint the striking Flint workers on the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiators walked out of discussions at the Flint Metal
Center Monday after a GM representative suggested striking workers'
support would weaken on a steady diet of $150-a-week strike pay,
said President Duane Zuckschwerdt of UAW Local 659.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took major exception to that remark,'' he said. ``That was
just a total slap in our face. Obviously, the company isn't trying
to look for a quick resolution to this thing. They think they can
win their case by holding our members hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest automaker released a statement saying the
union's account of the meeting was ``completely fabricated.''
</P>
<P>
   GM says the union has blocked plans to make the Flint factories
more efficient. The union claims GM has failed to invest in the
plants and has ignored long-standing grievances and run roughshod
over union contracts in its zeal to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW is determined to protect jobs in Flint in light of
company plans to slash 15,000 of its 34,000 Flint jobs over two
years

 &HT;    Internet provides answer to help wanted ads
 &HT;    By Mike Drummond

   DAYTON, Ohio -- Xiomara Young joined the millions of people who
shopped on the Internet this year. But she wasn't in the market for
a CD, a book or a car. She shopped for and found a job _ with Bank
One Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   She had never used the Internet for job hunting and was pleased
with the quick results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised they called me in a week (after submitting my
resume),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dayton-area employers increasingly are trawling the
Internet for workers as a way to fish for talent in a shrinking
labor pool. They see it as a way to broaden their reach, in
addition to buying traditional classified ads in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, newspapers are responding in part by putting their
classified ads online. The Dayton Daily News will begin posting
online classifieds before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of free and for-fee sites on the Net allow head hunters
and job seekers alike to find each other in a way impossible just a
few years ago. Several, including JobTrak, link employers with
colleges, offering the next best thing to on-site recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   An unscientific survey conducted by Washington Twp.-based Right
Management Consultants showed that one out of five Dayton-area
companies post positions on Internet job banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet as job-recruiting tool takes on added significance
when mapped against a joint University of Dayton and Wright State
University study this year, which showed there are more than 48,700
local jobs available in this time of near-record low unemployment
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Right Management conducted a local seminar Tuesday morning to
expose local employers to the recruiting possibilities of the 'Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised at who's out there,'' said Jennifer Warner,
vice president of Right Management's marketplace resources.
</P>
<P>
   The session's four panelists from NCR Corp., Standard Register
Co., Bank One and Midmark Corp., talked about their successes and
growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dalinghaus of Bank One has filled four positions this year
via the local NationJob Network (www.nationjob.com/dayton).
</P>
<P>
   The company paid $3,000 to have its logo on the front page of
the network's local site, although companies can post jobs for
free. Dalinghaus said she receives at least two resumes a day via
NationJob. As far as she's concerned, the company's $3,000
investment, ``has more than paid for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hoying, global recruitment director for NCR, offered a
hard lesson for companies posting their own employment sites. In
its haste to launch an employment page about two years ago, NCR
tabbed a third party, CareerMosaic, the hottest job bank on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   However, when NCR built its own corporate page, it looked
different than its employment page.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the job site is not on the same computer server as the
rest of NCR's Web pages, meaning the company has to go through
CareerMosaic to update the listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a computer company and not even hosting our own
employment site, which is kind of sad,'' Hoying acknowledged. NCR
is redoing its entire Web suite, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has brought the world's employers to home PCs.
Workers can look for jobs virtually anywhere in the world, any time
of day, increasing the choices of an already mobile workforce. More
advances are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   New software in the works will let job seekers keypunch their
desired position, salary, location and other requirements and have
their PCs hunt the Web for suitable jobs. The software will alert
users when the search is done and keep the list on file.
</P>
<P>
   Carletta Railey-Worthy, a Lexis-Nexis human resources manger who
attended Tuesday's session, said, ``When you understand that power,
you can see a day when everyone will search for a job this way.

BRANSON FIGHTS TO CHANGE LAW ON AIRLINE OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ohio, Britain)  (lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Branson, the golden-haired British entrepreneur whose
Virgin Group's holdings range from airlines and high-speed trains
to retail stores and soft drinks, was close to a deal to start a
new low-cost airline at New York's Kennedy International Airport
earlier this month but backed away because of federal restrictions
that prevent foreigners from controlling domestic airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Branson said in an interview last week that he was still
committed to starting the new discount carrier, tentatively called
Virgin America, and was willing to invest his own money in the
venture, which would concentrate initially on the Eastern United
States. He is lobbying in London and Washington to get the
72-year-old ownership restrictions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy, according to airline analysts,
congressional staff members and experts in aviation law. The
restrictions, which originated in maritime law, are considered so
entrenched that they have never been seriously challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The rules protect the vast U.S. air-traffic market from foreign
competition, an advantage the major domestic airlines will not give
up easily without getting something in return, such as increased
access to overseas markets, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But Branson, who has been told often in the past that many of
his ventures would fail, predicted he would succeed because of the
current concern in Congress and the Clinton administration about
the lack of domestic airline competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When low-fare players come into a market it stimulates the
marketplace and I would think that the U.S. government would
welcome that,'' Branson said. ``We believe we are knocking on an
open door.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Branson entered into talks to start Virgin
America with David Neeleman, the former president of Morris Air, a
Utah-based discount carrier bought by Southwest Airlines in 1993.
The carrier would have begun flying from Kennedy early next year,
according to two people familiar with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Branson declined to confirm that the airline would fly from
Kennedy. He said that it would have started with about 20 planes,
with plans to expand to 15 cities mainly in the East, the region
least served by Southwest, the country's dominant low-cost airline.
</P>
<P>
   The new carrier would have complemented Virgin Atlantic,
Branson's London-based international carrier, and Virgin Express,
its European discount carrier based in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   He said the service was to have been modeled after Virgin
Express, featuring new single-aisle jets, leather seats and ``very
good value for money.'' Though there would be limited food service
on flights shorter than an hour, longer flights would be ``fully
frilled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline was to be capitalized at about $200 million, mostly
from U.S. investors, making it one of the best-funded airline
start-ups ever. But Branson was concerned that the federal
ownership restrictions would deny him ultimate control over a
business carrying the Virgin name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty is that our Virgin brand is so important to
us,'' Branson said. ``We would be reluctant to go ahead unless we
could have direct control.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law states that 75 percent of the voting interest in a
domestic airline must be owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.
Regulators have at times allowed foreigners to own more than half
the equity in a domestic airline as long as their voting rights
remain below 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Branson and his advisers met with officials at the Department of
Transportation in the last month to see whether the rules could be
relaxed. They concluded that they could not live with the current
restrictions. At that point, Branson and Neeleman decided to part
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to control something in the U.S.,'' Neeleman said.
``We don't think that is in the cards, at least in the time frame
we are operating in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Branson's timing may be ripe. Many lawmakers in Congress are
upset about the rising cost of air travel in recent years and the
lack of competition at many of the country's major airports. In
April, the Clinton administration proposed rules designed to
discourage major airlines from driving low-cost competitors out of
their home markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress, such as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of
the Senate Commerce Committee, have already proposed allowing
foreigners to control as much as 49 percent of a domestic carrier.
In 1993, a national commission appointed by President Clinton to
look at the airline industry also recommended raising the limit on
voting rights to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should look at ways to increase competition instead of
looking at more regulation from the Department of Transportation,''
said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee's antitrust subcommittee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Any change in the rules could still take years. Relaxing the
restrictions would likely require an act of Congress, a process
that easily could get bogged down as a result of opposition from
the major airlines and organized labor. National security issues
would also be raised because the Pentagon relies on airlines to
make passenger planes available in national emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is further complicated by the friction between
London and Washington over aviation issues. Washington considers
Britain one of the most restrictive countries because the British
allow only two U.S. carriers to serve London's Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
   AMR's American Airlines and British Airways have been waiting
two years for authorities on both sides of the Atlantic to approve
their proposed alliance, a deal that Washington says will come
about only after London agrees to open its market to more U.S.
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, whose Virgin Atlantic competes with British Airways,
has vehemently opposed the alliance. He is now pressing British
authorities to pressure Washington to lift its foreign-ownership
restrictions as a condition for Britain to open its market.
</P>
<P>
   Many think that if anyone can focus a spotlight on an arcane
aviation regulation that few people even know exists, it is
Branson, who was recently willing to mount a vintage German tank in
New York's Times Square to herald the arrival of Virgin Cola in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans complain about the Japanese and their
protectionism,'' he said. ``Yet you still have these archaic rules
that have no rational reason to exist in this day and age.''

ITS STRINGS TO MOSCOW SEVERED, DANCE COMPANY CAN BE ITSELF  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TERRY TRUCCO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time the Virsky Ukrainian National Dance
Company visited New York, in 1988, Ukraine was part of the Soviet
Union and the troupe was beholden to its Moscow sponsors. That is,
it was strongly encouraged to perform Russian dances along with
Ukrainian ones.
</P>
<P>
   The company eventually lost that support with the breakup of the
Soviet Union, in 1991, but in the process it gained its artistic
independence. This week Virsky, one of the world's premiere
professional folk troupes, returns to New York for three
performances at City Center, on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday as
part of a 38-city North American tour. And this time all the dances
are Ukrainian.
</P>
<P>
   For Myroslav Vantukh, the company's artistic director since
1980, the opportunity to present American audiences with an evening
of purely Ukrainian dance is sweet. ``Russian and Ukrainian dances
reflect different histories and cultures and result in very
different types of dances,'' he said through an interpreter in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Folk dance as performed by Virsky's 90 dancers and musicians is
an exhilarating display of athleticism and bravura technique
showcased in timeless dances that exude the culture, humor and
heart of Ukraine. The dancers look like a ballet troupe dressed in
folk gear; in vivid, hand-embroidered costumes and leather boots,
the women perform swift, precise footwork while the men demonstrate
a breathtaking repertory of barrel turns, air turns, butterfly
leaps, scissor jumps, squatting dances and toplike spins.
</P>
<P>
   The company has visited New York four times in the last 35
years, but never with lighting and theatrical effects as polished
and dramatic as they are in the current tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at Riverdance and knew we could do a very
professional, Broadway type of dance presentation based on the
roots of a culture,'' said the tour's executive producer, Donald
Baker, a Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Virsky has in fact presented a highly dramatized style of folk
dance since it was formed in 1937. Its founder, Pavel Virsky, a
ballet dancer and choreographer from the Black Sea city of Odessa _
he died in 1975 _ used folk steps and a ballet base to create his
hybrid style, elevating folk dance to theatrical dance.
</P>
<P>
   These days the company's 66 dancers _ 38 men and 28 women, most
of them 18 to 25 years old _ take a two-hour ballet class each day
as part of their training. Nearly all graduated from the Virsky
company school in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, where most were
students from the age of 7 (and where the troupe continues to
receive state financial support).
</P>
<P>
   The years of training no doubt account for the apparent
effortlessness with which the men perform their signature feats
like triple turns in the air and powerful jumps from a deep knee
bend (Ukrainian choreography has traditionally been showier for men
than for women).
</P>
<P>
   Like the best of today's ballet dancers, Virsky's virtuosos are
more technically skilled than their predecessors. ``The tricks they
perform are based on the traditional steps but are more difficult
than they once were,'' said Myroslav Vantukh, Vantukh's son and a
member of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere on the program are the tricks more thrilling than in
``Hopak,'' the company's rhythmic show stopper in which almost the
entire troupe, dressed in brilliant primary colors, fills the
stage. But the company has quieter moods as well, as in the lyrical
``Tree Dance,'' performed by women holding branches, and in a
joyous ``Marriage Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What our dances have in common is a love of Ukraine,'' said
the senior Vantukh. ``Without that love, there is no dance.''

PASADENA PART OF TRIPLE-A FOOTBALL LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB MIECH  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Reinholz might have discovered an original Pasadena
Pachyderm on a recent jaunt to the Atlanta area, where he conducted
research for a novel he's writing about telemarketing scams.
</P>
<P>
   Reinholz turned, and a 22-year-old man who stood 6-foot-11 and
weighed 425 pounds loomed before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like a giant Bob Lilly,'' Reinholz said. ``But he
was dumb as a skunk. Only made it through the eighth grade. I
almost had a hair to become a wrestling promoter. He was fast and
big, he just never could make it in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy of the hair Reinholz and four minor partners got about
two years ago, such fringe figures might soon find themselves with
an avenue, however long or rocky, to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Triple-A Football League -- of which Reinholz serves as
president, commissioner and 51-percent owner -- plans to develop
such talent for the professional ranks. Pasadena is slated to be
one of 10 cities that will field teams in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always interested in getting tenants,'' said Rose Bowl
events manager Sally Roach. ``We have not really researched the
viability of the whole thing, but we will listen to everyone and
work with them as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the young giant in Atlanta will even find himself
playing football in the Rose Bowl with an elephant on the side of
his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics and cynics abound, especially since Triple-A football
has no coaches, players, uniforms or logos yet. Reinholz and his
group, however, have a dream, and a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Games will take place on Wednesday nights, player contracts will
start at $30,000 and include many incentives, and Reinholz says a
cable network has shown interest in securing television rights.
</P>
<P>
   Field goals of at least 50 yards will be worth four points,
kickoffs will take place at the 25-yard line to induce action, and
certain players will don microphones while one referee will be
outfitted with a camera.
</P>
<P>
   AAA football could be the stage for players with fringe academic
pasts and potential crossover athletes from other sports who might
possess some football potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like (Reinholz) has a program in place, with some
pretty good ideas how to run it. And we will listen,'' Roach said.
``But it's a tough, tough road to put a new league together, no
matter if it's baseball, football or basketball. It isn't an easy
thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time, and a whole lotta money.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Reinholz, he and his group will have sunk $10
million into the league by the opening kickoff in October 1999. He
also said the first season will take place even without sponsors or
a television deal.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, the group hopes to have its team logos,
uniform designs and coaches, with NFL ties, in place. Training
camps will open next spring, and applications can be obtained from
AAA Football, 2828 University Ave., Suite 301-201, San Diego,
Calif., 92104.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to people who just don't get it,'' Reinholz said.
``Some people aren't convinced. But most of the time, they can
understand where we're coming from. We didn't start working on this
three weeks ago. We started two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've laid the foundation. Now, we're getting ready to put up
the framing of the house. More and more people are walking by,
saying, `Hey, what's this?' We'll get the house built.''
</P>
<P>
   The league will own its 10 teams, which will also play in San
Jose, Sacramento, Reno, Fresno, Bakersfield, Anaheim, Tucson,
Albuquerque and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Reinholz's group has been in contact with Michael Chan, the
NFL's director of player personnel, who said AAA football is not a
new concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many semi-pro leagues throughout the
country,'' Chan said, ``and this will probably be one of those
semi-pro leagues which is more regional than national. And they've
been successful. They continue to play.''
</P>
<P>
   And of the possibility of AAA football attracting a cable
television audience?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me, honestly, my personal opinion? I don't think
so, because it's based in California and Las Vegas,'' Chan said.
``(Cable stations) ... would want a wider audience than
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the recent NBC-TNT announcement of an imminent, alternative
pro league, Reinholz said he was excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to play them in a championship game,'' he said.
``Let me be the first to issue that challenge. We know our guys
wouldn't be good enough to play in the NFL, otherwise they'd be in
the NFL. I'm delighted. It's a perfect opening.''
</P>
<P>
   For Reinholz's next piece of fiction?
</P>
<P>
   Reinholz, who said he made his fortune in a Northern California
import business in the '70s and Southern California real estate in
the '80s, envisions a Triple-A team for each NFL franchise one day.
</P>
<P>
   An introductory brochure package, which Chan glanced at Friday
in his New York office for the first time, describes Triple-A
football as the future of pro football in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate malcontents, `goof offs,' head cases and
law breakers,'' Reinholz wrote. ``We will not have any one
individual distract us from our mission ... (and) the coaches don't
have to be baby sitters, security guards and psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Or roll, as in down the drain, which many football leagues have
done in the past. But Reinholz said the difference with Triple-A is
that it will be a feeder system to the NFL, not a competitor
against the established league.
</P>
<P>
   Reinholz and his group will not seek financial support from the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the CFL, which had to borrow $3 million from (the
NFL),'' Reinholz said, ``we wanted to go to them without our hands
out. We want to do it the way we want to, and they're very excited
over the concept. Hey, it looks good to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It will look even better when Reinholz finally sees a Pasadena
Pachyderm uniform.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and its allies said Tuesday that
pledges by Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic did not go far
enough to meet the demands of the West that he end his crackdown in
Kosovo, and that planning for possible NATO military intervention
was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   But Western officials also said that Milosevic's promises, made
to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in their meeting in Moscow on
Tuesday, were a first step toward halting the Serbian offensive
against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, the southernmost
province of Serbia. They emphasized that the West would carefully
monitor Serbian compliance with Milosevic's promises in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Congress on Tuesday that Milosevic had rejected a key demand for an
immediate withdrawal of Serbian special police and military forces
from Kosovo. Instead, Milosevic said that as ethnic Albanians
fighting for independence stopped their ``terrorist activities,''
Serbian forces would increasingly stay in their barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said: ``We don't
think that there should be any linkage between an immediate
withdrawal of forces by the Yugoslavs, on the one hand, and
stopping terrorist activities, on the other. There ought to be
complete withdrawal of military forces so that negotiations can
begin.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's spokesman, Mike McCurry, said: ``That's a
linkage that would appear to be a loophole. There's no
justification for continuation of the brutal campaign of violence
by Serb security forces, and the withdrawal of Serb security forces
is fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry said that the Yeltsin-Milosevic meeting, in
Clinton's view, ``moves us in the right direction.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to Yeltsin by telephone after the Russian leader
met with Milosevic in Moscow. Yeltsin hailed the meeting as a
breakthrough, and said that ``the most important thing is that
Milosevic agreed to sit at the negotiating table with the Kosovo
Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic has already done so once, in May, at U.S. urging,
before beginning the latest chapter of his crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright said Tuesday, ``It is insufficient to say that
dialogue could go forward, if the killing of civilians and
depopulating of villages continues.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Milosevic's promises _ if carried out _
would constitute progress, U.S. officials said they were not eager
to let Milosevic off the hook, particularly given his history of
doing just enough to stave off tough action against him.
</P>
<P>
   But they also acknowledged that Milosevic had relented enough
for now to make it highly unlikely that Moscow would agree to a
Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to stop
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The officials emphasized that it would take some time to
evaluate what Milosevic does to put his pledges into effect. They
said that no use of U.S. force is imminent, that planning for
possible NATO military strikes is being done at a rapid pace, and
that no unilateral U.S. military action is currently being
contemplated, although they did not rule it out in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   But if Milosevic continues his crackdown and his
disproportionate use of force in Kosovo, a senior Western diplomat
said, ``then the Russian effort will have failed, and one can only
hope that Yeltsin sees that more pressure of another kind is
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., strongly urged the administration
to act with strength in Kosovo. Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., continues
to gather signatures for a letter urging the White House to move
now to attack Serbian positions in Kosovo and to order a no-flight
zone for Serbian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said the Bush administration was correct to warn
Milosevic in 1992 that the United States could act unilaterally
with military force to prevent a conflict in Kosovo ``with the
potential to suck in Greece, Macedonia, Turkey and Albania and
strike at the heart of NATO unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel called for U.S. action before the situation worsens.
``This deal with Yeltsin is insincere and a sham and we shouldn't
be conned by it,'' he said in an interview. ``The lesson of Bosnia
is that Milosevic will never change his policies unless he knows
there's a resolve on the part of the United States and the West to
stop him. He will only do what he needs to do to stop sanctions or
action against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel also said that he was disturbed by the possibility that
the Russians, by vetoing any Security Council resolution
authorizing NATO to use force in Kosovo, could also restrict NATO
from doing what it wants, since the European Union has already
taken the position that military force in Kosovo, a part of
Yugoslavia, would require United Nations authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen have said that
Washington would act alone and without a resolution, if necessary.
But Washington would prefer action through NATO, backed by the
United Nations.

 &HT;    GM and UAW at a stand still
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
are making no progress in settling two Michigan parts-plant
strikes, which have now erased 60 percent of the company's vehicle
production and idled 4,500 workers in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes in Flint by 9,200 UAW members at a metal-stamping
plant and a Delphi instrument panel and engine parts plant have
caused GM to close or partially shut down 17 of its 29 North
American assembly plants. Parts shortages from the Flint strikes
have forced nearly 71,000 GM workers to be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, about 4,500 GM employees in are out of work at five
area plants. The local layoffs include about 3,900 workers at the
Moraine truck assembly plant; 323 at two Dayton brake plants; 158
workers at GM's Vandalia air bag plant; 73 hourly employees at the
Kettering suspension parts plant; and 27 workers at GM's Delphi
Chassis plant on Home Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   GM on Tuesday also informed 470 hourly workers at the Moraine
Engine plant that they would be working half-days due to the Flint
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   More plant closures and layoffs in the Dayton area and across
the nation are expected today. Analysts estimate the strike is
costing GM at least $40 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   With negotiators exchanging barbs at the metal plant Monday
night and union leaders expected to leave in a day or two for a UAW
convention, a settlement seems unlikely by Friday. By then, 95
percent of the automaker's car and truck output would be halted,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a long summer for those strikers,'' said Michael
Robinet, an auto industry consultant with CSM Forecasting in
Farmington Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Union and company officials said Monday the walkout appears
likely to last into July. If the Flint strikes aren't settled by
June 26 U.S. workers, idled by the walkouts, will not get their
union-won ``holiday pay'' for the first week of GM's annual
two-week plant shutdown, which starts June 29.
</P>
<P>
   GM's UAW contract classifies the second week of the break as
mandatory vacation, for which workers received pay in a lump sum
earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of auto workers from other U.S. plants, including 200
UAW members from the Dayton brake plants, are expected today to
joint the striking Flint workers on the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiators walked out of discussions at the Flint Metal
Center Monday after a GM representative suggested striking workers'
support would weaken on a steady diet of $150-a-week strike pay,
said President Duane Zuckschwerdt of UAW Local 659.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took major exception to that remark,'' he said. ``That was
just a total slap in our face. Obviously, the company isn't trying
to look for a quick resolution to this thing. They think they can
win their case by holding our members hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest automaker released a statement saying the
union's account of the meeting was ``completely fabricated.''
</P>
<P>
   GM says the union has blocked plans to make the Flint factories
more efficient. The union claims GM has failed to invest in the
plants and has ignored long-standing grievances and run roughshod
over union contracts in its zeal to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW is determined to protect jobs in Flint in light of
company plans to slash 15,000 of its 34,000 Flint jobs over two
years

BIG 12 IS NOT IN DANGER OF BREAKUP, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>

By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No commissioner. A testy television renegotiation looming.
Continuing rumors and predictions of dissolvement.
</P>
<P>
   So, there's panic in the streets of the Big 12 Conference's
neighborhood, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big 12 is healthy and stable,'' Texas athletic director
DeLoss Dodds said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard no expressions of dissatisfaction from anyone,''
said Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen, chairman of the Big 12
presidents. ``I only hear that from members of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past six weeks, commissioner Steve Hatchell has resigned,
the Big 12 held spring meetings at which negotiations for extending
the conference's football television contracts produced no
progress, and the Western Athletic Conference announced it was
breaking up. All three events produced rumors of rifts in the Big
12 and the league's impending doom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, the conference business is moving forward
in a very normal way,'' said Missouri athletic director Joe
Castiglione, who will take over as Oklahoma's athletic director in
a few weeks. ``Contrary to what some might believe, the Big 12 is
alive and well and getting stronger every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 presidents are in Dallas for meetings yesterday and today
to select a committee that will begin the search for a new
commissioner. Hatchell resigned the position in early May, and Dave
Martin, hired as the Big 12's chief operating officer six weeks
ago, is the de facto commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen describes the hiring of a new commissioner as ``important
but not critical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to move in a deliberate fashion without rushing,'' he
said. ``The consensus is that Dave Martin is doing a great job and
that we do no harm under his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen's guess is that a new commissioner won't be in place until
around the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the right person's out there, I think we need to move as
quickly as we can,'' Kansas athletic director Bob Frederick said.
``Ideally, in my mind, we need someone in place for the beginning
of football season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12, which is entering its third season of competition,
was formed primarily for television benefits. Adding Texas, Texas
A&AMP;M, Texas Tech and Baylor to the Big Eight gave the Big 12 clout _
and more television sets _ in negotiating TV deals.
</P>
<P>
   And Hatchell produced lucrative deals with ABC and Fox. The ABC
deal, which includes the Big 12 championship game, pays the league
$16 million a year. The Fox agreement is an escalating one that
paid the conference $8.5 million last year and will pay an
estimated $11.5 million this year. Both agreements run through
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, however, the Big Ten, Pacific-10 and Atlantic Coast
conferences all renegotiated their television deals, extending them
to 2006 with significant rights increases.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers maintained that the lack of progress on the TV
contract during the spring meetings signaled that the Big 12 family
was bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're talking strategy,'' Dodds said. ``We're
deciding what course to take. When we decide that, then we'll start
talking dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   When the WAC broke up last month, the rumor mill started
spinning about the Big 12's future. Baylor, some speculated, might
be interested in joining former Southwest Conference schools SMU
and TCU in a new league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is totally, completely and without a doubt not true,''
said Grant Teaff, executive director of the American Football
Coaches Association and former football coach and athletic director
at Baylor. ``Everybody at Baylor is in complete agreement that the
Big 12 is the place for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And one other fact speaks against a Big 12 breakup: The
conference generated more than $45 million for its members in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a lot of speculation about schools leaving
when I was in the Big Eight at Oklahoma State,'' Bowen said. ``At
Texas A&AMP;M, one of the schools people continue to speculate about
leaving, it's simply not a topic of discussion. We're committed to
the league.''

PROPOSAL MADE TO EXPAND HATE CRIMES LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two leading congressional Democrats, reacting to
the brutal killing of a black man in Jasper, Texas, introduced
legislation Tuesday aimed at expanding federal civil rights law to
make it easier to prosecute attacks based on race, religion, gender
or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed measure would remove a restriction in U.S. law that
outlaws attacks based on race or religion only if the victim was
exercising a federally protected right _ such as freedom of speech
_ at the time of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also broaden the scope of the law to
protect not only racial and religious minorities, but also
homosexuals, women and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government should be a full partner with the
states'' in prosecuting hate crimes, said Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., the bill's chief Senate sponsor. The current law's
protected-right limitation ``makes it very difficult to charge a
federal offense, and in many instances it may make a federal
prosecution impossible,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's introduction followed the June 7 killing in Texas
of James Byrd Jr., allegedly by three white supremacists. Byrd's
head and right arm were wrenched from his body when he was dragged
for about three miles from the back of a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested in connection with the killing were John William
``Bill'' King, 23, of Jasper; Shawn Berry, 23, of Jasper; and
Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs. Federal agents
are assisting local law enforcement in investigating the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is considering whether to file federal
civil rights charges in the case, Attorney General Janet Reno has
said. It is unclear whether the Byrd incident will meet the
standards of the current law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dragging death of James Byrd is a vivid and shocking
reminder that even in a civilized society there are those motivated
by blinding hate,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the
measure's chief House sponsor. ``For those in Congress who believe
that hate crimes are overblown or that the Hate Crimes Act is
unnecessary, let the brutal torture and murder of this innocent man
be a wake-up call. We have to seize the moment and pass a tougher
law, or else the brutal death of James Byrd will have been in
vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, noting that the Ku Klux Klan on Tuesday received a
permit to hold a march in Jasper, urged his colleagues to pass the
legislation and ``send a message to those who use hate as a
vocation that we are going to prosecute crimes of violent bigotry
to the fullest extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the legislation is not intended to undermine state
investigations and prosecutions of hate crimes. He praised Texas
law enforcement authorities for their ``immediate, vigorous and
effective response'' to Byrd's killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes tear at the heart and soul of our country, and we
need to do all we can to combat them,'' Kennedy said. ``As a
nation, we cannot afford to ignore such vicious acts of hate.
Public officials and citizens alike, at every level _ federal,
state and local _ have a moral obligation to root out hate crimes
and the hateful conditions that encourage them.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, although identical, has different names in the
Senate and House.
</P>
<P>
   Principal co-sponsors of the Senate version, the proposed Hate
Crimes Prevention Act, are Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Ron
Wyden, D-Ore. In the House, the leading co-sponsor of the proposed
Hate Crimes Prosecution Act is Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.

KKK TO HOLD RALLY IN JASPER, TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ City officials here were notified Tuesday that
members of the Ku Klux Klan will be in town on June 27 to hold a
two-hour rally in the aftermath of the recent racially motivated
murder of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking forward to it,'' said City Manager Terry
Lacy, ``but it is their constitutional right. The can do whatever
they want as long as they don't obstruct traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the murder of James Byrd Jr. and the arrest of three
white men _ two with possible ties to white supremacy groups _
there were rumors that the Klan was coming to Jasper to confront
the militant black groups that arrived on Saturday, the day of
Byrd's funeral. The Klan did not show.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lowe, regional director of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, later said that he would accompany 15 to 20 members of
another, Vidor-based Klan faction to Jasper for a parade, which
would require a permit from the city, to condemn the violence. A
notice posted on the Knights of the White Kamellia website states
that the KKK group will be on hand ``to provide assistance to the
White residents of Jasper County.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the group apparently now plans to hold a rally on public
property, instead of a parade, no permit is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not have to have our blessing for that,'' said City
Attorney Gary Gatlin. He said Lowe contacted city officials as a
``courtesy'' to let them know the rally would be held from noon to
2 p.m. on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said they want to make a statement that the two men (in
custody) are not part of their organization and that they do not
condone murder,'' Gatlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men arrested for the Byrd murder _ Lawrence Russell
Brewer Jr., and John William ``Bill'' King _ may have been
affiliated with white supremacy groups while they were in prison.
The third suspect, Shawn Berry, has denied any such affiliation and
has given a statement to the authorities, blaming the murder on the
other two men.

AMERICAN TEAM HAS CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A crisis of confidence threatens to undermine the United
States' World Cup campaign, with players second-guessing Coach
Steve Sampson's personnel decisions in the wake of Monday's
lopsided loss to Germany in a Group F opener.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the Americans' most experienced players relegated
to the bench, or worse, a timid squad of World Cup first-timers
took a 2-0 defeat to the Germans at Parc des Princes, raising
questions about whether the Yanks might have been better served by
guys who have been there and done that.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 11 U.S. starters, plus second-half substitute
Frankie Hejduk, had never seen action in the sport's most important
event, and their paucity of experience contributed to the naivete
the Americans displayed on the field, especially during the
critical first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little hesitant,'' admitted playmaker Claudio Reyna,
a debutante whom the Germans targeted in disrupting the American
game plan. ``They had seven (1990) world champions on the field,
and we have seven guys playing in their first World Cup. That
showed in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna's numbers might be a bit off the Germans have five
veterans of their '90 title-winning team but his point is well
taken. And while few of his teammates disagreed with his logic, not
many of them wanted to speak publicly about who should they thought
should be playing in place of the players Sampson selected.
</P>
<P>
   One willing to address it was Tab Ramos, one of three three-time
World Cup veterans on the U.S. roster and one of two of them who
started Monday's match on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to believe when you can look down the bench and see
guys like Alexi Lalas and Marcelo Balboa, and then you have guys
(on the field) who have never played in the World Cup before,''
said Ramos. ``I don't have to agree, and I don't, but I respect the
fact that it's Steve's decision to put those guys in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another: ``You die with the guys who got you there.''
</P>
<P>
   That would include Balboa, the Americans' all-time appearances
leader with 126, and Lalas, who teamed with Balboa to form a solid
central defense during the 1994 Cup. Neither appears likely to see
action in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Their experience, and that of ousted captain John Harkes and
several others, might have provided the Americans the wherewithal
to challenge the Germans, who got an eighth-minute goal and then
closed up shop, making it virtually impossible for the U.S. squad
to overcome the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who know how to react (in the World Cup), who know
what to do, they weren't on the field last night,'' said forward
Eric Wynalda, another three-time Cup choice who did start on
Monday. ``You don't know how to react in a World Cup until you've
been in one. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience is such a hard thing to explain. You don't know
what it is until you have it. And it's all the little things that
come to play in a game like that, all the little things that can
snowball and turn into something really bad and ruin your day. It's
the ability to stay calm and be completely intense at the same
time. I don't think experienced players get nervous; I think they
get intense. Nervousness can kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup sideshow might have played a role in that. After
spending a week secluded at the Chateau de Pizay in Saint-Jean
d'Ardieres, the Yanks arrived Saturday in Paris; some of the
younger players were a bit overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were isolated in the middle of nowhere,'' said Lalas, ``and
then we were plopped in the middle of Paris. It was like a circus,
and a lot of the guys didn't have the experience for it.''
</P>
<P>
   They're eyes were still wide open by game time Monday, which
begs the question: Were the Americans ill-served by leaving so many
experienced players, guys such as Lalas and Balboa and Roy Wegerle
and Preki Radosavljevic, on the bench?
</P>
<P>
   ``You think it showed?'' Wynalda asked a media throng Tuesday.
``What do you think? I think it's pretty clear. I think you guys
know what to write, but you're not going to get a quote out of me
in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to help the team. There's no sense in
slighting the guys. I'm not Tab, I'm not Tab. I've already spoken
to Tab about it. I think it's very important we stay positive right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, who played in his U.S. record eighth World Cup game, has
been told he'll start on Sunday against Kuwait, likely in place of
'94 veteran Ernie Stewart in the attacking midfield slot. As many
as eight starters will be making their second Cup appearance.
</P>
<P>
   If they approach the match, and the June 25 first-round finale
against Yugoslavia, with the right demeanor, things could work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough experience on this team to realize this can be
a very long tournament,'' Wynalda said. ``Or this can be a very
short one if we don't have the right attitude.''

COMPAQ SERVICE TO HELP BUSINESSES SET UP ONLINE STOREFRONTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN &QL; 
1998c. Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Compaq Computer Corp. on Tuesday launched another
product designed to generate cash through online transactions, this
time taking aim at the burgeoning small- and medium-business
market.
</P>
<P>
   During his keynote address to the PC Expo trade show, Chief
Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said Compaq will offer an easy way for
small businesses to offer products and services on the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Online Services is a software package _ to be included on
Deskpro computers _ that lets businesses set up and configure
online storefronts, sign up with an Internet provider, back up
critical data offsite and even buy postage via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This global initiative is designed to meet the needs of small
and medium businesses for quicker access to online sales
opportunities and more efficient ways of doing business,'' Pfeiffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The product is the second one Compaq has announced in two weeks
that will give the Houston-based PC maker extra revenue every time
a customer uses it. Businesses will use one of the services offered
in the package, and the service provider in turn will pay a fee to
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York last week, Compaq announced an agreement with
GTE's Internet services and America Online in which they would pay
Compaq every time a new Presario owner subscribed to their
services.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Kurtzmann, vice president for Compaq's small- and
medium-business division, estimated Compaq Online Services has a
potential revenue stream of $3 billion over 18 months, and
realistically ``it means at least tens of millions of dollars to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The product is a companion to Compaq's Club Web, a kind of
interactive yellow pages on the World Wide Web that lets businesses
find providers of various kinds of online services.
</P>
<P>
   One of the products being offered is 24-hour backup-and-restore
service from NovaStor. Marius Haas, a manager in the small and
medium business division, said a set of powerful computers operated
by the recently acquired Digital Equipment Corp. will be used to
hold customers' data.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to Digital to talk about this, they said they had
massive amounts of storage sitting around idle, just waiting for
something like this,'' Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pfeiffer's speech, delivered to a nearly full auditorium
at the Jacob Javitz Convention Center, focused on Compaq's role on
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, Compaq and its resellers today sell more than $6
million a day over the Internet _ and that is more than Dell,''
Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech at PC Expo Monday, Pfeiffer again sought to
allay the fears of Digital's longtime customers. Some have
expressed concern that Compaq's $9 billion acquisition of the
Massachusetts company means support for Digital's older systems
will go away.
</P>
<P>
   Since the acquisition was completed last week, Pfeiffer has used
each public appearance to proclaim that Compaq will continue to
develop Digital's core technologies, including its own version of
Unix and its high-powered Alpha microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those in the audience who are Digital customers, I want to
assure you that we are not taking your business for granted,'' he
said. ``We intend to earn your trust and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The integration of Compaq and Digital was evident on the PC Expo
show floor, where Digital's products were shown side-by-side with
Compaq's. Long before the two companies began talking, both rented
booths that coincidentally were next to each other. After the
acquisition, the two were merged into 18,000 feet of contiguous
floor space, one of the largest displays at PC Expo.

CONTROVERSY SPAWNED BY MAGAZNINE ARTICLE ON LEAKS CONTINUES TO
GROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An article in a new media magazine about leaks of
sensitive information to reporters covering the Lewinsky
investigation ignited a new round of accusations and rebuttals on
Tuesday, from the independent counsel, President Clinton's personal
lawyer and journalists who said their reputations had been
maligned.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in four days, Kenneth Starr, who is
investigating the relationship between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,
sharply questioned the veracity of the article in the magazine
Brill's Content, as well as the integrity of its author, Steven
Brill.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's latest response came in a 19-page letter to Brill, the
magazine's editor and publisher, in which he said the article was
replete with errors and rested on a fundamental misrepresentation
of the law. ``More disappointing, however, is that your reckless
and irresponsible attack borders on the libelous,'' Starr added.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy article entitled ``Pressgate,'' written for the
magazine's inaugural issue, alleged that Starr or his office was
the source of much of the information reporters used in stories
about witnesses who were to testify before the grand jury
investigating the Lewinsky matter. In the article, Starr
acknowledged briefing reporters but said that what he told them was
not a violation of federal law, Justice Department guidelines or
bar association ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over leaks of information about the investigation
rekindled charges by Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, that Starr
and his aides have improperly, and possibly illegally, tried to
influence the course of the investigation by disclosing potentially
damaging information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your statements in the Brill article are at breathtaking
variance with your previous public statements about your duties and
actions,'' Kendall wrote. ``Your statements consistently have led
the public to believe you would tolerate no leaks of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the charges and countercharges, Starr's investigation
proceeded, with testimony from two White House officials before a
federal grand jury. Nancy Hernreich, who determines who sees the
president, made her seventh appearance there and answered questions
for more than three hours. John Podesta, deputy White House chief
of staff, who played a role in helping Ms. Lewinsky find a job, was
questioned for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's letter, which reads much like a legal brief, is a
detailed attempt to dispute point-by-point many _ though not all _
of Brill's charges of improper conduct. He said discussions with
reporters about such issues as the time frame of the investigation
or office staffing were perfectly legitimate subjects to share with
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we must avoid, and what we do avoid, is discussion of
information sought from or provided by witnesses _ whether in the
form of investigative interviews, grand jury appearances, or
documents provided to this Office,'' Starr wrote. ``We have not
disclosed this information to the media and your claim that I have
admitted doing so is false.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, however, does not dispute the quotes attributed to
Starr in the Brill article, which said that he and his principal
lieutenant have provided reporters information on a
not-for-attribution basis. In that article Starr was quoted as
saying it was entirely proper to provide information such as what a
potential witness told an FBI agent, so long as that witness had
not been called before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what was disclosed to reporters by Starr's
office could be critical if it was found to violate federal law,
Justice Department guidelines or rules of ethics forbidding
disclosure of grand jury information. But Kendall and Starr have
offered different interpretations of what information those laws
and rules cover.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, on Monday, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who is
overseeing the grand jury investigation, called both sides into her
courtroom and admonished them for the leaks.  &QL;

EMBARGOED UNTIL 11 P.M. EST 
 
AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE PICKS TOP 100 FILMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors note: please see BEST-FILMS-LIST 
 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 57-year-old black-and-white movie most Americans have never
seen is the best American movie of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' is a better science-fiction movie than ``2001: A
Space Odyssey'', ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' and ``Close
Encounters of the Third Kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Character actor Ward Bond was in more great movies than Humphrey
Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and Marlon Brando.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Graduate'' is the best American comedy of all time, ``High
Noon'' the best western, ``The Wizard of Oz'' the best musical.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ending debate, the American Film Institute's
18-month effort to select the 100 Greatest American Movies of All
Time is sure to create endless arguments.
</P>
<P>
   And that is brilliant. Because the idea behind the Greatest 100
list, which was to be revealed Tuesday night, is to boost interest
in America's rich and wonderful film heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The list also serves as a nice contrast to the common rankings
of top moneymakers that prove more about marketing than quality or
art.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's only a list, reflecting the experiences, prejudices
and ages of those who voted on it. People tend to be most impressed
by films they saw when they were young and first aware of the
artistry and power of movies. Since most voters were past that age,
they were less likely to vote for recent movies.
</P>
<P>
   The results of voting by as many as 1,500 Americans _
film-industry insiders plus a few others _ were to be announced
Tuesday night on ``AFI's 100 Years . . . 100 Movies'' on CBS. The
movies were made during the first century of American filmmaking,
1896-1996. (So don't get upset if you think ``Titanic'' should be
on the list: It came out too late.)
</P>
<P>
   It will be no surprise to any student of film that, as on many
best-film lists, ``Citizen Kane'' came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   The masterful Orson Welles film, a thinly disguised and
unflattering pastiche based on the life of newspaper publisher
William Randolph Hearst, has long and widely been considered among
the best movies ever crafted.
</P>
<P>
   It can be hard for modern viewers, trained to care about big
scenes and wild plots, to spot what makes this film so important.
That's partly because so much of what Welles and cinematographer
Gregg Toland accomplished has become the standard language of film.
Understanding the film's significance requires knowing what was
usual before ``Citizen Kane'' came along.
</P>
<P>
   Far more popular are other films in the list's Top 10, including
the perennial favorites ``Casablanca'', ``Gone With the Wind'' (the
all-time top moneymaker when figures are adjusted for inflation),
``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``The Graduate'' and ``Singin' in the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Few movies on the list can be considered total surprises, though
plenty will debate the inclusion of ``Dances With Wolves'', ``Dr.
Zhivago'', ``Giant'', ``Pulp Fiction'', ``Unforgiven'', ``Platoon''
or ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   More surprising are some of the pictures that didn't make the
list. Among the 400 finalists that failed to make the final cut are
``Adam's Rib,'' ``All the President's Men'', ``The Big Chill'',
``The Big Sleep'', ``Cabaret'', ``The Conversation'', ``The
General'', ``His Girl Friday'', ``In Cold Blood'', ``The Killing
Fields'', ``The Last Picture Show'', ``Last Tango in Paris'',
``Mary Poppins'', ``El Norte'', ``Reds'', ``Red River'', ``Tom
Jones'' and ``Goldfinger''.
</P>
<P>
   Film writers and fans will analyze the significance of the list
and its oddities for some time to come. Here are a few to get you
started:
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg, who had to wait until 1993 to get a
best-director Academy Award for ``Schindler's List'' (ranked No.
9), directed five movies on the list. The other four are ``E.T.''
(25), ``Jaws'' (48), ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (60) and ``Close
Encounters'' (64). He beat out Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder,
who directed four each.
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Hepburn is the leading lady with the most films: ``The
African Queen'' (17), ``The Philadelphia Story'' (51), ``Bringing
Up Baby'' (97) and ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' (99). Natalie
Wood, Diane Keaton and Faye Dunaway had three each.
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart and Robert De Niro lead all leading men with five
films each. De Niro's are Raging Bull (24), The Godfather Part II
(32), Taxi Driver (47), The Deer Hunter (79) and Goodfellas (94).
Stewart's five are It's a Wonderful Life (11), Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington (29), Rear Window (42), The Philadelphia Story (51) and
Vertigo (61).
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most popular actors of all time, Humphrey Bogart and
John Wayne, had good representation. Bogart is the star of four,
all in the Top 30: ``Casablanca'' (2), ``The African Queen'' (17),
``The Maltese Falcon'' (23) and ``The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre'' (30). Wayne's films are ``Stagecoach'' (63) and ``The
Searchers'' (96).
</P>
<P>
   Beating all actors was Ward Bond, one of the most popular and
prolific character actors in Hollywood history. He had supporting
roles in seven movies on the list: ``It Happened One Night'' (35),
``Bringing Up Baby'' (97), ``Gone With the Wind'' (4), ``The Grapes
of Wrath'' (21), ``The Maltese Falcon'' (23), ``It's a Wonderful
Life'' (11) and ``The Searchers'' (96).
</P>
<P>
   The list includes 11 comedies, eight musicals, nine war films,
eight westerns, four science fiction, four horror and two animated.
Most of the rest are, no surprise, drama. Of course, many also
overlap each other. ``From Here to Eternity'' could be called
either drama or war. ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' (50) is
both comedy and western,
</P>
<P>
   Voters seemed to agree with the popular notion that 1939 was the
best year in American movie history, with five films on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s, often considered a relatively fallow period of
American film making, had the most films on the list: 20.
</P>
<P>
   The only sequel on the list is ``The Godfather Part II.'' It's
one of the few sequels often noted as better than its original,
``The Godfather'' (3).
</P>
<P>
   The oldest film on the list is ``The Birth of a Nation'' (1915).
The most recent is ``Fargo'' (1996).

BEST SIGNATURE OF ALL? PEROT'S ON A CHECK  
 GOVERNOR'S BOOK AT ISSUE IN ARKANSAS  
 VIRGINIA TOBACCO TIES GOP AND LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., S.C., Tenn., Texas, Va., Ark.)   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost from the day it was founded, Ross Perot's Reform Party
has been complaining about the difficulty that third parties have
in gaining official recognition and getting on state and federal
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The other day the party even failed to gain access to the 1998
ballot in Texas, the founder's home state. It needed the signatures
of some 44,000 Texans on ballot petitions _ or 1 percent of the
state's electorate _ but it came up with fewer than half that many.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas failure was the party's fourth this year. It also fell
short of gathering the required number of signatures to win ballot
access in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements for gaining a ballot line vary widely by state
and can be daunting. In many states, a party's performance in the
previous election determines whether it will automatically be on
the ballot in the next election or has to circulate petitions again
to demonstrate its political viability.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its recent failures, the Reform Party remains on at
least 30 state ballots as a result of the 1996 election returns.
Still, what of the rest of the states?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the party has demonstrated that it can prevail in
just about any ballot access fight _ if Perot weighs in.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential election years of 1992 and 1996, when Perot
was a candidate, he saw to it that the party had the petitioning
manpower, money, legal advice and leadership to overcome state
rules and obstacles. The party won position almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in 1998, with no presidential contest
scheduled, Perot has not seen fit to come to the aid of those
seeking ballot access in any state, not even his own, despite
pledges at the party's national convention last year that he and
other party leaders would wage an all-out effort to field
candidates at all levels in all coming elections, presidential and
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of being realistic,'' Reform Party chairman
Russell Verney explained in the aftermath of the Texas failure.
``We've decided we're not going to go for ballot access everywhere
and we're not going to field candidates at every level unless we
can see reasonable results down the road for all that effort and
money. Texas and the other states had to face that reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the party does not run lots of candidates and make a
showing in the 1998 elections, particularly in states where it
already has ballot access, will it not find itself off the ballot
again in 2000 and once again facing a huge petitioning challenge?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done twice, we can do a third time,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Governor's Book At Issue in Arkansas
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about political candidates writing books
about themselves or public issues or both, and then having their
selectively crafted works hit stores just as the campaign season
heats up. Most of the tomes are then routinely greeted for what
they are _ self-serving political advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But the political reviews have been anything but routine for a
new paperback by Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican up for
re-election. His 180-page book, ``Kids Who Kill'' (Broadman &AMP;
Holman), explores violence among American youth, and its opening
lines describe the March 24 incident in Jonesboro, Ark., in which
two middle-school students are accused of fatally shooting a
teacher and four fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's Democratic opponent, Bill Bristow, and a number
of the state's Democratic leaders contend that the book is not just
a political screed but greedy ``exploitation'' of tragedy by a
public servant. They say the governor owes an apology to the
survivors of the shooting victims and should donate his $25,000
advance from the publisher to a scholarship fund.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who leads Bristow, a Jonesboro lawyer, by a 2-to-1
margin in the polls, counters that his critics are ``utterly
ridiculous'' and accuses them of political hypocrisy. Last year he
published a book called ``Character Is the Issue,'' and he says he
planned to write the book on violence well before the Jonesboro
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shooting occurred, he argues, there was no literary way
he could ignore it, given that violence in American society was the
new work's subject. In any event, he said, the Jonesboro incident
takes up only a few pages in the $11.99 paperback.
</P>
<P>
   As for donating his advance to a scholarship fund, the governor
has plans somewhat along that line. He said he would use the money
to send his children to college.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tobacco Ties GOP and Labor
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco makes strange political bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday in Richmond, one of the country's major tobacco
processing centers, Republican Gov. James Gilmore and Virginia
AFL-CIO president Daniel LeBlanc put aside decades of ideological
antagonism and, standing shoulder to brotherly shoulder at a
``Tobacco Workers Summit,'' pledged unity in the fight to save the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as most people can remember, Virginia Republicans
have been at odds with Virginia's Democrat-dominated unions. Or, as
LeBlanc put it, there was a time when ``the governor of Virginia
wouldn't dare be in the same room as the president of the Virginia
AFL-CIO.''
</P>
<P>
   But the threat that the tobacco bill now before Congress poses
to the state's biggest cash crop looms larger than all that, if the
Gilmore-LeBlanc unity pledge is any indicator.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old Dominion, tobacco is a $2.5 billion industry,
providing livelihood for 120,000 farmers and other workers. That is
a lot of union jobs and a lot of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gilmore's meeting with LeBlanc, some Virginia labor
leaders had complained that the state's Democratic legislators in
Washington were mouthing support for the tobacco industry but
otherwise doing little out of fear that the White House might
retaliate. The Democrats had countered that they were doing all
possible, and some subsequently showed up at the Gilmore summit and
signed the unity pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been on a roll in Virginia in recent years,
after decades of Democratic hegemony that was attributable in part
to solid union support. If they could steal away some of that
support, the state Republican Party could gain even more momentum.
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc praised both the Republicans and Democrats who gathered
to hear union concerns. But he added pointedly, even portentously,
that in the future big labor's goal in the tobacco fight would be
to have its voice ``not only heard but heeded.''

ARMEY SUPPORTS LOTT'S VIEWS OF HOMOSEXUALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Miss., Minn.)  (th) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress unexpectedly became embroiled in a
controversy over homosexuality Tuesday as a senior House Republican
defended the assertion that it is a sin and as the White House
declared that such ``backward'' thinking was holding up
confirmation of its nominee as the ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute came a day after Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., likened homosexuality to alcoholism, kleptomania and ``sex
addiction'' in a television interview. When Armstrong Williams, a
conservative talk show host, asked him whether homosexuality was a
sin, Lott replied, ``Yes, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   With leaders of gay rights groups condemning Lott's remarks,
Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, Tuesday cited
Scripture to support Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is very clear on this,'' Armey said at his weekly
news conference, adding that ``both myself and Senator Lott believe
very strongly in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey cited I Corinthians 6:9, 11, 18 and 20. In the King James
version of the Bible, I Corinthians 6:9, for example, says that
``neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind'' shall inherit
the kingdom of God.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., seized upon
Lott's remarks to call for President Clinton's nomination of James
Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg to be brought to the Senate
floor. Hormel, who is gay, was approved by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on a 16-2 vote last fall. But Lott, at the
behest of a number of conservative senators, has refused to move
the nomination to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone told the Senate: ``We ought to bring it to the floor
so we can have an honest discussion. The majority leader is
entitled to his opinion. He is entitled to his opinion and his
vote. But the rest of us are entitled to our opinion and our
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, said Lott's
comments showed ``how difficult it is to get business done in
Washington sometimes when you're dealing with people who are so
backward in their thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry added, ``For over 25 years, it's been quite clear that
sexual orientation is not an affliction, it's not a disease, it is
something that is part of defining one's sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Irby, a spokeswoman for Lott, said that what McCurry
considered backward ``are the views and values of the great
majority of Americans who understand and are concerned about the
grave social and ethical questions our country faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The political dispute set off by Lott comes at a time of intense
debate in religious circles, especially within Protestant churches,
over whether certain verses of the Bible should still be read as
condemning homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent events have fueled that controversy. Among them
are the decision by Southern Baptists to continue their boycott of
Walt Disney Co., which they accuse of condoning homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry attributed Lott's comments to the growing influence of
social conservatives and the religious right in the Republican
Party as it prepares for the midterm elections. He said they were
drawing Republican leaders toward ``the extreme point of view in
American political life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian
political group, sent letters to Lott and Armey asking to meet with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These comments are out of step with the American people and
prevailing medical and mental health opinion and in step with James
Dobson and his extreme right-wing rhetoric,'' said Winnie
Stachelberg, the group's political director. &QL;

GALAXY'S MATHIS IS ROOKIE OF YEAR FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  Clint Mathis. His name alone sounds Hollywood made. You
immediately think of a Clint Eastwood or Johnny Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   But little do people know that Clint Mathis is no more the
Sunset Boulevard type than a tourist on holiday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the soft spoken Georgia boy is an enormous soccer
talent whose humble family approach to life was evident following a
recent Galaxy victory when he was seen dancing with his mother at
an Old Town Pasadena restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   And Mother's Day had already past.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old midfielder, far and away the leading candidate
for Major League Soccer's rookie of the year, just wants to let
life shuffle the cards and see what hand he's been dealt at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell the future,'' Mathis said. ``I just have to worry
about now and keep my head on straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis played his first game of cards back in November, which
seemed to Galaxy officials like a scary game of high-card,
low-card.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of many big decisions in his young career,
following a sensational college career at South Carolina, Mathis
opted for the MLS instead of taking his career to Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis was a three-time Hermann Award finalist, men's soccer's
equivalent to college football's Heisman Trophy. He was named to
Soccer America's team of the week four times, and was a first-team
All-South selection and Soccer News All-South player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   During last November's MLS college draft, Galaxy president and
general manager Daniel Villanueva, along with coach Octavio
Zambrano, couldn't believe Mathis was available when it came time
for the team to use its first-round pick (No. 6 overall).
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a guy (Mathis) that was not clearly filling anybody's
mold, but he was an outstanding athlete,'' Villanueva said. ``I
said before the draft we were looking at depth for central
defender, but when he was still available, you have to be able to
change gears and get the best athlete with the most skill and leave
behind the whole positional issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a big surprise, Mathis delayed his trip to the Galaxy
camp. Rumors immediately spread that Mathis would develop his
talents overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if he entered the draft, he was an automatic,''
Zambrano remembered. ``As he delayed his trip to come into camp I
got a little worried and then I got a couple phone calls from his
advisor and things really didn't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a joint effort from Villanueva, Zambrano and assistant
coach Ralph Perez to convince Mathis to move to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano and Perez got Mathis on the phone, and wouldn't hang
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph and I were going back and forth handing the phone to
each other,'' Zambrano said. ``I would talk for 10 minutes and
Ralph would pick it up for another 10 minutes. Finally, we figured
out the issue bothering Clint. He didn't know how much of an impact
he would be on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he understood that when we picked him, we picked
him with the idea he would see a lot of playing time. Once he had
that in his mind and I had that conversation with him that I
expected him to really contribute, then I think he understood he
was coming into a situation where he wasn't just going to be one of
the guys who would get in every now and then. Rather, he was going
to be expected to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   And produce he has.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis has started in nine of the Galaxy's first 14 games and is
currently fifth on the team in scoring with 15 points on two goals
and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   He started the season a little shaky and nervous, but now a
third of the way through he looks like a seasoned veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've picked up the game a little bit and I believe I can play
with these guys now,'' Mathis said. ``The level of play is much
different than college, but the players on this team have shown
trust in me and that's giving me a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that his coach has praised him at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt, he's the leading candidate (for rookie of
the year) as far as I'm concerned,'' Zambrano said. ``And knowing
his character, he is going to keep his head on straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart kid, this is just the beginning in a career that
has a lot of rewards ahead. You can dream, but you need to keep
your head on the ground and he understands that. That is why I
don't mind praising his efforts because he takes them for what it's
worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano says Mathis' best attribute is that he reads the game
well beyond his years.
</P>
<P>
   ``American players are not known as players that have an above
average technique, or that have flair,'' Zambrano said. ``He
understands the game like a young South American player who has
grown up with this game. Sometimes that's just good instinct, but
it's those kind of special intangible talents that make him
different.''
</P>
<P>
   While Zambrano's watches the World Cup, he can picture Mathis in
a different uniform down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the U.S. national team is in his future, no
question.'' Zambrano said. ``Everyone has different opinions about
talent, but I think he would bring something new. He's national
team material without a doubt.''

ABLE TO LAUGH AT THEIR PEOPLE, NOT JUST CRY FOR THEM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   SLIAMMON INDIAN RESERVE, British Columbia _ One morning
recently, Evan Adams, a 31-year-old American Indian actor, was
telling stories in the small living room of his parents' home on
this beautiful, heavily wooded stretch of the Canadian coast.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his mother, three sisters and a brother, he
explained in his singsong voice how he had terrified some of the
participants in a first-aid course he had taken by reacting with
passionate alarm toward a doll that was supposedly choking and its
inflatable mother.
</P>
<P>
   He was telling the story as a testament to his acting ability,
but his normally soft-spoken sister Maureen slyly deflated the
boast by asking, ``Was it acting or were you excited about that
blow-up doll?''
</P>
<P>
   This gentle gibe brought gales of laughter from Adams' family,
and it was just one episode in a day of wordplay among a group of
people clearly comfortable communicating through sometimes bawdy
humor and irony. That, of course, would be unremarkable in such a
close-knit family except for the fact that Indians have generally
been depicted in popular culture, and especially in movies, as
earnest and stoic, sometimes pathetic and at times bloodthirsty,
but rarely wry.
</P>
<P>
   Indians have also been pictured as living in poor, if not
squalid conditions. And in fact Adams, a Coast Salish Indian, said
that he had eaten so much salmon as a child growing up in a
subsistence economy based on fishing that he took to calling it
``Indian bologna.'' But the economic poverty has often been
interpreted as cultural impoverishment _ as an implication that
Indian culture lacks a playful or a cerebral dimension.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason the new movie in which Adams is a co-star,
``Smoke Signals,'' which opens Friday, is so distinctive. It's
funny and complex, as well as poignant, casting a new light on the
Indian sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' based on a book of short stories by Sherman
Alexie, is the first feature-length movie written, directed and
acted by American Indians. But the film, which won the award for
best drama at the Sundance festival in January and has already been
widely acclaimed by critics, is something more too: it is a step by
a new generation of Indian artists toward finding an idiom for
exploring their individual and cultural identities without
resorting to self-pity, political correctness or Hollywood cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of ``Smoke Signals,'' which documents the unexpected
ways two young men living on the Coeur d'Alene reservation in Idaho
come to terms with absent fathers, is brash and self-confident in
its self-examination. In one scene, for instance, Thomas
Builds-the-Fire (Adams) notes as he watches a western, ``The only
thing more pathetic than Indians on TV is Indians watching Indians
on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   This movie, which was directed by Chris Eyre, 28, is the work
not just of a group of creative people with full hearts but of
aggressive achievers determined to stake their claim to high ground
on the American cultural map.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of them is Alexie. A 31-year-old novelist and
poet who grew up on the Spokane reservation in Washington, he was a
producer of ``Smoke Signals'' and wrote its screenplay and is also
producing a movie adapted from his recent novel ``Indian Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that one of his primary goals was to
take away from so-called white experts the responsibility for
describing contemporary Indian culture. His aim, he said, is not to
avoid criticism of Indian society but to make sure that it is
Indians doing the criticizing and interpreting.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, an athletic-looking man with a broad smile, a long
ponytail and wire-framed glasses, is also a good example of
restless ambition _ but with a twist. He has acted in four
full-length features; he will appear in ``Indian Killer,'' and he
is completing a script for a movie in which he will also act later
this year, with Loretta Todd, a Cree from Northern Alberta,
directing.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond all that, Adams _ whose grandparents and several
aunts died of tuberculosis _ will begin medical school at the
University of Calgary this fall, to fulfill a goal of bringing
something back to his reservation, a hamlet of 650 people about 100
miles north of Vancouver amid mountains, towering cedars and rich
blue waters.
</P>
<P>
   The people involved in ``Smoke Signals'' are not, in short,
willing to passively accept conventional images of Indian life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' is a slow-moving, often wistful drama that
turns into a road movie as Thomas, a confident nerd who maintains
his people's storytelling tradition in an offbeat manner,
accompanies the angry, self-conscious Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) on
a journey to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But the story is consistently enlivened by a self-deprecating
sense of humor, one of the most enduring Indian cultural
characteristics, particularly on the reservations, according to the
makers of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' is clearly a product of a post-Wounded Knee
generation. The filmmakers paid tribute to the American Indian
Movement, saying that those angry demonstrators of the 1970s had
helped establish a contemporary tradition of Indian pride that made
a movie like ``Smoke Signals'' possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the film has a far different sensibility. The characters are
angry, but they're also silly, loving, careless, vulnerable, witty
and persistent. They play basketball. They laugh at their squalor.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the only way they can go forward is by driving a
car backward. They mock Indian stereotypes, and they embrace them.
In fact, they are much like the group of people who made the film.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Eyre, a graduate of the film school at New York University, is a
Cheyenne-Arapaho who was adopted as a baby and brought up by a
white family in Oregon. He has spent the last few years tracking
down his biological parents and embracing his Indian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' the first feature he has directed, was
integral to that process. ``In this movie, we're all searching for
home to different degrees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beach, 25, an Ojibway from north of Winnipeg, bluntly described
how much of his own personal history was reflected in that of his
character, Victor, who is haunted by the absence of a parent. He
said the defining element of his early life was the death of his
mother, who was killed by a drunken driver when he was 8; she was
eight months pregnant at the time. His father drowned two months
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living with that loss and not understanding it, you kind of
feel you're not in the right place,'' said Beach, an avid hockey
player and rock musician. ``I'm kind of looking for the right place
in this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Beach also described the making of ``Smoke Signals'' as a means
by which he could confront his own anger about the loss of his
parents. ``It was the first time in my life I was able to get that
out of myself,'' said Beach in describing the filming of the
tearful closing sequence of the movie. ``I remember I was crying on
Chris' shoulder and saying, `It still hurts.' And he'd say, `Well,
you have to go do it again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Adams, who has been almost frenetic in his
efforts both to investigate his culture through writing and acting
and to serve his people as a doctor. His parallel career paths
reflect a tension that runs through the lives of many Indians, he
said: whether to concentrate on articulating a distinct cultural
vision to the world outside the reservations or to focus on their
own people.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is still undecided on which path will win out in his case,
but he seems to be leaning in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love acting and I'm working at it, but there are only a
few times in an actor's career when he can do movies that are life
changing or magical,'' he said. ``That's not enough for me. I need
to do something that really helps my people all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' father, Les, the captain of a tugboat, said he had long
contemplated these issues. As he sat bobbing on his boat, he
explained that he knew many years ago that Evan was capable of
extraordinary accomplishments. And he said that he had sternly
instructed his son to focus his ambition on the world beyond the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   But, he admitted, Evan made it clear early on that he had his
own ideas about heritage and creativity. As a teen-ager, for
example, Evan learned and performed traditional dances that had
been little seen for years. Les Adams recalled bringing a friend,
the chief of a nearby tribe, to one of Evan's performances and
being struck to see his friend cry at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he had not seen those dances since he was a boy and
that he never expected to see them again in his life,'' said Adams.
``He was impressed that these young people wanted to bring them
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan did go away to a private high school when he was 14 and
then to McGill University in Montreal. His father said he was
crushed when Evan announced that he was leaving McGill after a
year, to pursue acting.
</P>
<P>
   Evan said that part of his struggle over the years had come from
his mixed feelings about living in a dominantly white society.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family had a very high status on the reservation,'' said
Adams, whose father was the elected chief of his tribe for a number
of years. ``I was low status in the town. It was a constant source
of irritation and humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Adams enrolled at the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver and completed his premed studies, while continuing to
write and act, doing everything from Shakespeare to a play he
wrote, ``Snapshots,'' about how two Indian families deal with
illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   He described his swings from one world to the other while
showing a reporter an extraordinary collection of totem poles,
masks and other ceremonial objects preserved in the glass and
concrete Museum of Anthropology on the University of British
Columbia campus. He insisted that he was trying to find a way of
revering the past while shaping a new kind of future that was true
to both the Indian spirit and the modern spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indian way,'' he concluded, ``is being adaptable and
flexible.''

FANS BID THE BULLS HAIL (AND FAREWELL?) 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Chicago threw a bittersweet celebration Tuesday, with
300,000 fans filling Grant Park to thank the Chicago Bulls for
winning their sixth National Basketball Association championship on
Sunday but fearing that it was a goodbye party.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls may have been the only team to hold a public victory
celebration without any player saying, ``We're going to try to do
it again next year!''
</P>
<P>
   It's been the longest-running soap opera in Chicago, with more
fighting than a Jerry Springer show. Will Michael Jordan retire?
Will Scottie Pippen go elsewhere for more money? Will Phil Jackson
coach or take a year off? Would any other team put up with Dennis
Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was tentative, chanting ``One More Year!'' and
listening for any word of encouragement. They heard none, and not
only because the sound system broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has said that he does not want to play for any coach but
Jackson, or with any sidekick but Pippen. He left the crowd in
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows if we're going to be in Grant Park next year,''
he said. ``But the one thing I do know, no matter what happens, my
heart and my soul and my love will still be in the City of
Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson said he has already cleaned out his desk (as
has the assistant coach Jimmy Rodgers, who resigned Tuesday), and
made a point of telling the crowd, ``This was our last dance; it
was a wonderful waltz.'' (This was cheered and booed.)
</P>
<P>
   He thanked Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, who fans
believe is pushing the breakup of the team, for ``giving us the
opportunity to do it.'' (This was loudly booed.) Jackson then
dropped a bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the crowd thought it heard Jackson say that Jerry
Reinsdorf, the Bulls' owner, asked him if he would stay another
year, ``and I said yes.'' (This was cheered.) In fact, Jackson was
merely describing what he told Reinsdorf last year.
</P>
<P>
   It all may depend on Pippen, one of the 50 best players in NBA
history, but 122nd this past season on the league's salary scale.
Early in the season, when he was injured, the 32-year-old forward
said he would never play again for the Bulls, then said he wouldn't
stay unless he got a long-term contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday that Pippen will be offered
a two-year contract for $35 million to $40 million, and Jordan said
Pippen ``should take it.'' To the fans, Pippen offered only this
genuine goodbye, or a bargaining position: ``Thank you for our last
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's sixth title pushed further into Chicago history the
memory of Al Capone and John Dillinger and the Cubs, who are
uncharacteristically near first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Grant Park crowd more accurately reflected the city than did
the moneyed bunch that filled the $1,500 seats for the NBA finals.
And the crowd mirrored the team, a gritty bunch with a mix of races
and cultures. The Australian, the Croatian, the Flake, His Airness.
</P>
<P>
   The fans started lining up at 3 a.m. to greet the champions.
Mayor Richard Daley sat between Jordan and Jackson on the stage,
flanked by the Luvabulls cheerleaders. Krause stayed in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the real Rodman, on stage, age 37 and still less
housebroken than Jed. He offered a profanity, then closed with
this: ``I've always told myself I would never ever get married,
right? I would never have another wife. If I had to marry anybody,
it'd be these 12 guys right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The champions repeated their annual ritual. This year's bauble
left as it arrived, strapped into the passenger seat of guard Ron
Harper's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a safe trip home, folks,'' a Chicago police officer named
Gomez told the departing crowd through a megaphone. ``See you in 30
years, when the Bulls win again.'' &QL;

U.N. AIDES REMAIN WARY ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Officials here cautioned on Tuesday that
although the chief U.N. arms inspector succeeded at the weekend in
setting a list of immediate goals for Iraq to meet before an
eight-year embargo on oil sales could be lifted, other, more
difficult, issues remained.
</P>
<P>
   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's representative at the United Nations, said
in an interview on Tuesday that the inspector, Richard Butler, had
laid out in Baghdad exactly what Iraq needed to do to come into
compliance with Security Council resolutions. Iraq welcomed the
move, Hamdoon said, and has pledged cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He provided a final list, and that's important,'' Hamdoon
said. ``And they have agreed on a time frame for the different
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats here and in the Middle East say Butler never
intended to predict that by early August Iraq would meet the
conditions for ending sanctions. The first assessment of Iraqi
compliance will be made in August, almost exactly eight years after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions are due to be reviewed in
October.
</P>
<P>
   There are now concerns among diplomats that Iraq will try to
turn any cooperation into proof that it has met all demands, as it
did when it allowed diplomats and inspectors to conduct pro forma
inspections of presidential palaces earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said that in talks with the Iraqis last weekend
Butler decided to focus over the next two months on straightforward
disarmament measures _ the handing over of weapons parts still
unaccounted for in biological, chemical and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   This would set aside for later the larger questions of
documentation involving areas of official decision-making,
especially on Iraqi concealment policies, which inspectors say were
deliberate attempts to confuse and confound their work.
</P>
<P>
   Also put aside for the moment are demands for proof that 300
tons of missile fuel has been destroyed, according to diplomats who
spoke to Reuters in Baghdad. Butler's team has said the fuel was
suitable only for Scud-type missiles. Iraq insists it has other
uses.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative at the United Nations,
and other diplomats said Tuesday that the order in which Iraq
approached its tasks did not change the reality that it had a way
to go before it could resume selling oil, and even further to go
before the broader trade embargo would be lifted completely. Iraq
will also remain under international scrutiny for an indefinite
period after sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, based on UNSCOM's last briefing with the Security
Council, Iraq has a long way to go to fully comply with the
disarmament provisions relating to chemical and biological
weapons,'' Richardson said in an interview, referring to the U.N.
Special Commission, which Butler leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqis are good at rhetoric about complying, but when it
comes to fulfilling their commitments they are always woefully
short. We don't expect the Butler road map to be met.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who is on his way to Australia from the Middle East, was
not available for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that he would submit a report on his talks in
Baghdad to the Security Council by the end of the week and that it
would outline his program of action. It is expected to detail the
timetable of action for the period before the next half-yearly
sanctions review in October.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Iraqi officials said that Butler and UNSCOM had
``finally shown flexibility,'' and they tried to turn Butler's more
conciliatory, methodical approach into progress, if not victory,
even in the most difficult area, biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed on a new approach, a practical approach, within the
context of disarmament to address the biological file,'' Tariq
Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister who negotiates with Butler,
said on Tuesday in Baghdad, where an Egyptian trade fair opened _ a
signal of Iraq's hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which when not promising compliance is denying that it has
any disarming left to do, is pressing hard for some lifting of
sanctions _ at least the bar on oil sales _ in October.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon confirmed Tuesday that his government decided last week
not to accept any more relief aid from U.S. or other foreign groups
that have been willing to defy sanctions if necessary to import
medicines and other commodities for Iraqis suffering from
sanctions. Iraq asked its friends abroad to lobby against sanctions
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Iraq's strongest supporter on the Security Council,
seemed to take a less optimistic view of the Baghdad talks. In
Moscow on Tuesday, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vladimir
Rakhmanin, told reporters that the meetings between Butler and Aziz
had been ``tense.''
</P>
<P>
   A special Russian presidential envoy for the Middle East was
sent to Baghdad this week to hold his own meetings with Iraqi
leaders. The envoy, Victor Posuvalyuk, played an important role
earlier this year in defusing a crisis that led to a U.S. war
buildup in the Persian Gulf and ultimately to the visit by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Some Security Council members are questioning whether the United
States, with a range of international crises to confront, will be
able to give much attention to Iraq if Butler runs into trouble
again with Baghdad. On May 26 the Pentagon announced that half its
forces in the gulf area would be withdrawn.

 &HT;    Two more Guatemalan bodies recovered
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The bodies of two more Guatemalan
landscape workers whose screams for help in Spanish went unheeded
Monday night by other beachgoers were recovered from the Jupiter
Inlet Tuesday by sheriff's divers.
</P>
<P>
   Another Guatemalan's body was found about 6:30 p.m. Monday night
by a fisherman just after the three non-swimmers disappeared in
swift currents at DuBois Park on the inlet's south side.
</P>
<P>
   County officials said Tuesday they believed it was the first
time three swimmers had drowned simultaneously in a county park.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County sheriff's Sgt. Jack Courtney said parkgoers
paid little attention to their plight, thinking they were engaging
in loud horseplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they spoke Spanish, no one understood they were yelling
for help,'' Courtney said. ``Some were upset they were making so
much noise.''
</P>
<P>
   The men, who lived at 1600 Center St., and are believed to be
under 30, had gone into the water off a rocky point outside of
buoys marking safe swimming areas.
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguards, who had been on duty about 200 feet away, left about
an hour before the drownings at the end of their scheduled shift
about 5:30 p.m., a county official said.
</P>
<P>
   The park is guarded by the county's beach patrol from 9 a.m. to
5:20 p.m. seven days a week from Memorial Day to Labor Day and on
weekends and holidays in the cooler season, said David Lill,
director of the county's aquatics division.
</P>
<P>
   DuBois also had the highest number of swimmer rescues in any
north county park from June through August last year because of
swift currents beyond designated swimming areas, county records
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the county would consider extending summer
lifeguard hours beyond 5:20 p.m. in light of the tragedy, Lill said
money for that isn't budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had more money, we could guard from sunrise to sunset,
but for the hours we're there, I believe we meet the needs of the
greatest amount of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DuBois, like most county parks, is closed from sunrise to sunset
by sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Det. Brian Jacques said Tuesday he is unsure of the
names of the victims and is seeking documents to prove their
identities.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Rev. Felipe Jimenez, pastor of the Iglesia
Evangelical De Sandidad in Hobe Sound, where the men attended
church, said they are David Lopez, about 30, and brothers Antonio
Guzman, 16, and Roberto Guzman, 18.
</P>
<P>
   The three were regular churchgoers who had dedicated their lives
to God, Jimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their main goal was to support their families,'' Jimenez said.
``They were sending money back to Guatemala and were working very
hard to help their parents. They eventually planned to return
home.''

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic promised
Tuesday to make a series of concessions over Kosovo to forestall
military action by the West. But he stopped short of meeting one
key demand: the withdrawal of Serbian security forces accused of
attacking ethnic Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of closed-door meetings here with President Boris
Yeltsin and other top Russian officials, the Yugoslav leader
announced his promises. They included access for relief groups and
international monitors, arrangements for refugees to return and the
resumption of talks with Kosovo's Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, who like Milosevic are eager to head off NATO
air strikes, were quick to cast his pledges as an important
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from clear, however, whether Milosevic's pledges were
merely tactical or whether he was genuinely prepared to ease the
repression in Kosovo, whose population is predominantly ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that Milosevic had only met NATO part
way. Western diplomats at NATO headquarters said the alliance was
continuing to work on military options. But the threat of military
action has, in effect, been deferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some progress,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said. But she added that that Milosevic ``did not meet the
primary points that the Contact Group raised.'' Western diplomats
at NATO headquarters said that the alliance was continuing to work
on military options. But the threat of military action has, in
effect, been deferred. The Contact Group, which monitors events in
the Balkans, includes Britain, Germany, France and Italy as well as
the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant press conference in an ornate Russian Foreign
Ministry mansion, Milosevic denied that Serbian forces had ever
harmed ethnic Albanians. ``There was no kind of ethnic cleansing,''
Milosevic said. ``In the latest actions it was declared by the
security forces there were no civilian victims at all.''
</P>
<P>
   International observers have painted a very different picture.
They say that at least 250 ethnic Albanians have been killed in the
fighting and at least 65,000 have been forced to abandon their
homes in the separatist province.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has condemned the Serbian
crackdown as ``ethnically driven violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's talks took place a day after NATO conducted air
exercises over the Balkans in an effort to pressure him to end the
crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He met with Yeltsin on Tuesday and then engaged in several hours
of talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev and other top Russian aides as the two sides sought
to cobble together a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Kosovo crisis, the Kremlin has had conflicting
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Yeltsin has an interest in maintaining good
relations with the West, especially since Moscow wants billions of
dollars in Western loans to help overcome its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian officials also acknowledge that Milosevic has gone
too far in Kosovo. Primakov, for example, went along last week with
the demand by his fellow foreign ministers in the so-called
``Contact Group'' on the Balkans who insisted that Milosevic
withdraw security forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians see solidarity with their fellow Slavs in
Yugoslavia as a useful card to play in Russian domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Russian view, Milosevic is defending an important
principle when he says he is entitled to take firm steps to insure
that Kosovo remains part of Serbia. Russia has its own regions of
ethnic tension _ like Chechnya, where it fought a two-year war
against separatists _ and is not eager to invite international
scrutiny or intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Primakov enjoys playing a pivotal role in world affairs
and is no friend of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO countries have threatened measures including military
intervention if Milosevic does not stop the Serbian offensive
against ethnic Albanians. And the newspaper Izvestiya bluntly
outlined one of the main purposes of Tuesday's meeting: ``Russia is
trying to save the Serbs from NATO bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of lengthy negotiations, Primakov claimed a major
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this opens up a real possibility to resolve the
situation,'' Primakov said at a joint news conference with
Milosevic. ``In many ways, the ball is now in the court of the
Kosovo Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials will be monitoring the situation in Kosovo for
the next several weeks to see if the Serbs keep their promises.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has, in fact, promised to take some noteworthy steps.
In the joint statement, he agreed there would be no restrictions on
the work of international organizations, such as the International
Committee of the Red Cross, or on international monitors. And he
promised to allow refugees who had fled Kosovo to return.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to continue talks with ethnic Albanians on
``forms of autonomy,'' though he spurned the idea of doing so with
the help of international mediators. Western officials are worried
that any talks will stall without international supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The Western-dominated ``Contact Group'' had demanded that
Milosevic recall intelligence and army units sent to Kosovo for the
crackdown. Security forces inside Kosovo, they insisted, should be
confined to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, Milosevic refused to take the initiative and
instead put the onus on the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``As terrorist activities subside, security forces will reduce
their presence outside the areas of their permanent deployment,''
Milosevic's joint statement with Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees crossing into Albania from Kosovo on Tuesday reported
attacks on mountain refugee camps by Yugoslav army helicopters, but
there was no independent confirmation of those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president told reporters Tuesday that his position
was intended to protect the principle of Serbian sovereignty over
the Kosovo region. He revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no reasons or grounds for the Yugoslav army not to
be on the territory of Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said. ``Any
withdrawal of units of the Yugoslav army from any part of
Yugoslavia is out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's statement also showed some of the contradictions in
the Russian stance.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who sat at Milosevic's side throughout the press
conference, joined the ``Contact Group's'' call for the withdrawal
of Serbian security forces. But the Russian foreign minister then
endorsed the far weaker measure Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seemed to enjoy his verbal jousts with the press
Tuesday. To the obvious discomfort of his Russian hosts, he
occasionally lapsed into English to respond to Western reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When Western reporters pressed Milosevic about the violence in
Kosovo, he shot back that Albanian ``terrorist groups'' had
launched reprisals against ethnic Albanians who refused to support
them.
</P>
<P>
   As Milosevic ended his remarks, Primakov cut off the session,
reminding the Yugoslav president that he was late for a visit with
the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic seemed ready for another round of sparring and
wrapped up the news conference with an invitation to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, next time, if you want longer talks, you
come to Belgrade,'' Milosevic said. ``You are invited, all of
you.''

AN ARCHITECT WITH THE SPARE, SINEWY GRACE OF AN ATHLETE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note that last week's architecture article should have
been slugged ARCHITECTURE-GLASS)  
 af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though Rafael Vinoly is the most elegant architect now
practicing in the United States, he probably doesn't want to hear
about it. The elegance of his work is ascetic as well as esthetic.
It has everything to do with integrity and nothing to do with airs.
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly's new Princeton University Stadium, now nearing
completion for an official opening in September, would make a great
location for a fashion shoot. But the fashions would have to be of
a kind worn by those who understand the beauty of service to an
ideal.
</P>
<P>
   This trim, understated building arrives at an opportune moment.
In the last decade, with places like Denver's Coors Field, the
sports stadium has emerged as America's most diseased building
type, an expression of arrested development in the innocent guise
of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly's design delivers the architectural equivalent of sports
medicine: it's not whether you win or lose, but where you play the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The new 30,000-seat football stadium replaces Princeton's Palmer
Memorial Stadium, a deteriorated campus landmark judged by
university officials to be beyond repair. The new stadium is on the
eastern edge of the campus, set on an axis with Jadwin gymnasium
(designed by Walker O. Cain), the school's main sports complex.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the stadium, the project includes a new track
field, with its own seating, situated between the stadium and the
gym. The project architect was Chen-Li Lin.
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly has conceived of the stadium as a kind of Roman aqueduct:
a tall, arched concrete structure, curved into a U-shape and lined
with seats. The aqueduct is a self-contained building. On the top
level, behind thin ribbon windows, it houses classrooms, offices, a
rehearsal hall for the marching band, rooms for social and other
functions. The ground floor will hold concessions and restrooms in
deep, recessed alcoves.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is unusual. What appears at first glance to be
cladding material _ panels of earth-colored concrete aggregate _ is
the surface of the load-bearing, structural blocks of which the
building is constructed. Besides supporting their own weight, the
hollow blocks (U-shape, like the stadium) provide bracing for the
grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   The seating is arranged on two tiers, the lower level organized
in the conventional way, in the form of a squared-off bowl. The
upper tier is more dramatic. Rather than continuous rows, the
concrete bleachers are divided into three flat, sloping,
trapezoidal slabs. These are propped up by steel, V-shape struts.
The slant and the trapezoidal shape create a forced perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The tiers are vertiginous to look at, exhilarating to sit in,
even without a game going on. The playing field is pitched below
grade, which heightens the sense of enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of seating, the corners of the U are voids _ tall,
rectangular arches that allow peripheral views of the stadium's
parklike surroundings. The tops of the arches slant inward,
creating the illusion of two-dimensional frames. Landscaping is a
prominent feature throughout the design. The park spills through
the arches into the stadium itself. Two raised plazas, set into the
corners, are planted with trees.
</P>
<P>
   Walkways, bordered on one side with sloping planting beds, pass
through the stadium, beneath the upper bleachers; these remain
accessible even when the stadium is closed. Sunlight passes through
slits between the rows of seats, casting bold stripes of brightness
and shade, though the paths may prove more popular when its
raining.
</P>
<P>
   The palette is on the raw side. The aggregate is not a pretty
color. The bleachers are bare concrete, with strips of aluminum
stretched along the seats. The bleacher stairs evoke classical
ruins. The overall image, in fact, is classical, further proof, if
more were needed, that the classical idea in architecture
gravitated long ago to structural expression and has stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly practices architecture as if it were a form of gestalt
therapy. Many architects do. The dynamic whole was the animating
principle behind Frank Lloyd Wright's gospel of organic
architecture.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Wright would feed a building's requirements into his
imagination, pull out his pencils and sketch his way toward unity
of structure, image, space, and surroundings. Vinoly's classical
symmetry is poles apart from Wright's romantic tension. But his
approach to design is organic, perhaps to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium's arches might be more impressive _ scarier _ if the
tops were straight instead of slanted, but the slant provides
structural bracing. It also enhances the views, and echoes the
slope of the bleachers. But Vinoly wouldn't slant them simply to
create a scenographic effect. At either end of the U there are two
diagonal slots, openings for the ramps that lead from the ground
level to the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Though the slots help reveal the structure, they also look
dismayingly like notches cut in a piece of cardboard with an X-acto
knife. Vinoly would rather risk such an impression than entertain
the extraneous visual gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The architect has a weakness for dull walls. The rear of his
gymnasium for Lehman College in the Bronx is as glum as the front
is radiant. The main facade of the theaters at the Tokyo Forum is
bleak. Beyond Vinoly's walls there is always something sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense the wall functions as a curtain. It's a relief that
Vinoly doesn't try to make these walls interesting. Their
uncompromising intelligence is clear enough. Yet you may find
yourself wishing that the visual matched the philosophical appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly once memorably called architecture an art of dealing with
heaviness. A stadium is an ideal place to see this idea put into
practice: the relationship between building and body is an ancient
classical theme. This is the second sports center Vinoly has built
in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The Lehman gymnasium, with its curving metal roof, which evokes
the grace of divers in its Olympic-size pools, is a ravishingly
fluid design. The Princeton Stadium is more stolid _ more
block-that-pass than jack-knife dive. Both put one in mind of
Balanchine dancers. They are thoroughbred, stripped-down, in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly's athletic spring contrasts sharply with the
ponderousness of recent stadium design. The new generation of
sports architecture started out well enough in 1992 with
Baltimore's Camden Yards, a first-rate synthesis of architecture,
planning and urban design by Hellmuth Obata &AMP; Kassabaum.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture had something valuable to say: traditional
stadiums like Wrigley Field were lean, functional pieces of
architecture, modern in everything but name. In subsequent
stadiums, designed by the same firm for Cleveland, San Antonio and
Denver, this point was lost. The retro subtext of Camden Yards took
over the field.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of locker room talk in New York right now. A new
Yankee Stadium. A rebuilt Ebbets Field for the Mets. But the
discussion has yet to engage architecture on a serious level. Let's
hope that the Yankees stay in the Bronx. But the architectural
victory goes to New Jersey for now.

SENATE OKS FEE CAPS FOR LAWYERS IN TOBACCO SUITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Tuesday narrowly approved capping
fees for plaintiff's attorneys in tobacco lawsuits, a move that
could have major financial consequences for Texas lawyers who
spearheaded a state suit against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   After two unsuccessful efforts to limit fees, the Senate voted
49-48 to cap attorneys' compensation based on a sliding scale from
$4,000 an hour to $500 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum fees would be determined by what year the attorneys
filed suit, based on the premise that those lawyers who were
involved early on took greater risks and laid the groundwork for
attorneys who filed lawsuits later.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., would
apply to attorneys involved in all pending state lawsuits and to
lawyers in states such as Texas that have reached agreements. Only
fees that have been paid to attorneys as of June 15 would be
excluded from the limitations.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, plaintiff's attorneys are scheduled to get $2.3
billion as part of the $15 billion settlement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been estimated that the five top attorneys who initially
took the Texas case on a contingency basis would receive fees
equivalent to $100,000 an hour over 25 years. Those lawyers would
have to pay as many as 100 more attorneys who worked with them on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the amendment approved by the Senate, Texas lawyers would
be limited to a maximum compensation of $2,000 an hour. The fee is
based on the fact that the Texas suit was filed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation provides that plaintiff's lawyers who
participated in suits filed before 1995 would be entitled to the
maximum of $4,000 an hour while those who filed after June 15 of
this year would get the minimum of $500.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was condemned by Richard Hailey, the president of
the Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress limits what consumer attorneys, but not corporate
lawyers, may earn, it can cap the wage of every hourly worker in
America, of every profession, every professional sports figure,
every movie star, and every corporate executive,'' Hailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush, who has
challenged the Texas lawyers' fees in court, said the provision
adopted by the Senate represented a ``a more reasonable way'' to
determine the compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the governor has not lobbied senators for
restrictions on fees.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys' fees issue was resolved as lawmakers try to
finish work on the complicated and controversial tobacco
legislation, which would raise cigarette prices and give the
federal government broad authority to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, lawmakers have added provisions that would also
tap revenue generated by tobacco price increases to pay for a tax
cut for married couples and fund anti-drug programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators are scheduled to meet Wednesday to determine
how to proceed on the bill which has badly split their caucus
between conservatives, who oppose the tobacco measure as containing
too much government intervention, and moderates, who support the
effort to crack down on teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the fee cap was clearly important to the Senate
Republican leadership, who view the limit on lawyers as necessary
to get conservative members on board.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the amendment was initially going to be
defeated by one vote. But the Senate leaders extended the time for
voting and convinced Republican Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon to
change his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Four Democrats joined 45 Republicans, including Texans Phil
Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison in voting for the fee limits.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Texas lawyers, Tom Banning, declined to
comment on the impact of the Senate action. He claimed, however
that the tobacco industry has already paid $40 million in expenses
and $50 million in fees to the plaintiff's lawyers involved in the
Texas case.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. said that it was unfair that attorneys
challenging the tobacco companies would have their fees limited
while the lawyers working for the tobacco companies would have no
limits on their remuneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our anger for lawyers is reserved only for those who sue
tobacco companies not for those who defend tobacco companies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders contended that because Congress has been asked to
regulate the tobacco industry and impose a tax on their products,
they should be able to determine how that money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can regulate everything with respect to tobacco but we dare
not touch attorneys fees. I think that is a difficult argument to
make,'' said Gorton.

FOR STEVEN SODERBERGH, IT SEEMS THE OH-SO-SERIOUS PHASE IS OVER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: La., Ga.)   (Eds., Jamie Diamond is the West Coast editor of Mademoiselle.)  
 (af)  
 By JAMIE DIAMOND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Steven Soderbergh's career looks as if it has been
happening in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, with ``Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' Soderbergh became the
youngest director to win the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.
He was 26. Rolling Stone described him as ``a cross between Steven
Spielberg and Woody Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of his astute account of ennui among young
professionals _ a first feature that turned out to be a critical
and commercial success _ he was positioned to have access to big
studios, big stars and big budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, Soderbergh decided to make bleaker films aimed at
more limited audiences. From a position of power, he made the bold
decision to work small.
</P>
<P>
   First there was ``Kafka'' (1991), starring Jeremy Irons, a
black-and-white allegory that appeared to have been shot primarily
in the bowels of a Czech insane asylum. It grossed $904,000. Then
came ``King of the Hill'' (1993), based on A.E. Hotchner's memoir
about being abandoned by his parents during the Depression. It
grossed $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   People clamored for sex or lies or videotape. And they got a
little of the first in ``Underneath'' (1994), a noir character
study that thudded soundlessly at the box office. Soderbergh's last
two movies, ``Schizopolis'' (1996) and ``Gray's Anatomy'' (1997),
had budgets of $250,000 and $350,000, respectively, and looked like
experimental first films.
</P>
<P>
   When Lady Luck smiles on a 26-year-old first-time director, she
doesn't take it kindly that he ignores her and heads out on his own
path. But now, at 35, after five well-made flops, Soderbergh has
returned to knock on her door with ``Out of Sight,'' an upbeat
romantic film starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Did
something change his mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said one afternoon recently at his production office
in Hollywood. ``I had a bad case of my 20s, of being overly
serious. And now I feel better at my job than I was.'' He paused.
``I'm so lucky. I mean I got this job on the heels of five bombs in
a row. How many people get that?''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't believe, however, that the studio in question,
Universal, simply jettisoned its business sense. ``They were tiny
bombs,'' he explained, ``so I don't think they were held against me
personally. Nobody expected them to be blockbusters and then said,
`Oh, what a disaster!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Out of Sight,'' which opens on Friday, Soderbergh is
back with something no one would have expected from him: a film
that has a good chance to appeal to public taste  &UR; and &LR;  still be
idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't have to pick one or the other,'' he contended.
``You can have a film like `Out of Sight' that operates perfectly
well on a mass-entertainment level and also has quirky, interesting
cinematic elements to engage the members of the audience who are
looking below the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney has a different interpretation. ``I think Steven's
defensive,'' he said. ``He's reluctant to be a successful director,
and that's why he stayed independent so long when studios were
trying to lure him away. There's a part of him that still wants to
be Steven Soderbergh from Baton Rouge who does what he wants and
doesn't have to answer to anybody. But it's a fear any independent
director has: that early on they're edgy but when they get fat and
happy, the edge goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it seems a big leap for a director in tune with
angst-ridden protagonists and the sensibilities of Franz Kafka to
be attracted to a people-pleaser like ``Out of Sight,'' which was
adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name. Some
observers may even think that the holdout has sold out _ an
implication that does not please Soderbergh.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume they know what it means for a director to be
true to himself, which they don't,'' he said. ``America has no
shortage of auteurs. What we have is a shortage of films being made
by really smart filmmakers that open in 4,000 theaters. I don't
understand why a filmmaker should be penalized for working in the
mainstream. Why not give the big money to the most interesting
filmmakers instead of putting them in quarantine, where, in order
for them to do something interesting, they have to do it for a
million bucks?''
</P>
<P>
   When Soderbergh speaks, his voice remains even and he makes
little effort at eye contact. He gives the impression of being able
to step barefoot on a tack but keep walking.
</P>
<P>
   On this day he was dressed not unlike a biology teacher in a
1950s high school movie: in white button-down shirt, vintage
Alpo-colored jacket, khakis, white socks and black shoes, with
rectangular, black-framed bifocals (smudged).
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven has this thing of being an invisible presence, like a
fume or a scent; his presence is that subtle,'' said Spalding Gray,
whose monologue served as the basis of ``Gray's Anatomy.'' ``It's
not that he has an emptiness; it's something else. And it's
certainly an odd personality for a director.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Soderbergh's previous films have all dealt
with emotionally frozen characters. ``I can easily put myself in
the place of a protagonist who feels somewhat mystified and at odds
with his surroundings and is having trouble bridging the gap
between himself and other people,'' he said. ``But I do have a
better understanding of myself than I used to. I feel a little
looser, and my films are a little looser.''
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh was seated in a dark room in front of a huge bank of
switches and glittering green and red lights. He and three
engineers were adjusting the sound level for gunshots and cricket
calls in a prison break scene that sets up the central relationship
in ``Out of Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after escaping, the convict Jack Foley (Clooney) runs
smack into Karen Sisco (Ms. Lopez), a federal marshal who's
pointing a gun at him. Because this is a movie, the marshal is
wearing high heels and a Chanel suit whose skirt is slit up to the
thigh, and the convict is an amiable guy who robs banks armed with
only charm and the blinding white light reflected from his perfect
teeth. The convict takes the marshal hostage, and audiences are
asked to believe that she falls in love with him _ as they are
locked together inside a car trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a preposterous start, but is it any more
preposterous than, say, a lizard eating New York?'' Clooney asked.
``That's why you need a director as dry and subtle as Steven; the
Elmore Leonard characters are broad. They're not caricatures;
they're just characters who make big choices.''
</P>
<P>
   It appealed to Soderbergh that the plot was fueled by the
pursuit of passion, by love at first sight, by the very opposite of
disconnection. ``Jack Foley is the first nondetached,
non-self-reflective protagonist in anything I've made,'' he said.
``I was ready to do a picture in which the characters acted on
their feelings instead of their thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   What made him ready was a sequence of events that started with a
loss of confidence he experienced while directing ``Underneath,''
in 1994. This was about the time that he was going through a
divorce with the actress Betsy Brantley, with whom he has a
7-year-old daughter, Sarah. It was to rekindle his enthusiasm for
directing that he moved back to the filmmaking starting line and
created the jagged ``Schizopolis,'' which several critics described
as a ``linguistic experiment,'' and the expressionistic ``Gray's
Anatomy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to reaffirm my status as an amateur and recapture
some of the excitement amateurs have,'' he said. ``I had to
reinvigorate myself. And had I not made `Schizopolis' and `Gray,' I
could not have made `Out of Sight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Reinvigorated or not, Soderbergh was silent for more than a
moment after he was asked how close he felt to his new up-tempo
movie. ``It's hard to decide if I feel close to it because it has
significant meaning for me or because I had a good time making
it,'' he said. ``But if you sat me down and put all my other films
in front of me, I'd rather not visit that world now. This one is
more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his air of self-possession, it's hard to picture
Soderbergh having fun, and he admits that he has always been
taciturn. He was born in Georgia, the second of six children, and
his family moved around quite a bit until settling in Baton Rouge,
La.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the earliest time I can remember, I felt separate,'' he
said. ``My oldest brother is mentally retarded and at the age of 3
went to live in a special home. In the early '60s, in the South, it
was not a pretty proposition to have to institutionalize a child.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, who was interested in the occult and paranormal,
interpreted dreams on the air for a local radio station. His father
was a professor of education at Louisiana State University, and
Steven got into a filmmaking class there when he was still in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   He skipped college and started making short films. After
directing a concert film for the rock group Yes, he wrote the
screenplay for ``Sex, Lies and Videotape'' and managed to get it
made. It was screened at what is now the Sundance Film Festival,
and helped put Park City, Utah, on the cultural map.

   ``I got my father's focus,'' Soderbergh said, ``but I got my
mother's disregard for convention, the ability to say, `I don't
care what this looks like; this is what I'm doing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What Soderbergh is doing with ``Out of Sight,'' clearly, is
moving in a more conventional, commercial direction. And while he
is certainly not repudiating his career up to this point, he is
re-evaluating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to come to terms with what kind of filmmaker
you think you are,'' he said. ``As much as I'd like to imagine
myself to be a kind of Fellini _ a real artist of real magnitude
who has a world view that is gloriously specific _ that is not who
I am. What I am is someone who has a take on things that is skewed
enough from the norm to be able to give a movie like `Out of Sight'
an interesting feel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he added, ``I've never made a movie and known when
it was coming out before. That's a great feeling.''

COMMENTARY: MONICA AND ME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Never mind Steven Brill.
</P>
<P>
   This is really hot.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of my cat fight with Monica.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dark and stormy Monday night. I was sitting at my desk,
trying to do three months' worth of travel expenses so that
American Express would stop using those tiresome words
``declined,'' ``denied'' and ``not a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang. It was my friend Duffy from Time. He offered to
whisk me off to the Bombay Club, an Indian restaurant across the
street, where I could revive my spirits with a little vindaloo.
</P>
<P>
   I was coming back from the ladies' room when I saw her. She
looked demure. Oval wire-rimmed glasses. A sky-blue jacket buttoned
over a long black and white flowered skirt. The strong jaw line and
wide smile turning down at the edges were familiar.
</P>
<P>
   I am, after all, a trained observer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That girl looks a little like Monica,'' I told Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Monica, stupid,'' he replied. ``See, she's with her
father and stepmother and her mother and her mother's fiance.''
</P>
<P>
   What cheek! Monica Lewinsky had come to Chelsea Clinton's
favorite restaurant, right across the park from the White House,
the one where Chelsea celebrated her 17th birthday with her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to see that, with Ginsburg gone, Monica was eating
less red meat _ veggie appetizers and chicken tandoori. And yet,
her presence at the Bombay Club suggested the former intern was
still trying to grab the president's attention, like some
love-struck teen-ager, loitering outside Billy Clinton's biology
class.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, what was that Vanity Fair photo spread about, if not
casting a come-hither look at the president?
</P>
<P>
   In person, Ms. Lewinsky did not come across as a vulnerable
victim or dizzy Valley Girl. She was sipping a Cosmopolitan and
striding around with blazing confidence. You could see how, with a
pizza or Starbucks latte as a prop, she could easily talk her way
into any office, even an Oval one.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she bounded over to the piano player to request a
song. On the way back, she stopped to say hello to Duffy, whom she
had previously met. She said she had taken ``the magic carpet'' out
of the Watergate, to have an evening out. He introduced us. Her
smile went cold.
</P>
<P>
   She leaned over, bracing her hands on her knees, so that our
eyes were level. She was In My Face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mind if I ask you something?'' she said, poised and
icy. ``Why do you write such scathing articles about me?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the three years I've had this column, which occasionally
requires me to be a teensy-weensy bit critical, I've always been
afraid someone I've written about would throw a drink in my face or
otherwise upbraid me in public. But so far nobody had. Suddenly, I
experience deep impact, and it's Monica!
</P>
<P>
   I didn't reply at first. My brain was fogged with chilling
images of Monica and me wrestling on the floor, like that scene in
``Dynasty'' when Joan Collins and Linda Evans pull each other's
hair in the pool at the Four Seasons restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I was distracted by Monica's song request, which the
piano man was now playing: ``Send in the Clowns.'' ``Isn't it rich,
are we a pair? Me here at last on the ground, You in midair?''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to pull myself together and come up with a trenchant
answer. She was still crouched, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   I might have told her what my mother had told me when I was
about her age: Stay away from married men; they're long-tailed
rats.
</P>
<P>
   I might have told her that posing with fuchsia feathers and an
American flag was not a smart move for a young woman in the middle
of a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   I might have told her that I felt sorry for her, that I reserved
my most scathing commentary for the president, who never should
have fooled with an impressionable intern. And for Ginsburg, who
bollixed up her case and then allowed her to be exploited in Vanity
Fair so he could al around with celebrity photographer Herb Ritts.
And for her father, who should be angry at Bill Clinton and William
Ginsburg, not Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But I wimped out. ``I don't know,'' I shrugged, lamely. She
sashayed away, looking triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   Hell hath no fury ... oh, never mind.

HYUNDAI FOUNDER PRODS NORTH KOREAN DETENTE WITH GIFT OF COWS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In an exercise that the U.S. military patroling between
North and South Korea dubbed ``Operation Rawhide,'' the founder of
the giant Hyundai conglomerate drove 500 cows across the border to
the North on Tuesday in an effort to aid reconciliation on the
divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Ju-yung, the 83-year-old founder of Hyundai, which makes
everything from cars to semiconductors, passed through Panmunjom at
10 a.m., leading a convoy of 50 trucks filled with cattle from his
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle will be hooked up to plows and used to work farmland
in North Korea, which has been suffering from food shortages that
are aggravated by its political isolation. Chung will stay in the
North eight days, visiting his hometown of Tongchon in Kangwon
Province and trying to do a little business, according to Kim
Sangnyun, a spokesman for Chung. He was accompanied by three
brothers, two sons, and Hyundai officials and others who entered
North Korea via Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the border he announced that this visit won't just be a
visit to his birthplace,'' Chung's spokesman said. ``He wants this
visit to be a kind of cornerstone leading to North-South
reunification and to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   North and South Korea have been bitter enemies for half a
century, but the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, has
increasingly been advocating a more pragmatic approach to the
North, where the United States largely prohibits American companies
from doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has said that greater political and economic engagement is
the best way of softening the North's hardline Stalinist stance,
and he has unofficially designated South Korea's business leaders
as ambassadors to the North.
</P>
<P>
   Chung has apparently taken that directive to heart. While his
visit is primarily humanitarian, the spokesman said Chung also
plans to discuss with North Korean officials the potential for
developing a resort that would cater to South Koreans visiting
relatives there.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, North Korea ran a trade surplus with South Korea,
which is its third-largest trading partner after China and Japan.
But the South Korean economic crisis has put a big dent in Seoul's
demand for gold, zinc and other metals that accounted for 50
percent of its imports from the North in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is apparently in no rush to restore South Korean
demand for its products. Much of the demand comes in the form of
``processing on commission'' trade, under which South Korea ships
pieces to North Korea where they are assembled and exported back to
the South.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea charges South Korea dollars for that kind of
production, and although the Korean won has plunged against the
dollar, the North has not adjusted its dollar prices. ``The
conclusion I draw from that is that North Korea is not really
interested in big South Korean investments,'' a Western diplomat
said on Tuesday. ``What they want is U.S. investment.''
</P>
<P>
   American companies are largely prohibited from doing any
business in North Korea by the Trading With the Enemy Act, although
some humanitarian aid has been permitted. On a visit to Washington
this month, Kim urged the United States and other Western countries
to drop such barriers to trade with and investment in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's efforts to thaw the deep freeze between North and South
Korea did not start with cows. He previously shipped 10,000 tons of
corn across the border and plans to send another 40,000 tons over
the next several months. Chung chose to make a dramatic gesture
with cattle because he has fond memories of selling one of his
father's cows to get the money that ultimately led to his success
as a businessman, the spokesman said. ``He has always been thinking
that he owes something to the cows,'' the spokesman said.

 WASHINGTON: the leaks. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brill's article has prompted a buzz in Washington, in part
because it also raised serious questions about the methods and
integrity of many in the city's press corps, an institution as
important to the nation's capital as legislators, bureaucrats and
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Brill said on Tuesday that what is being lost in the emphasis on
whether Starr had improper contact with reporters is how reporters
treated information allegedly provided by Starr in the first few
weeks after the Lewinsky story broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors will always leak,'' rill said in an interview.
``There are always going to be leakers. The question is what do
guys like you and me do about them. Do we just take stenography or
do we go and check them out?''
</P>
<P>
   But while Brill questioned the professionalism of some in the
Washington press corps, and the accuracy of some of their stories
in the early days of the Lewinsky coverage, several reporters have
said he mischaracterized comments they made to him. In the last two
days, the affirmation ``We stand by our story,'' has been heard all
over town.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Brill's article chastised Jackie Judd, an ABC
reporter, for saying on air that eye witnesses had apparently seen
the president and Ms. Lewinsky in a compromising position. So far,
no such witnesses have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ms. Judd disputed Brill's version of how she handled
that story. ``He mischaracterized my point of view on this story,''
Ms. Judd said. ``In my conversations with him, I told him that ABC
has not had to retract any report we put on the air, including the
eye witness story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brill-Starr dispute has, in fact, laid bare some potentially
embarrassing aspects of the hotly competitive contest for
information. In making his case that Time Magazine could not have
been the recipient of leaks from his office, Starr, in his reply to
Brill, quotes from a letter written to Jackie Bennett, his
principal deputy, by Michael Weisskopf, a Time Magazine
correspondent. Weisskopf is seeking to ``open lines of
communication'' with the prosecutor's office in order to establish
an ``off the record relationship,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, we went pretty far to cast doubt on the charges of
Starr leaks,'' Weisskopf wrote, in what appears to be an effort to
get in Bennett's good graces.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Duffy, Time's Washington bureau chief, confirmed the
accuracy of the letter, but declined to discuss it further.  &QL;

BENEATH THE SURFACE CALM, CONCERNS ABOUT HONG KONG PERSIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite its smooth reversion to Chinese rule, some worrisome
political and social undercurrents are rippling Hong Kong's surface
calm, analysts and politicians said Tuesday on the second and final
day of a Seattle conference looking at the transition.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of generally optimistic assessments on Monday of
the former British colony's first year under Beijing's control,
speakers at the ``Hong Kong One Year After Transition'' conference
yesterday expressed several concerns over the future, many of them
political.
</P>
<P>
   They cited:
</P>
<P>
   _An electoral system aimed at ``containing'' democracy and
promoting ``rule by tycoon.''
</P>
<P>
   _Moves toward a Singapore-style authoritarian system that
provides for economic liberty while curtailing some freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   _A reluctance by the Hong Kong government to take steps toward a
constitutional convention and universal sufferage;
</P>
<P>
   _Increasing polarization between big business and the rest of
Hong Kong's 6.4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davis, a constitution expert and law professor at the
Chinese University of Hong Kong, said business in the territory has
fared much better than in most of the rest of Asia during the
financial crisis that has swept the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the political side has not done as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the handover, on a superficial level, things have not
changed,'' Davis said. ``Political demonstrations still occur, the
press still operates freely and elections are held. But this is a
sameness with a difference. One democrat likens the situation to a
war, where one side (China) has seized the high ground but not yet
fired a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that promised
Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under the one country, two
systems concept was based on the political separation of capitalist
Hong Kong and the socialist mainland. But that basic ideological
division _ capitalism vs. communism _ is no longer so distinct, he
said, because of the sweeping, market-oriented economic reforms
that have transformed China. Today, the difference is primarily
between a politically authoritarian mainland and a Hong Kong that
has been promised liberal democracy and the rule of law. The
result, he said, is a framework ``loaded with tension.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy in Hong Kong is viewed as a worrisome threat to the
authoritarian center and much of China's Hong Kong policy aims at
its containment,'' Davis said in a paper prepared for the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Basic Law now governing Hong Kong provides an
elaborate electoral formula that basically gives the government
two-thirds of the legislative seats and could keep the opposition
in the minority indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese fear of democracy in Hong Kong has become
paramount,'' Davis said. ``This is evident in a wide range of
policies, including, for example ... the promotion of rule by
tycoon; the watering down of democracy, making it impossible for
democrats to win; the promotion of national security concerns in
post-handover laws on public order and ... attacks on human rights
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's pro-business leadership has shown some affinity for
certain aspects of Singapore's authoritarian model, Davis said. The
support of big business is evident in a range of Hong Kong's
post-handover policies, including the scuttling of proposed labor
laws and proposals to import workers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that heavily pro-business forces ... will ride
roughshod over other political, social and economic concerns,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said attempts to characterize Hong Kong's opposition
democrats as radicals are unfair. The outspokeness of the democrats
``is a product of a system designed to keep them a minority and,
quite frankly, I'm concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By passing laws and creating a system where the democrats have
no chance of succeeding, the people in power are being
confrontational and I think it is unnecessary. I don't see any
radicals in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shared by Christine Loh, the 42-year-old
chairwoman of the Citizens Party, considered one of the democratic
parties within the Legislative Council. Loh was re-elected to the
legislature in May 24 elections that saw democrats take 18 of 20
seats up for direct election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hong Kong, the democratic camp is about as responsible as
they come,'' Loh said. ``We are mild. We are moderate. We don't
have revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the business and professional elite in Hong Kong enjoy
an undue advantage under the current electoral system and
challenged them to show their support for democracy by running for
direct election.
</P>
<P>
   Loh also urged Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa to begin
preparations for a constitutional convention that will determine
the region's political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I don't see any enthusiasm yet in that
direction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But another politician, pro-Beijing legislator Yok Sing Tsang,
said the current electoral timetable allowing for consideration of
universal sufferage in 2007 was the most prudent approach in a city
that prizes stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should look at the decisions we have made, but we should
not rush to change the timetable,'' declared Tsang. He said elected
executive and legislative branches could bring to an end some of
the advantages of living and doing business in Hong Kong, including
small government and low taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take some time to work out the right chemistry
between the executive and the legislature,'' Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
   Eden Woon, director of The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce
and former head of the Seattle-based Washington State China
Relations Council, said the economic uncertainties facing the
territory and the increasingly vocal political debate threatens to
lead to further polarization between big business and the rest of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   Woon said there are increasing signs of resentment toward
successful business people, who are often categorized as being
pro-Beijing and insensitive to the concerns of the common person.

FRANCE'S SOCIALIST PRIME MINISTER SHARES HIS PRAGMATISM
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ ``When the French want to change policy, they will turn
to you,'' President Francois Mitterrand told Lionel Jospin, his
fellow Socialist and longtime party aide, in 1995 after Jospin
unsuccessfully sought the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   French voters elected Jospin prime minister a year ago, throwing
out a conservative government that had tried to slim down generous
French welfare benefits that were driving up deficits.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, not only his compatriots but also officials of
the United States have come to see Jospin as pursuing many of the
same policies as his conservative predecessor, only more
effectively. Jospin begins his first official trip to the United
States on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest success was meeting the deficit-reduction
requirements for France to join the euro, the common currency that
starts on Jan. 1, a target the conservatives said would require
unpopular austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' candor brought them defeat at the polls when
Jacques Chirac, who defeated Jospin for the presidency, called a
surprise election last spring. Jospin, who had promised to make
jobs his main priority, then had a stroke of luck when the French
economy started a powerful recovery. That brought in extra tax
revenues and enabled France to squeak in under the budget-deficit
limits without further big budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's popularity rating has dipped below 50 percent only once
since his election.
</P>
<P>
   His handling of an embarrassing strike by pilots of the
state-owned airline, Air France, this month has brought grudging
expressions of respect even from conservatives. The pilots agreed
last week to a seven-year salary freeze and voluntary pay cuts in
exchange for stock options after Air France is partly privatized
later this year. These were basically the terms offered at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador, Felix Rohatyn, observed the other day that
this episode was one of many that indicated Jospin was less a
leftist than a pragmatist who was quietly adapting France's
state-dominated economy to the demands of global competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has seemed to me to be quite pragmatic about
starting restructuring of defense industries and of the Airbus
consortium, and about going ahead with privatization of France
Telecom and Thomson,'' he said. He was referring to Jospin's
decisions to open the French telecommunications market to private
investment; reorganize Airbus, a civilian airliner company, and
regroup state-dominated military electronics industries like
Thomson-CSF with private investments as well. All these policies
began under the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The combative Jospin, who turns 61 next month, tells people that
his responsibility is to govern France as effectively as possible
during his time as prime minister. But many say he will make
another run for the presidency at the end of Chirac's first term,
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   On the fundamental issues of European policy and relations with
the United States, even Rohatyn says: ``Franco-American relations
are driven by interests and by philosophy. I haven't seen any real
difference between the presidency and the prime minister's office
on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest French-American difference at the moment is in
unemployment. French joblessness has started to fall from
near-record levels of the past several years but is still near 12
percent, three times that in the United States. And Chirac and
Jospin have both resisted suggestions by American policymakers that
reducing the French welfare state's heavy payroll taxes might
encourage employers to do more hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin has admitted that he and his Socialists underestimated
the job-creating potential of the less encumbered U.S. economy, and
might have lessons to learn.
</P>
<P>
   As for private versus public ownership of French companies, he
says that how a company contributes to overall prosperity and
employment is of more interest than who owns it.
</P>
<P>
   But friends say Jospin remains faithful to his lifelong
Socialist upbringing in one respect: he prefers the phrase ``market
economy'' to ``capitalism.''

 Webcams Turn the Internet Into One Big `Truman Show'   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The woman who broadcast her birth over the Internet yesterday isn't
alone in letting strangers peek into life's private moments.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of people the world over have set up ``Webcams,''
small cameras that broadcast digital snapshots or video over the
Web. In essence, they act like electronic eyes, letting anyone on
the Internet peer into homes and offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, 20 or 30 people submit new Webcam sites,'' said
Thomas Rene, an Albuquerque man who keeps an online list at
 &LR; www.rt66.com/ozone/ &LR;   &LR; cam.htm. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most Webcams overlook bridges or highways. But the most
intriguing sites are those that invite Web surfers to spy on their
creators.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a different twist on Jim Carrey's role in ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the voyeur's paradise come to life,'' said Ken Showalter
of Alexandria, Va., who maintains another Webcam list
( &LR; www.whatsonthe.net/webcamks.htm) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Apple software engineer John Kullmann  &LR; (www.mae.apple.com/jk) &LR; 
perched a Webcam in his Cupertino office three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I know someone is looking is when the flash on
the camera goes off,'' Kullmann said. ``I get no warning. If I
happen to be picking my nose, they catch me.''
</P>
<P>
   And just what thrill does Kullmann get out of the 76,000
anonymous visitors that have flashed into his office so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of taking a picture and spying on people is
something that appeals to the general public,'' he said. ``I get a
sort of pleasure out of catering to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Office Webcams are comparatively tame, but if you hunt around
the lists long enough, you're bound to point and click to one of
the racy sites, where cameras in bathrooms or bedrooms yield the
odd glimpse of someone in the raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have an exhibitionist side,'' said Howard Besser,
a professor at the University of California at Berkeley's School of
Information Management and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us manifest this in low-tech ways. Perhaps we're good at
telling jokes or stories, or we move well on the dance floor or on
skis. Putting up a Webcam is just a high-tech way of getting people
to pay attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's society, the media seem to say the only people who
matter are the ones who appear on TV or movies,'' Besser said.
``Normal people are separate from that. Maybe by letting others
look at them or parts of their life, they feel like they've had
some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Hardly Trumanesque: &LR;  Andrew Jones was annoyed when he got two
unsolicited e-mails from ``Sylvia'' at the ``Truman Liberation
Front.'' The spams directed him to a Web site
 &LR; (www.freetruman.com) &LR;  that seemed to take a political stand
against OmniCam, the fictional company that made a TV show out of
the life of Jim Carrey's Truman Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is the Web master at Humboldt State University in
Arcata (Humboldt County), checked to see who owned the Free Truman
online address. When he discovered that it belonged to Paramount
Pictures, which produced ``The Truman Show,'' he became irate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw `Truman' and enjoyed it,'' Jones said. ``But I take
issue with the fact that a major motion picture studio apparently
used spam to promote the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount officials did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Worrywarts? &LR;  While making small talk at a reception, I ran
into Lee Hamilton, worldwide risk manager for Bay Networks, which
telecom titan Nortel acquired on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Her title intrigued me, and in response to some ribbing,
Hamilton explained that she and fellow risk managers worry about
everything from lawsuits to the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But that's not all they do. ``We're supposed to take care of
it, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The risk managers at 50 Silicon Valley firms get together on a
regular basis to share their professional concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be known as the person who worries about
everything,'' said Leanne Johnson of 3Com Corp., who heads the
local risk manager's association.
</P>
<P>
   But she admitted, ``It's not easy for me to say in one word what
I do at a cocktail party.''
</P>
<P>
   Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by
phone (650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail (abate(at

 Breathing In Insulin Works as Well as Shots, Study Says   By Carl T. Hall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Inhaling a powdered form of insulin appears to work as well as
standard injections in controlling diabetes, a study revealed
yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inhale Therapeutic Systems, a San Carlos-based drug delivery
company, reported the results of the first major clinical trials of
lung-delivered insulin during the annual meeting of the American
Diabetes Association in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of mid-stage, or Phase II, studies tracked 121 patients
with both major forms of diabetes _ juvenile- and adult-onset _ for
three months. Half used standard injections, half the new aerosol
delivery method.
</P>
<P>
   The new insulin-delivery system is designed to disperse a cloud
of fine-powdered insulin into a clear chamber. The drug is given at
the start of a slow, deep inhalation in order to ensure the insulin
reaches the deep lung, where it's quickly absorbed into the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Blood-sugar control for those using the inhaled delivery method
was comparable to that with injections for both forms of the
disease, researchers said. Follow-up studies extending as long as
18 months showed no sign of lung impairment or other safety
problems, they added.
</P>
<P>
   The results pave the way for a much larger clinical study,
expected to track about 1,000 patients for six months or more. That
study is planned to begin late this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the pivotal results are as favorable as those reported
yesterday, the new system could be before the Food and Drug
Administration by 2000 and ready for commercial launch by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Inhale Therapeutic stock rose $1, or 3.7 percent, on the news to
close at $27.75 yesterday. Shares in drugmaker Pfizer Inc., the
biotech company's New York-based marketing partner, rose $1.75, or
1.6 percent, to close at $109.75.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chess, chief executive of Inhale, noted that patients
much preferred the lung-delivered insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Even among study participants with lifelong experience with
insulin injections, the vast majority _ 80 percent _ asked to
continue using the aerosol system after the clinical trial ended.
About 92 percent of the adult-onset cases prefered the new method.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not prove that injections can be eliminated
altogether. Patients given the aerosol system continued to take a
slow-acting form of insulin by injection before bedtime. ``Our
focus was on the rapid-acting, regular insulin because a lot more
people need that,'' said Ajit Gill, chief operating officer at
Inhale Therapeutic.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics might also continue to endure frequent finger-stick
blood draws in order to gauge how much insulin to take, although
less-invasive methods are being developed.
</P>
<P>
   About 3.5 million people in the United States now take regular
insulin injections out of about 16 million total cases of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said there's a potentially huge market for a
convenient lung-delivered system that proves safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inhaled insulin could be used in the great majority of
patients,'' said Peter Ginsberg at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis,
who estimates sales along the order of $500 million to $1 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of insulin and syringes for diabetes run about $3 billion
a year worldwide. The market for all the so-called macromolecule
drugs _ including hormones like insulin and other proteins that
generally cannot be given in pill form _ totals about $10 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides insulin, Inhale has lung-delivery systems for five other
drugs in the clinical stage of development.

`BOB AND MARGARET': A BRITISH ANIMATED SHOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob and Margaret are mildly pathetic. Bob whines about his
dentistry career. (``Hardly anyone flosses any more,'' he says.
``What's the point?'') Margaret, a podiatrist with horizontal hair,
can't feed the dogs without throwing out her back.
</P>
<P>
   And Bob never knows when to shut up. Like the time he wandered
through the house without his pants on, rattling on about whether
it was too late to have children and declaring ``All our friends
are boring.'' (Unfortunately all their friends were hiding behind
the living room furniture at the time, poised to leap out and shout
``Surprise!'' for Bob's 40th birthday.)
</P>
<P>
   And somebody thought Americans couldn't identify with these
people?
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at 10:30, ``Bob and Margaret,'' an animated series
about a British couple, created by a Canadian husband and a British
wife, will have its premiere on Comedy Central. And although
producers urged the creators to have Bob and Margaret move to the
United States or at least take up with some American friends, the
couple, their social circle, and the show remain firmly rooted in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in London, and we wanted to use stories from our
personal experience,'' said David Fine, 37, who is from Toronto.
``And we wanted to be true to the short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and Margaret'' began as a 12-minute film made by Fine and
his wife, Alison Snowden, 40, who grew up in Nottingham, England.
When the film won the Oscar for best animated short in 1995,
television producers from England, Canada and the United States
approached the couple with proposals to turn the offbeat characters
into a series.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, ``Bob and Margaret'' is multinational: a
co-presentation of Comedy Central, England's Channel 4, and a
Canadian company, Nelvana. The series will have its Canadian and
British television premieres in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that in the premillennial global village, a
middle-aged urban professional couple is a middle-aged urban
professional couple, no matter where they live. But Ms. Snowden
believes Bob and Margaret are British in some specific ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't express themselves so well,'' she says. ``And
they're not in complete control of their lives. An American couple
might be slightly more assertive.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Still it's hard not to feel a certain kinship with a married
couple who, virtually forced to take up a fitness program, choose
doubles badminton. Margaret is furious when Bob tells a visiting
chiropractor how slothful she is. ``You're just as lazy as I am,''
she reminds her husband later in the privacy of their kitchen.
``That's what attracted us to each other in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   British or not, the couple is being called Seinfeldian by some.
Maybe that's because they don't always seem like such nice people.
When Bob and Margaret's house is burgled and it's time to fill out
the insurance forms, they enthusiastically list elaborate
electronics they never owned.
</P>
<P>
   And when sitting at the hospital bedside of a comatose
acquaintance, Bob doesn't hesitate to dig into the patient's dinner
tray. Well, he rationalizes, the patient isn't going to be eating
it while he's in a coma, is he?
</P>
<P>
   This strikes Bob as a good time to discuss the patient's
girlfriend. ``She can never keep a boyfriend for more than two
weeks,'' he says. ``And have you noticed? They're always such
wimps.'' Naturally the patient wakes up while Bob is talking. And
Bob and Margaret are at the hospital only because they couldn't
think of a polite way to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central has high hopes for this imperfect couple and has
scheduled them right after ``Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist,''
another animated series about adults with problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks ahead, viewers will enter a world in which everyone
has a discolored nose the size of a guava. (Ms. Snowden insists the
characters' noses are ``peachy pink,'' but they're definitely
several shades off the overall skin tone.)
</P>
<P>
   The world is also inhabited by William and Elizabeth, Bob and
Margaret's peculiarly synchronized dogs who exhibit lots of manic
energy and some oddly human arm movements. In the first episode,
Bob will go through a business crisis when a charming, handsome
young dental surgeon with a fresh Cambridge degree sets up a
practice across the street and begins stealing all of Bob's
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, say the creators, viewers will come to
understand what impressively dull people Bob and Margaret are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that they live in one of the most exciting
cities in the world,'' says Fine, and Ms. Snowden finishes his
sentence: ``They can't think of anything to do.''

 Spending Plenty of Green at U.S. Open   By Jon Swartz and Kenneth Howe  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 Somewhere Near the 16th Fairway of the Olympic Club  
 
Phil Ressler is about to make the most important pitch of his life
here at the U.S. Open golf tournament. But it's not a golf shot
he's lining up, it's a business deal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mere 7-iron from where Tiger Woods will tee up tomorrow,
scores of companies are shelling out millions of dollars for
hospitality tents. Within these green-and-white-striped pavilions,
they will woo clients at one of the world's most prestigious golf
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of corporations _ ranging from BankAmerica, Transamerica,
Pacific Bell and NationsBank to Callidus Software, PeopleSoft and
Hartmann Studios _ have plopped down more than $120,000 each for
the rights to host elaborate soirees at the week-long event.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 152 companies are spending an estimated $11 million just
to rent space at the Open _ and that doesn't include food and
alcohol. Tent-rent fees all go to the United States Golf
Association, which puts on the event.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have arrayed themselves within four fenced and
closely guarded tent villages, each covering several acres.
</P>
<P>
   Inside air-conditioned, carpeted 40-foot-by-40-foot tents,
company executives booze and schmooze important customers with
catered meals, alcohol and all the comforts of home.
</P>
<P>
   And what parties they are _ in some cases, waiters in tuxes
serve five-course French dinners in settings that could double for
four-star restaurants. The goal: scoring lucrative business deals
and rewarding overachieving employees. It's also a great excuse to
watch golfing icons Woods, Davis Love III and Ernie Els compete in
a major tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good opportunity to keep customers happy and foster
deals,'' Carolyn Flinchum, a spokeswoman for NationsBank, whose
spellbinding tent could pass for a small-scale version of the
Fairmont Hotel's Tonga Room. The South Pacific decor is festooned
with exotic palm plants, thatched roof, wicker chairs and a
Polynesian-style bar.
</P>
<P>
   Ressler, the senior vice president of marketing for Callidus,
said his company is spending more than $160,000 during the week of
golf to bring his San Jose start-up software company to the
attention of Fortune 1000 executives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``This is a marketing play for us,'' said Ressler, whose
company sells a half-million-dollar computer system to help
companies track sales and bonus incentive plans. ``I need to reach
an audience of executives and the best way to get them is at an
event like golf that interests them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ressler said he could have launched his marketing campaign at
New York's PC Expo this week at a cost of about $80,000. ``Trouble
is that everybody else in the corporate software business is there
too,'' he said. Getting a busy chief financial officer to sit down
in a cramped booth for an hour's pitch would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But for golf-loving executives, the U.S. Open, whose tickets are
hard to come by, is an irresistible lure. Many are willing to spend
60 minutes or so in Ressler's tent when they know they can spend
the rest of the day following their favorite golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Ressler said the 50 admission tickets a day that came with his
tent are virtually all spoken for, meaning that he has booked as
many prospective customers as guests as he can.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan bought a half of a tent for $65,000 for the week and
is splitting the cost among four divisions in the company, said
spokeswoman Melissa Freidman, who sat behind the white picket fence
that surrounded the tent's entryway.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had invited Johnny Miller, the golfer and broadcaster,
to speak to a crowd of favored customers yesterday evening. Other
units of J.P. Morgan were using their tickets to reward
high-performance employees.
</P>
<P>
   The tents for each company range from the plush to the opulent.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica's luxurious digs are &UR;  &LR; modeled after the TV series
``Cheers.'' A dartboard, framed sports photos on wood-paneled
walls, a popcorn machine and plenty of good grubb ``make people
feel cozy,'' says Connie Colladay, vice president and general
manager of BofA's client marketing. Tomorrow afternoon, Masters
champion Mark O'Meara is scheduled to speak to a select group of
VIP customers.
</P>
<P>
   Golf has been an important part of Transamerica's marketing mix
for at least 10 years, spokesman Bill McClave said. In addition to
renting a hospitality suite at the Olympic Club, the venerable
insurance company is one of this year's U.S. Open sponsors and puts
on a senior golf tournament in Napa in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many executives get quality face time with clients in a
setting like this,'' BankAmerica's Colladay said. ``They normally
enjoy playing the sport and building relationships on a golf
course. So why not extend that relationship at a prestigious event
like the U.S. Open?''
</P>
<P>
   For more than $120,000 a company can &UR;  &LR; get a pavilion tent for a
week, more than 100 tickets for the U.S. Open, at least 40 parking
passes, a telephone, a computerized scoring system, a 32-inch color
TV with cable, a kitchen in the back, a storage locker and
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only a portion of the tab. Companies fork over more
for catered food and drinks or interior decorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Super Bowl. Everyone wants something different,
something special,'' said Susan Lacz Gersten, partner of
Ridgewells, the Washington, D.C., catering service that has worked
exclusively with the U.S. Open since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgewells offers companies a menu of more than 100 selections.
</P>
<P>
   The choices run the gamut from the 49er breakfast grinder
(``fluffy scrambled eggs topped with smoked ham slices, shredded
pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and peppers tucked into a
sourdough pocket''), which costs $7.50 per person, to a $110 French
feast of beef cho cho, roasted loin of veal with shitake mushroom
sauce and a chocolate logo box with chocolate bourbon mint.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, silverware costs $750 a day to rent.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, Ridgewells will feed 55,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The high-rent district is Olympic Village, perched atop a hill
overlooking the entire course at $135,000 per tent. Its dozen or so
corporate tenants include Pacific Bell, BankAmerica and
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Lakeside Village, nestled behind the 16th hole, is a tad more
egalitarian _ or as egalitarian as one can get for $120,000. The
sprawling 40-company compound is populated with the likes of
NationsBank, Compaq Computer, Cisco Systems and Goldman Sachs. An
extension of the village, called Winged O, was hastily created to
handle more companies that wanted tents.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rest rooms are elegant. Spectators who trod the
fairways of the U.S. Open will have to make do with Porta-Potties.
</P>
<P>
   But guests of the hospitality tents enter large portable
air-conditioned restrooms where the atmosphere is enhanced by
recorded music and prints of impressionist paintings hung about the
walls. Running water flows into brass sinks, where at the touch of
a dispenser, mouthwash, body lotion and aloe vera gel is available.
The latter presumably for those who have seen a touch more sun than
is good for them. An electric shoe polisher stands by the door.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between a dirt parking lot and a grove of trees is
the bargain basement Champions Pavilion, where some 80 companies,
such as KCBS radio, Electronics Arts and Miller Brewing have taken
up residence. For $27,500, a firm can get a table in a festive big
top with unlimited food and drink. There's even a life-sized cable
car and faux street signs labeled ``Nob Hill'' and ``Chinatown.''

COMMENTARY: ALL BRILL ALL THE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the wonderful word ``oleaginous'' didn't exist, someone would
have to invent it to describe Rahm Emanuel, the White House spin
artist who has set the Washington news agenda for this entire week.
</P>
<P>
   It was Emanuel, with downcast eyes and a noble tremor in his
voice, who took to TV on Sunday to herald the cover story of the
new magazine Brill's Content as a ``bombshell'' with implications
not only ``grave'' but also ``serious.'' His was a performance
self-righteous enough to make one shout, ``Bring back Sidney
Blumenthal!''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel's ``bombshell'' was the news that Ken Starr and company
had been talking to reporters _ and that Starr had admitted so in
an interview with Steven Brill, the magazine's editor and the cover
story's author.
</P>
<P>
   Bombshell? As Brill himself said during one of his nonstop TV
appearances, ``It's no revelation to anyone that Ken Starr has been
leaking material.'' Nor is it a revelation to anyone that Starr
would confess to what Emanuel and Brill (but as yet no judge) call
a misdeed: Starr long ago proved himself the most self-destructive
hunter of gargantuan prey to come our way since Ahab.
</P>
<P>
   But Emanuel is no fool. With his ``bombshell,'' he deflected
attention from his own appearance in the Brill article, which
describes how he ``cynically'' tried to discredit a damaging and
still undisputed New York Times story about Betty Currie's
revelations to Starr investigators.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew the media would take the bait _ even as they faulted
the White House for ``changing the subject'' to Starr _ because
they welcomed the opportunity to avoid the real subject of Brill's
24,000-word piece. The Brill article is called ``Pressgate,'' not
``Starrgate,'' and the bulk of it is about the press's behavior,
not the independent counsel's, during the first three weeks of its
All Monica orgy.
</P>
<P>
   You'd hardly know this from much of the coverage that Brill's
Content is getting. You wouldn't know, for instance, that Brill
tracks down exactly how a false ``one-source story from a
fifth-hand source,'' about a Secret Service agent's supposed
witnessing of a Monica-Clinton tryst, was spread as fact by all too
many of the country's major news operations.
</P>
<P>
   Or that he unearths the genesis of the illusory semen-stained
dress and details just how it morphed into the holy grail of
scandal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue in ``Pressgate'' is not that many reporters
talked to prosecutors _ as is their right _ but that a small
minority of them wrote erroneous stories that were then amplified
by the echo chamber of a feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new, Brill-fed frenzy began, most of the press
criticism has been directed at Brill himself _ some of it well
deserved. He should have disclosed his contributions to Democratic
campaigns, including Clinton-Gore, and he should have avoided an
appearance of partisanship by keeping his checkbook shut to start
with.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to argue that Brill, who at The American Lawyer
magazine published the Stuart Taylor Jr. article that rekindled the
Paula Jones case, is a Clinton lackey. Nor is he single-mindedly
anti-press. His article names the names of those who resisted the
stained dress and other unfortunate multimedia pileups.
</P>
<P>
   And at least Brill has said he will admit mistakes _ though
perhaps to a fault, given that his first issue contains a
correction about a prototype issue not seen by the general public.
(He'll probably even run Starr's 19-page letter to the editor.)
</P>
<P>
   What's been remarkable this week is how few in the thin-skinned
media have been willing to concede any errors and how many just
duck Brill's questions altogether.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday ABC News' ``World News Tonight'' ran ``A Closer Look''
about the Brill piece in which Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts
sounded off without so much as acknowledging that their own Sunday
show figures in it at length. On Tuesday a Wall Street Journal
editorial trashed the Brill piece as ``Tabloid Criticism'' without
disclosing that it reports on The Journal's retracted account of a
White House steward and stained tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Wednesday is Brill's Content actually available to
civilian readers. The difference between the cover story they find
there and the one spun by the media and Emanuel could be a future
cover story in itself _ though not, heaven help us, at 24,000
words.

 Pricey Souvenirs Don't Tee Off Fans   By Steve Rubenstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A plastic cup is a plastic cup anywhere except San Francisco, where
a plastic cup is $17.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was no ordinary plastic cup. This was an ordinary plastic
cup that said ``1998 U.S. Open'' on it, which made it something to
be embraced, clutched to the bosom and, only as a last resort,
drunk from.
</P>
<P>
   Paying $17 for a plastic cup may not be a good deal, but it's no
worse a deal than paying $12 for a tiny towel or $6 for a plastic
luggage tag or $3.33 for a golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   That was the going rate inside the giant white air-conditioned
tent where U.S. Open souvenirs were being hawked to otherwise
sensible people who all of a sudden did not mind paying $18 for a
fuzzy sock that slips over the top of a golf club and keeps it from
catching cold on chilly mornings.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Phil was selling $59 periscopes. Every golf fan
needs a periscope, he said, in order to look over the heads of
every other golf fan when crowded around the green.
</P>
<P>
   There are cheaper periscopes on the market, said Phil, but woe
be to him who buys one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the green if you're six or seven deep in the
crowd,'' he said, as a gaggle of golf fans stood around his booth
and tried out the scopes. There were more raised periscopes than
the Sixth Fleet on maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Golf balls, which normally sell for a buck or so, were selling
for $40 a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are too expensive to hit,'' said Glenn Greer, who bought
a set. ``You would never actually play with golf balls like
these.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You stick them on a shelf someplace,'' said Richard Westover.
``Then you take them down and look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing for free was a 144-page golf rule book full
of wondrous rules about the differences among movable obstructions,
immovable obstructions, temporary obstructions and temporary
immovable obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   A few steps away, Scott Duffy was selling $82 Izod golf shirts,
the kind that used to have embroidered alligators on them back in
the days when golf shirts used to have embroidered alligators.
</P>
<P>
   That was before other shirtmakers began mimicking the alligators
with embroidered pumas, embroidered leopards and embroidered
ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of alligators, golf shirts carry the logo of the
tournament, right where the alligator used to be. Izod sold the
rights to the alligator to another shirt company for $40 million,
which sounds like a lot of money but, in the world of golf, isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alligator is meaningless,'' said Duffy. ``The alligator is
nostalgia. This business has gone beyond the alligator.''

PFIZER TO SELL STENT BUSINESS FOR $2.1 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc. announced on Tuesday that it would sell its
cardiovascular devices unit to Boston Scientific Corp. for $2.1
billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The move to sell Schneider Worldwide, which makes stents used to
hold open arteries, had been long anticipated. Pfizer had announced
in February that it planned to sell its entire Medical Technology
Group to focus its resources more on its core pharmaceutical
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basically the first component of that group that will
be sold,'' said Steven Tighe, a pharmaceuticals analyst with
Merrill Lynch. ``Even with Pfizer at the top of its game, it
continues to focus on pharmaceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of Viagra, its impotency pill, Pfizer has
become the nation's hottest pharmaceutical company. Sales of Viagra
are projected by most analysts to be one of the most profitable
drugs ever, with sales of more than $1 billion during its first 12
months on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Such success has made the company's top brass commit itself to
the next huge-selling drug. The Medical Technology Group was looked
upon as a drain on money that could be funneled into research.
</P>
<P>
   While the sale clearly fits into Pfizer's long-term strategy, it
also appears to be a boon for Boston Scientific. The company, based
in Natick, Mass., will be one of the top manufacturers of stents.
Schneider Worldwide, based in Bulach, Switzerland, also made
peripheral stents, used in areas outside the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to like the deal. Shares of Pfizer rose
$1.625, to $109.6875, while Boston Scientific increased $1.75, to
$62.75.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Mike Hampton's hopes for his first All-Star berth took a serious
blow Tuesday when the Astros placed the lefthanded pitcher on the
15-day disabled list because of a strained left groin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The injury occurred on Hampton's last pitch in Monday's
rain-delayed game at Cincinnati, and he tweaked the groin while
running out a bunt in the next inning. Righthanded reliever Reggie
Harris was promoted from Class AAA New Orleans to take Hampton's
spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros opted for a relief pitcher because the bullpen
endured a workout in Cincinnati. Adding to the bullpen woes,
righthander Doug Henry has a sore arm and might be held out of
action until the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie will give us another fresh arm down there,'' Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We'll have another decision
to make Saturday when Mike's spot in the rotation comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those options include John Halama and Scott Elarton, both of
whom have pitched well this season at New Orleans. It's also
possible the Astros might tap the bullpen for a spot starter, most
likely lefthander Trever Miller. Hunsicker said using a four-man
rotation was not an option.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a day off in the schedule, Hampton should miss only
two starts if the rotation holds form. Regardless, it will be
difficult for the Astros to replace their most consistent pitcher
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who suffered the same injury in 1995, is 8-3 with a
2.80 earned run average. He pitched a shutout in his only complete
game and ranks among the league leaders in wins, ERA and innings
(103).
</P>
<P>
   Monday's injury almost certainly cost Hampton win No. 9,
considering the Astros waxed the Reds 13-2 and were leading 6-0
when he departed. It also might have cost him a spot on the
National League All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hadn't thought much about it,'' Hampton said. ``I
mean, I thought I had a good opportunity to make it this year, but
you never really know. It's a little disappointing, because things
like that (making the All-Star team) don't happen to you every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, I can't worry about that. I've still got
to come back and pitch the best I can, regardless of that. I'm
going to miss two starts, but there's no doubt in my mind that I
can get back to where I was when I come back from the disabled
list. I didn't really want to go on the DL, but it was a logical
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the layoff caused by a 50-minute rain delay
might have contributed to his injury, Hampton said: ``That might
have had a little to do with it, but who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton became the ninth Astros player to go on the disabled
list this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Hunsicker said. ``This is very similar to
when Jeff Bagwell went down. Mike is a key member, and we're going
to miss him. On the bright side, we don't think this is a severe
injury, and we're optimistic that he'll be on his way back to being
healthy over the next 10 days.''

YUGOSLAV LEADER MAKES CONCESSIONS ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (shortens 6th graf)  (Eds.: budgeted earlier as BOSNIA-MILOSEVIC; see also KOSOVO-U.S.) 
(BL) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic promised
Tuesday to make a series of concessions over Kosovo to forestall
military action by the West. But he stopped short of meeting one
key demand: the withdrawal of Serbian security forces accused of
attacking ethnic Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of closed-door meetings here with President Boris
Yeltsin and other top Russian officials, the Yugoslav leader
announced his promises. They included access for relief groups and
international monitors, arrangements for refugees to return and the
resumption of talks with Kosovo's Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, who like Milosevic are eager to head off NATO
air strikes, were quick to cast his pledges as an important
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from clear, however, whether Milosevic's pledges were
merely tactical or whether he was genuinely prepared to ease the
repression in Kosovo, whose population is predominantly ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that Milosevic had only met NATO part
way. Western diplomats at NATO headquarters said the alliance was
continuing to work on military options. But the threat of military
action has, in effect, been deferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some progress,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said. But she added that that Milosevic ``did not meet the
primary points that the Contact Group raised.'' The Contact Group,
which monitors events in the Balkans, includes Britain, Germany,
France and Italy as well as the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant press conference in an ornate Russian Foreign
Ministry mansion, Milosevic denied that Serbian forces had ever
harmed ethnic Albanians. ``There was no kind of ethnic cleansing,''
Milosevic said. ``In the latest actions it was declared by the
security forces there were no civilian victims at all.''
</P>
<P>
   International observers have painted a very different picture.
They say that at least 250 ethnic Albanians have been killed in the
fighting and at least 65,000 have been forced to abandon their
homes in the separatist province.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has condemned the Serbian
crackdown as ``ethnically driven violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's talks took place a day after NATO conducted air
exercises over the Balkans in an effort to pressure him to end the
crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He met with Yeltsin on Tuesday and then engaged in several hours
of talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev and other top Russian aides as the two sides sought
to cobble together a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Kosovo crisis, the Kremlin has had conflicting
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Yeltsin has an interest in maintaining good
relations with the West, especially since Moscow wants billions of
dollars in Western loans to help overcome its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian officials also acknowledge that Milosevic has gone
too far in Kosovo. Primakov, for example, went along last week with
the demand by his fellow foreign ministers in the so-called
``Contact Group'' on the Balkans who insisted that Milosevic
withdraw security forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians see solidarity with their fellow Slavs in
Yugoslavia as a useful card to play in Russian domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Russian view, Milosevic is defending an important
principle when he says he is entitled to take firm steps to insure
that Kosovo remains part of Serbia. Russia has its own regions of
ethnic tension _ like Chechnya, where it fought a two-year war
against separatists _ and is not eager to invite international
scrutiny or intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Primakov enjoys playing a pivotal role in world affairs
and is no friend of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO countries have threatened measures including military
intervention if Milosevic does not stop the Serbian offensive
against ethnic Albanians. And the newspaper Izvestiya bluntly
outlined one of the main purposes of Tuesday's meeting: ``Russia is
trying to save the Serbs from NATO bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of lengthy negotiations, Primakov claimed a major
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this opens up a real possibility to resolve the
situation,'' Primakov said at a joint news conference with
Milosevic. ``In many ways, the ball is now in the court of the
Kosovo Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials will be monitoring the situation in Kosovo for
the next several weeks to see if the Serbs keep their promises.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has, in fact, promised to take some noteworthy steps.
In the joint statement, he agreed there would be no restrictions on
the work of international organizations, such as the International
Committee of the Red Cross, or on international monitors. And he
promised to allow refugees who had fled Kosovo to return.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to continue talks with ethnic Albanians on
``forms of autonomy,'' though he spurned the idea of doing so with
the help of international mediators. Western officials are worried
that any talks will stall without international supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The Western-dominated ``Contact Group'' had demanded that
Milosevic recall intelligence and army units sent to Kosovo for the
crackdown. Security forces inside Kosovo, they insisted, should be
confined to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, Milosevic refused to take the initiative and
instead put the onus on the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``As terrorist activities subside, security forces will reduce
their presence outside the areas of their permanent deployment,''
Milosevic's joint statement with Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees crossing into Albania from Kosovo on Tuesday reported
attacks on mountain refugee camps by Yugoslav army helicopters, but
there was no independent confirmation of those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president told reporters Tuesday that his position
was intended to protect the principle of Serbian sovereignty over
the Kosovo region. He revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no reasons or grounds for the Yugoslav army not to
be on the territory of Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said. ``Any
withdrawal of units of the Yugoslav army from any part of
Yugoslavia is out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's statement also showed some of the contradictions in
the Russian stance.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who sat at Milosevic's side throughout the press
conference, joined the ``Contact Group's'' call for the withdrawal
of Serbian security forces. But the Russian foreign minister then
endorsed the far weaker measure Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seemed to enjoy his verbal jousts with the press
Tuesday. To the obvious discomfort of his Russian hosts, he
occasionally lapsed into English to respond to Western reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When Western reporters pressed Milosevic about the violence in
Kosovo, he shot back that Albanian ``terrorist groups'' had
launched reprisals against ethnic Albanians who refused to support
them.
</P>
<P>
   As Milosevic ended his remarks, Primakov cut off the session,
reminding the Yugoslav president that he was late for a visit with
the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic seemed ready for another round of sparring and
wrapped up the news conference with an invitation to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, next time, if you want longer talks, you
come to Belgrade,'' Milosevic said. ``You are invited, all of
you.''

   STOCKS REBOUND SLIGHTLY AS INVESTORS SEEK BARGAINS
</P>
<P>
   Stock-market gauges rose slightly as investors sought bargains
but shunned multinational companies with exposure to the financial
turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 37.37 points,
to 1,753.12, erasing Monday's 29.30-point decline. The 2.18 percent
gain was the largest percentage increase in the barometer in more
than three months. Among the big gainers on the Nasdaq were Intel,
Microsoft and Dell Computer. Dell jumped 5.9 percent on news that
it was in talks with Microsoft to custom-design personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   PRESSMANS TO GIVE UP TITLES
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Gene Pressman will step down shortly as co-chief
executives of Barney's, the luxury fashion retailer started by
their grandfather, executives involved in the negotiations said.
The two will remain consultants to the company as it continues to
emerge from bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   LARGER ISSUE UNDERLIES GM STRIKES
</P>
<P>
   The strikes crippling General Motors, while partly about job
security and work-place safety, reflect a broader struggle over how
the United States' auto industry will make vehicles. GM wants to
embrace efficient techniques it uses in countries like Brazil. But
where GM sees efficiency, the United Automobile Workers union sees
a threat.
</P>
<P>
   PFIZER TO SELL SCHNEIDER UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer will sell its Schneider Worldwide unit, which makes
stents used to hold open arteries, to Boston Scientific for $2.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   OBSTACLE LOOMS FOR FINANCIAL BILL
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration all but doomed efforts to update the
United States' Depression-era financial-services law this year,
saying it would not budge from its opposition to the bill passed
last month by the House and that it wants to start over next year.
</P>
<P>
   NO HARM SEEN BY MERGER WAVE
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
Alan Greenspan, agreed in testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee that there was little evidence of excessive consolidation
from the mergers sweeping the banking, telecommunications and
military contracting industries.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER PRICES UP 0.3 PERCENT IN MAY
</P>
<P>
   Price increases for lettuce, cigarettes, gasoline and
prescription drugs pushed up consumer inflation by 0.3 percent in
May, the largest increase in 17 months. In another report,
construction starts on new homes were down 0.7 percent last month,
to an annual rate of 1.53 million units.
</P>
<P>
   MERCK EXPECTED TO GET WINDFALL
</P>
<P>
   Astra, the Swedish drug giant, is expected to buy Merck's share
of the two companies' joint venture. That, plus last month's DuPont
deal, means Merck is looking at a multibillion-dollar windfall.

</P>
<P>
   For the first time on Wednesday, an energy technology called a
fuel cell will supply all the power to a suburban house in Latham,
N.Y. The Energy Department is helping pay for the test in the hope
that the technology will eventually be an economical alternative to
traditional energy sources, while cutting pollution.

GROUP FUNDS FACIAL SURGERY FOR WOMEN SAVAGED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

<P>
   PHOENIX _ For women like her, it hurts just to look in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, every time she catches a glimpse, she's reminded of
the day her husband tried to destroy her face with an ice pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ruin you so no man will want you,'' he'd warned
her so many times.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, he did it, said the 30-year Phoenix woman still
too afraid to be named. After smashing both of the woman's legs
with a baseball bat and breaking both elbows, he hit her 4-year-old
daughter with a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went for the woman's face.
</P>
<P>
   Severe facial injuries and scarring are not uncommon for victims
of domestic violence, shelter and medical workers said. Long after
a victim escapes her abuser, the evidence of broken jaws and noses,
missing teeth and deep gashes remains as public reminders of
private anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Phoenix organization has recognized the high demand for
medical treatment among domestic-violence victims unable to afford
it. Volunteers and financial donors said they will help restore
both victims' hopes and their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Faces for the Future, will fund the repair of
facial injuries of women who have escaped abuse and are at little
or no risk of returning to their abuser. To be eligible, women must
demonstrate a commitment to establishing a new life through job
training and education. They also must be unable to afford medical
treatment for the injuries that haunt them with long-term physical
complications and low self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   The program, just under way, is a creation of the Arizona
Foundation for Women, a non-profit Phoenix-based organization. The
foundation raises private funds and matches candidates with
volunteer doctors, dentists and optometrists.
</P>
<P>
   Once approved for the program, women are referred to one of 70
doctors or 30 dentists. The foundation raises money to pay for
medical supplies, hospital stays and lab fees.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted candidates might need something as simple as a new pair
of eyeglasses or as complex as plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ginger Price looks forward to volunteering her dental
services for victims who find it painful or embarrassing to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone has decided to leave an abusive husband and is
looking for a job, crowning a tooth is just out of her realm,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Price believes that restoring a victim's smile is not only a
medical procedure but also an important tool for restoring
self-esteem damaged by years of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Patti, 40, knows it firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   She left her abuser 13 years ago after he hit her in the face
with the butt of a gun. She's undergone the initial screening for
the program and is waiting to find out whether she will be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that if some of the physical scars are erased, so can
the emotional scars heal,'' Patti said. She described the
self-consciousness she felt facing job interviewers with purple
scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (facial damage) is like something very sacred being taken
from you,'' she said. ``It depleted my self-esteem and affects my
personal and professional life.''
</P>
<P>
   Each victim selected for help by Faces of the Future is matched
with a volunteer to provide emotional support throughout the
treatments; the volunteers also lend practical support, such as
driving victims to appointments or helping write resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Both types of support are vital, coordinator Jan Dahms said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outside appearance doesn't make the person whole,'' she
said. ``You need to feel good about yourself to become a productive
member of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Sommerdevlin, president of the Arizona Foundation for
Women, called Faces for the Future a holistic approach to healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic violence is not simply a matter of someone being
beaten,'' she said. ``It's psychological abuse. When you see the
scars physical violence leaves, it's very dramatic. But the
physical damage is just a symptom of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Faces is one of the few programs aimed at helping
victims establish lives away from their abusers, its volunteers say
it can also act as an incentive for people still trapped in abusive
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It empowers them to feel there is support out there so they
``can'' leave,'' Dr. Neil Rockowitz said. ``I think that just
knowing that we are here serves a purpose for them.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: MINES ON THE ROAD TO REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   After months of false starts, the House on Wednesday embarks on
a path that could lead to genuine campaign finance reform. Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other foes of change have lined the road with
mines and booby traps, but if reformers counterattack with
discipline and force they can quickly gain the upper hand. The
Shays-Meehan bill, which would ban unlimited ``soft money''
donations to parties and impose other sensible fund-raising limits,
is close to commanding a majority. Supporters need to show right
away that they have the votes to reject dozens of amendments that
the speaker and other obstructionists will try to put forward to
stymie the process.
</P>
<P>
   The first vote Wednesday will be on the false issue of whether
to create a commission to study the problem. We have urged
reformers to reject the commission idea as a diversion, and it is
expected to lose. Next on the agenda will be the bill named for its
main sponsors, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Rep.
Martin Meehan of Massachusetts. Republicans are paying it the
ultimate compliment. Fearing that the bill is gaining momentum,
they will try to destroy it by offering dozens and perhaps hundreds
of amendments. They hope the amendments will undercut support for
the bill or at least take up so much of the 18 hours allotted for
debate that time runs out before the bill itself can be passed.
</P>
<P>
   We urge Republicans and Democrats who have spent the last two
years championing reform in principle to seize the moment. They
need to submerge their partisan instincts and reject these
amendments no matter how tempting it may be to go along with them.
Once it becomes clear that there are enough votes to thwart the
obstructionists, it will be harder and harder to carry out the
amendment charade. Amendments targeting unions and progressive
groups and repealing provisions of the Voting Rights Act, for
example, are designed solely to make the reform bill unpalatable to
many members who would otherwise support it. They should be seen
for what they are and be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   If Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay had any shame, they
would be embarrassed to oppose campaign reform only one day after
entertaining corporate fat cats, lobbyists and rich donors at a
dinner in Washington that had raised more than $10 million before
it began. If the obstructionists succeed, the fund-raising scandals
will only get worse. &QL;

Brazil flourishes against Morocco, sews up Group A title
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NANTES, France _ Walk through this town, and you see women in
high-heeled sneakers and business suits sitting at cafes writing
poetry, or old men with flowing hair dancing by themselves at
plazas, or young girls in pigtails sitting in parks sketching
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes clear why this eclectic city calls itself ``the
cradle of surrealism.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Paris with an attitude. It is so many things constantly
going on at one time. It is so many creative people and only one
breezy bank on which to walk barefoot along the Loire River.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, Brazil. Welcome, Mayor Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there seemed to be a time and a place for Brazil to
regain its mastery of the surreal, its command of the creative, it
was Tuesday night at Stade de la Beaujoire.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Brazil did in a 3-0 victory over Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our kind of soccer,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo
said. ``This was a joy. It was happy football.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ronaldo, the awesome goal-scorer and ball-handler who was
among the most vocal critics of the Brazilians' lackluster World
Cup opener last week, was happiness personified. He took matters
into his own hands _ actually, his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo moved the ball crisply through the Morocco defense all
night, freezing defenders with stylish moves and ripping shots from
every angle at a poor, unfortunate goalkeeper named Driss Benzekri,
who probably still is looking for Ronaldo's game-breaking first
shot that whizzed by in a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played good in the first game,'' said Ronaldo, who
ultimately finished with a goal, an assist and countless
breathtaking moves before a crowd of nearly 40,000. ``But good is
not Brazil. We had to be more assertive tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The game could not have turned out better, with all the
near-misses of the 2-1 opening-game win over Scotland last week
turning into direct hits on Tuesday night, beginning with Ronaldo's
first ninth-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
   Against a Moroccan team that played well in its 2-2 opening-game
draw with Norway, Brazil dominated possession and played exactly
the type of soccer that its Samba Kings fandom has come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a catastrophic start for us tonight against a great
team,'' Moroccan coach Henry Michel said. ``To be down a goal after
10 minutes is difficult, but even more so against Brazil. They were
extraordinary today. They got us down from the start, and then
things got worse and worse for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect kind of match for Brazil and set off a
carnival of sorts both at the stadium and on the streets of Nantes.
</P>
<P>
   Fans dressed in Brazil's green and yellow colors set off
fireworks and rained confetti on the field after the final whistle,
as samba drums echoed off the walls of the stadium and everyone
danced _ including some players, who stayed on to wave at the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was a festive and peaceful scene, perhaps exactly what World
Cup organizers needed in the wake of Sunday and Monday's violent
outbursts by English hooligans in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is a beautiful game, and we were frustrated when we won
(last week). We didn't think we played good soccer,'' said Bebeto,
a veteran Brazilian striker who scored his team's third goal
Tuesday on a nice assist from Ronaldo. ``All this game did was
guarantee that we will move on and play in the next round. But we
were glad we played well and played a beautiful game.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, the defending World Cup champion, indeed became the
first 1998 team to be guaranteed a berth in the second round. With
two victories and six points, Brazil has clinched first place in
Group A.
</P>
<P>
   Norway (two points), Scotland (one) and Morocco (one) will vie
next week for the second ticket to the second round out of Group A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked a lot better today than in our first game, and
that's all we wanted,'' Zagallo said. ``If we get the same people
doing the same things in our coming games, I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ronaldo and Bebeto, Brazil also got a goal from Rivaldo
early in the second half. Another who dominated was Dunga, a
ball-controlling midfielder whose teamwork with Ronaldo was close
to perfect all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out today and show the world the kind of
soccer we should have played last week,'' Ronaldo said. ``We wanted
to play the kind of creative, exciting soccer we expect from
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nantes, they came to the right place.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is set to return to Martha's
Vineyard for a vacation of about two weeks in August, while his
wife and daughter may spend the entire month on the island, White
House sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The president is expected to arrive the weekend of Aug. 15,
joining Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are expected to stay at their usual perch _ the
sprawling Edgartown home of Boston businessman Richard Friedman.
``The Clinton family are always welcome at my family's house,''
said Friedman, who otherwise declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the Clintons' vacation plans are
still not finalized.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the Clintons' fourth Vineyard vacation. The family
spent the first two presidential vacations on the island, and then
stayed away two summers, opting for Jackson Hole, Wyo., and the
Grand Tetons.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Martha's Vineyard last year for the longest
vacation of the Clinton presidency _ a full three weeks. They spent
their vacation socializing with celebrities, walking along the
beach, reading, playing board games, listening to '60s music, and,
in the case of the first duffer, golfing and jogging.

 &HT;    Smoltz start delayed
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- John Smoltz's return start has been bumped back a day
to Saturday. That's slightly better than last weekend, when Smoltz
was ready to call the whole thing off.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz will start his first game in four weeks in Montreal
Saturday night, which gives him an extra day's rest and allows
Kevin Millwood to retain a four-day off schedule. None of this
would have happened without an extended series of conversations
with friends and advisers who convinced him that returning to the
mound was best, despite two partially successful re-hab starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the frustration of not being able to do what I wanted
to,'' Smoltz said. ''I hoped to make some subtle changes that
weren't so subtle. I'd hoped to be able to do it in two starts. I'd
hoped to feel things that you just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz had worked on throwing a fastball with less elbow stress
and experimented with change-ups, throwing 36 of them in Sunday's
six-inning appearance with the Class A Macon Braves. He doubts he
threw 36 change-ups the entire 1997 season. During the ride back
from Macon that night, though the discomfort in his elbow has
subsided, he began to question if the last month has been a waste
of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''My frustration level was pretty bad, my confidence level was
pretty bad,'' he said. ''I tried to do everything in two starts.
I'd hoped for a miracle to find some ways to pitch differently and
to try to alleviate some (elbow) pressure. That's just very
difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects to be on a 90-pitch limit Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Skip-o-gram
</P>
<P>
   An MRI to Skip Caray's back revealed the announcer is suffering
from a bruised spinal cord, and while that diagnosis allayed some
fears, Caray is still not expected to resume working until next
week. Caray was injured June 10 in a tumble from a treadmill at his
home and underwent a Monday follow-up examination when his back
showed little improvement.
</P>
<P>
   While a June 24 target date versus the New York Yankees has been
penciled in, TBS is still scrambling to fill Caray's chair. Ernie
Johnson Jr. filled in Tuesday night and with Fox Sports South
carrying tonight and Thursday night's games, TBS will rotate its
two spots over the weekend between Pete Van Wieren, Don Sutton and
Joe Simpson. Daron Sutton will fill in on radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Moss surgery
</P>
<P>
   Damian Moss, the Australian left-hander who made a strong
impression in spring camp before experiencing elbow problems, will
undergo ligament transplant surgery next Wednesday. Moss threw 10
scoreless innings in his first five appearances this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But he left a March 13 game after feeling something pop in his
elbow, and though a subsequent MRI showed no substantial damage, he
was placed on the DL. A subsequent exam by club orthopedist Joe
Chandler last week showed a tear in the ulnar collateral ligament.

 &HT;    On Deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Fox Sports South, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (9-2, 1.75; 6-1,
2.32 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. LHP Jesus Sanchez (3-3, 3.97; first
appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: With a win, Maddux would have his 10th in 16 starts. He's
had only one faster start as a Brave, in 1994 when he won 10 in his
first 14 starts. Maddux has four no-decisions but left just one of
those games with a lead; that was in his last start, Friday, when
the bullpen gave up five runs in the ninth to Montreal. Since the
start of May, Maddux has given up 10 earned runs on 45 hits over 68
1/3 innings. He has struck out 53 and walked just 10 in that
period. Take away back-to-back April starts when he gave up 10 runs
to the Colorado Rockies, and Maddux's ERA this year would be 1.08.
Sanchez, acquired from the New York Mets in the Al Leiter deal in
February, has been the best of the seven rookies the Marlins have
tested as starters this season. Although he has had decent run
support _ 4.7 runs in his 10 career starts _ he also has held
opponents to three earned runs or less seven times, remarkable for
a 23-year-old who spent all of last season in the Class AA Eastern
League. Since Sanchez's recovery from 1996 elbow surgery, his
fastball reaches the low 90s in mph, and he causes particular
problems when his hard-breaking slider is working.

 &HT;    USGA's big decision: Ruling body to weigh in on equipment
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Whatever happens with today's United States
Golf Association press conference regarding equipment, there's no
likely need to panic. Do expect something long-term, but don't
presume anything immediate. The blue blazers and white caps won't
be riding herd with the 156 participants today, ordering them to
play the first round of the U.S. Open with persimmon woods,
nonperimeter weighted irons, a low-tech golf ball, plaid
bell-bottoms and Ban-Lon shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has been rampant ever since the USGA said it was
studying possible restrictions on the kind of high-tech, highly
successful equipment that has been helping amateurs and pros all
over the globe come a little closer to figuring out the game of
golf. The USGA is concerned that technology is taking away from
talent and that in 20 years you'll need a 750-yard par-5 to protect
Old Man Par.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting the worst, equipment manufacturers such as Ely
Callaway have been advising consumers to do everything but sleep
with their Big Bertha drivers. It's unlikely, however, that the
USGA, on the eve of its showcase championship, would unload a
blockbuster announcement to cause panic in the golf industry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite theorizing you may have read about oversized,
titanium drivers soon going the way of the T. rex, until the USGA
brass met this past weekend in San Francisco, it had not decided
precisely what would be said at a press conference The Golf Channel
will televise live.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA is not expected to announce any rules changes today.
More likely is the announcement of a USGA task force to study the
equipment matter _ probably containing some people from the golf
industry, to help deflect potential legal problems. Any future
mandates are likely to contain a reasonable grace period, probably
by 2000. Plus, any changes would have to be discussed with Europe's
ruling body, the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be be surprised,'' said USGA senior director of
communications Marty Parkes, ``if the announcement Wednesday is a
dot-all-the-i's, cross-all-the-t's kind of thing. Certainly, we'll
have something to say about the issues, things to look at, some of
the future steps. But if somebody is looking for a Holy Grail or
something that's going to tie everything together comprehensively,
I think they might be disappointed.'' Indeed, the timing of a USGA
decree to potentially affect the golf consumer is puzzling. Golf is
enjoying its biggest boom since the 1960s. People are diving into
the sport by the millions. So what if modern equipment makes it
easier for them and less prone to give up? Is that, well, ``good
for golf?'' And, seriously, what's the difference between the
titanium/graphite age than what happened when golfers stopped
swinging tree branches and discovered steel?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very difficult situation because golf is doing so
well right now that it's like an economy _ you don't want to mess
with it,'' said Gary Player, who, like many older players, agrees
with the USGA's watchdog approach. ``The only disadvantage I see is
that you will never be able to compare golfers. You can never
compare Bob Jones with Jack Nicklaus because one man played with
hickory-shafted clubs and a ball that went 80 yards shorter. You
won't be able to compare Jack Nicklaus with Tiger Woods because
Tiger plays with metal-headed woods and a golf ball that goes 15
yards farther on fairways and greens that are immaculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Hale Irwin, ``I've maintained for years that we should have
our own set of rules and standards. The talent of the player should
speak before the technology. You can go down to Pro Golf Discount
and buy yourself a golf game now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The equipment has gotten out of hand,'' says Tiger Woods.
``Guys who aren't that strong are able to hit the ball over 300
yards. It's one of those things that's leveling out the playing
field. It's not putting demand on shaping shots anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech equipment is, however, putting demand on courses.
Augusta National, for example, announced last week significant
changes to four holes (Nos. 2, 11, 15 and 17) in an effort to
reward accuracy over distance.
</P>
<P>
   Distance is the number one advantage high-tech equipment offers.
Although oversized, long-shafted titanium drivers might mean just a
few extra yards for some golfers, most pros say they gain an extra
15-20 yards. Golf balls are going farther on their own, too,
although how much is up for debate. There's no denying, however,
the fact that the PGA Tour's average driving distance keeps going
up every year.
</P>
<P>
   And so do golf equipment sales. Golfers spent $2.5 billion on
equipment last year, which explains why Callaway and other
manufacturers are worried about even the slight hint of a ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``A USGA rules change would definitely affect (equipment
sales),'' said Darren Jackson, manager of Golf Warehouse in
Kennesaw. ``It just remains to be seen how much. ... Most players
really don't play under the rules of golf. If you asked everyone
who walks in here if they played in a USGA-sanctioned tournament,
maybe one out of 100 would say yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've still got people who will walk in and ask for
whatever clubs they saw (professional players) using.''

 &HT;    Power outage cancels practice
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The lights were out Tuesday _ but not from good
marksmanship on the eve of the USA Shooting National Championships
at Wolf Creek Olympic Shooting Complex.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most of this country's history, parents were
content to keep children at home playing in the kitchen until
kindergarten or first grade. Most nursery schools were considered a
luxury of the middle and upper classes. Even Head Start, the
early-education federal program begun in 1965 for poor children,
was long deemed experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, more than half of all mothers of young children
work outside the home, and study after study has shown that the
years before the age of 5 are a crucial learning time. As a result,
the demand for enriching preschool programs _ in which pre-reading
and pre-math are nurtured _ has soared.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, 520,000 children, or 4 percent of the population of 3-
to 5-year-olds, were enrolled in preschool. In 1996, more than 4.1
million in the same age group were enrolled, or 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-K, a squishy term for a wide range of programs offered to
children the year or two before they enter kindergarten, is now at
the top of social and political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is pushing for early-education initiatives
like scholarships for child-care workers and teachers. On Tuesday,
a House Banking and Financial Services subcommittee held a hearing
on a new bill, nicknamed Kiddie Mac, that would provide Federal
Housing Administration loan guarantees and other help for
child-care and child development centers, including public and
private pre-kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   State governments, at least 30 by most counts, have also been
taking steps to improve options and to set up regulations. Georgia
began earmarking lottery money for pre-programs for all children in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   This coming school year, New York state will give money to
school districts that offer programs to all their 4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and Connecticut now have public-private
partnerships aimed at offering pre-K to a growing number of pupils.
And for the first time this year, New Jersey is providing money to
make pre-kindergarten an option for 4-year-olds in 125 districts,
with more to be added in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   But what, in fact, pre-K should consist of is just beginning to
be considered as legislators, educators and parent groups debate
not only issues of curriculum and regulation but also basic
questions like who is best suited to run the program _ private
centers or public schools.
</P>
<P>
   n a strictly legal sense, pre-K may resemble anything from
baby-sitting to group child care to a traditional kindergarten,
depending on the state. In most states, anyone caring for five or
more children for pay must be licensed and follow strict health and
safety rules, from keeping immunization records to limiting the
number of children per supervisor and square foot.
</P>
<P>
   But while states might require a pre-kindergarten program to
provide certain materials, like blocks or markers, it is up to each
center to use the materials in creative ways. In general, teachers
are not required to teach any particular skills, like the alphabet
or counting. For example, New York's new pre-kindergarten programs
``must be educationally based'' and ``promote English literacy,''
among other guidelines, but the requirements are broadly defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really are no specific guidelines for a pre-K curriculum
or even a kindergarten curriculum in this state,'' said Carolyn
Tebbetts, director of the Bright Horizons center in Lyndhurst,
N.J., which enrolls children ranging in age from several weeks to 6
years. The center is one of 155 Bright Horizons sites across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Education of Young Children,
which accredits programs it considers appropriate, says about 6
percent of the nation's 95,000 licensed child-care, or preschool
programs, are accredited. Among those are the larger franchised
centers as well as elite nursery schools, which can use their
credentials to charge fees of $200 or more a week.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing push for such quality assurance for the
programs, and thousands of them are in the process of gaining
accreditation, said Barbara Willer, an association spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has helped spark a debate over who is best suited to
educating the nation's tricycle set, with parents and legislators
pushing school districts to assume responsibility. Many public
schools, strapped for money and space, have been reluctant to take
on the job.
</P>
<P>
   In Cortland, N.Y., a small city in a poor rural county just
south of Syracuse, the school board agreed to provide a
pre-kindergarten program only on the condition that it not cost the
district any extra money. The board is using the state allowance to
hire private child-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do it ourselves, down the road we'll have to add
classrooms to the schools, and there would be a cost,'' said Donald
E. Parks, superintendent of the Cortland city schools.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those who want enriched preschool programs to be part of the
public school system see it not only as a logical extension of the
commitment to public education but also as an issue of equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very people who need this kind of early education
experience are the ones whose families can't afford the tuitions of
private preschools,'' said Edward Zigler, a psychology professor at
Yale University and one of those who conceived the Head Start
program. ``The public schools should be the ones taking on the
younger children.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of public-school involvement say school districts
should not pass up the opportunity to prepare 4-year-olds,
something that would make their teaching job easier later on.
Public schools are more experienced in the educational mission than
for-profit national chains, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Private preschool directors argue that their programs are
superior to those of public schools because they are tailored
specifically to the needs and skills of 3- to 5-year-olds and are
not an educational afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   They also complain that turning programs over to public schools
drains the child-care centers of the tuitions needed to keep them
going. Most also provide infant and toddler care, which is so labor
intensive that centers are barely able to break even, said Lynn L.
White, chief executive of the National Child Care Association, a
trade group representing 6,000 licensed centers.
</P>
<P>
   Most pre-kindergarten programs still consists of church-run
nursery schools and mom-and-pop operations, which run on shoestring
budgets. But increasingly, entrepreneurs are getting into the
action.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, child-care and preschool programs have grown as a
market by $2 billion and make up $30 billion, or 5 percent, of the
$665 billion spent on schooling each year.
</P>
<P>
   Some business analysts believe that education, including the
fragmented pre-K market, is an industry ripe for consolidation.
Earlier this spring, Michael R. Milken, the financier who was
convicted of securities fraud, and his new company, Knowledge
Universe, bought the Children's Discovery Centers, which provides
day care, preschool and elementary school programs for over 24,500
children across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the New York buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.
bought Kindercare Learning Centers, the largest of the for-profit
preschool and child care companies with 1,148 child care centers
throughout the country. And Bright Horizons and Corporate Family
Solutions recently agreed to merge to form one large
early-education company.
</P>
<P>
   Even Salomon Smith Barney, which was bearish on the preschool
market in its education industry report two years ago, upgraded its
assessment in its current report, ``as demographics point to
continued increases in the demand for such services.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more than half of the 3- to 5-year-olds are in programs
outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon at Bright Horizons in Lyndhurst, a handful
of children nestled near a pint-sized desk in an area outfitted
with tape, scissors, a computer keyboard and plenty of paper for
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Flowers, 35, greeted her 4-year-old daughter with a hug
and explained why she chose a pre-K program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted Taylor in a learning environment,'' Mrs.
Flowers said. ``Taylor was in home care, or day care, before. But I
moved her here because I didn't want her just playing or watching
TV all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came time for kindergarten, I wanted her to be
prepared.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Researchers studying elderly cancer patients in
nursing homes have found that many are severely undertreated for
pain and more than a quarter of those who complain of pain,
especially blacks and the oldest of the old, are given no pain
medication, even aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the largest of its kind, is all the more troubling,
experts say, because as hospital stays grow shorter and the elderly
population increases, more and more old people with cancer are
living out the end of their lives in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The research involved 13,625 cancer patients in five states,
including New York. It found that patients older than 85 were about
half as likely to be treated for pain as those between the ages of
65 and 74, and that blacks were half as likely as whites to receive
pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, nursing home staff and in-house doctors may
give up on patients who they know are going to die,'' said Dr.
Giovanni Gambassi, a main author of the study in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association. ``There is no
acceptable excuse for not treating pain appropriately in terminally
ill patients.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the American Nursing Home Association, which
represents 11,000 nursing homes across the country, said the new
study raises ``legitimate issues that bear close scrutiny.'' But
the spokesman, Tom Burke, also complained that nursing homes were
being unfairly singled out, saying the problem of undertreatment of
pain cuts across all areas of medicine. ``I'd be hard-pressed to
think a nursing home would do better than an oncology ward,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts do not fully understand why the very old and minorities
are more vulnerable to having their pain left untreated, but
several theories are circulating, said Dr. Kathleen Foley, chief of
the pain and palliative care service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York City. One is that outright prejudice is
at work, particularly in the case of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Another, she said, is that these patients ``are used to being in
pain and suffering and therefore don't complain about it.'' A third
is that they don't want to be impaired by the side effects of
medication. In addition, experts say that nursing home workers are
poorly trained to recognize pain.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Dr. Foley and other experts in end-of-life
care have long complained that their colleagues underestimate and
undertreat pain and that patients' quality of life could be vastly
improved if doctors paid attention to this problem.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, patients themselves have taken up the cause;
fear of dying a protacted, painful death has fueled the movement to
legalize assisted suicide, which in turn has brought the issue of
pain management, also called palliative care, out of the medical
fraternity and into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But while the lack of attention to pain has been well-documented
in a variety of medical settings, including hospital oncology
wards, only a few small studies have examined the problem in the
nation's nursing homes. That is why the new study, conducted by an
international team of Italian, British and American scientists, is
so important, Dr. Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new information, original information,'' she said.
``It is, for the first time, defining the epidemiology and the
ethnography of pain in the elderly population.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are 19,000 nursing homes in the United States, and experts
who study life inside them say they are particularly ill-equipped
to care for patients in pain. Many nursing home patients,
particularly the very elderly, are demented and unable to tell
those responsible for them how they feel. As a result, nurses and
nurse's aides must rely on other indicators like moaning, writhing
and crying to determine when a patient is pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the nursing home, there is not a lot of knowledge about how
to manage pain,'' said Dr. Mathy Mezey, a gerontologist and
professor of nursing at New York University. ``Most of the staff
has not been prepared in good palliative care, and that is both the
nursing home staff and the primary care physicians who are managing
the residents.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, most nursing homes do not have on-site
pharmacies that would allow them to dispense pain medication
easily. And many do not have the facilities to store addictive
narcotics like morphine, which must be kept under lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   For their study, Gambassi and his colleagues examined patient
evaluations collected by the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration from 1,492 nursing homes in New York, Kansas, Maine,
Mississippi, and South Dakota. From 1992 to 1995, the years covered
by the study, more than 360,000 new patients in these nursing homes
were given detailed evaluations when admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Of those patients, the researchers identified 13,625 to study,
all older than 65 and all diagnosed with cancer or other ailments.
The vast majority, 89 percent, of the patients were white, and 59
percent were women.
</P>
<P>
   While pain is often a daily fact of life for patients with
cancer, the study found that pain often went unrecorded among the
nursing home patients. In an interview, Gambassi said the study
found that from 25 to 40 percent of the patients experienced ``some
degree of pain on a daily basis,'' a figure he believes reflects
both the inability of nursing home staff to diagnose pain in
patients unable to speak, as well patients' reluctance to complain
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oldest patients are sometimes reluctant to report pain for
a variety of reasons,'' he said. ``There is fear that reporting
pain would take physicians' time away from their cancer. And
somebody might believe that pain is just a natural part of aging,
that there is nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4,003 patients who were diagnosed as having pain, 26
percent were given no medication at all. Sixteen percent were given
a simple analgesic, such as aspirin or Tylenol. Thirty-two percent
were given codeine or other weak pain relievers, and 26 percent
received morphine.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that white patients were the least likely to
have their pain ignored. Of 3,697 whites who were diagnosed with
pain, about a quarter were not given any pain medication. But of
the 188 black nursing home patients who were diagnosed with pain,
slightly more than one third, 64, went untreated. Similar trends
were identified among Hispanic, Asian and American Indian patients,
although these groups accounted for so few patients that the
researchers said the numbers were not statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   The older the patient, the less likely he was to receive strong
medication, the study found. Among patients who received morphine,
for instance, 38 percent fell between the ages of 65 and 74. Just
13 percent were older than 85.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Gambassi said, cannot be explained by biology.
``There is no physiological reason to believe that as you age, you
feel less pain,'' he said. ``That is definitely not true.
Eventually, it is the opposite _ you feel more pain'' with age. &QL;

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS WOODWARD MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   AND JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Closing a chapter in an ordeal that has fueled
international debate about child care and justice for 16 months,
Massachusetts' highest court has upheld the manslaughter conviction
of Louise Woodward in the death of baby Matthew Eappen, but freed
her to go home instead of sending her back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But a new phase began almost immediately. Sunil Eappen, the
baby's father, sued Woodward in federal court Tuesday, demanding
unspecified damages ``for the conscious suffering and wrongful
death'' of his son and seeking to bar her from profiting from the
ordeal. A hearing is set for 2 p.m Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed,'' Eappen said. ``We had hoped the
court would see beyond the publicity and judge the evidence as a
jury did.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, cloistered with friends in Marblehead, a suburban town
about 25 miles from Boston, for most of the day, was equally
dismayed by the ruling, her lawyers said. The 20-year-old _ later
seen skipping in the yard _ had hoped her felony conviction would
be entirely dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the prosecution nor the defense planned to contest the
court's ruling, which upheld Judge Hiller B. Zobel's surprise
decision last October to reduce a jury's second-degree murder
conviction and spring Woodward from jail.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides joined forces and asked the court to speed up its
standard rulings procedure, so that Woodward can retrieve her
passport and leave the Uunited States, possibly as soon as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that she will now begin the rest of her life,''
said defense attorney Harvey A. Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her out of this country as soon as possible,'' snapped
Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal _ which divided the state Supreme Judicial Court on
several key issues _ included strong criticism of several parties
involved in the Woodward case, particularly Middlesex Superior
Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel, who exercised a rare judicial
prerogative while presiding over the case.
</P>
<P>
   In October, after a month-long trial, jurors found Woodward
guilty of murder for Matthew Eappen's death. They faced a difficult
legal construct: in an ``all or nothing'' strategy, the defense
convinced Zobel to eliminate manslaughter as an option, hoping to
avoid a compromise verdict.
</P>
<P>
   That left the jury a choice: convict Woodward of first- or
second-degree murder, or set her free.
</P>
<P>
   The jury settled on second-degree murder. The verdict, which
carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison with parole
eligibility after 15 years, raised passions on both sides of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Judge Zobel's next move that transformed the Woodward
case into an international spectacle, complete with dogmatic
websites, mushrooming legal foundations and protests on two
continents and both sides of the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 10, ten days after the verdict, Zobel overrode the jury
and reduced the conviction to manslaughter. He then sentenced her
to the 279 days she had already spent in jail and set her free.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides immediately appealed. The prosecution contended Zobel
overstepped his bounds by tossing out the jury's verdict, while the
defense maintained Woodward should not have been convicted at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging, 46-page opinion written by Justice Margaret
H. Marshall, the SJC voted 7-0 that the judge was within his power
to change the jury verdict, ruling that the courts have a
``responsiblity to ensure that the result in every criminal case is
consonant with justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the justices chastized Zobel for going along with the
defense's all-or-nothing strategy, which removed manslaughter from
the jury's options.
</P>
<P>
   Zobel later compensated for the mistake by reducing the verdict,
ensuring the system did not treat Woodward too harshly. But he
never should have eliminated the charge in the first place, the SJC
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was peculiarly inappropriate for the judge to refuse to
charge the jury on manslaughter,'' especially in light of
his &UR;  &LR; apparent belief that the evidence did not support a murder
conviction, according to the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintained that the baby died when Woodward
violently shook and struck his head against a hard object,
fracturing his skull. But they did not contend he was the victim of
a long history of physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the reported murder and manslaughter convictions in
Massachusetts involving the battery of young children, there was
compelling evidence of multiple injuries ... not death caused by a
single fatal blow,'' according to the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no evidence in this case of repeated caretaker
abuse, the SJC wrote, Zobel ``did not abuse his discretion'' in
concluding that the murder verdict was out of proportion with
similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the SJC split 4-3 on whether the 279-day jail term the judge
imposed was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, manslaughter is punishable by up to 20 years in
prison. In tough language, the dissenters argued that Zobel should
have allowed the victim's relatives speak before he changed
Woodward's sentence to time served.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Justice John M. Greaney, the dissenters also said they
believe Woodward should have been sentenced by a judge other than
Zobel.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by Justice Ruth I. Abrams and Roderick L. Ireland,
Greaney wrote that Woodward also should have been placed on
probation _ including terms barring her from ever working as an au
pair again and preventing her from selling her story for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not view the judgment against Woodward as a light
matter,'' according to the opinion. ``She stands guilty of causing
an infant's violent death.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Tuesday, District Attorney Reilly
lambasted the SJC's decision not to reinstate the jury verdict, but
took cold comfort in their ruling that Woodward caused Matthew
Eappen's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is clear _ Louise Woodward killed Matty Eappen,'' he
said. ``Twelve jurors, a trial judge and now seven justices of the
high court have found that Louise Woodward is responsible for the
violent death of a little boy, for ending his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reilly said, ``I remain troubled by the sentence ... I
still feel it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate was more conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do hope that the Eappen family, at some point, will be able
to open their minds and look at the case in a more disapassonate
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's defense team vowed to restore her reputation with an
independent scientific study that would prove Eappen's injuries
were not consistent with child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We recognize that there are degrees of injustice and that
the outcome of this case could ahve been much worse of an
injustice,'' said Andrew Good, Silverglate's partner. ``Louise
Woodward maintains her innocence as she always has and she always
will.''

<P>
   Bob and Gene Pressman, the grandsons of the founder of Barney's
Inc., the luxury fashion retailer, will step down as co-chief
executives as early as this week as part of the company's plan to
emerge from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the reorganization agreement, the two
brothers will receive consulting contracts _ Gene Pressman for the
merchandise operations, and Bob Pressman for the operational side
of the business _ executives involved in the negotiations said
Tuesday. Although they will each retain the title of co-chairman,
each will relinquish the title of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment Tuesday. Both Pressmans also
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The move is not a complete surprise. Under the plan proposed by
the creditors' committee last month, the brothers each received
only a 1.5 percent equity stake in the reorganized retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Thomas Shull, who was named president of the
company in September, is widely viewed as responsible for
improvements in operating income over the last year. He will take
on the title of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is an emotionally charged transition for the brothers,
whose grandfather, Barney Pressman, financed the company's first
store at 17th Street and Seventh Avenue in New York by pawning his
wife's engagement ring in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' father, Fred Pressman, took over in the 1950s and
was widely respected in the fashion world as one of the great New
York merchant princes, transforming the business from one of men's
off-price suits to a fashion leader for New York's male fashion
elite. A women's department was added in 1981. Fred Pressman died
in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gene and Bob Pressman joined the business in the 1970s and
eventually led it on an expansion path that put the store
everywhere from Beverly Hills, Calif., to Asia, with the help of a
partner, Isetan Co. of Japan. Disagreements with Isetan over who
owned the company's crown-jewel stores _ on Madison Avenue, New
York, and in Chicago and Beverly Hills _ fueled the
bankruptcy-protection filing in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, several potential suitors have offered to acquire
the retail chain, most notably Dickson Concepts, a Hong Kong retail
concern that made an offer last summer for the company. But the
company's creditors ultimately decided to make a go of it on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers dealing with Barney's will not feel the change
involving the Pressmans. Judy Collinson, the general merchandise
manager for the women's-clothing division, will remain in place,
and Tom Kalenderian, who runs the men's department, will also
continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Bonnie Pressman, Gene Pressman's wife, who
learned the art of merchandising from Fred Pressman, will remain
the retailer's fashion director and perhaps even take on more
responsibilities under the reorganized retailer's plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Pressman is highly regarded by fashion companies for her
fashion sense and mode of doing business. Gene Pressman has often
said that Ms. Pressman's personal aesthetic has helped to define
the store's fashion point of view on the sales floor in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, largely devised by Bay Harbour Management and
Whippoorwill Associates, the two investment firms that own the
largest chunk of the debt of Barney's, a new board will be formed
to decide the future management and determine who will indeed run
the show. The retail industry is buzzing about who besides former
creditors might get a seat on that board, which could end up being
a coveted spot.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is set to return to Martha's
Vineyard for a vacation of about two weeks in August, while his
wife and daughter may spend the entire month on the island, White
House sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The president is expected to arrive the weekend of Aug. 15,
joining Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are expected to stay at their usual perch _ the
sprawling Edgartown home of Boston businessman Richard Friedman.
``The Clinton family are always welcome at my family's house,''
said Friedman, who otherwise declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the Clintons' vacation plans are
still not finalized.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the Clintons' fourth Vineyard vacation. The family
spent the first two presidential vacations on the island, and then
stayed away two summers, opting for Jackson Hole, Wyo., and the
Grand Tetons.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Martha's Vineyard last year for the longest
vacation of the Clinton presidency _ a full three weeks. They spent
their vacation socializing with celebrities, walking along the
beach, reading, playing board games, listening to '60s music, and,
in the case of the first duffer, golfing and jogging.

U.S. JURY REJECTS KEYBOARD INJURY CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal jury has rejected claims by nine people
that they suffered injuries from using computer keyboards made by
Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, handed up Tuesday by a jury in federal district
court in Brooklyn, reverses in part a 1996 verdict that was seen at
the time as a significant setback for computer makers. But since
then, computer makers have won a number of court victories against
claims that use of keyboards contributes to a variety of arm, wrist
and hand injuries. Such ailments _ known as repetitive stress
injuries _ have become increasingly common in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawyers have had a hard time proving in court that those
injuries have been as a result of defects in the design of the
keyboards. By Digital's count, juries have rejected liability cases
against keyboard manufacturers in 30 out of 31 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is how a keyboard is used, not the keyboard
itself,'' said Thomas Siekman, general counsel of the Compaq
Computer Corp., which completed its acquisition of Digital last
week. ``A hammer, if improperly used, can be quite dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs, Patricia Geressy, had won a judgment of
$5.3 million from a jury in December 1996 for her claims of wrist
injuries while using a keyboard made by Digital. But that judgment
was thrown out by Judge Jack Weinstein of the Federal District
Court in Brooklyn in May 1997, when Digital presented new evidence
that Ms. Geressy's injuries could be attributed to a pre-existing
neck condition.
</P>
<P>
   When a new trial was ordered for that case, eight other
plaintiffs joined the suit. Digital, meanwhile, is continuing to
appeal an award of $274,000 to Jeannette Rotolo for keyboard
related injuries, in a case that was part of the 1996 trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing arguments in the trial, which lasted six weeks,
Digital Equipment cited articles in prestigious medical journals
that found ``keyboard use was not a risk factor in carpal tunnel
syndrome,'' a severe wrist debilitation. Digital argued that the
injuries attributed to the keyboards were because of other health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Phillips, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, pointed to
government research that linked repetitive actions, such as the use
of keyboards, to carpal tunnel syndrome and neck injuries. ``This
stuff is not coming out of thin air,'' Phillips said in his
argument. ``This is real and is resulting in surgery and human
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips did not return calls seeking comment Tuesday.

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS WOODWARD MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   AND JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Closing a chapter in an ordeal that has fueled
international debate about child care and justice for 16 months,
Massachusetts' highest court has upheld the manslaughter conviction
of Louise Woodward in the death of baby Matthew Eappen, but freed
her to go home instead of sending her back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But a new phase began almost immediately. Sunil Eappen, the
baby's father, sued Woodward in federal court Tuesday, demanding
unspecified damages ``for the conscious suffering and wrongful
death'' of his son and seeking to bar her from profiting from the
ordeal. A hearing is set for 2 p.m Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed,'' Eappen said. ``We had hoped the
court would see beyond the publicity and judge the evidence as a
jury did.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, cloistered with friends in Marblehead, a suburban town
about 25 miles from Boston, for most of the day, was equally
dismayed by the ruling, her lawyers said. The 20-year-old _ later
seen skipping in the yard _ had hoped her felony conviction would
be entirely dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the prosecution nor the defense planned to contest the
court's ruling, which upheld Judge Hiller B. Zobel's surprise
decision last October to reduce a jury's second-degree murder
conviction and spring Woodward from jail.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides joined forces and asked the court to speed up its
standard rulings procedure, so that Woodward can retrieve her
passport and leave the Uunited States, possibly as soon as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that she will now begin the rest of her life,''
said defense attorney Harvey A. Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her out of this country as soon as possible,'' snapped
Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal _ which divided the state Supreme Judicial Court on
several key issues _ included strong criticism of several parties
involved in the Woodward case, particularly Middlesex Superior
Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel, who exercised a rare judicial
prerogative while presiding over the case.
</P>
<P>
   In October, after a month-long trial, jurors found Woodward
guilty of murder for Matthew Eappen's death. They faced a difficult
legal construct: in an ``all or nothing'' strategy, the defense
convinced Zobel to eliminate manslaughter as an option, hoping to
avoid a compromise verdict.
</P>
<P>
   That left the jury a choice: convict Woodward of first- or
second-degree murder, or set her free.
</P>
<P>
   The jury settled on second-degree murder. The verdict, which
carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison with parole
eligibility after 15 years, raised passions on both sides of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Judge Zobel's next move that transformed the Woodward
case into an international spectacle, complete with dogmatic
websites, mushrooming legal foundations and protests on two
continents and both sides of the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 10, ten days after the verdict, Zobel overrode the jury
and reduced the conviction to manslaughter. He then sentenced her
to the 279 days she had already spent in jail and set her free.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides immediately appealed. The prosecution contended Zobel
overstepped his bounds by tossing out the jury's verdict, while the
defense maintained Woodward should not have been convicted at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging, 46-page opinion written by Justice Margaret
H. Marshall, the SJC voted 7-0 that the judge was within his power
to change the jury verdict, ruling that the courts have a
``responsiblity to ensure that the result in every criminal case is
consonant with justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the justices chastized Zobel for going along with the
defense's all-or-nothing strategy, which removed manslaughter from
the jury's options.
</P>
<P>
   Zobel later compensated for the mistake by reducing the verdict,
ensuring the system did not treat Woodward too harshly. But he
never should have eliminated the charge in the first place, the SJC
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was peculiarly inappropriate for the judge to refuse to
charge the jury on manslaughter,'' especially in light of
his &UR;  &LR; apparent belief that the evidence did not support a murder
conviction, according to the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintained that the baby died when Woodward
violently shook and struck his head against a hard object,
fracturing his skull. But they did not contend he was the victim of
a long history of physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the reported murder and manslaughter convictions in
Massachusetts involving the battery of young children, there was
compelling evidence of multiple injuries ... not death caused by a
single fatal blow,'' according to the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no evidence in this case of repeated caretaker
abuse, the SJC wrote, Zobel ``did not abuse his discretion'' in
concluding that the murder verdict was out of proportion with
similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the SJC split 4-3 on whether the 279-day jail term the judge
imposed was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, manslaughter is punishable by up to 20 years in
prison. In tough language, the dissenters argued that Zobel should
have allowed the victim's relatives speak before he changed
Woodward's sentence to time served.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Justice John M. Greaney, the dissenters also said they
believe Woodward should have been sentenced by a judge other than
Zobel.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by Justice Ruth I. Abrams and Roderick L. Ireland,
Greaney wrote that Woodward also should have been placed on
probation _ including terms barring her from ever working as an au
pair again and preventing her from selling her story for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not view the judgment against Woodward as a light
matter,'' according to the opinion. ``She stands guilty of causing
an infant's violent death.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Tuesday, District Attorney Reilly
lambasted the SJC's decision not to reinstate the jury verdict, but
took cold comfort in their ruling that Woodward caused Matthew
Eappen's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is clear _ Louise Woodward killed Matty Eappen,'' he
said. ``Twelve jurors, a trial judge and now seven justices of the
high court have found that Louise Woodward is responsible for the
violent death of a little boy, for ending his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reilly said, ``I remain troubled by the sentence ... I
still feel it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate was more conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do hope that the Eappen family, at some point, will be able
to open their minds and look at the case in a more disapassonate
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's defense team vowed to restore her reputation with an
independent scientific study that would prove Eappen's injuries
were not consistent with child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We recognize that there are degrees of injustice and that
the outcome of this case could ahve been much worse of an
injustice,'' said Andrew Good, Silverglate's partner. ``Louise
Woodward maintains her innocence as she always has and she always
will.''

EDITORIAL: CHINA'S OPPRESSIVE SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   There is a disturbing quality to China's preparations for next
week's visit by President Clinton. Chinese leaders are so eager to
project a sanitized picture of political harmony to a global
television audience that they have been harassing democratic
dissidents, preventing Chinese-Americans from visiting their
families back home and blocking distribution of a book featuring
American journalistic accounts of Clinton's alleged sexual
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   These actions do not, as intended, advertise Beijing's growing
importance as a world capital or the confident consolidation of
power by a new leadership since Deng Xiaoping. Instead, they remind
the world how far China still falls short of international
standards of political freedom and how nervous its leaders remain
about spontaneous political expression by their own people.
</P>
<P>
   China's leadership sees the first trip to Beijing by an American
president in more than nine years as a major event. In Chinese
eyes, Clinton's presence will ratify China's status as a world
power and symbolize its full return from the international
isolation that followed the 1989 massacre of democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Beijing also seems to anticipate
substantive accomplishments from Clinton's meetings with President
Jiang Zemin, although that seems unrealistic given the concerns in
Washington over alleged Chinese donations to the 1996 Democratic
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The importance China's leadership attaches to the Clinton visit
has left it particularly anxious about unscripted events. China's
great fear is that democratic protesters will capitalize on the
presence of a large international press corps to publicize their
cause. That is just what happened during the early weeks of the
Tiananmen Square demonstrations, which coincided with a historic
visit to Beijing by Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, and much of the rest of the world, will not judge
China favorably for enforced silence on its streets. What would
impress them far more would be a return to the slightly increased
tolerance for political debate that began to appear in China
earlier this spring. &QL;

SECLUDED IN MARBLEHEAD, WOODWARD FACES THE FUTURE

<P>
   MARBLEHEAD, Mass. _ Freed from the possibility of returning to
jail, Louise Woodward remained a sort of captive Tuesday, holed up
behind the shuttered windows of a friend's home here, awaiting her
passport before flying home to England.
</P>
<P>
   The object of intense international media attention, Woodward
made only one brief appearance outside the house, joining two
friends for a high-spirited sprint around the backyard. As she
smiled and laughed, a small corps of photographers hustled into
position to record the moment.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Woodward, 20, must stay in the United States, owing to
a legal technicality plus the fact that courts in Suffolk County
will be closed Wednesday in observance of Bunker Hill Day.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's passport was turned over to authorities while the
appeal of her conviction in the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen
was pending. The state Supreme Judicial Court Tuesday finally
decided that appeal, affirming her manslaughter conviction and
clearing the way for her departure _ except that the SJC must first
formally file its decision _ which it can't do until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the suggestion of Woodward's defense attorneys, Middlesex
County District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly agreed to request an
expedited filing of the SJC decision. ``The sooner she is gone, the
better,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, as she awaited the SJC decision, Woodward
stayed with Timothy and Jane Hunt, who are active in an
organization that aids British citizens in America.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, friends visited the Hunts. ``She's fine, she's
healthy and she's beautiful,'' one woman said upon exiting the
house.
</P>
<P>
   But also arriving at the the gray clapboard home on Marblehead
Neck were court officials with notice that Louise Woodward had been
named as a defendant in a civil suit filed in federal court by
Deborah and Sunil Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, a federal marshal handed Woodward a summons to
appear at a hearing on the civil suit today before US District
Court Judge William G. Young. It was not clear whether she would
appear or have a lawyer represent her. Federal courts are open
despite the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks to make sure Woodward does not benefit from
selling her story to media outlets _ talk shows, movie producers,
or book publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Boston defense lawyer Norman Zalkind arrived at
the Hunt's house.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward is legally required to leave the country as soon as her
passport is returned, legal specialists say, because the visa that
allowed her to enter the country under an au pair contract had
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Services officials said that if
Woodward wants to later come back to the United States, she would
have to apply for entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elements of her conviction would be reviewed to see if it
was a crime of violence and if she should be admitted to the
country,'' said William Strassberger, an INS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In England Tuesday, officials said Woodward's future prospects
in employment would not be harmed by her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposite is likely to happen,'' said Andrew Miller, the
member of Parliament for Woodward's home district of Cheshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the families she knows will hire her as a child
minder,'' he said. ``I don't think anyone has lost faith in her
whatsoever.''

</P>
<P>
   Woodward is legally required to leave the country as soon as her
passport is returned, legal specialists say, because the visa that
allowed her to enter the country under an au pair contract had
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Services officials said that if
Woodward wants to later come back to the United States, she would
have to apply for entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elements of her conviction would be reviewed to see if it
was a crime of violence and if she should be admitted to the
country,'' said William Strassberger, an INS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In England Tuesday, officials said Woodward's future prospects
in employment would not be harmed by her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposite is likely to happen,'' said Andrew Miller, the
member of Parliament for Woodward's home district of Cheshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the families she knows will hire her as a child
minder,'' he said. ``I don't think anyone has lost faith in her
whatsoever.''

Even Tiger takes back seat 
to `person in the golf cart'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ It was almost like old times Tuesday for the boys
from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods and Casey Martin played a practice round together at
the Olympic Club, a site they visited on countless occasions when
they were members of the Stanford golf team. It really wasn't that
long ago when the two were collegians, worrying about exams,
professors and beating up on rival teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps it was a lifetime ago for the pair, who have
found fame in the world of professional golf for two very different
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Woods entered this 1998 U.S. Open with all of the fuss and
fanfare that has accompanied him everywhere he has gone since he
left Stanford and turned professional in 1996, taking the PGA Tour
by storm. There was the usual collection of security guards and
police watching his every move, and scores of fans shouted his name
as he made his way around the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   But just as intense was the activity surrounding Martin, who is
possibly the only golfer in the world currently capable of taking
the spotlight off Woods. Martin doesn't have the game of Woods or
the flamboyant air of Woods or the track record of Woods, but he
entered his first Open as at least as big of a story as the
superstar with whom he played side by side at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was asked how it felt coming into a week being only the
second-biggest story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is great,'' he replied, flashing his famous smile.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, would love the attention if it were coming
because of his golf game. But it isn't. And Martin is at peace with
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that day will come,'' Martin said. ``That is going
to happen because of playing well. And if that does happen, that
will be great. If it doesn't, I understand why. And I just accept
that. I will always probably be known as `the person in the golf
cart.' And I can handle that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful for the opportunity to be out here competing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Martin is a lot of things to a lot of people.
He's the person in the golf cart. The little guy who went up
against the PGA Tour and won. The hero of the disabled. The
inspiration for everyone who has been told he or she couldn't do
something. The man who, against all odds, is playing in the 1998
U.S. Open Championship using a golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing how things happen,'' Martin said. ``I would have
never dreamt it. I am just thrilled to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin made himself a household name earlier this year when he
took the PGA Tour to court in order to be allowed to use a golf
cart in competition. Martin was born with a rare circulatory
disorder in his right leg and doesn't have the stamina to withstand
the rigors of walking a golf course. But he has the game to compete
on the professional level.
</P>
<P>
   So Martin sued the tour and won, playing on the Nike Tour with
the use of a cart. And the USGA decided to accept that ruling for
the Open as well, allowing Martin the use of a cart in qualifying
and this week in the championship.
</P>
<P>
   If they hadn't, Martin said he would never have played.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had not extended me the golf cart, I would not be
playing, because I just would not have done that,'' Martin said.
``I was not in the position to pursue legally against them. I am
not saying I couldn't have won or not, but I just wasn't willing to
go through that.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the use of a cart, it hasn't been easy for Martin.
The USGA originally wanted Martin to use a specially designed
single-rider cart, but it proved to be nothing but trouble. On
Monday, Martin's single-rider cart broke down twice during his
practice round, at one time forcing Martin to walk three holes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the USGA agreed to let Martin use a conventional
cart during tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided from a safety standpoint, especially from a
spectator-safety standpoint, that we are better off providing the
regular, traditional golf cart for Casey, and we think that is the
right thing to do,'' said USGA official Mike Butz.
</P>
<P>
   While the use of a cart continues to be a subject of great
controversy on tour, Martin said he has received nothing but
support from fans and players this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without exception, everyone has been just extremely kind to me
and extending me support,'' Martin said. ``It has been great. It
has been a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are a number of players who are against the idea of
a cart being used in competition. Among the most vocal is Jack
Nicklaus, and Tom Watson concurs but maintains he feels
``compassion'' for Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Martin was not without his supporters, his former teammate
from Stanford to name just one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is great that he played,'' Woods said. ``He
qualified. He earned his way out here. And he is going to go out
here and play a golf course that he is familiar with. I think it is
great. It shows a lot of courage on his part to deal with all of
the things that he has had to deal with, with the lawsuit and all
the distractions, while trying to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to be able to go out and qualify, especially the way he
did, that shows a lot of guts. That is what he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   The words were especially meaningful coming from Woods on
Tuesday afternoon. On Tuesday morning, Martin sank a pretty putt
for birdie on No. 18 that won him all the ``skins'' in the
unofficial match that Woods and Martin played during their practice
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Woods said with a grin, ``I was taken for some cash
today.''
</P>
<P>
   And he never enjoyed paying more.

RELIGIOUS LEAD ERS JOIN FIGHT AGAINST CHILD ABUSE, DOMES TIC
VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CLAY THOMPSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phoenix area religious leaders Tuesday signed onto
Gov. Jane Hull's campaign against child abuse and domestic violence
by pledging to raise the issue in hundreds of congregations across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to scratch our fingernails across the blackboards of
the consciousness of every church, mosque and synagogue,'' Dr. Paul
Eppinger, director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council, said before a
meeting of about 100 religion, education and business leaders at
St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd were representatives of the Catholic, Mormon and
Jewish faiths and several Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Warren Stewart, pastor of First Institutional Baptist
Church, Phoenix, told the group the religious community ``needs to
first of all repent of how we've been silent on child abuse and
family violence. Churches have looked the other way, many times
because it involved our own parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church must rise up and stop child abuse and family
violence by being peacemakers and not just peace lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eppinger said the Ecumenical Council will encourage the faith
community to join the state's public awareness campaign planned for
October.
</P>
<P>
   The council, which represents about 700 churches, will dedicate
its annual Children's Sabbath weekend _ Oct. 16-18 _ to raising the
issues of abuse and violence in churches. Each day of the following
week will be dedicated to one aspect of the problem _ verbal,
emotional, physical or sexual abuse and community violence.
Religious groups will be asked to dedicate each day to preaching,
teaching or acting on the issues, Eppinger said.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend of Oct. 24-25, the council will sponsor a gun
buy-back program and distribute gun safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   Information packets recently were sent to 3,800 churches,
synagogues and mosques around the state to encourage them to speak
out on the issue, Eppinger said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17 the council also will sponsor a training program for
clergy and laypeople on addressing problems of abuse and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Edward Ryle, executive director of the Arizona
Catholic Conference, said the state ``by its enthusiasm for
executing people who are mentally ill, poor or themselves the
victims of child abuse is making a statement that violence is a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Reich, director of the Governor's Office for Community
and Family Programs, brought a message from Hull, who said,
``Government cannot solve this problem, and you by yourselves as
houses of faith cannot solve the problem and business cannot solve
the problem, but maybe together we can solve the problem.'' &QL;

DEFENDING CHAMPION ELS SAYS HIS BACK REMAINS SORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ernie Els has resigned himself to playing this
year's U.S. Open with a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   Els, the defending champion, has been undergoing treatment since
he abruptly pulled out of the Buick Classic last Thursday, after
playing nine holes of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   But during a news conference Tuesday at the Olympic Club, Els
admitted that he is not 100 percent, and the world's No. 2-ranked
player was obviously disappointed that he will not be at full
strength when the year's second major begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the way you want to feel playing in a major
tournament,'' said Els, who also won the U.S. Open in 1994. ``It is
a lot better than it was Thursday, but it is still a day-to-day
thing. Obviously, it is the wrong timing for me to get this kind of
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Els said his back has been bothering him for three weeks, and
that the spasms worsened last Wednesday. The pain is in his lower
back, near the left side of his spine, and while it is expected to
clear up with treatment, the healing process may take three or four
weeks. Els is being treated by Tom Boers, a noted back specialist
who works with Fred Couples, Davis Love III and several other
professional golfers.
</P>
<P>
   The injury could make Els tentative when hitting from Olympic's
five-inch-deep rough. He did not hit a golf ball last weekend, and
even after Tuesday's practice round, he did not plan to work on the
driving range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have really got to take it easy,'' he said. ``When you feel
the pain, you don't want to aggravate it more.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Els sounded worried, Tiger Woods sounded confident.
Woods, the world's No. 1-ranked player, has also been dealing with
back trouble recently, and he withdrew from the Kemper Open two
weeks ago. But Woods declared himself at full strength Tuesday. And
after struggling to a tie for 19th last year, he was eager to
disprove criticism that his game does not suit the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like when people say that,'' said Woods, who has spent the
past week fine-tuning his game with his coach, Butch Harmon. ``It
definitely gets me a little revved up. My preparation has been very
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said his recent back pain was nothing serious, and was
mostly caused by jogging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing a lot of golf, and I was doing a lot of
roadwork,'' he said. ``All of a sudden, I went from no miles to
running four, five, six miles every day. That puts a little stress
on your back, and I felt a little twinging, a little tightening,
and a couple of spasms. I decided to pull out of Kemper, saw my
trainer, and basically just stretched it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Woods will face a severe test this week, as will everyone
in the field. Olympic's Lake course puts a premium on accuracy
instead of distance. Not only are the fairways lined by deep rough,
but they slope to either side. During Tuesday's practice rounds,
many balls that landed in the fairway still rolled into the rough.
And with sunny weather predicted all week, the course should play
even faster by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympic Club last held the U.S. Open, in 1987, Scott
Simpson won with a final score of 277, three under par. Don't look
for anything lower this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year, we are going to see over par win the
tournament,'' said Tom Watson, who finished one stroke behind
Simpson in 1987. ``The rough is the most difficult I have seen in
the U.S. Open. You are lucky to be able to move it 50 or 60
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, players will continue adjusting to the nuances of
Olympic. And when the first round begins Thursday, most players
expect a wide-open tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty guys could win this tournament,'' Simpson said. ``That
always cracked me up when guys said there are five or 10 guys who
could win. You've got to be kidding me. A lot of guys have a shot
at it.'' &QL;

WITH A BRONX CHEER, GRAMMYS GO WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a playful but pointed rebuke to New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the head of the organization that runs the
Grammy Awards announced Tuesday that next year's event would be
held in Los Angeles, at the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as no surprise in the wake of a
high-profile feud earlier this year between Giuliani and Michael
Greene, the head of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences. The dispute ended with the mayor stating that New York
doesn't need the Grammys. ``If they want to go to L.A., they can,''
he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Grammy Awards have alternated between Los
Angeles and New York, with each city competing for the increase in
tourism, revenue and publicity the ceremony brings with it. For the
past two years, the Grammy Awards have been held in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his differences with Giuliani, Greene said the
ceremony would continue to alternate between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   What was a surprise was the way the announcement was handled.
Instead of trying to downplay the conflict, which began when
Giuliani accused Greene of verbally abusing a mayoral aide during
the preparation for a press conference last January, Greene and Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan gloated.
</P>
<P>
   The press conference began with the Grammy-winning producers
David Foster and Phil Ramone, who is also the chairman of the
Grammy organization, playing piano as a choir sang a New
York-bashing song, a variation of Randy Newman's ``I Love L.A.,''
that began, ``Oh, New York City, it's cold and it's damp. And all
those cabbies act so grumpy. Let's leave Manhattan to the
Eskimos.''
</P>
<P>
   Fanning the flames of rivalry higher, Riordan said in a speech
that ``a certain Rudy'' boasted on ``Late Show With David
Letterman'' that New York can kick any other city in the rear. But,
Riordan pointed out, ``I'm here to tell you that you have to be
behind somebody'' to kick them in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``And L.A. is far ahead of anyone when it comes to music,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite this ribbing and the criticism he has weathered for
alienating the Grammys over a personal matter, Giuliani was
unrepentant. ``Well, I wasn't too disappointed that they left,'' he
said from City Hall on Tuesday. ``I thought the person who ran the
Grammys was abusive and, you know, the city had a record year for
tourism last year. It's going to have a record year for tourism
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people from the entertainment business didn't agree with
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame,'' Judy West, a spokeswoman for Local 802
of the American Federation of Musicians, which represents 10,000
musicians in New York City and on Long Island, said about the loss
of the Grammys. ``New York is supposedly the cultural capital of
the world. It belongs here. It brings in $40 million, which you
can't just write off with the flick of your wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   (Though other organizations have also estimated the city's
revenue at $40 million, the New York City Convention and Visitors
Bureau has said the figure is actually $23.2 million.)
</P>
<P>
   With construction of the Staples arena, which will be larger
than Shrine Auditorium, scheduled to be completed at the end of
this year, Los Angeles city officials said they had hoped the new
building would become a new permanent home for the Grammys. In an
interview after the press conference, however, Greene said that he
had received phone calls from every major record label asking him
to bring the Grammys back to New York in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, however, isn't ready to campaign for the Grammys to
return to New York, as he has in the past, saying that he wasn't
``going to work too hard on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they change their behavior, we'll be really happy to have
them back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the Grammys and Giuliani administration
comes at a turbulent time for Greene and the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences. Over the past year, the accuracy of
the National Academy's reports of its philanthropic activities has
been called into question as has an investigation by the National
Academy clearing Greene of sexual harassment charges, which Greene
denies.

MARINE CITES SPLIT ON JET ACCIDENT REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ One of the authors of a Marine report that
blamed a jet's Italian ski-lift cable accident on crew error
testified on Tuesday that the investigating board was divided over
how to apportion responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Thomas Blickensderfer, a defense witness at a hearing to
determine what charges should be brought against the pilot and the
navigator of the Marine jet, also said that the plane might have
been too low because of an optical illusion induced by flying from
a narrow valley into a broader one. He said that in the
investigation of the Feb. 3 accident, in which 20 people in a
gondola died, he retraced the route in a simulator several times
and faced the same illusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down to just a few hundred feet, without even knowing
it,'' said Blickensderfer, who is the director of operations at the
Cherry Point Marine base in Havelock, N.C., where the crew was
based.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, might have
seen the uppermost of six cables and believed it was the only one,
misjudged its height and dived to get under it.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing ended on Tuesday after two days that centered on
Ashby and his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, and four days
last month that focused on the electronic warfare officers in the
back seat, Capt. William Raney II, and Capt. Chandler Seagraves.
</P>
<P>
   The investigating officer, Lt. Col. Ronald Rodgers, will write a
recommendation on what charges should be brought in a court
martial. Rodgers must decide whether the crew's action could
constitute involuntary manslaughter, defined as involving ``a
negligent act or omission which, when viewed in the light of human
experience, might foreseeably result in the death of another.''
They could also be tried for negligent homicide, a lesser offense,
and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers did not say when he would file his report, but under
military rules he must give a decision in the case of the two
back-seat officers later this month. A court martial could come in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony on Tuesday, Blickensderfer faulted the Air Force
for failing to keep the Marine aviators well informed about local
rules and conditions as they rotated through the Aviano air base,
where the Prowler jet involved in the crash was based. He said the
Marine squadrons had done a poor job of keeping their files current
on flight information, and weeding out old materials.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident, local rules set a minimum height
above ground level of 2,000 feet but everyone in the Marine
squadron said that they believed it was 1,000 feet, and some of the
material on file in the flight operations center gave an even lower
number for some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Blickensderfer said that if he had conducted the investigation
alone, ``I would have done a lot of things differently,'' and that
the report, released in March, had been rewritten repeatedly to
gain consensus.
</P>
<P>
   One issue in the hearing was why the Marines Corps did not
follow the usual practice in such incidents, which is to quickly
convene a safety investigation, offering immunity to the crew in
exchange for their description of what happened, and then to
conduct a separate criminal investigation. Defense lawyers accused
the Corps of being more interested in prosecution than in
preventing a repetition of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   That position was supported in part by Blickensderfer. He
testified that he had been told by Gen. Michael Ryan, the commander
of all the Prowler squadrons, that there would be no such safety
investigation because Italian Premier Romana Prodi had warned
President Clinton in a telephone conversation, ``You Americans may
never operate out of Italy again.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Defense Department officials were afraid that an offer of
immunity in a safety investigation would outrage the Italians,
Blickensderfer said.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, lawyers for the defendants said that
Rogers should recommend dropping the charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Maj. Vernon Couch, a prosecutor, said the crew must have
deliberately broken the rules. They thought they were supposed to
be at 1,000 feet, he said, but hit a cable at 264 feet. ``It is not
a mere mistake,'' he said. ``You just don't blink your eyes and get
down 634 feet.''

   NEW YORK _ Sounding at times both righteous and wary, the City
Council voted Tuesday to override the vetoes of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, restoring roughly $200 million to the first budget in
memory to be passed without the mayor's consent.
</P>
<P>
   As the cheers and applause of social service advocates rained
down on them from the Council Chamber mezzanine, council members
took turns declaring personal pride in voting, 44-7, to override
the mayor's vetoes. In addition to fighting for the after-school
programs, the centers of the elderly and other items that would
have been cut, they said they were sending a message to Giuliani:
The legislative branch of city government is no longer fearful of
exercising its powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling upon the other side of the hall finally to make
peace now,'' said the council speaker, Peter Vallone. ``Stop the
missiles coming from the other end. This is now the law _ the law
for every citizen of this city. It will be the law as soon as we
override. And once that law takes effect, no one person in this
city _ no matter who he or she is _ is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath all the hurrahs and lectern-pounding ran an
undercurrent of fear. By adopting their own $34 billion budget, the
council members were well aware of Giuliani's promise to exact
vengeance by freezing spending and delaying contracts with various
nonprofit agencies.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, at the same time that the Democrat-controlled
council was ceremoniously rebuking him, the mayor reiterated the
threat. He said that once the new fiscal year began on July 1, he
would take steps to contain what he called an irresponsible budget,
stuffed with special-interest spending, that will bloat the city's
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for negotiations,'' the mayor said. ``We will
carry out the powers that the City Charter gives the mayor to hold
spending back, which I'm allowed to do, and there are several
different ways in which I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Jones, the deputy director of Neighborhood Defender
Service, a group in Harlem that provides legal services to 2,500
families a year, was one of several advocates who voiced fears that
the budget battle could curtail or eliminate their programs. He
said that the mayor's vetoes had wiped out 80 percent of the
group's annual budget of $2.5 million; the rest came from the state
and was recently vetoed by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue for us is what happens now,'' Jones said.
``We're going to close if the mayor starts impounding funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns like those of Jones are why Madeline Provenzano, a
Democratic council member from the Bronx, told her colleagues that
``I don't share in the joy.'' Although she was also voting to
override the mayor's vetoes, she said, his inevitable response
``makes me very nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Giuliani keeps his promise to freeze spending or
cancel contracts, council leaders say they will sue _ a day in
court that the mayor's aides say they eagerly await. Until then,
both sides continue to blame each other in trying to explain why a
budget with a $2 billion surplus has become so contentious.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes down to the city's two highest-elected
officials, who accuse each other of following agendas that have
little to do with the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone once again said that the budget impasse occurred because
he refused to drop his call for a referendum on whether tax money
should pay for a stadium in Manhattan for the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's focused on one thing and one thing only,'' the
speaker said at a news conference, his tone suggesting a struggle
to contain his incredulity. ``It's the most important thing in his
life, it's the most important thing for this city: that we must
find a way to relocate Yankee Stadium from the Bronx to
Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   And Giuliani once again suggested that all of Vallone's recent
actions _ from the referendum to the budget _ were designed to aid
his campaign for governor. ``This is a gubernatorial election-year
budget on behalf of the speaker,'' he said. ``That's the whole way
it's played out today. It's almost like a convention, not a City
Council hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Once talks collapsed, the two sides began to play budgetary
chess, using the City Charter for their rule book. First came the
council's adoption of its own budget, which was virtually identical
to the one presented by the mayor, save for some tax-cut proposals.
Then came Giuliani's vetoes of about $201 million from the expense
budget, $315 from the capital budget, and $165 million from a
debt-retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday came the expected veto override. But no matter how
predictable the council's recent actions may have appeared,
political analysts and council members say, they reflect an unusual
display of independence and strength.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Schwarz Jr., the chairman of the charter revision
commission that in 1989 changed the structure of city government,
said that one of the goals of the panel was to give the council
more say in the budget and in land use. Previously, the council had
been seen by some as a haven for those who bartered in patronage
and pork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have a council that was a strong counterweight to
a strong Mayor and we thought that the council could be the more
representative body,'' Schwarz said. ``You want an executive who is
checked, and the best way to do that is with a popularly elected
legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schwarz and others say, the council took its time in
fully realizing its new-found powers. ``I think that they've begun
to do well in lots of fields,'' he said. ``But it's been clear that
over the last eight to 10 years, they've needed to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The council and Vallone have often been accused of not
challenging Giuliani enough on past budget issues.

FUEL CELL WILL SUPPLY POWER TO N.Y. TEST HOUSE

(th) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, an energy technology called a
fuel cell will supply all the power to a suburban house, another
sign that fuel cells are on the verge of acceptance as an
economical alternative to traditional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of fuel cells _ which convert liquid fuel into
electricity through a chemical reaction rather than combustion _
has been around for more than 100 years. But until recently, fuel
cells were so expensive that it was practical only for NASA's
specialized use on space missions. But the cells being tested now
are powerful, flexible and reliable enough to work as an affordable
earth-bound energy source.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a team of engineers will cut off the electricity
the local utility company provides to a brick ranch-style house in
Latham, N.Y., and switch on a back-porch component that looks more
like a home central air-conditioning unit than the small chemical
plant it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in the past few weeks include the first commercial
sale of a fuel cell for remote power (to the New Jersey Department
of Transportation, for a traffic warning sign) and the first
street-ready car powered by a fuel cell (built by students at
Humboldt State University in California). And in April, Ford put
$420 million into Ballard Power Systems, a fuel cell company in
Vancouver, British Columbia, in which Daimler-Benz already has a
major investment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Energy Department, which is helping to pay for
the test in Latham, say they have high hopes that within a few
years thousands of homes will be drawing electric power from fuel
cells powered by natural gas or propane, cutting pollution and
consuming less fuel than conventional energy production.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, we've seen significant breakthroughs,'' said
Energy Secretary Federico Pena in a telephone interview. ``We're
going to see fuel cells in homes, cars and other uses much sooner
than we had predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reicher, the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and
renewable energy, said, ``The launch of a fuel-cell-powered house
is up there with the introduction of the electric refrigerator, the
room air-conditioner and the fluorescent light.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made fuel cells more practical has been improvements in
the gossamer-thin components, which look like plastic food wrap or
aluminum foil, that are used to turn a basic chemical reaction _
the combination of oxygen and hydrogen to make water _ into the
basis of an energy revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the fuel cell being used in house in Latham and
being studied for use in automobiles is called a proton-exchange
membrane. When a hydrogen atom _ one proton and one electron _ is
pressed against that membrane, the proton passes through and the
electron is left behind. That creates a positive charge on one side
of the membrane and a negative charge on the other; wire them
together, and the result is a flow of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Leonard, the program supervisor for fuel cells at
California's South Coast Air Quality Management District, one of
many government agencies eagerly watching the research, said:
``Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is a simple process that
takes electricity. Combining them to make water and electricity,
well, you don't get much simpler than that. I don't think there are
many doubters.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Michael Walsh, a mechanical engineer who is a
consultant to the company running the Latham test, Plug Power, and
who lives in the house five days a week with, among other devices,
a stereo, a personal computer and a clock radio that wakes him in
the morning. They will operate the same, whatever the electricity
source, he said, and people inside the house ``won't know whether
we are running on the grid or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the breakthroughs, fuel cells are still much too
expensive for everyday use. The car companies, which would probably
be the biggest users of an efficient fuel cell, say that they still
cost roughly 100 times more per horsepower than an internal
combustion engine does. Chrysler, for example, figures that each
car-sized fuel-cell stack it buys costs $170,000. And running
houses on fuel cells is substantially more expensive than relying
on power from conventional utility plants.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power will not say what its prototype cost, arguing that
the figure is about as relevant as the cost of producing the first
automobile of a model year; it is astronomical but allows the
production of thousands more units at lower cost. Plug Power
predicts that it can commercialize fuel cells for houses by 2000,
at a cost of $3,000 to $5,000 each. Detroit Edison, a part-owner of
Plug Power, plans to purchase 30,000 to 50,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey company, H-Power, also hopes for mass sales. In
March it made what it describes as the first ever unsubsidized,
fully commercial sale of a fuel cell that will supply energy for a
trailer-mounted highway sign, the kind that are commonly used to
warn of construction projects along the roadway. The company will
supply 65 of them for $759,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an arms-length sale, with no subsidies, with a warranty
and all the aspects of a commercial sale,'' said Arthur Kaufman, an
executive at H-Power.

SOME WILL MISS OUT ON BIG PAYDAY AT GOLDMAN, SACHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bankers call it ``yesterday's trade'' _ the one buy or sell
order that might have made an easy million had it only been
executed. For retired, resigned and might-have-been partners of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the announcement on Monday that the private
investment bank would go public was the ultimate missed
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most junior of Goldman's 190 general partners, the
young recruits who received the coveted brass ring at the last
selection in 1996, are each likely to have a stake in the company
valued at $50 million or more after Goldman issues stock. That
figure tops what a general partner who spent a lifetime there
received upon retirement as recently as a year ago, retired
partners say.
</P>
<P>
   Some 36 partners left the firm, becoming ``limited'' in
Goldman's parlance, after the company had a tough year in 1994.
Many others have slid from Goldman's all-time-consuming embrace to
teach, found boutique investment houses or, in the case of Robert
Rubin, become treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   They missed payday. Though Goldman had considered going public
many times before, its partnership will not sell out more than
once, and only its current general partners have guaranteed
ownership stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine and Henry Paulson Jr., Goldman's co-leaders, vow to
spread shares generously in the new Goldman, whose market value is
expected to reach as high as $30 billion. But the leaders' main
targets are Goldman's nonpartner, front-line employees. Those who
have retired, and certainly those who quit during the prime of
their careers, do not expect to see big bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Pity, for example, Jack Salzman. A highly rated equity analyst
and former Goldman partner, he left the firm and became limited in
December of last year to set up his own investment fund. Though he
retains equity in the firm, it will be returned to him at close to
its book value, while partners who stayed on six months longer will
see their equity stakes increase threefold or fourfold.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman is not eager to discuss the issue. ``I am very happy
running my hedge fund, and I have absolutely nothing else to say,''
he said when reached by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Another near miss is the company's respected stock-market
strategist Abby Joseph Cohen. Ms. Cohen has consistently predicted
a strongly rising stock market, making her advice _ and by
extension, Goldman's advice _ the most lucrative on Wall Street.
But Ms. Cohen is not a partner, and some at Goldman considered her
a sure shot for partner this year _ if there were still
partnerships to award.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen did not return calls to her office seeking comment.
But colleagues at the firm expect that she will be among the most
highly compensated of Goldman's managing directors when it comes to
passing out stock.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 115 limited partners are another story. Some, including John
Weinberg, a respected former chairman, opposed Goldman's decision
to go public at a partners' meeting last weekend, though he himself
led a similar drive to consider ending the partnership in 1986.
Other limited partners supported the company's decision to sell
stock, though they derive no major benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has yet to work out how to deal with limited partners.
All of them have capital invested in Goldman in a form equivalent
to preferred nonvoting stock. They receive fixed-interest payments,
more like debt than equity.
</P>
<P>
   Unless new arrangements are made, limited partners will lose
this investment opportunity. And a few of them, including some who
spent their lives building Goldman into an investment-banking
powerhouse, have voiced complaints that the firm has forgotten
their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Some limited partners who asked not to be identified by name
said they had heard that Goldman was planning to force them to cash
out on unfavorable terms or to convert their stakes to equity at a
modest premium.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns appear to have been put to rest. A group of 30
gathered at Goldman's Broad Street headquarters Tuesday morning and
met with Corzine. Two interviewed afterward said their earlier
fears were unfounded. A Goldman person who attended the session
said the firm would seek ways to keep the limited partners, and
their capital, involved with the firm even after it goes public.

THOUSANDS OF PHOENIX RESIDENTS EXPECTED TO REAPPLY FOR FOOD
STAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ More than 4,000 Arizona residents are expected to
reapply for food stamps after Congress voted this month to restore
the benefits to needy legal immigrants over 64 and under 19 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 are among 13,000 Arizona residents of all ages who
lost their food stamps in September after federal lawmakers
stripped legal immigrants of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't expect the food stamps to arrive until they are
shopping for Christmas dinner. Eligible legal immigrants won't be
able to apply until November. It takes about 30 days to process the
application and get the benefits to each individual, Department of
Economic Security officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delay, many are applauding the move as a first step
in the right direction. About 250,000 older and younger legal
immigrants across the country are expected to reapply for food
stamps, or 30 percent of those who lost benefits last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's got to be a tremendous help,'' says Ginny Hildebrand,
executive director of the Association of Arizona Food Banks, ``not
only to them but to the emergency food network.''
</P>
<P>
   After Congress voted to make legal immigrants ineligible for
food stamps, 18 states voted to continue to pay for those benefits
out of state funds. Arizona was not among them, and the state's
food banks were flooded with families suddenly unable to put food
on the table. Southern Arizona food banks are especially hard-hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't come soon enough,'' says Ronna Sue Stubbs, executive
director of Yuma Community Food Bank, about the restoration. The
demand for emergency food boxes in her food bank has jumped 40
percent over June 1997, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Economic Security officials say they will rely on
food bank officials to help them design an outreach program to find
eligible individuals and make sure they reapply for benefits. &QL;

PASSAGE APPEARS UNLIKELY FOR BANKING BILL THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Tuesday all but
doomed efforts to update the United States' financial-services law
this year, saying that it would not budge from its opposition to
the bill passed last month by the House and that it wanted to start
over next year.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury Department official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the administration saw no prospect of compromise
among the banking, securities and insurance industries, each of
which wants something slightly different from the proposed
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, the official said the Treasury
Department saw little or no chance of coming to an agreement with
the Federal Reserve Board over one of the most contentious issues
surrounding the bill: whether Treasury or the Fed should be the
primary bank regulator.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, which passed by one vote and faces a veto threat
by the White House, would effectively strip the Treasury of its
power to oversee national banks and shift considerable authority to
the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is scheduled to outline the
administration's position on Wednesday at a hearing before the
Senate Banking Committee. The committee's chairman, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., has been exploring whether there is enough common
ground within the industry and between the regulatory bodies to
move ahead with a Senate version of the bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been under pressure from Wall Street, insurers and
some big banks to try to rush a bill through the Senate this year
and end a decades-long stalemate in Congress over updating the
Depression-era laws that erected barriers between banks, brokerage
firms and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Big mergers such as the proposed combination of Citicorp and
Travelers Group have added to pressure from the industry to have
the law recognize the rapid changes sweeping the financial-services
market.
</P>
<P>
   But in signaling Tuesday that it is unwilling to compromise at
this point, the administration has given D'Amato no room to find a
workable solution.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury official said the administration continued to
support efforts to modernize the legislation. But he said the
administration wanted to begin a new effort next year, a strategy
that would allow it to avoid using the House version of the bill as
a starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think time is needed to work out the consensus this bill
ought to have,'' the Treasury official said. ``With relatively few
days left in this session, it's not likely that thoughtful
attention to these issues will be possible.''

SENATE PANEL PONDERS LONG-TERM EFFECT OF MERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Confronted with a merger wave that is reshaping
industries like banking, communications and military contracting,
the Senate Judiciary Committee began debating Tuesday whether the
trend was going too far and putting workers, consumers and the
economy's long-term health at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The initial answer, from the White House and from Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, was that despite the
headline-grabbing deals, there is little evidence so far of
excessive consolidation. But the session highlighted some
continuing political tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, a champion of unfettered markets, questioned one of
the tenets of current antitrust policy: the idea that the
government could determine in advance which planned mergers would
prove to be anti-competitive and head them off. Given the speed of
technological change, Greenspan said, it might be better to wait
and see which mergers actually create competition problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel very uncomfortable if we inhibited various
different types of mergers or acquisitions on the basis of some
presumed projection as to how markets would evolve, how technology
would evolve, because history is strewn with people making
projections which have turned out to be grossly inaccurate,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's views were disputed by the government's two top
antitrust regulators, Joel Klein, an assistant attorney general,
and Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

   ``The problem is that if you challenge the merger before it
happens, it's not very expensive to remedy it,'' Pitofsky told the
senators. ``After the merger, after the assets are scrambled, the
employees have been fired, the management has gone elsewhere, the
factories have been sold for junk in some other country, then
putting the company back in business is enormously expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the committee's chairman, said it was
important for policy-makers to step back and examine long-term
consequences. But, he added, it is also important to avoid
``simple, reflexive'' reactions based either on the notion that big
is by definition bad or that markets would ultimately take care of
competition problems on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the committee suggested that they and their
constituents were ready to challenge business combinations that
they saw as rewarding corporate executives and shareholders but
leaving workers and communities out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really come to question how much we should be
laissez-faire when it comes to this whole era of merger and
acquisition,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has undertaken its own review of
merger activity. But in testimony before the committee Tuesday,
Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House's Council of
Economic Advisers, suggested that the administration was not overly
concerned about the merger boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence we have does not suggest any alarming trend
toward economic activity being concentrated in large firms,'' Ms.
Yellen said.

PAGE FIRES BACK AT DUCKS
</HEADLINE>

By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; COSTA MESA -- One day after the Mighty Ducks finished the
Pierre Page chapter of the team's history by firing the coach, Page
fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite what (Anaheim general manager) Jack (Ferreira) said
yesterday I don't believe what he says,'' Pagee said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Page and Ferreira's relationship goes back 18 years, but Page
said being fired by a friend wasn't nearly as upsetting as the
reason he gave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to God that you didn't bring me here because I was your
friend,'' Page said he told Ferreira on Monday. ``I hope you
brought me here because you knew I could do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind you firing me even though I'm one of your
friends, but don't tell me it was philosophical differences. There
is something else. If you don't want to tell me the real reason
that's your choice, but I don't buy this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent differences, especially in player personal matters,
werethe main factors in Page's dismissal, according to Ferreira,
but Tuesday Page insisted he was just trying to help the club from
retaining the status quo, something he said Ferreira had expressed
grave concerns about over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him `don't worry, I'll keep pushing, I'll disagree with
you, I'll disagree with anybody, just keep pushing to make sure
things keep happening,''' explained Page, who says he has no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy in our business to be quiet ... the best thing in
life is to stand up and be counted and if it means moving on, it
means moving on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that being fired doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement was like being knocked down and the season
was like being knocked down,'' said Page. ``I have a hard time
believing they brought me in for one year. I was more than shocked,
but this is what this business is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be frustrated, disappointed, but I don't have the right
to be the Ducks coach, I'd just like to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he came to Anaheim confident he could get the job done,
Page, 50, admitted he was never able escape Ron Wilson's sizeable
shadow -- even after the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   He hinted that Wilson's run to the Stanley Cup Finals might have
put the final nail in his coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end it seemed like I was going to be here and we were
going to find solutions together,'' Page said. ``(But) I think
every round Ron Wilson won it seemed to take a different course.
There was a lot of heat in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to believe you rejoice in the success of others, but
it created a lot of pressure in the organization and from what I
read in the papers yesterday fans and media seemed to be happy the
organization admitted they made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Page admits his mistake might have been looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Jack for 18 years, but maybe it was a mistake,'' he
said of joining forces with his old boss. ``Never try to go back to
the past, always look ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira was unavailable for comment. The Ducks' executive was
attending the NHL general managers meetings, which are taking place
in Washington D.C., where Wilson's Washington Capitals and the
Detroit Red Wings were playing Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals.

 &HT;    Klan to hold rally in Jasper
 &HT;    By MITCH MITCHELL
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two factions of the Ku Klux Klan have informed Jasper officials
they will be staging a rally 10 days from now in the same place a
prayer vigil for healing was held in the wake of the brutal
dragging death of James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction of the community and especially the white people
is fear and shame,'' Jasper Ministerial Alliance President Bobby
Hudson said. ``They want this thing to die, to go away. They don't
want this town to be totally divided.''
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney Gary Gatlin said Michael Lowe of Waco, regional
director of the Texas Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, contacted him
Monday and Tuesday to tell him the Klan would hold a rally between
noon and 2 p.m. June 27 at the Jasper County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said the Klan has been taking a beating in the press and
members of both groups, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and Knights
of the White Kamellia wanted an opportunity to set the record
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are appalled by this tragic death and we are glad that
arrests were made so quickly,'' Lowe said. ``We hope that if those
in jail are found guilty they are prosecuted to the fullest extent
of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said there are about 80 or 90 different groups under the
KKK umbrella nationwide and about nine of those groups are in
Texas. While Lowe said he cannot speak for all the groups sharing
the KKK name, he insist members of his group and the Knights of the
White Kamellia are not hateful or racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is for white people,'' Lowe said. ``The NAACP and
LULAC are targeting a certain group of people. Our group is trying
to make sure (whites) are not discriminated against. The pendulum
has swung too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said he could not deny the violent past of the KKK, but he
compared that organization's past to organized religion's past,
saying that organized religion had violent and cruel periods such
as the Crusades. Lowe said their intention is not to display any
firearms and not to use any racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper officials expect between 15 and 20 participants at the
rally, Gatlin said. This all comes in the aftermath of a prayer
vigil and funeral townspeople hoped would go a long way toward
healing wounds caused by a grisly murder authorities say was
racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, was chained to the back of a
pickup and dragged for three miles, authorities said. His head and
right arm were severed from his body during the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, of Sulphur Springs, and Jasper
residents Shawn Allen Berry and John William King, both 23, have
been charged with murder and are being held in Jasper County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to say that these two men are not part of their
groups and they denounce what they have done,'' Gatlin said.
</P>
<P>
   But others are more suspicious of the groups' intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are sincere, they must atone for the sins of the Klan
in the past and help the black man and woman toward freedom,
justice and equality,'' Robert Muhammad, Southwest regional
director of the Nation of Islam said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just condemning what happened to Mr. Byrd is not good enough,
because the history of the Klan since its founding has been one
that rivaled and exceeded what happened to Mr. Byrd,'' Muhammad
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said plans have been set in place to deal with the Klan
rally and the community is prepared for whatever the situation
brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the white leaders in the community to stand up for the
community just like we did when the black militants came to town,''
Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said there is concern that the appearance of white
supremacists might bring other black militants to town. Jasper was
visited by representatives of the Black Muslim Movement Friday and
the New Black Panther Party came to town on Saturday after Byrd's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The New Black Panthers embarked on an armed march throughout the
city after Byrd's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white ministers must let (the Klan) know that they cannot
separate us,'' Hudson said. ``But our strategy is peace and not in
your face.''
</P>
<P>
   On an Internet Web site message, the Vidor-based Knights of the
White Kamellia described itself as a ``legal, law-abiding, white
rights organization that does not condone violence in any form,''
an Associated Press story said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also claimed to have a chapter in Jasper County since
1996. Vidor is 55 miles south of Jasper in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Because the courthouse square is a public area, the groups did
not need permission for the rally, Gatlin said.

WHEN'S RIGHT TIME TO QUIT FOR RIPKEN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN.: Md.) 
 (ja) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ As long as we're debating the merits of fading stars
and imminent retirements, let's discuss Cal Ripken Jr., the
Baltimore Orioles' third baseman and baseball's monument to
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   In the years leading up to his breaking Lou Gehrig's record for
consecutive games played, Ripken willed himself into the lineup
every day. Metaphor-prone baseball writers wrote about heroism,
valor and the timeless American Ideal: the laborer who shows up for
work every day with lunch pail in hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening seasons things have taken a couple of turns
for the worse _ primarily Ripken's batting and fielding range. Now
the organization can't get Ripken, who is 37, out of the lineup.
Baseball-wise, the Orioles are in a state of paralysis, unable to
go forward or backward because this proud, aging superstar won't
give way.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, like Michael Jordan, has his own rules: For Ripken, they
include staying at a separate hotel on the road, having his own
doctor, and the power to determine, by himself, that he will be
penciled into the lineup every day.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Jordan, at age 35, still backs up his
self-made rules.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Yankees and Orioles players watched with millions
across the world as Jordan turned in an exemplary performance,
scoring 45 points and leading Chicago to a sixth National
Basketball Association championship.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the points, when the moment of truth arrived, Jordan
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken hasn't pulled the trigger at the moment of truth since
Sept. 6, 1996. He didn't get a hit to propel Baltimore into a World
Series, or win a Series. His moment of truth came in breaking
Gehrig's record by making his 2,131st consecutive start.
</P>
<P>
   Since then pitchers, apparently no longer fearful of injuring
Ripken, have mercilessly jammed him with inside pitches. He no
longer has the bat speed to pull the ball. When it comes to
production from third basemen, Baltimore is 11th in homers, last in
extra-base hits and 13th in slugging percentage. In the field,
Ripken's range is gone.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the source of Ripken's continued prima donna reign?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that he's a tourist attraction. This is the new
vista of baseball: the stadium and player as tourist attraction.
Ripken has become one of the sights: come to Baltimore to see Babe
Ruth's childhood home, the Edgar Allen Poe House, and Cal Ripken
play another game, drilling his name deeper into immortality.
Meanwhile, the Orioles spiral deeper into a hole.
</P>
<P>
   The game we know and love is changing before our eyes. It is
contrived, scripted. This is what Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has in
mind for Yankee Stadium when the team moves to Rudyland near Times
Square. On Monday the mayor was in Baltimore, raving about Camden
Yards. What a beautiful view of the city, he gushed, though all you
can really see is a cluster of buildings over the center-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the new Yankee Stadium be another New York tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani should know that the Inner Harbor wasn't always this
cute, cuddly beehive of commerce. This was a waterfront wasteland
with longshoremen, crabs, beer and rough living until the former
mayor, William Donald Schaffer, launched a drive to make the harbor
the centerpiece of a revitalization for the city.
</P>
<P>
   A visionary mayor would develop the Bronx, make that his Inner
Harbor initiative, bring light to dark places rather than more
light to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   There is a beautiful view from Yankee Stadium, though the vista
also includes signs of neglect and disdain for quality of life of
people who live around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no such blemishes in Rudy's World: a world of
upper class and middle class sensibilities: no woes, no worries.
Just the Game. When the Yankees do move to Rudy's Town, they won't
simply be tossing away tradition, but entering into a new dimension
of competition where the game becomes like drama at best, pro
wrestling at worst.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman has been preparing us for this for years; Cal
Ripken is telling us in a gentler fashion. Who knows, Ripken could
be a Yankee in 2002 when the team leaves the Bronx and opens in
midtown. They'll need a celebrity to go with Simba and Uncle Scar.
</P>
<P>
   This is why we marvel all the more at Michael Jordan and his
last shot. Perhaps he is, or was, our last chance to feel something
real in a changing sports market. It is one thing to reward a
player for showing up for work each day with lunch pail in hand.
But what do you do when the pail is empty? &QL;

JUDGE REBUFFS FDA ON EFFORT TO BAN DIET SUPPLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday lost
the first round of its legal battle with the manufacturer of
Cholestin, an herbal remedy that is being marketed as a dietary
supplement to reduce cholesterol but which the agency is trying to
declare an illegal drug.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief three-page decision, a U.S. judge in Salt Lake City
ordered the agency to permit the manufacturer, Pharmanex Inc., a
small, 3-year-old company in Simi Valley, Calif., to continue
making Cholestin while the court case proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiff's Cholestin product is preliminarily declared to be
a dietary supplement, and not a drug, within the meaning of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,'' Judge Dale Kimball of U.S.
District Court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball added that Pharmanex would ``clearly suffer irreparable
injury'' if it could not continue to make the herbal remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came one day after lawyers for both sides argued the
case before Kimball. It is now up to the judge to make a final
decision about whether Cholestin will be allowed to remain on the
market as a dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously very gratified by the judge's decision,''
William McGlashan Jr., the president of Pharmanex, said in an
interview. ``It's an important first step.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who handled the case for the drug agency, Neal
Parker, declined to comment on the ruling. But Lorrie McHugh, the
FDA's chief spokeswoman, said the agency intended to pursue the
case despite Tuesday's setback.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being watched as a pivotal battle between the food
and drug agency, which is struggling to exert its authority under a
1994 law that left it almost powerless to regulate herbal products,
and the dietary supplement industry, which has been growing at a
furious pace since the law was passed.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is not whether the product is unsafe; the FDA does not
argue that it is. Rather, the agency asserts that Cholestin is an
illegal, unapproved drug under the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act of 1994 because it contains a natural form of
lovastatin, the key chemical in Mevacor, a cholesterol-lowering
drug made by Merck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Cholestin is made from a pulverized strain of rice fermented
with red yeast, which is then ground up into a brick-colored powder
and put into capsules. The rice is imported from China, where it
has been used for more than 2,000 years, as an herbal remedy and a
food.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Pharmanex say that the lovastatin occurs naturally
in the rice and that, under the law, the FDA cannot take Cholestin
off the market unless it believes the product is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, the agency, prompted by complaints from
officials at Merck, began an investigation of Cholestin. While the
inquiry proceeded, the agency impounded 10 tons of the red yeast
rice. Then, last month, agency officials declared Cholestin a drug,
and insisted that the product undergo the same rigorous testing as
any pharmaceutical. That prompted Pharmanex's suit.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on Monday before Kimball, the company asked that
the hold on its red yeast rice be released. The judge complied,
ordering the agency to permit the rice to enter the United States
immediately and to allow Pharmanex to import an additional 6 tons
every three months, or however much the company needed to meet its
demand.

MARTIN IS CLEARED TO USE GOLF CART 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GLF-USOPEN) 
 (ja) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Golf Association will allow Casey
Martin to use a regular golf cart this week at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made Tuesday after Martin continued to have
mechanical and handling difficulties with his specially designed
one-seat cart.
</P>
<P>
   On holes where Martin is not able to drive close to the greens,
a marshal will drive Martin's cart to the next tee.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who uses a regular cart in Nike Tour events, was
relieved by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the single cart ride is a great idea; I just don't
think it's quite there yet,'' said Martin, who had a single-seat
cart stall on him Monday. ``It's got a few kinks that make it
difficult to drive, especially when there are 37,000 people. I'm
excited that they gave me a regular cart because it will make my
time at the Open easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is afflicted with a circulatory disorder in his
right leg, also announced that he has accepted a sponsor's
exemption to play at the Canon Greater Hartford Open next month. It
will be Martin's first PGA Tour event since he successfully sued
the tour for the right to use a cart earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A large gallery followed the threesome of Martin, Tiger Woods
and Joel Kribel during Tuesday's practice round at the Olympic
Club, and the crowd was clearly supportive of Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a great experience,'' he said. ``For the last six
months, my life has changed quite a bit. Coming up the 18th hole,
there must have been 15,000 people. This is the stuff I dreamt
about 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin won a friendly skins game with Woods during their round.
``He has yet to pay me,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   While many players still believe a cart should not be allowed in
competition, Martin said his peers had received him warmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen a few players that were outspoken,'' Martin said.
``I am not going to name names. They didn't go out of there way to
say hi, but at the same time, they didn't sneer at me either. I'm
not getting caught up in who said what. I'm enjoying the
experience.''

COMMENTARY: SORRY, MAYOR, IT'S THE LAW _ CHAOS RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michio Kaku has good news for hapless hot-dog
vendors, street artists and cabbies frazzled by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's quest to quell urban entropy. The mayor's zeal for
near-absolute order is against the law.
</P>
<P>
   Of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second law of thermodynamics is an absolute, iron law,''
said Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at City College.
``Entropy always increases. Disorder always increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes. That means no matter how much you straighten things out
in one place, it creates a mess somewhere else. The mayor's critics
might say that has happened in parts of Manhattan that are being
cleaned out and gussied up at the expense of neighborhoods where
tourists never tread. His supporters could counter that he has only
wreaked havoc on Democrats steamrolled by municipal progress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kaku's musings are just the product of someone who
teaches in a system that itself has been singled out by those who
would impose order through new standards. But he sounds reasonable
when he explains that some rules preceded this administration. The
city that is the capital of the world cannot claim to be the center
of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that there are some things that are even beyond
Giuliani,'' Kaku said. ``He can impose his will on everything but
the laws of physics. There is a higher authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Such treason. Equally alarming is the work of chaos theorists at
some universities, who look for the method in mayhem. Their
theories could explain why, say, an asteroid would tumble from its
orbit and crash in midtown _ which would handily justify the cost
and construction of the mayor's proposed emergency bunker.
</P>
<P>
   As any chaosmeister worth his pocket protector knows, minor
events can have unexpected and catastrophic results. In a way, the
administration understood this when it embraced the ``broken
window'' concept behind its quality of life crackdown. A broken
window left unfixed, it was said, sent out a message that a
community was uncared for and ripe for destruction through urban
plagues. But there is a limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real, complex systems, for example those involving the
interaction of many bodies, are, over time, usually unpredictable
and unstable,'' said Sylvain Cappell, a mathematics professor at
New York University. ``And that's the case even when the relative
motions are deterministic and governed just by the simple laws of
inertia, collision and mutual attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaos happens. Still, Cappell was loath to draw any social or
political conclusions, lest someone accuse him of being a
mathematical partisan. Math is easy. Life is hard, was all he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia
University, cautioned against drawing tidy comparisons between the
realm of tiny particles and cities with life-size pedestrians. But
he was just as insistent in his belief that order in the universe
inevitably will degrade. That, presumably, includes New York,
despite any efforts to prevent it. Yet, there is hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``String theory has shown us there is an incredible elegance and
order when you look at the universe the right way,'' he said.
``Order is not necessarily a bad thing, but it has to be order that
is in harmony with the system to which it is applied. That's the
question individual citizens have to answer when it comes to order
in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   As a New Yorker, Greene has actually been pleased with the way
things have been going in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more comfortable place to be than when I grew up,'' he
said. ``Part of me recoils against restrictions, but part of me
thinks it's been effective. I tend not to judge things in such
grand terms when it comes to day-to-day life. At the moment, it's
still moving in a useful direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to nudge a behemoth of government and people is good enough
for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it from a Newtonian point of view, the city has
a correlation of many chaotic forces,'' Kaku said. ``So, what
Giuliani has done is try to impose some order on all of these
diverging interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is personal, but a strong mayor who is wrong is better
than a weak mayor who is right. If you are wrong there are
corrections. This is a Newtonian view. Ultimately, there will be
corrections. At least, the city is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, any would-be mayor, if not Master of the Universe,
should remember the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. You can know
an object's speed or where it's going. But never both.
</P>

A LONG HOT FISCAL YEAR IS ANTICIPATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last two weeks of June usually mark the end of
the budget-negotiating season in New York City. But because of the
overheated political atmosphere in City Hall this year, the fight
over the budget will continue for several months and perhaps for
the entire next fiscal year, officials predict.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a budget agreement would have been announced at a
carefully orchestrated photo-op, with the mayor and the speaker
slapping each other's backs and flashing toothy smiles at
television cameras. Then on July 1, the start of the city's fiscal
year, the mayor's office would have begun using the new budget.
</P>
<P>
   But this month the City Council passed its own budget after
Speaker Peter Vallone and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani reached an
impasse. A large part of their differences centered on the future
of Yankee Stadium, but the mayor also complained that the council
had increased spending by $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Voting along straight party lines Tuesday, the
Democratic-controlled council easily overrode items that Giuliani
had vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time since the City Charter revision of 1989
gave the City Council its current fiscal powers that the city will
have a non-consensus budget. And that has carried the fight between
the mayor and the council onto unfamiliar ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget is done,'' said Douglas Criscitello, director of
the city's Independent Budget Office, adding that it was now just a
matter of ``arguing over its implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office has almost exclusive authority in
implementing the budget. Giuliani emphasized Tuesday that he would
use the full extent of his considerable powers to do so according
to his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor gets the chance to determine how much money should
be spent and in what order,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of the City Charter allows the mayor to impound
money, or simply refuse to spend it. But council leaders argue that
the mayor can exercise these powers only during a fiscal crisis; to
do so now, when the city has a $2 billion surplus, would just be
political retaliation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani withholds spending, the council has vowed to take
the mayor to court, which is the stage on which the budget battle
will likely end up.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not disclose his entire strategy yesterday, but he
said he would delay spending in certain areas until the fall, when
he expects to have a clearer picture of the city's fiscal
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Withholding money from agencies will hurt the city's most
vulnerable residents, said Thomas McMahon, director of the
council's finance division.
</P>
<P>
   ``All New Yorkers will feel some impact,'' McMahon said. ``But
the Upper East Sider who has access to one less library book
obviously will be less affected than the southeast Queens mom who
cannot get day care. Our hope is to insure that all essential
programs continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that his actions would not hurt the
average New Yorker.

3-D COMPANY'S ICONIC IMAGERY HEADED FOR INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- If 3-D computer graphics specialist Synthonics
Technologies has its way, visions of the Virgin Mary and various
saints no longer will be limited to Central European peasants and
children in remote Mexican towns.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal the company says will gross it more than $1 million,
Synthonics has begun delivering digitized, three-dimensional
replicas of 3,000 rare wood carvings of Catholic saints to Centro
Alameda, a San Antonio-based affiliate of the Smithsonian
Institution. As completed, the dimensionally accurate and fully
rotatable images will be posted for viewing and study on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The statues are part of the museum's ``Santos'' collection of
carvings of Catholic icons.
</P>
<P>
   Synthonics' technology wraps two-dimensional photographs of an
object taken from various angles around a virtual, 3-D wire-mesh
frame. It is a technology that has its roots in the Cold War, but
one Synthonics hopes to turn into an entertainment moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies can put 3-D images on the Net, but no one can
do it with this sort of detail,'' said Synthonics founder Charles
Palm. With the final Centro Alameda project, viewers will be able
to zoom in and out, make precise measurements of objects and even
``peel away'' layers of the carvings to show their inner structure,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A statue of Our Lady of Sorrow, for example, has tiny daggers
emerging from the figure's heart. Using the Synthonics technology,
Internet viewers can remove the weapons to see the statue
dagger-free, Palm said.
</P>
<P>
   The Centro Alameda deal is the first in a series of agreements
between the Smithsonian and Synthonics, based in Westlake Village,
35 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The museum has hired
Synthonics to create a consumer-oriented CD-ROM containing 3-D
replicas of a portion of the Smithsonian's sprawling art and
historic objects collection. The CD-ROM is scheduled to be
completed this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Synthonics said it had won a patent to automatically
convert standard movies into enhanced, 3-D films. The company hopes
to convert blockbusters such as ``Star Wars'' to 3-D to allow film
companies to re-release and generate new revenue from the titles.
</P>
<P>
   Synthonics shares closed unchanged Tuesday at 62.5 cents.

JOB CREATION CONTINUES IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LESLIE GOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey's labor market continued to expand
last month, with the creation of 10,200 new jobs and a dip in the
unemployment rate to 5.0 percent, from 5.1 percent in April, the
State Labor Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The increase brought the total number of payroll jobs to an
all-time high of 3,795,400, said Kevin Smith, a Labor Department
spokesman. Computer programming, data processing and other business
services jobs drove the growth, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's unemployment rate continued to be higher than the
national rate, which was 4.3 percent in May. Connecticut's rate was
3.9 percent, and New York's was 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A slowdown in job creation in April raised questions about New
Jersey's economic recovery. But James Hughes, dean of the Edward J.
Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers
University, said the May surge indicated the slowdown was ``just a
one-month blip,'' and that the rate of job growth is on a par with
last year's total of 87,500 new jobs. &QL;

LAWYERS SEEK TO EXCLUDE STATEMENTS FROM MEN ACCUSED OF TEACHER'S
KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Defense lawyers for the two men charged with killing
Jonathan Levin, a popular New York City high school teacher, sought
Tuesday to exclude statements that the suspects gave to police and
that could be important evidence for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Levin was discovered in his Upper West Side apartment on May 30,
1997, bound with duct tape and shot in the head. Eight days after
his death, which triggered a citywide manhunt, police charged a
former student, Corey Arthur, and another man, Montoun Hart, with
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the two men killed Levin, the son of Time
Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, while stealing his ATM card.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence police assembled were a series of statements
given by Arthur and Hart while in custody. Tuesday, lawyers for
both men argued in State Supreme Court in Manhattan that portions
of the statements should be excluded from evidence on legal
grounds. The arguments during the preliminary stages of the trial
were the opening of what promises to be a long fight over what
evidence will be allowed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical evidence challenged by defense lawyers Tuesday
was one of three statements that Hart gave to the police on the
morning of June 7. According to the statement, Hart told detectives
that he and Arthur had gone to Levin's apartment intending to rob
him. The statement is an important element in the case against Hart
because it could be used to show that he intended to commit a crime
when he entered the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's lawyer, David Stern, argued that police improperly
questioned Hart when they took the statement. Stern said that a
lawyer representing Hart called the police precinct house and told
a sergeant that he had been hired by Hart's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York state law, Stern said, police must stop
questioning a suspect once they are informed that he is represented
by a lawyer. Stern told the judge that the lawyer who called the
precinct house had testified in earlier hearings that he thought
that he had placed the telephone call before the police finished
questioning Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Stern asked Justice Marcy Kahn to exclude the statement from
evidence because the police did not stop the questioning when they
received the phone call.
</P>
<P>
   But Eugene Hurley, the prosecutor in the case, responded that
there was no conclusive record that could show whether the lawyer
called before or after the statement was finished. He argued that a
reading of telephone records would actually suggest that the police
received the phone call from the lawyer after Hart's statement was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Arthur argued that a portion of their client's
statement also should be excluded. Their argument is based on a
police report that indicates that an interview with Arthur
continued for some time after a lawyer called the precinct house
and told officers that he was representing Arthur. However, Hurley
told the judge that the time on the report was a misprint. He said
officers have testified that they completed the interview with
Arthur well before the lawyer called.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Justice Kahn reserved her decision on both motions.
Lawyers for both men also said in court that they plan further
challenges, which are expected to be heard in September. &QL;

UNLIKELY FIGURE IN UNFATHOMABLE CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The people who know Shawn Allen Berry, some who
killed time with him, drinking beer and watching the insects whirl
around the street lights, some who frequently waited in vain for
him to show up for work at the town tire store, often feared that
he was just one more drunken joyride away from another trip to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   But they figured it would be something dumb, something little,
not something mean. They never dreamed he would be charged, along
with two other white men, with dragging a black man to death behind
Berry's primer-gray pickup, a crime so cruel it sickened people
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' said a former employer, Bill Snelson, ``he just got
mixed up in the wrong crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Berry and his court-appointed lawyer maintain: that
he was an unwilling accomplice to the June 7 murder of James Byrd
Jr., 49. Those who know Berry, a 23-year-old part-time mechanic,
theater manager and failed burglar, want to believe him, because
they do not want to think that so evil a crime has a familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   In Jasper, where almost half the population is black and
memories are long, people understand prejudice. But few of them,
black or white, understand what could happen in a life that would
make a man hate with such intensity. As they look back on the lives
of the three accused, they find clues, but not answers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement given to investigators, Berry has implicated the
two other suspects, both friends: John William King, 23, a one-time
schoolmate in Jasper who became his partner in the bungled burglary
that landed both in a prison boot camp in 1992, and Lawrence
Brewer, 31, a day laborer from the Sulphur Springs area who had
just completed a seven-year prison term for cocaine peddling when
Byrd was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   By the account of Berry, who had given Byrd a lift, King forced
him to accompany the two other men on the ride of death and
dismemberment after they had chained the victim to the rear bumper.
Brewer and King, both linked to prison hate gangs, say they did not
murder anyone.
</P>
<P>
   People who know the three suspects, either here in Jasper or in
Cooper, Brewer's tiny hometown, describe them alternately as good
boys and small-time criminals. King often used racial slurs, but
that did not set him apart here.
</P>
<P>
   All three men were born in East Texas, where racism can be
almost a recreation _ in 1993, white supremacists in Vidor, some 50
miles from Jasper, succeeded in driving out of town the several
blacks who lived there _ but Jasper had not seen such meanness in
decades, people here say. The mayor, the hospital administrator,
the superintendent of education and other political and civic
leaders are black. The country club has black members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed a lot in the past 20, 30 years,'' said
District Attorney Guy James Gray, who has lived here for 48 years.
Certainly, blacks and whites alike say, racism is alive in Jasper,
but it is a thing of lingering resentment and hurtful words, not
threats or violence.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people here believe that the suspects' time in prison,
where inmates tend to split off into gangs by color for their own
protection, intensified racial prejudice that had been part of
their culture, and set the stage for an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials say that King and Brewer were both
members of the Confederate Knights of America, a racist group
linked to the Ku Klux Klan, and that both have tattoos that mark
them as white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   But this crime was so evil, so widely denounced, that Texas
klaverns of the Klan have denounced it, too. A small group of
Klansmen, 10 to 20, have applied for a permit to march here this
weekend or the next, not in support of the suspects but to disavow
any connection with them.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, friends of Berry say they are certain that when he
offered Byrd a ride that fateful night, he did so as a kindness.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Snelson, who owns Jasper Tire, where Berry worked off and on for
about three years, said Berry's mentor there was an old black man
who was dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn went with me to the funeral,'' Snelson said. ``He was
crying like a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Wood, 21, a worker on offshore oil rigs who has known
Berry for years, echoes what many say about him: People liked to
like him. He made dumb mistakes, but he did not seem to have a mean
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard Shawn say anything racist,'' Wood said. ``I have
a lot of black friends. He has a lot of black friends. All this
news has just shocked me and everyone he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry drank beer, mostly on the weekends; shot pool, and got
tattoos, ``but there's nothing racist about tattoos,'' Wood said.
``He had a Playboy bunny, a Grim Reaper and a cow skull, if I
remember right.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a child by a young woman in Jasper and, friends say,
was planning to marry her.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the circumstances he was raised in,'' Snelson said, ``he
was a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   His father died when he was a teen-ager, and he quit school in
the eighth grade. ``He never did talk much about his mother,'' said
Wood, one of a number of acquaintances who say Berry and his mother
were never close.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was raised on the street,'' Snelson said. ``I tried to help
the kid because I felt sorry for him,'' although ultimately ``I had
to let him go because he was not dependable.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Berry and King, his friend from school, committed a
burglary in Jasper and were sent to the boot camp, a detention
center where guards used military-style discipline to try to turn
around the lives of young offenders. It seemed to work for Berry,
who came home and got a job at the movie theater. (The night of the
killing, he had just finished showing ``Godzilla.'')
</P>
<P>
   But for King, boot camp proved to be only preparation for two
more years in custody. He violated parole so often that the state
sent him to Beto One, a tough prison in the town of Tennessee
Colony. He came out a different person, by the account of friends
and relatives, who say prison taught him to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Berry, of whom people speak well even as they shake their
heads, King seems abandoned by Jasper. Even his father, Ronald
King, has conceded his guilt, in a letter to reporters. ``It hurts
me deeply,'' the elder King wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While people here acknowledge knowing John King, they refuse to
have their names attached to any recollection about him, if they
talk about him at all.
</P>
<P>
   They remember a mannerly boy, quiet around grown-ups. His family
was blue-collar Baptist. The only vice he had as a boy was snuff.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of school in 10th grade and did manual labor.
Like Berry, he was just one of the sunburned young men who cruised
town in ragged pickups, a six-pack from trouble. If he was overtly
racist then, the people who remember him say they do not recall.
</P>
<P>
   But in Beto One, he met Brewer, who had been in and out of jail
for drug and burglary convictions much of his adult life. Like
King, the new acquaintance came from a solid, hard-working Texas
family, ``real respected people,'' said Brewer's hometown sheriff,
Benny Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody liked him,'' said Brewer's grandfather, Morris
Gillham, 76, a retired electrician. ``I don't know what to say. He
didn't have that makeup,'' as a boy, to do the things the
prosecutors say he did to Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives say Brewer too learned to hate in prison. Both he and
King joined the Confederate Knights of America, a loosely organized
prison gang for white supremacists, although his lawyer, Bill
Morian Jr., says Brewer joined the gang for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't join,'' Morian said, ``you become someone's
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas prisons have powerful black and Hispanic gangs, in
particular one called the Mexican Mafia. They, and their white
counterparts, espouse racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of racism in prison is very high,'' said Mark Potok,
a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center. ``The truth is,
you may go in completely unracist and emerge ready to kill people
who don't look like you.''

UNION MAY NOT PAY LEGAL BILLS FOR OFFICER IN SHOOTING OF SQUEEGEE
MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Appearing to distance itself from the officer charged
in the shooting of a squeegee man on Sunday, officials of the
city's police union said yesterday that they were weighing whether
to continue paying his legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Michael Meyer, was provided with lawyers by the
union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, to guide him through
his arraignment on Monday on charges of attempted murder in the
shooting of a squeegee man who was trying to clean his windshield.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the union was considering whether the shooting
qualified as a line-of-duty incident, for which the union
ordinarily pays legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union's obligation to pay for lawyers in off-duty
incidents officially ends after the arraignment,'' said Joe
Mancini, a spokesman for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
``If the PBA decides it's not a line-of-duty incident, that doesn't
mean we've drawn any conclusions about whether the shooting was
justified or not.''
</P>
<P>
   As the union considered the issue, new accusations emerged
Tuesday about several past allegations that Meyer had beaten and
brutalized people while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a Long Island man said he was hospitalized for a
month after being severely beaten by Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smirti, the union lawyer who represented Meyer at his
arraignment, would not comment on Sunday's case or discuss whether
his fees would be paid by the union or by the officer's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's personal,'' he said Tuesday night. ``I think it's still
being worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Basing a decision about paying Meyer's legal fees on the issue
of whether he was off-duty would be unusual, since the union has
said in the past that police officers are never really off-duty,
using that contention to support its arguments that officers killed
while off-duty should be given funerals with full honors.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the union has paid the legal fees for some officers
involved in off-duty shootings, including Peter Del-Debbio, a white
officer who was off duty when he mistakenly shot a black undercover
police officer in 1994 on a Manhattan subway platform.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the union decided not to pay legal fees, officers
have often hired union lawyers on their own to represent them.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's incident, Meyer is accused of shooting a squeegee
man, Antoine Reid, 38, who tried to wash the windshield of his car
as he stopped in traffic on East 138th Street in the Bronx while
driving his girlfriend and her 6-year-old son home from a Yankees
game, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who lost his spleen and had considerable liver damage in
the shooting, remained in critical but stable condition Tuesday at
Lincoln Hospital. Hospital officials said that Reid was able to
recognize his mother.

EX-CLINTON AIDE REPRESENTING PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's chief spokesman during the
campaign finance investigations is now serving as a foreign agent
for Pakistan, representing the Islamabad government as White House
officials are making key decisions on how to address the threat of
a nuclear arms buildup between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, who left as special White House counsel in February
to resume his position as a partner with the powerhouse Washington
lobbying and law firm of Patton Boggs, also has not registered with
the Justice Department as a foreign agent, according to a Globe
review of federal records.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Tuesday he believed he had not yet billed his client
enough money to require registration, but he planned to register
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, senior administration officials are prohibited from
lobbying on behalf of clients immediately after leaving the White
House. But White House officials said Davis did not earn a large
enough salary while on the public payroll to be covered by federal
``revolving door'' criminal statutes and a 1993 presidential
directive preventing senior aides from immediately engaging in work
as a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not in the category required to sign that pledge, so he
did not sign,'' said Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman,
referring to a lobbying prohibition pledge required of anyone
making more than $110,000 a year. Davis said he made $100,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Pakistan is just one in a range of clients
that Davis has taken on since returning to his legal and lobbying
practice from his high-profile position at the White House, where
he served as Clinton's chief spokesman on the myriad campaign
fund-raising investigations. Last week Davis led a group of 125
American Indian tribal leaders trying to secure gambling rights in
California through a series of meetings with Attorney General Janet
Reno, members of Congress and staff aides on Capitol Hill and in
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, an affable lawyer and spokesman much-liked by many
members of the news media for his quoteability and easy access, had
represented Pakistan as a lawyer and lobbyist from July 1993
through November 1996, according to Justice Department records on
file with the Foreign Agents Registration Office. Back then, he did
fill out a so-called short form that registered him as a foreign
agent. He returned in February to Patton Boggs and to his
representation of Pakistan, which had remained a client of the firm
in his absence. But Davis never filled out a new Justice Department
form.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has resumed his work for Pakistan at a pivotal time in the
relationship between Washington and Islamabad. Pakistan's historic
enemy, India, detonated five nuclear devices last month in a round
of tests, spurring Pakistani officials to respond in kind. The
United States has levied economic sanctions against both countries
as anxieties remain high over the possibility of one country using
nuclear weapons to attack the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pakistan and India thing, strategically, is probably the
most sensitive issue in the world today,'' said Charles Lewis, the
executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington
think tank. ``For a former White House official to go back in the
door holding a brief for a government, it's unacceptable. There's
no other word for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much he made is irrelevant,'' said Lewis. ``It might be
legal, but it violates the spirit of the law. This is a fellow with
complete familiarity with any and everyone in the White House,
including the president. It's poor judgment by Lanny Davis, and it
shows a lot of the White House pronouncements of deep concern about
conflict of interest and appearances of impropriety are hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Davis stressed that since he
had already represented Pakistan, he was not using his White House
contacts as his prime selling point when he returned to Patton
Boggs. He also said that in his former capacity as a special
counsel he had no access to officials with regulatory and
policy-making powers, especially on the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an instance where I am trading off on my White
House experience to represent a client,'' said Davis. ``My job at
the White House was to speak to the press about campaign finance
and other related issues. If my job had anything to do with any of
the issues that Pakistan might face, then from an appearances
viewpoint I would certainly consider the appearance on a
case-by-case basis on whether to take a client.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis left the White House in February after a 15-month stint as
Clinton's chief spokesman on the campaign finance issues that have
plagued the administration since the 1996 reelection. He is now one
of Pakistan's lawyers in the United States at a crucial point in
the relationship between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said he is providing legal guidance to
Pakistani officials on whether to file suit against the United
States for the return of more than $500 million that Pakistan paid
in 1989 for a fleet of 28 F-16 fighter planes but never received.
In 1990, President Bush halted the deal and froze the assets under
US law because officials could not certify that Pakistan was not a
nuclear state.
</P>
<P>
   Since India detonated its first nuclear devices on May 12,
Clinton has made a series of public statements hinting that he
would like to settle the issue, either by seeking a waiver to the
law that would allow him to give Pakistan the planes or by
refunding the money. Those signals have weakened since Pakistan
exploded its own nuclear devices on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Davis acknowledged making one recent call to a White House
national security official on behalf of his client. The call was
placed to Jim Steinberg, the deputy national security adviser, and
involved a request for a telephone conference between Steinberg and
a Pakistani official, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into government and you lose a lot of money to do it,''
Davis said Tuesday. ``When you come out, you have to keep in mind
appearances. But I didn't deal with people in regulatory fields''
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Davis added: ``You can't practice law in Washington without
interacting with government.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday whether Davis violated any regulations or
laws by not registering with the Justice Department as a foreign
agent when he returned to Patton Boggs in February. The head of the
Foreign Agents Registration Office, Marshall Williams, said that in
general, if an agent had registered previously, left his or her
position and then returned to the same work, the agent would be
expected to register again.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Pape, the managing partner at Patton Boggs, said Tuesday
that Davis' work for Pakistan since he returned was ``limited,''
and he did not believe a registration was necessary. Still, other
Patton Boggs officials have recently referred to Davis as their
lead attorney on the Pakistani account.
</P>
<P>
   Pape described the registration as ``not a big deal.'' But asked
why Davis would not register, Pape said, ``I haven't had occasion
to ask him, but my guess is he is so busy that if he is engaged in
activity, and I mean if, it is an oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Tuesday that neither Davis nor his
client, Pakistan, would receive special access because of his
former duties and relationships with senior officials, including
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lanny is an appreciated figure here, but I don't know what
kind of work he is doing for his client,'' said White House press
secretary Michael McCurry. ``As long as he follows legal
guidelines, he has a right to provide information to the
government. He doesn't get any better or worse treatment from the
White House than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, other government watchdogs expressed disbelief at such
declarations and said that Clinton's pledge to end a revolving door
from the White House to the city's lobbying industry has repeatedly
been broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing you can have on your resume as an attractive
lobbyist is exposure to the White House, and the only thing that
can trump that is exposure to the White House but no limitations
from the revolving door statute,'' said Larry Makinson, the
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. ``It's
hard to beat that. He has the access, but he doesn't have the
liability. That's Park Place on the real estate map. You've hit the
jackpot.''

   RONKONKOMA, N.Y. _ Accusing Long Island utility officials of
breaking their word by taking $67 million in extra compensation, a
state agency on Tuesday called for their resignations and imposed a
$1.04 million-a-month corporate penalty until the issue is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves were among a series of actions voted unanimously by
the Long Island Power Authority in a board meeting here that raised
the stakes in Gov. George Pataki's battle with the officials of the
old Long Island Lighting Co.
</P>
<P>
   The power authority, which the governor controls, took over
LILCO's electricity service on May 28. LILCO's remaining parts _
its power plants, gas operations and employees _ merged with
Brooklyn Union Gas's holding company to form Marketspan Corp. It
supplies the electricity, management and work force to operate the
old LILCO system under long-term contracts with the power
authority.
</P>
<P>
   But a week after the takeover, the governor and power authority
disclosed that LILCO had made secret payments to 26 executives. The
prime beneficiary was LILCO's chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos,
who received $42 million. Pataki denounced the payments as
violations of the state's takeover agreement, which coupled a
no-layoff guarantee with a bar on severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   All the LILCO executives automatically succeeded to jobs at
Marketspan, led by Catacosinos as chairman. They defended their
payments as proper, saying they represent pension funds and other
benefits they were entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the power authority, meeting for the first time
since the disclosures, struck back with numerous actions that the
agency's chairman, Richard Kessel, said ``will have far-reaching
consequences for Marketspan.'' He added: ``This message sends a
strong signal to Marketspan that its biggest customer is seriously
dissatisfied. These payments were a serious breach of our
agreement, and they were deliberately concealed.''
</P>
<P>
   The compensation issue must be resolved, he said, for the power
authority to resume working with Marketspan ``in a spirit of
cooperation that is built on mutual respect and trust.'' For now,
he said, ``we do not have that trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, the governor's spokesman, said, ``LIPA's action
to reverse the secret acts of greed are appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the authority's board voted to withhold in an
escrow account Marketspan's $1.04 million monthly management fee,
starting with the payment that was due on Monday. The board called
for the resignation of Catacosinos and two top aides, Joseph
McDonnell and Leonard Novello, who the authority said helped
conceal the payments. The board also banned those three men from
working on the power authority's account at Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   The board said that as a matter of policy, it would consider
disqualifying Marketspan from bidding on future authority projects
like building new power plants, laying a new electric supply cable
under the Long Island Sound or using poles or other equipment for
cellular or cable communications.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted to hire a legal expert to review whether LILCO
executives violated civil or criminal laws in granting the payments
and in their disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The board directed a review of whether the purchase price for
LILCO's properties should be adjusted to reflect the executive
payments, and it demanded reimbursement to the authority for the
costs of investigating the compensation. And the board voted to
restrict Marketspan's access to the power authority's records
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the board demanded reassurance from Marketspan that
never again would it conceal information from the power authority.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the power authority's actions, McDonnell,
Marketspan's senior vice president, said: ``We will continue to
fulfill our obligations under our contract and to serve the people
of Long Island.'' As for the withheld fees, he said: ``We will
review our remedies under the terms of that contract. We disagree
with the premises of the LIPA action. The compensation contracts
were legal obligations of the company and were properly
discharged.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessel said that the contract provided for arbitration to settle
any disputes between the parties. The power authority will continue
to pay about $37 million a month to cover Marketspan's overhead for
providing electrical power and operating the system. The $1.04
million a month being withheld is mostly Marketspan's profits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giving his first full interviews since the dispute erupted,
Catacosinos, 68, dismissed any thought of quitting Marketspan. He
said he hopes to complete his six-year term as chairman, ``the Lord
willing.'' After that, he said, he wants to ``spend a little time
enjoying the fruits of our labors.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to talk in detail about the compensation issue
because the Marketspan board is reviewing it, Catacosinos said:
``Once the facts are carefully reviewed, then I think people's
concerns will be dispelled.'' In the meantime, he said, ``I'm here
trying to get a job done, trying not to get distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   The power authority's actions failed to mollify critics, who
oppose the takeover deal as a giveaway to LILCO. ``You handed over
$7 billion to LILCO stockholders, and you're pretending you didn't
know Catacosinos and others would get a cut of that?'' said Gordian
Raacke, director of the court-appointed LILCO watchdog group, the
Citizens Advisory Panel. ``Did you guys really trust LILCO? I don't
think the public can trust you people.''

EX-CLINTON AIDE REPRESENTING PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's chief spokesman during the
campaign finance investigations is now serving as a foreign agent
for Pakistan, representing the Islamabad government as White House
officials are making key decisions on how to address the threat of
a nuclear arms buildup between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, who left as special White House counsel in February
to resume his position as a partner with the powerhouse Washington
lobbying and law firm of Patton Boggs, also has not registered with
the Justice Department as a foreign agent, according to a Globe
review of federal records.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Tuesday he believed he had not yet billed his client
enough money to require registration, but he planned to register
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, senior administration officials are prohibited from
lobbying on behalf of clients immediately after leaving the White
House. But White House officials said Davis did not earn a large
enough salary while on the public payroll to be covered by federal
``revolving door'' criminal statutes and a 1993 presidential
directive preventing senior aides from immediately engaging in work
as a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not in the category required to sign that pledge, so he
did not sign,'' said Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman,
referring to a lobbying prohibition pledge required of anyone
making more than $110,000 a year. Davis said he made $100,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Pakistan is just one in a range of clients
that Davis has taken on since returning to his legal and lobbying
practice from his high-profile position at the White House, where
he served as Clinton's chief spokesman on the myriad campaign
fund-raising investigations. Last week Davis led a group of 125
American Indian tribal leaders trying to secure gambling rights in
California through a series of meetings with Attorney General Janet
Reno, members of Congress and staff aides on Capitol Hill and in
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, an affable lawyer and spokesman much-liked by many
members of the news media for his quoteability and easy access, had
represented Pakistan as a lawyer and lobbyist from July 1993
through November 1996, according to Justice Department records on
file with the Foreign Agents Registration Office. Back then, he did
fill out a so-called short form that registered him as a foreign
agent. He returned in February to Patton Boggs and to his
representation of Pakistan, which had remained a client of the firm
in his absence. But Davis never filled out a new Justice Department
form.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has resumed his work for Pakistan at a pivotal time in the
relationship between Washington and Islamabad. Pakistan's historic
enemy, India, detonated five nuclear devices last month in a round
of tests, spurring Pakistani officials to respond in kind. The
United States has levied economic sanctions against both countries
as anxieties remain high over the possibility of one country using
nuclear weapons to attack the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pakistan and India thing, strategically, is probably the
most sensitive issue in the world today,'' said Charles Lewis, the
executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington
think tank. ``For a former White House official to go back in the
door holding a brief for a government, it's unacceptable. There's
no other word for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much he made is irrelevant,'' said Lewis. ``It might be
legal, but it violates the spirit of the law. This is a fellow with
complete familiarity with any and everyone in the White House,
including the president. It's poor judgment by Lanny Davis, and it
shows a lot of the White House pronouncements of deep concern about
conflict of interest and appearances of impropriety are hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Davis stressed that since he
had already represented Pakistan, he was not using his White House
contacts as his prime selling point when he returned to Patton
Boggs. He also said that in his former capacity as a special
counsel he had no access to officials with regulatory and
policy-making powers, especially on the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an instance where I am trading off on my White
House experience to represent a client,'' said Davis. ``My job at
the White House was to speak to the press about campaign finance
and other related issues. If my job had anything to do with any of
the issues that Pakistan might face, then from an appearances
viewpoint I would certainly consider the appearance on a
case-by-case basis on whether to take a client.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis left the White House in February after a 15-month stint as
Clinton's chief spokesman on the campaign finance issues that have
plagued the administration since the 1996 reelection. He is now one
of Pakistan's lawyers in the United States at a crucial point in
the relationship between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said he is providing legal guidance to
Pakistani officials on whether to file suit against the United
States for the return of more than $500 million that Pakistan paid
in 1989 for a fleet of 28 F-16 fighter planes but never received.
In 1990, President Bush halted the deal and froze the assets under
US law because officials could not certify that Pakistan was not a
nuclear state.
</P>
<P>
   Since India detonated its first nuclear devices on May 12,
Clinton has made a series of public statements hinting that he
would like to settle the issue, either by seeking a waiver to the
law that would allow him to give Pakistan the planes or by
refunding the money. Those signals have weakened since Pakistan
exploded its own nuclear devices on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Davis acknowledged making one recent call to a White House
national security official on behalf of his client. The call was
placed to Jim Steinberg, the deputy national security adviser, and
involved a request for a telephone conference between Steinberg and
a Pakistani official, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into government and you lose a lot of money to do it,''
Davis said Tuesday. ``When you come out, you have to keep in mind
appearances. But I didn't deal with people in regulatory fields''
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Davis added: ``You can't practice law in Washington without
interacting with government.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday whether Davis violated any regulations or
laws by not registering with the Justice Department as a foreign
agent when he returned to Patton Boggs in February. The head of the
Foreign Agents Registration Office, Marshall Williams, said that in
general, if an agent had registered previously, left his or her
position and then returned to the same work, the agent would be
expected to register again.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Pape, the managing partner at Patton Boggs, said Tuesday
that Davis' work for Pakistan since he returned was ``limited,''
and he did not believe a registration was necessary. Still, other
Patton Boggs officials have recently referred to Davis as their
lead attorney on the Pakistani account.
</P>
<P>
   Pape described the registration as ``not a big deal.'' But asked
why Davis would not register, Pape said, ``I haven't had occasion
to ask him, but my guess is he is so busy that if he is engaged in
activity, and I mean if, it is an oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Tuesday that neither Davis nor his
client, Pakistan, would receive special access because of his
former duties and relationships with senior officials, including
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lanny is an appreciated figure here, but I don't know what
kind of work he is doing for his client,'' said White House press
secretary Michael McCurry. ``As long as he follows legal
guidelines, he has a right to provide information to the
government. He doesn't get any better or worse treatment from the
White House than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, other government watchdogs expressed disbelief at such
declarations and said that Clinton's pledge to end a revolving door
from the White House to the city's lobbying industry has repeatedly
been broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing you can have on your resume as an attractive
lobbyist is exposure to the White House, and the only thing that
can trump that is exposure to the White House but no limitations
from the revolving door statute,'' said Larry Makinson, the
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. ``It's
hard to beat that. He has the access, but he doesn't have the
liability. That's Park Place on the real estate map. You've hit the
jackpot.''

SHOTS FIRED INTO RESIDENCE OF PAROLED RAPIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINDEN, N.J. _ In the most violent attack directed at a paroled
sex offender since ``Megan's Law'' was enacted in New Jersey four
years ago, five shots were fired early Tuesday into a two-story
house where a convicted rapist lives, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the incident, which occurred less than two
weeks after the police began circulating a flier warning neighbors
of the presence of the man, Frank Penna, under the community
notification provisions of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Penna, 57, was convicted of kidnapping and raping two teen-agers
in 1976, and was sentenced to life in prison. He was paroled in
1992, and has apparently been living in the two-story house, his
boyhood home, since then. It was unclear Tuesday why Linden
officials first notified Penna's neighbors of his presence earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Local and state officials were quick to denounce the apparent
act of vigilantism, and said they had begun an aggressive
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire represented the type of incident that critics of the
law had long predicted would occur when sex offenders were
identified publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Peter Verniero denounced the gunfire at a news
conference in Trenton, saying, ``We will not tolerate any act of
vigilantism against a known sex offender.''
</P>
<P>
   But Verniero also denied that the incident demonstrated that the
critics of the law were correct. ``I don't think one incident,
which hopefully will remain isolated, proves any defect in the law
itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shots, which were fired shortly after midnight Monday,
pierced the front windows and walls of a first-floor apartment. Its
resident, Joan Bazydlo, was in bed watching television at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Penna, the apparent target of the fusillade, was asleep in his
basement apartment when the shots were fired, Ms. Bazydlo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was petrifying,'' Ms. Bazydlo said Tuesday afternoon on her
bullet-scarred front porch. ``I was just watching TV in the dark
and all of a sudden it was pow, pow, pow, pow, and glass was coming
at me. I just fell to the floor and laid there.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the law had argued that community notification
would lead to harassment, threats and vigilantism against parolees
whose names, addresses and physical descriptions were circulated in
police notices to neighbors of the sex offenders' homes and
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The first instance of vigilantism connected to community
notification occurred in rural Warren County in 1995. Two men burst
into a home in Phillipsburg where a paroled sex offender lived and
beat up a housemate whom they mistook for the parolee. The pair, a
father and son, were arrested and served a year in prison,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bazydlo said Penna should be left alone. ``He doesn't bother
anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Garcia, who lives a block away, said he was appalled by
the gunfire. ``He seems like a peaceful person,'' he said. ``Who
are we to judge? If he served his time, he deserves a chance.''

ROJAS STILL STRUGGLING TO FIND HIS OLD FORM
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Mets' pitching coach, Bob Apodaca, bristled when
asked whether the team had been hiding Mel Rojas in its bullpen at
times this season to keep Rojas from hurting the team's chances
late in close games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,'' Apodaca said Tuesday of the notion, two
days after Rojas could not nail down the third out in the eighth
inning of a game the bullpen lost in Florida, 5-4. ``It's pure
matchups, getting the right pitcher against the right part of the
lineup. And sometimes, Mel isn't the right matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that the Mets, after trading Greg McMichael to
the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Hideo Nomo deal, are going to need
more out of Rojas in his setup role if they are to avoid the
disastrous consequences of last season's bullpen collapse in front
of the closer John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that he's a key to our club,'' Apodaca
said of Rojas. ``The entire bullpen is.''
</P>
<P>
   And since the bullpen has been struggling lately, more attention
is being focused on Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this season, it was generally accepted that the
Dominican right-hander was the biggest question mark in the Mets'
revamped bullpen. As the Expos' closer in 1995 and 1996, Rojas
saved 66 games. In 1994, Rojas had 16 saves in 18 chances as John
Wetteland's setup man before the strike ruined Montreal's chances
of winning a division title.
</P>
<P>
   But after signing a three-year deal at $4.5 million a season as
a free agent with the Chicago Cubs before last season, Rojas has
struggled to regain the form that made him one of the National
League's top relievers. Last year, he was 0-6 with a 4.64 earned
run average with the Cubs and Mets, converting just 15 of 22 save
opportunities (68 percent). The four previous seasons, Rojas had
converted 79 percent of such opportunities (92 of 116).
</P>
<P>
   This year, after returning to a setup role, Rojas is 2 for 3 in
save opportunities (67 percent) and 3-0 with a 2.83 ERA. But he has
inexplicably been hit hard by right-handers, who were batting a
whopping .373 against him this season (22 for 59, including the
only home run he has allowed) before tonight, compared with
left-handers, who were hitting .170 (8 for 47) against Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous five years, right-handers had hit just .230 in
747 at-bats against Rojas, while lefties had hit .236 in 772
at-bats. Last season, righties his just .226 against Rojas in 164
at-bats, while lefties hit .258 in 159 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not back yet,'' Rojas said Tuesday. ``I still have a
little bit to work on. It's real close, but I'm not 100 percent to
the point where I come in and this game's over. It's still early,
though. We have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency has been Rojas' main problem, especially with his
split-finger fastball, which he said he needs to get over for
first-pitch strikes. Rojas has retired 19 of the 27 first batters
he has faced this season. When he doesn't retire the first batter,
that is when the trouble usually starts.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas retired the first batter in Miami on Sunday, in what he
called his worst outing of the season. But the Marlins then touched
him for a one-out walk, a run-scoring double, a run-scoring
groundout and another run-scoring double. All of a sudden, a 4-0
game was 4-3. Two other Mets relievers, Brian Bohanon and John
Hudek, could not hold on. And, for the second time in three games,
the Mets' bullpen had blown a game.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the season, Manager Bobby Valentine could have turned
to McMichael, who was something of an insurance policy for Rojas.
Since the Nomo trade on June 4, however, Valentine has tried
Bohanon, Hudek and Turk Wendell in game-breaking situations, and no
one has had much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel's still there,'' Valentine said. ``We have to fill that
other spot.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Internet birth a reality even though most couldn't see it
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The first delivery shown over the Internet produced a
baby boy, but thousands who turned in couldn't see the birth.
</P>
<P>
   For those who got through, the images were abrupt _ they tended
to freeze _ and blurry at best. Still, thousands tried to see the
birth of 7-pound, 8-ounce Sean, the fourth child of Elizabeth, a
40-year-old woman who didn't want her last name used. Cameras were
discreetly trained on Elizabeth's side and in front of her hospital
bed, but nurses backs blocked any view of the actual delivery.
</P>
<P>
   America's Health Network, which put the delivery on its Internet
site, said there were more than 10 million hits at the Web site
throughout the day. At any one minute, 5,000 viewers were able to
log onto the site.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth and the network said they wanted to help educate
mothers-to-be and quell their fears. But those who logged on may
not have gotten much of an educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit here and say this is the proper method to educate
the public,'' said Peggy Hotz, the department director for
perinatal services at Crawford Long of Hospital of Emory Hospital.
``The problem with the Web is that no one is there to give support
or answer questions that may rise from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did not rise at the crack of dawn to follow
Elizabeth from her 6 a.m. check-in to her delivery at 10:40 a.m.,
was Christopher Rywalt, a New Jersey resident who tried to showhis
wife's delivery live through the internet last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rywalt, who wrote about the conception and development of their
first baby on a Web site called ``It's Just Another Baby''
(http://www.westnet.com/ (tilde)crywalt/pregnancy.contents.htm),
admitted that he did not find Tuesday morning's live birth ``too
thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could just be bitter,'' joked Rywalt.
</P>
<P>
   He had arranged to show his wife's delivery over the Web, but
the hospital pulled the plug at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural outcome of the Web site. It was in
conjunction with the book and so those who were following it could
join in,'' said Rywalt. ``We wanted to do it because it was a fun
thing to do. The tradition on the Internet is that people say,
`This is fun, let's do it because we can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Werbach, managing editor of ``Release 1.0,'' a monthly
newsletter that discusses trends in the computer industry, said
that the amazing factor of the Internet is that it allows
information and events such as a live birth to be broadcast, an
event that the original creators of the Internet most likely never
imagined or expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is the Internet allows everybody to be a
publisher. It lets people who would not have access to the media to
get the word out,'' said Werbach. ``It makes it possible to
distribute information, although information on childbirth may be
stretching it.''

   NEW YORK _ A federal prosecutor in Manhattan told a jury Tuesday
that Anthony Baez died one winter's night in 1994 outside his
parents' home in the Bronx after he was intentionally choked during
an arrest by a New York City police officer, Francis Livoti.
</P>
<P>
   But, the prosecutor also told the jury, ``This is not a murder
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In those six words, the prosecutor, Mark Pomerantz, summed up
how the federal government plans to use a different legal strategy
than the state did to try to convict Livoti in Baez's death. Two
years ago, Livoti was acquitted on state charges of criminally
negligent homicide after a judge ruled that the government had
failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Baez's death was
caused by an illegal choke hold, rather than a severe asthma
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Livoti goes on trial in federal district court in
Manhattan, the federal government will only have to prove that in
causing Baez bodily harm, Livoti violated his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell,'' Pomerantz said, ``this is a case about police
brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   But Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, argued that his client had
never sought to harm Baez, whose death he said was accidental, the
result of an asthma attack.
</P>
<P>
   London asserted that Livoti, who was later dismissed from the
police force, did not use a choke hold on Baez. He said that Baez
and his brothers had confronted the police and were resisting
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they just acquiesced to this,'' London said, ``the whole
situation would have been diffused at that very moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Tuesday, two of Baez's brothers testified about how
their family had come to their parents' home at 6 Cameron Place in
the University Heights section of the Bronx for Christmas, and in a
family ritual, played a late-night touch football game, not
bothering anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But several police officers drove up, and after a football
accidentally hit one of their cars several times, Livoti stepped
out of his car and threatened the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody touch the police officer?'' Pomerantz asked one of
the brothers, Henry Bothwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bothwell replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody make any threatening gestures toward him?''
Pomerantz continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bothwell answered.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Pomerantz told the jury that Livoti's decision to put
Baez into a prohibited choke hold ``was not an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did that after having been warned not to use excessive
force in making arrests,'' Pomerantz said.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz, the chief of the criminal division of the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan, said that the government would
build its case in part on medical evidence, including autopsy
findings that he said would prove that an illegal choke hold was
used on Baez.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz said that the department prohibited officers from
using choke holds ``because they are potentially lethal; they can
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government would show that Livoti's use of the choke
hold was neither an accident nor inadvertent. Prosecutors will cite
an earlier case of police brutality in which Livoti started to
choke a 16-year-old boy who was driving a motorized cart, an
allegation that London has said that his client denies.
</P>
<P>
   By avoiding the question of whether Livoti's actions that night
directly caused Baez's death, prosecutors hope to avoid the outcome
of the 1996 state trial, after which a State Supreme Court justice
ruled that the government had failed to prove its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is not arguing to you that Francis Livoti
intentionally killed Anthony Baez,'' Pomerantz told the jury
Tuesday. ``The charge is that Francis Livoti deprived Anthony Baez
of a federal constitutional right.'' He described that as the
``right to be secure in our persons, the right not to have
unreasonable force used against us by someone who is making an
arrest.''

SORE ELS WILL GIVE IT A GO AT OPEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ernie Els grimaced as he responded to the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it stemmed from the pain in his lower back. Maybe it was
simply a reflection of his disappointment at not being able to
defend his U.S. Open title while completely healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Els' face conveyed as much information as his lips
yesterday at the Olympic Club as he stopped just short of
dismissing himself as a candidate to win his third Open title in
five years when play begins in tomorrow's first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back is not 100 percent, obviously,'' Els said, wincing
slightly. ``It is very frustrating. This is the wrong timing for me
to get this kind of injury. Maybe I should just slow down a little
bit and take it easy for a couple of weeks. There will be more U.S.
Opens and British Opens.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments suggest that Els, who withdrew from last week's
Buick Classic because of back spasms, questions whether he will be
healthy enough to be a factor at next month's British Open, much
less this week's competition at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Els said yesterday that he plans to report for tomorrow's noon
tee time although he characterized his status as an Open
participant as ``a day-to-day thing.'' He has spent the past week
in consultation with physical therapist Tom Boers, a back
specialist from Columbus, Ga., who accompanied Els to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After withdrawing from the Buick Classic, Els did not hit a golf
ball for four days. Instead, he walked, did stretching exercises
and underwent therapy. He was cleared to play a practice round
yesterday but said he still experienced some minor pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is coming from the lower back and it is on the left side of
the spine,'' said Els, 28, who has two victories and 10 Top-10
finishes in a combined 14 starts this season on the European and
PGA tours. ``It's a couple of joints that got really stiff. The
muscle started helping it to turn and when it got tired of doing
that, it just kind of seized up and went into spasm. To get that
healthy, obviously, takes a bit of time and the right bit of
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, who ranks 19th on the PGA Tour season earnings list
($667,638), said he was unsure what triggered the injury. But he
said his frequent transcontinental flights this spring probably did
not help the situation and could lead to a cutback on his European
Tour schedule in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   In six events on the 1998 European Tour, Els has not finished
worse than third. He won the South African Open. On the PGA Tour,
he won the Bay Hill Invitational and finished 16th at the Masters
Tournament, the season's first major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Els, who won his first U.S. Open title in 1994, said he was
unsure if he would practice today or simply show up for tomorrow's
opening round and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it is the U.S. Open, I can't really just go out and
hit balls right now. It might flare up again. So, the less tension
I put on it, the better,'' Els said. ``As bad as it is, it's still
a lot better than last week. My swing isn't where you want to be.
But at least I can go out there and make a good pass at it. I'm
hoping that old saying about `Beware of the wounded golfer' has
some truth to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Els said a more realistic goal would be that the
injury will heal in time to allow him a chance to make a legitimate
run at a British Open title. In May, Els proclaimed winning the
British Open as his primary goal for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to win all four at least once . . . and I've
already won two U.S. Opens. My sights are really on the British
Open,'' Els said while competing at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his back injury might impact those plans, Els said:
``If I can just get through the next couple of weeks without doing
too much damage to it, I will be all right.''

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Bobby Witt's nine-plus years with the Rangers
came to a sudden end yesterday when the club designated him for
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Rangers must figure out how to replace him in their
rotation, and Todd Van Poppel has emerged as a strong possibility
if general manager Doug Melvin can't make a trade.

   The Rangers have expressed a strong interest in Cincinnati Reds
right-hander Pete Harnisch, but Melvin said the team is unlikely to
trade for a starter before Saturday, which was Witt's next
scheduled start.

   Meanwhile, the Rangers have 10 days to trade or release Witt,
who declined an offer to pitch at Triple-A Oklahoma.

AFTER 30 YEARS AS GADFLY, A STATE SENATOR BOWS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It is the time of year when Franz Leichter's
colleagues in the state Senate ardently wish that he would
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   As the legislative session lurches to an end and lawmakers try
to rush through piles of complicated bills, Leichter, a Democrat
from the Upper West Side of New York City, starts reeling off
questions. On the last day of session, he is usually unstoppable,
challenging bill after bill as the hours creep past and his
colleagues roll their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers say they will suffer Leichter's last-minute
tirades a little more gladly this year, because they will mark the
end of an era. The session, which will probably end on Thursday, is
his last. Leichter will retire in December after three decades in
office, leaving the Legislature without one of its harshest critics
and most staunchly liberal members.
</P>
<P>
   Though his career as in-house gadfly has left him with few
concrete legislative achievements, lawmakers say that without him
the Democratic minority in the Senate will agitate less effectively
and the Republican majority will breathe more easily.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Leichter says the public has become so mistrustful
of government, and his colleagues on both sides of the aisle have
become so lethargic, that he is finally too frustrated to press on.
</P>
<P>
   Leichter, 67, entered politics at a time when leftist
philosophies were fashionable in New York City, though not in
Albany, and won an Assembly seat in 1968. He used the platform to
speak out against the Vietnam War, and he called in vain for the
legalization of marijuana and changes to the notoriously secretive
budget process in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he moved to the Senate, where he began writing damning
reports on topics like campaign finance law, banking practices and
corporate tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Leichter, whose district snakes from Chelsea in
Manhattan to Riverdale in the Bronx, has inveighed against
pork-barrel spending, back-room deal-making and the rigidly
hierarchical leadership system in the Legislature, which he says
``stifles initiative and productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   In relinquishing his seat, Leichter says, he is relinquishing
hope that the system will change in his lifetime. ``It's a tightly
closed system that has crystallized and become even more of a way
of life since I came here,'' he said recently. ``This is not a time
to be in government. Continuing to do the same thing is not going
to accomplish much at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the minority party for his entire legislative
career, Leichter has never been able to accomplish much. But he has
frequently drawn attention to what he sees as Republican misdeeds.
And he has brought about some measure of change.
</P>
<P>
   After Leichter revealed in the early 1980s that the state's Job
Incentive Board had given Tiffany &AMP; Co. a $5 million tax credit for
expanding its store on Fifth Avenue, Gov. Mario Cuomo abolished the
incentive program. And his reports that criticized fund-raising
practices by members of the New York City Board of Estimate helped
persuade city officials to create an independent campaign-finance
board in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franz is unique because he attacks the process like an
outsider,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of New York
Public Interest Research Group, which has worked with Leichter on
consumer and environmental issues. ``Instead of developing
relationships with more powerful members, he has tried to generate
public interest, which can have a much more powerful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Leichter rarely stops hurling accusations and
complaints, his colleagues say he is one of the best-liked
legislators in Albany. Even lawmakers who tangle with him in the
Senate greet him warmly outside the chamber, and many even play
tennis with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franz has a lot of respect across the board because he happens
to be a warm and friendly person,'' said Sen. Guy Velella, a R-New
York City. ``He's one of the last beatnik types there is, thank
God. But he is a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, like Sen. Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh, are
less charitable, but hardly vindictive toward their colleague from
the 30th District. ``Well,'' Stafford said, ``he's certainly
indefatigable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An immigrant from Austria whose mother died in a Nazi
concentration camp, Leichter worked for Adlai Stevenson's
presidential campaign in 1956, while attending Harvard Law School.
After graduation, he joined the reform wing of the Manhattan
Democratic Party, which was challenging the Tammany Hall political
machine that had controlled Democratic politics for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fighting against the boss-dominated party organization
that existed in New York, which still exists, more or less, in
Albany,'' Leichter said. ``I liked the openness. I was very
idealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   He raised enough hackles in the Assembly that the Republican
majority tried to get rid of him, eliminating his seat when it
redrew the state's legislative districts in 1972. Undeterred,
Leichter moved his wife and two children seven blocks north to run
in the newly drawn district.
</P>
<P>
   Leichter decided to run for the Senate in 1974, when the federal
government declared the reapportionment illegal and carved up his
new district. The Republican majority again tried to thwart him,
redrawing the Senate district so that he once again lived outside
it. He moved a second time and defeated Sen. Joseph Zaretzski, the
Democratic minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Leichter would presumably have trouble drumming up votes in most
other districts, though _ especially in recent years, with a
Republican in the Governor's office and many voters favoring
smaller government. In what his colleagues describe as a
quintessential Leichter move, he introduced legislation in 1995 to
repeal Gov. George Pataki's popular income-tax cuts, saying they
benefited only the wealthy. Not surprisingly, the bill died.
</P>
<P>
   So why spend hours extolling bills that have no chance of
passage, and challenging others that will pass no matter how loudly
Leichter protests?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel that is what I was sent up here to do,'' Leichter
said. ``To fight against that sense of futility. I have a visceral
dislike for the idea of putting these bills through without
discussion. My colleagues say, `What's the use? You get up and
debate the bill and you get three votes against it.' But if nothing
else, I want to know at least that I voted right.''
</P>
<P>
   In appearance, Leichter is more neatnik than beatnik, wearing
double-breasted suits, starched shirts and glasses with scholarly
frames. He has worked for a law firm on Park Avenue since 1988,
specializing in international corporate litigation. He likes movies
about politics, books about economics and Wagnerian operas.
</P>
<P>
   He does not talk about his wife, Nina, who suffered from
depression and committed suicide in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Even his friends describe Leichter as a workaholic, and while he
is leaving the Legislature, he has no intention of fading from
view. He is a candidate for a seat on the Federal Housing Finance
Board, and is considering teaching or working with advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Although Leichter's final legislative session has been one of
the most uneventful in years, he has managed to carp with his usual
flair. He introduced a campaign finance bill and has pressed for a
bill that would speed the creation of Hudson River Park, which
would stretch from Battery Park to 59th Street in New York City.
But over all, Leichter sums up the 1998 legislative session as
depressingly stagnant, with lawmakers driven by polls and
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paucity of new programs and ideas, whether they come from
the right or the left, shows how dispirited people are,'' Leichter
said. ``I think we can say that the Legislature is brain dead.''

COWBOYS RELEASE TOLBERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOSIE KARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In a move motivated more by concerns about
productivity than about the salary cap, the Cowboys released
veteran defensive end Tony Tolbert yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tolbert, who had three years left on his contract, nor
the Cowboys were convinced the 30-year-old, who recently underwent
arthroscopic surgery on both knees, is ready for the physical
demands of an NFL season, team vice president Stephen Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting Tolbert now, the Cowboys save his base salary of
almost $2.5 million against the 1998 salary cap. The Cowboys are
responsible for almost $1 million of Tolbert's prorated signing
bonus toward the 1998 salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert, who has spent all nine years of his career with the
Cowboys, could be re-signed if he and the Cowboys determine he is
ready to play at a later date. He is free to sign with any other
NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, playing in the NFL for as long as Tony Tolbert has
can take a toll on you,'' Jones said. ``...Obviously, he wants to
play at the level Tony Tolbert's accustomed to. We finally sat down
and mutually decided this was probably in the best interest for
both people at this time, although no doors have been shut for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Cowboys have no immediate interest in any
free-agent defensive ends and will likely enter training camp next
month with rookie Greg Ellis and third-year player Kavika Pittman
scheduled to start. Jones said he probably will initiate contract
talks this week with Ellis' agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also might move rookie Michael Myers from tackle to
end and might use linebacker Broderick Thomas at defensive end
again, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good options,'' Jones said. ``There are several
players we think can play well and come to the forefront for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of Tolbert was not the result of the player refusing
a pay cut, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never discussed a pay cut with Tony. It was strictly Tony
feeling what level he could play football at and how he could help
the Dallas Cowboys,'' Jones said. ``If at some point he feels he
can help us, he is going to let us know that, similar to (offensive
tackle) Mark Tuinei.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys released Tuinei, a 15-year veteran, before the draft
because of his knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert's off-season knee surgery was his second round of double
arthroscopic surgery in the past two years. Tolbert recorded a
career-high 12 sacks in 1996 but had only five last season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NANJING, China _ New Bibles stream forth from a computerized
printing press in this onetime southern capital at a rate of two
and a half million a year, for sale to Christians all over China.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening in 1988, the publishing company, a joint venture
of the government-approved Protestant Church and a global charity,
United Bible Societies, has shipped out 18 million inexpensive
Bibles, an astonishing turn in a country that only a few decades
ago tried to stamp out religion for good.
</P>
<P>
   The Bibles are quickly bought and eagerly used. In downtown
Nanjing on any Sunday morning at St. Paul's Church, one of the
city's seven legal Protestant churches, the pews overflow with more
than 1,000 worshipers at each of two services, while hundreds more
watch from another building on closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   With hymns, a sermon, and the closing recitation of the Lord's
Prayer, the services here, and at thousands of other churches
around the country, have the rhythms of mainstream Protestant
services anywhere. Like many urban churches, this one has a
preponderance of older women, some of whom were Christian before
the communist takeover in 1949, but around the country many men and
women, young and old, are embracing Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Such open, joyous displays of worship were unusual in the 1950s,
as the Communists reshaped China, and unthinkable during Mao's
Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976, when churches were burned and
those Christians who were not jailed could only hold clandestine
prayer meetings, and dared not own a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Bibles flow and churchgoers worship, at least scores
of Protestant and Catholic leaders are held in in labor camps or
jails for refusing to bow to government control. While the
confirmed number of imprisoned Christians appears to be lower than
is often asserted abroad, their travails are a telling sign that
religion here is not truly free.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, security agents reportedly razed an unapproved
Catholic church in Fujian, while in Hebei, to the north, they
arrested a pro-Vatican bishop who was too energetically promoting
his faith. Last fall, the leader of a fervent born-again sect known
as the Weepers was sentenced to a three-year term for disturbing
public order.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of other Christians who reject the official church must
practice their faith with a wary eye, and even those who embrace
the government cannot publicly proclaim or spread their faith as
they might wish to.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of religious persecution _ of Christians and also of
Tibetan Buddhists and some Muslim groups _ has emerged as perhaps
the most potent human rights issue in Chinese-American relations,
one President Clinton cannot avoid as he prepares to visit Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is under pressure in Congress to raise the issue. In
March, as the House passed a human-rights resolution, Rep. Chris
Smith, R-N.J., declared that Beijing's tight control over religion
``is totally unacceptable and ought to be condemned.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the West point to the restrictions and repression as
evidence of systematic persecution, while the government's
defenders here point, instead, to the relative freedom most
Christians now enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the rising outcry abroad comes as Christianity in
China, especially evangelical Protestantism, is growing
explosively. The Rev. Don Argue, recent president of the National
Association of Evangelicals in the United States, says China may be
experiencing ``the single greatest Revival in the history of
Christianity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of that growth has occurred with official acquiescence, and
though they remain a small minority in a giant country, millions of
Chinese people like Zhang Linmei, a 32-year-old worshiper at St.
Paul's, find the same comfort in religion that Christians do
anywhere, without worrying much about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel life is meaningless in society at large,'' Ms. Zhang
said after services as she picked up her 5-year-old daughter,
dressed in her finest, from Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only reliable place in my life,'' Ms. Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation for religion is in many ways the best it's been
since 1949,'' said Richard Madsen, an expert on Chinese religion at
the University of California at San Diego. Though the government
still controls their growth and closely monitors their activities,
he said, the official churches enjoy more autonomy today than in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Even the illegal churches _ unregistered Protestant churches and
openly pro-Vatican Catholic groups _ function without serious
trouble in many places, Madsen and others say. But those who refuse
to pledge support to the government and its apparatus of religious
control, and those with unorthodox or ecstatic styles of worship,
can face harsh repression. The situation is similar for other major
religions here, including Buddhists and Muslims. Many believers now
enjoy relative freedom, but Tibetan Buddhists who consider the
Dalai Lama their leader face repression.

<P>
   In 1949, there were fewer than 1 million Protestants here. In
1979, three years after the end of the Cultural Revolution when
Maoist mobs attacked churches and the homes of believers, only
three Protestant churches were open in all of China.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of Christians in China's population of
1.2 billion range from about 15 million to 35 million, or, some
believe, many more. Chinese church officials say that there are 12
million Protestants, and outside experts like Madsen say that the
actual number may be at least 20 million and rising. More than
12,000 official Protestant churches are open and, again by official
estimates, Christians without access to churches or professional
pastors meet in some 25,000 homes or other meeting points. These
estimates ignore groups that the government regards as criminal,
and are believed to understate the total greatly.
</P>
<P>
   The legions of Protestants include new converts like Xu Wenju, a
74-year-old widow in Beijing who first attended a large official
church in 1995 at the urging of a neighbor and, she says, found
spiritual sustenance. She was soon baptized and now says that she
feels healthier, and that her family has become more harmonious.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It includes those born into Christian families like Dr. Wu, a
75-year-old retired physician in Beijing who read the Bible at age
6 and has wanted to spread the Gospel ever since. Chafing at the
controls of the official church, he was jailed for over a year in
the 1950s, he said, and he still prefers a house church, as the
illegal gatherings are known.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the police came to his house and took his religious
books and tapes, said Wu, who declined to give his full name. But
they left him his personal Bible, telling him: ``You can believe
but you cannot preach.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes a 30-year-old economics student in Beijing, Ms. Li,
who said a friend had introduced the Gospel to her. She, too,
attends a small house church, not for political reasons but
because, she said: ``I think there is more a feeling of love, and
more opportunity for fellowship.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that Catholics now number 4 million, while outside
researchers say that the true total may be closer to 10 million,
with many secretly accepting the pope as the true head of their
church.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar hybrid state of Christianity here reflects the
general obsession of the Communist Party with control: virtually
any organization, whether political or social or religious, must
gain party approval.
</P>
<P>
   The party is an officially atheist organization that asserts
that religion will eventually wither away. But in a policy spelled
out in the early 1980s, the government officially guarantees
freedom of religion _ within prescribed boundaries including a
required allegiance to the state, adherence to certain styles of
worship, and limits on church construction, evangelizing, and the
baptism of children, among other rules.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For those willing to accommodate, the 1990s seem a golden time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, now is the best period ever for
implementing the policy of religious freedom,'' said Han Wenzao,
who as president of the China Christian Council is the national
leader of the official Protestant church and a prime link to the
communist government. ``The criterion should be, is the word of God
being propagated or not? It is and it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Han, who is 75 and has his office in the Jinling Union Seminary
of Nanjing, says he became a devout Christian at a missionary
college though he was never ordained. He helped create the
official, ``patriotic'' Protestant church here during the period
after the communist takeover in 1949, when, he says, it was
politically necessary to repudiate the ``imperialist'' sponsorship
of foreign missionaries. The willing believers joined in a generic,
nondenominational church.
</P>
<P>
   Han and other official leaders are bitterly denounced as
sell-outs and ``fake Christians'' by some who reject the notion of
saluting an atheistic state, and who often suffered terribly for
refusing to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Yuan Xiangchen, also known as Allen Yuan, 84, is one of the
best-known leaders of the house church movement. He simply says:
``The head of the church is not any agency or person. The head of
the Church is Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The official church is led by the Communists,'' he added.
``That's why we worship at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuan, like many of the more defiant figures here, spent more
than 20 years in jail for his beliefs, and in recent years has
faced on-and-off curbs on his travel and work. At present, he is
allowed to preach to up to several dozen followers in a dingy room,
with a picture of the Rev. Billy Graham tacked on the wall, in an
alleyway in the center of Beijing _ one of dozens such illegal
gatherings that Beijing authorities suffer to exist, under a tight
watch.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month, Yuan said he was forbidden to
collect money from worshipers, and he added that controls were
often more stringent on house churches in rural areas. More
recently, security officials have warned him not to speak to
reporters.

<P>
   While for those in prison the situation is all too stark, the
religious picture in China today is often painted in shades of
gray.
</P>
<P>
   The printing press outside Nanjing can produce millions of
Bibles, for example, a clear boon to the church. But the press, the
Nanjing Amity Printing Co., must reach agreement each year with the
government's Religious Affairs Bureau over how many Bibles it can
actually print _ well below its capacity _ and the books can only
be sold in churches, not in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Yet officials have also allowed the press to supply more than
1.2 million Bibles, through an American missionary group led by Ned
Graham, a son of Billy Graham, to unapproved house churches.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, as religious activity began to recover here,
outside evangelical groups had begun smuggling many Bibles into the
country in suitcases. One of the major smugglers was Doug Sutphen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Sutphen's East Gates Ministries, from the Seattle area,
negotiated a deal in which it bought Nanjing Bibles to distribute
outside official channels. He later handed over the organization to
Ned Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no need for smuggling any more,'' said Sutphen, who now
dreams of some day arranging _ legally _ for a Christian television
station in China. Graham has not responded to requests for an
interview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To illustrate another gray area: officially, evangelizing is
forbidden in China. The definition has become blurred, though, as
officials struggle to co-opt rapidly spreading Protestantism,
especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   During a surprise visit several weeks ago to the Saint James
Protestant Church in Yichang, a city on the Yangtze River in Hubei,
the pastor, the Rev. Zhu Zhigao, said that tens of thousands of
people in the surrounding mountains had become Christian through
person-to-person contact or under the influence of Hong Kong radio
programs.
</P>
<P>
   So his church has brought in groups of rural Christian leaders,
two groups of 40 each in the last year, for two-month training
sessions, to serve as lay ministers in their villages. Among other
things, he shows them imported videotapes about Christianity. And
he distributes Bibles from the Nanjing press.
</P>
<P>
   One of the government's greatest fears is the breakaway
emergence of an unorthodox sect that might seriously challenge
public order _ at the extreme, something like the Taiping Rebellion
of the mid-1800s, which began with a charismatic Christian sect
leader, and eventually conquered half of China, with Nanjing as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
   From the government's perspective, then, giving mainstream, if
limited, theological training to leaders of a budding rural church
is preferable to letting them forge their own paths, possibly into
what the government considers illegal cults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very free to spread the Gospel,'' said Zhu, who also
serves on local governmental bodies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Catholics have a seemingly clear litmus test: do they accept
the leadership of the National Patriotic Catholic Movement and its
selection of bishops, or do they, like Catholics in other
countries, reserve those roles for the pope? Some of the most
pro-Vatican bishops and priests are persecuted or jailed. Yet there
are many permutations.
</P>
<P>
   Many priests in the official church say they remain privately
loyal to the Vatican. The Vatican, for its part, says that while
many newer priests and bishops are not legally ordained, they are
true Catholics with the spiritual power to celebrate Mass and
perform other sacred duties _ ``valid but not licit'' is the
tortured phrase used by the Vatican to describe their status. The
Vatican has even granted secret approval to some official church
leaders, Madsen says.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, to help meet the acute shortage of theology
teachers, China has allowed groups of Vatican-ordained priests,
from Hong Kong, Taiwan and elsewhere, to teach in official
seminaries in China, according to church officials in Hong Kong.
Groups of official Chinese priests have also studied in the
Vatican-run seminary in Hong Kong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And still the repression of some Christians continues, to
different degrees among the country's far-flung regions.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people in jails or labor camps for their religious
activity is a matter of dispute, but loose assertions abroad that
thousands are in prison appear to be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Two major human rights groups, Amnesty International, based in
London, and Human Rights Watch, in New York, both say _ while
admitting to deep uncertainties _ that they find solid evidence
only that scores of people are now in some form of long-term
detention for their Christian activities: several dozen Catholic
leaders, and a similar number of Protestants, are thought to be
held.
</P>
<P>
   Imprisonment is increasingly reserved for major organizers and
leaders, while brief detentions and fines have been the more common
penalty levied against illegal Christian groups, said Arlette
Laduguie of Amnesty International. But she warned that information
even on some recent large-scale crackdowns, like the arrests of
hundreds of Roman Catholics last year in Jiangxi Province as part
of a campaign against a powerful illegal movement, may not emerge
for many months.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom in
Washington and one of the sharpest American critics of China, said
that on the basis of various field reports her group believes that
at least 500 Christian leaders are serving sentences, while at
least another 500 followers are detained at any given time,
justifying her published statements that thousands are under
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict and arrests may have intensified in the mid-1990s as
the government, faced with an explosive spread of Christian groups
and a shortage of reliable pastors, made a strong new push to
require all religious groups to register with authorities. Those
refusing have often been hounded.
</P>
<P>
   While the registration drive is notorious among the house
churches and their international supporters, it is actually good
for Christianity, asserted Han, the official Protestant leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you register, your legal status is protected,'' Han said.
``That's something we wanted,'' he said _ to provide a defense
against the lawless persecution seen in the past. The argument is
rejected by those who just wish to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Han admitted that local officials sometimes improperly harass
the church, and said he had on several occasions called on national
authorities to rectify a local problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the grass-roots or country level, there are still some
people who cannot understand the central government's policy of
religious freedom,'' he said. He adds that local officials
sometimes have trouble distinguishing cults, which are banned, from
genuine Christian groups.
</P>
<P>
   On that question, the definition of a cult, opinions differ.
Han's sympathies do not extend to the likes of Xu Yongze, the
Weepers leader recently sentenced to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Xu's followers are said to cry, sometimes for days, until they
find a vision. Han said Xu's views were heresy, caused mental
disorders and disturbances to neighbors, and were a violation of
the law.
</P>
<P>
   The very drive for conformity is part of the problem, rights
advocates say. In its effort to define acceptable beliefs and limit
how religion can be publicly expressed, China violates
international standards of religious freedom as laid out in
international charters and resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to believe what you want and the right to publicly
manifest that belief when and where and with whom you want is
what's at stake,'' said Mickey Siegal, a Human Rights Watch
researcher in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem altogether is discrimination even against legal
Christians, who usually cannot hold senior positions in government
or the vast state-run economy. This reflects a more fundamental
trait of China: high office is still almost entirely reserved for
members of the Communist Party _ who are not supposed to adopt
Christianity or any other religion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Recent Sunday services at St. Paul's Church in Nanjing
exemplified the moderate, hybrid style of Protestantism that is
promoted by government agencies. In what could have been a scene at
an American Presbyterian or Lutheran church, the members shared
prayers and the Apostle's Creed, and they sang hymns with the robed
choir. The recited verses from Acts and Psalms, and watched as six
men from an ethnic minority group in Yunan, here on an exchange,
sang a hymn in thanks for the hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   They listened to a pleasant 20-minute sermon by the middle-aged
Pastor Lin De'en, telling the story of a man who on his deathbed
finally appreciated the Christianity of his wife and son, and
concluding with an ode to the value of personal worship: it will
help you become modest, honest, patient, and love one another.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the house churches, in contrast, have the fiery spirit
and orations of a revival meeting, the passion fed by a shared
sense of persecution. Some also have links with foreign evangelists
who slip into China, in unknown numbers, to exhort their brethren,
sometimes with just the kinds of messages the government most
abhors.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent house church service in a central Chinese city that,
to protect the preacher, cannot be identified, two such
missionaries, an Asian woman and a European man, showed up
unannounced and were given the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Christians were persecuted, too,'' the Asian said.
``We all must go out and spread the word!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must take the word of Jesus to Tibet and Xinjiang,'' she
said, referring to the mainly Buddhist and Muslim border regions.
</P>
<P>
   The European man took over. ``They burn down a church every
week, but the church is not made of wood,'' he said. ``Let us go
out and plant 1 million house churches,'' he said to the crowd of
perhaps 50. ``It will turn China upside down! God give us China or
we die!''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese pastor took over, his air a bit more moderate.
``It's true, we should all go out and start new house churches,''
he said. But, he added, ``If you go to the official church, then
don't come here.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rabbi Hillel A. Fine, an educator, expert in Semitic
languages, and, most recently, director of the New Orleans Hillel
Foundation, died of a heart attack on May 25 in New York City. He
was 77 and had lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan since his
retirement in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Fine was ordained in 1948 at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati,
where he also earned a doctorate in Semitic languages. He briefly
served as assistant rabbi at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan before
returning to Hebrew Union in 1948 to lecture in the department of
history.
</P>
<P>
   He served as rabbi of Reform Temple Ohev Sholom in Harrisburg,
Pa., from 1956 to 1970, when he accepted the post in New Orleans.
The foundation serves Jewish students at Tulane University and
Newcomb College, the University of New Orleans and Loyola
University, where he also taught as an adjunct faculty member and
introduced credit courses in Hebrew and Judaica.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Birmingham, England, and attended the
Universities of Pennsylvania and Cincinnati before completing his
rabbinical studies.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of many articles on Judaica and Semitic
languages. He also wrote ``Studies in Middle Assyrian Chronology
and Religion'' (Hebrew Union Press, 1955).
</P>
<P>
   Fine is survived by two sisters, Jean Trichter, of Hollywood,
Fla., and Miriam Miller, of Allentown, Pa.; and a brother, Aaron
M., of Swarthmore, Pa.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Meet Paul Soros, the invisible Soros. He is 71, the
older brother of George, the 67-year-old financier-philanthropist
famous for giving away nearly $2 billion. Big brother says little
brother got all the attention when they were children _ ``that's
always what the older one feels.'' It hasn't changed today, unless
you know that Paul Soros made his own fortune, separate from
George, building the world's largest industrial ports.
</P>
<P>
   But last month Paul Soros and his wife, Daisy, made their first
foray into major philanthropy when they announced the creation of a
$50 million trust to help underwrite American graduate education
for immigrants and their children. The Paul &AMP; Daisy Soros
Fellowships for New Americans will give selected students one-half
of their tuition costs plus $20,000, for up to three years, at any
graduate institution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are 20 recipients for the 1998-99 school year. One is a
Cambodian-born woman, Na Eng, who escaped with her parents from the
Khmer Rouge at age 5 and will go to Columbia University. Another is
Rajiv Doshi, of Indian parentage, who invented a prosthesis for
upper-arm amputees. He is at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big trend in this city is putting your name on a
building,'' Mrs. Soros said. ``Which didn't appeal to my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this instead,'' Soros said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple say their largess had nothing to do with playing
catch-up with brother George, one of the few people in the world
who can make $50 million look like chump change. George Soros has
given the bulk of his billions to build free societies in former
communist countries; last fall he pledged a $500 million grant over
the next three years to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Paul and Daisy Soros describe their gift as a creative
use of their millions when other philanthropists are searching for
something to do with their money beyond writing checks to the
ballet. So far, Soros says, he and his wife have given $4 million
to other causes this year.
</P>
<P>
   The most romantic is underwriting Midsummer Night Swing, a month
of dancing under the stars at Lincoln Center. ``I generally don't
give to endowments,'' Soros said. ``By its nature, the money has to
be very conservatively managed. I find it wasteful to contribute to
something when it earns 7 or 8 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul and Daisy Soros talked in their apartment of potted white
orchids and a very large poodle at 78th Street and Fifth Avenue, 11
blocks down the street from George, who is at this moment on
vacation in Lapland, observing reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Soros looks like a slightly older version of George Soros _
that is, another courtly might-have-been academic. Daisy Soros, 68,
has blond hair and chic suits, and looks as if she is on the board
of Lincoln Center, which she is. Soros started out the interview a
little stiff, but warmed up. His wife seemed to be restraining
herself from saying something indiscreet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the biggest difference between these two brothers?''
she said, repeating a question. ``Not much.'' Then she amended:
``The biggest difference is that George's wife is 30 years younger
than I am.'' (George Soros' wife, Susan, is his second.)
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the interesting subject of sibling rivalry.
``First of all, I was four years older,'' Soros said. ``That's a
very bad age difference. I found him a very obnoxious kid. But he
improved with age.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Soros chuckled. ``As kids, we weren't competitive,'' he said.
``Four years was too big a gap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just naturally inferior,'' his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Soros says George has more money, but he has plenty of his own,
and the two brothers are close friends. ``There are different
yardsticks,'' he said. ``So I feel quite happy with what I have
done.'' Friends have estimated George Soros' personal fortune at $5
billion, made through his hedge funds; Paul Soros would not enter
into any speculation about the amount of that fortune, or his own.
He works today with his brother, calling himself a ``global
capitalist'' _ buying companies and investing with George.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any deal I am in, he comes in on,'' Soros said, although he
isn't in on all of George's deals. A decade ago, when George Soros
was as invisible as Paul, Paul advised him against going public
with his philanthropy. But he did not listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side of the argument was that if he wants to be
effective, it's inevitable, and it's necessary, to become a public
personality,'' Soros said. ``That's the part he followed _ not
without occasional regrets.'' Announcing the Paul &AMP; Daisy Soros
Fellowships, Soros said, was similar, ``maybe in some ways. But I
don't think it requires that much being public for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Soros, like George, grew up in Budapest, Hungary, a
lawyer's son. When the communists came to power after World War II,
Paul Soros went to Switzerland with the 1948 Hungarian Olympic ski
team, defected, made his way to the United States (he says he
docked in New York with $17), and got a master's degree in
engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Soros Associates, with offices in the basement
playroom of his house in New Canaan, Conn. _ ``I was the
associate,'' Daisy Soros said _ which eventually built vast
industrial ports. The Soroses have two children.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is a better skier than his brother, but his brother
once beat him in a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That he rubs in,'' he said.

   NEW YORK _ JAMES BRADY, a columnist for Advertising Age and
Parade magazines, was not being a schmoozy and glad-handing author
at the party celebrating the publication of his new novel, ``Gin
Lane'' (St. Martin's Press).
</P>
<P>
   Schmoozy he was. But with absolutely no glad-handing.
</P>
<P>
   Poison ivy, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out pulling weeds in the garden,'' Brady explained, his
skin a pastiche of pinks and reds. ``I don't know anything about
botany. I could be pulling up champion roses or rare botanicals, so
when I pulled up the poison ivy, I guess it just didn't register.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not gripping and grinning at the book party, he
did manage some physical contact. ``I can still slink my arm around
a woman's shoulders and pull her close to me,'' he said. Assuming,
of course, that she is wearing long sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's previous page-turner, ``Further Lane'' (St. Martin's,
1997), looked at the celebrity-driven whirl of East Hampton, N.Y.,

because it dropped the names of real people. Brady said that MARTHA

thought they would come all the way from France and beyond to
beautiful Vermont,'' said Menes, whose flight was delayed at
takeoff because of engine trouble and arrived 90 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   That was not his only airplane problem: The silver trophy he won
was too big to take with him as carry-on luggage on his flight home

LUKE MANDOKI film ``Message in a Bottle,'' added, ``I would love to
get public reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Poe wrote that as ``kind of an afterthought,'' Newman said,
``People take themselves so seriously _ it just drives me nuts.''

seriously, a spokeswoman for Newman's Own said, ``There's nothing

   ``I love it,'' the Internet gossip MATT DRUDGE said of the media
magazine Brill's Content. Drudge, who wore a Walter Winchell-style

TWO COLLEGES IN NEW YORK PLAN TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Into the swirl of proposals about how the City
University of New York should be transformed comes one more: a plan
to merge Queens College and Queensborough Community College to
create a bigger, more comprehensive university, akin to the Albany
or Stony Brook campuses of the State University of New York, with
its own doctoral programs and more generous funding.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which was drawn up by the presidents of the two
colleges after CUNY's trustees told the colleges to be creative in
devising ways to put into practice the board's new policy to remove
remedial classes from their bachelor's degree programs. The two
presidents sent the proposal to CUNY'S chairwoman, Anne Paolucci,
late last week.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY's own projections suggest that its four-year colleges like
Queens will have empty seats as they turn away students who do not
pass placement exams, while community colleges like Queensborough
will be overrun with students. Nearly half of the entering students
at the four-year colleges failed one or more of the placement exams
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Dr. Paolucci, Allen Sessoms, the president at
Queens, and Kurt Schmeller, the president of Queensborough, said
that with their plan for the school, called the University at
Queens, they could fulfill the new remedial policy six months
earlier than the September 1999 deadline that Queens faces. Neither
was willing to comment Tuesday, college spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   For some CUNY trustees, however, the plan may be too creative,
since it raises issues about the mission of the colleges and about
CUNY's model of a central, consortial graduate center, and would
require approval not only by the trustees but also by the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very large, very ambitious plan,'' said Dr.
Paolucci, who called it premature and said it ``is coming from left
field.'' She said that rather than helping pave the way for the
remedial changes, the plan would divert attention.
</P>
<P>
   But Herman Badillo, vice chairman of the CUNY board, said the
proposal might point the way to the future. While it raises a lot
of questions, he said, ``it might be a good idea to review the
whole structure of the community colleges and the senior
colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   David Speidel, acting provost at Queens, said the proposal came
together quickly. The two presidents first met to discuss the idea
on June 4, and sent their one-page proposal to Dr. Paolucci, to
Christoph Kimmich, CUNY's interim chancellor, and to some local
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says universities can't move quickly?'' Speidel said.
</P>
<P>
   At Queens, Nancy Hemmes, a psychology professor and chairwoman
of the college's Academic Senate, said the plan would have the
advantage of allowing students who do not pass the entrance exams
to enroll in two-year programs at Queens. But, she added, ``I'm
overwhelmed with the complexity; it is very difficult to evaluate
it as a complete package.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials at other CUNY campuses in Queens were reserved about
the plan. Kristin Booth Glen, dean of the CUNY law school, said she
had held back when approached about signing on to the plan, saying
she had to consult with her faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Kelly, a spokeswoman for York College, said top
administrators there had not seen the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Reitano, a history professor at La Guardia Community
College and chairwoman of the university faculty senate's community
college caucus, said she feared that such a plan could undermine
the role of the community colleges and their linkages to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Shulman, Queens borough president, was more encouraging.
She called the plan ``an interesting idea that deserves
consideration,'' and said she planned to discuss it with Dr.
Paolucci on Wednesday.

   McGwire pulls 10,000 &QL; 
to see batting practice
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
This would be history, I told the kids on the drive to the
Astrodome, surprised that they seemed impressed. I told them of the
great slugger, as other fathers will for decades when another
larger-than-life lumberjack chases the record Mark McGwire could
claim this season.
</P>
<P>
   I no longer felt as unfit, having failed so to teach the
American lessons of baseball to my children. This would be one of
those family-memory nights.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that if they hear James Earl Jones intone, ``The one
constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball,'' they
would wonder why Darth Vader was talking about baseball and who is
Ray.
</P>
<P>
   But for this night, we would sit in the left-field mezzanine and
catch history.
</P>
<P>
   If Mark McGwire was to hit a rocket, we would be there. If he is
to hit 62 this season, breaking Roger Maris' unbreakable record, or
the 75 he was on pace to hit when he arrived in town Tuesday, we
would grab one. David, my 6-year-old who might miss a putt of a
ground ball off the bat of a 45-pound tee-ball opponent, would
catch whatever the Cardinals' 250-pound human forklift would send
his way. Emily, my daughter, without a glove, would catch it.
</P>
<P>
   And an outfield full of Davids and Emilys and fathers fooling
themselves felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this before,'' Jim Dillon said,
with his 4-year-old, Blake, and Blake's tiny glove at his side.
``I've gone to batting practice for years. Look up here. It's
great. This is special.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time we reached our seats in section 430 _ at 5:10 p.m.
for a 7:05 start _ the left-field mezzanine was packed. The Astros
estimated the batting-practice crowd at 10,000. Most seemed in our
section.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters with notebooks and minicams wandered about, believing
the news to be found 400 feet from home plate and almost two hours
before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us stood and waited. When the Astros' Craig Biggio
reached our seats, we all knew what was to come. ``I know I've got
McGwire's now,'' Steven Maglitto said, having pulled in Biggio's
shot.
</P>
<P>
   But as the crowd grew thicker, Rick Luberger knew the chances of
catching a McGwire home run were shrinking. ``This is why we got
season tickets out here,'' he said. ``Usually you can find them
under the seats up here. But we knew everyone would be out here.
This is the biggest attraction in Major League Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   We knew it was more than even that. I imagined myself old with
that home run ball still on my desk, my kids telling their kids of
the night we brought it home. People around us shared binoculars to
watch McGwire stand still as he waited for the Cardinals reserves
to complete batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he made his way toward the batting cage. And when he
took his turn in the batting cage, we stood, as if the World Series
were reaching its final outs.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 pitches, McGwire hit nine balls to the bleachers. McGwire
hit a few to right, a bunch to center. He pulled a few to the other
side of our reach. Each shot was longer than the lines at the
will-call window. With each, we believed our moment touching
history would come.
</P>
<P>
   And just before we could give up hope, Ron Gant lined a shot
right to us. My son, I'm proud to say, lifted his glove as if to
take his best shot. My daughter reported later she could have
caught it and asked if it would have hurt. And just before the ball
could find my bare hands, Andy Ramirez of Cypress reached a glove
in its path for a clean catch. The fiend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special because Mark McGwire's here,'' he said of his
position in the row in front of us. ``It's a special game.''
</P>
<P>
   And he admitted what we all knew about the shot hit by Ron Gant:
``Twenty years from now, it'll be McGwire's.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time McGwire came to bat in the first inning, all of us
were convinced that his every swing would land a ball in our hands,
and I felt as greedy for that $5 baseball as a contestant on Let's
Make A Deal with Monty Hall walking up the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   When he batted, the dome buzzed and hung on every pitch, every
umpire's call. The crowd in Lefty's Pub squeezed itself to the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was served one pitch to hit and lined it foul. He
walked.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Albert of Seabrook waited in the first row, wearing a
Detroit Red Wings hockey shirt with matching hat, knowing he was
missing his favorite team's chance to win the Stanley Cup to be in
the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Mark McGwire would keep me from the Stanley Cup,'' he
said. ``This is a piece of history. Any baseball fan that does not
see this is ripping himself off.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire led off the third inning. This time, Astros starter Pete
Schourek offered little worth a cut. McGwire walked quickly. In two
at-bats, Paul Bunyan had done no more than Felix Unger could have
managed.
</P>
<P>
   By the time McGwire had grounded into a double play in the fifth
inning, the Cardinals were on their way to an 8-4 lead and the star
attraction of the visiting team was irrelevant. An inning later,
McGwire sent a soft fly ball out to right on the first pitch. In
the eighth, we wore our gloves one last time: McGwire struck out.
</P>
<P>
   We cheered when they retired McGwire, but there might have been
pangs of disappointment, too. The pressure McGwire must now feel to
send a packed left-field mezzanine home with a story to tell will
only increase as long as he chases the record. And the expectations
are not that he will excel but amaze.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Dillon had said he would like to see McGwire reach the
upper deck in center field, a shot perhaps impossible with a
College World Series sledgehammer of a bat.
</P>
<P>
   And though I should have known better, I was disappointed the
impossible had not happened. Dan Gulizia, who drove four hours from
his Navy base in Corpus Christi with his 4-year-old daughter,
Jessie, seemed to take it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see Big Mac hit a home run,'' he said. ``I wanted
to see the Astrodome, and I wanted to bring my daughter to a
ballgame. I love baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all its problems and strife, baseball had us Tuesday
back in its grasp. Even without the proof, we had seen perhaps a
glimpse into a legendary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field, this game, is part of our past, Ray,'' I thought
in James Earl Jones' Field of Dreams voice. ``It reminds us of all
that once was good, and that can be again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the kids understand. &QL;

CRITICS SHOULD WALK A MILE IN MARTIN'S SHOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Casey Martin played a U.S. Open practice round
Tuesday at the Olympic Club. Fellow Stanford golfers Tiger Woods
and Joel Kribel tagged along. What, you were expecting Jack
Nicklaus and Tom Watson to power walk the 6,797-yard Lake Course
alongside Martin's single-rider cart?
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus and Watson both have publicly questioned the fairness
of allowing Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory disease in
his right leg, to use a cart during tournament play. The way they
see it, the disabled golfer who successfully sued the PGA to be
able to use a cart is riding roughshod over the game's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Their perspective might be different if they bothered to change
their vantage point from, say, the inside of their glass houses to
inside the ropes. Because as the 10,000 or so people who followed
his every shot Tuesday can tell you, it's hard to schlep around the
course with Martin and not learn a little something beyond where
the most severe side slopes are on the fairways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch Casey. He has very little strength in his right
leg,'' said Kribel, a rising senior who entered Stanford right
after Martin matriculated, in 1995, but has played with him quite a
few times. ``It's hard for him to drive through the ball. His swing
is almost all upper body. It's incredible he can do what he does.
The people who criticize him, they don't know what he goes
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Picture Scottie Pippen's grimace throughout Game 6 of the NBA
Finals and you know what Martin's expression looked like as he
trudged through ridiculously thick rough adjacent to the 16th
fairway in search of an errant drive. Imagine your great
grandmother walking up a grassy hill that's only slightly less
steep than Hyde Street, where the cable cars clang, and you have a
pretty good idea how Martin looked limping on his brittle right leg
from the 18th green to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was out on the course, ``showing a lot of guts and
courage'' in the words of Woods, when, back in the
climate-controlled comfort of the press tent, Watson was asked to
imagine that his 15-year-old son Michael had the same talent and
disability as Martin. What would he tell him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell him, son, `I want you to play the best you can within
what the Tour will allow,''' replied Watson, another Stanford grad
(class of 1971). ```(If) the Tour doesn't allow it, that is just
one of the tough decisions in life.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Fay, the executive director of the USGA, faced a difficult
decision, one of many that you are bombarded with when you're
bucking tradition. The single-rider cart that the USGA had assigned
to Martin was cute and all, but like the new VW Bug, it has a few
glitches. For starters, it kept stalling.
</P>
<P>
   Fay could have adopted Watson's stance and told Martin, ``I want
you to play the best you can with the cart we'll allow. If it
drives you to distraction, oh well. That's just one of the tough
breaks in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fay put himself in Martin's seat. After taking the cart
for a spin _ and having the brakes lock on him _ Fay recommended
that Martin be allowed to use a standard cart Thursday when he
becomes the first driver in the U.S. Open that is not pulled from
the players' bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing how things happen,'' said Martin, who lives 30
minutes from the Olympic Club, in a condominium in Foster City.
``In the last six months I went from just kind of struggling to
stay in this game and not knowing if I could keep playing to
(playing) in the U.S. Open. I am running on adrenaline right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the cart, he'll be required to do a lot more walking
this week than is good for his leg, which Martin is resigned to
losing, probably sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   Every step hurts, the ostracism by some of his peers stings and
sleep is a recurring nightmare for Martin. But the next complaint
you hear from Martin will be his first.
</P>
<P>
   He has learned to take comfort where he can find it, like in the
crowd that got so loud when Martin birdied the par-4, 347-yard 18th
with a 4-iron, a 9-iron and a 6-foot putt that you would have
thought it was the 72nd hole on Sunday. And indeed, there was a
payday at the end, though Martin suspects he might have trouble
collecting his $30 in side bets from Woods, a notorious tightwad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to hear the crowd roar,'' Martin said. ``That is
the stuff that I dreamt about 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is worth rooting for. The 26-year-old has grace to spare.
Now if he can only find some takers in the Olympic Club locker
room, which could get pretty cold this week no matter what the
thermostat is set at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen a few of those players who were outspoken (about
his not being able to use a cart) and they didn't go out of their
way to say `hi' or anything,'' Martin said. ``At the same time, you
know, they didn't sneer at me, either.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Tom Lehman and John Cook went out of their way
to make Martin feel welcome. As for those who did not, Martin said,
``You wish people could understand what you deal with (because) if
they knew they wouldn't say the kinds of things they do.'' &QL;

ARIZONA HIGH COURT REJECTS BID TO LEGALIZE SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION
FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The latest legislative attempt to equalize school
construction funding in Arizona was rejected Tuesday by the state
Supreme Court, forcing lawmakers to reopen the volatile issue in
the middle of their re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a rare unanimous opinion, said the Students FIRST
law passed in April fails to fulfill the state's constitutional
obligation to maintain a ``general and uniform'' school system
because its funding methods would ``cause substantial disparities
between public school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices gave the Legislature 60 days to come up with
another plan or risk the cutoff of all school funding in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   That means legislators will be writing law with parents and
voters looking over their shoulders. They will have to go back into
special session sometime before Aug. 15, just days before many
public schools are scheduled to open for the fall and a little more
than three weeks before the Sept. 8 primary election. All 90
legislative seats are open, and the cost of failure could be the
national embarrassment of Arizona school doors padlocked by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've obviously got a tough deadline,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Marc Spitzer, R-north-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an election year, so that complicates things. And we've
got members who aren't running for re-election who will be voting
on this. But what I want to do, and what most members want to do,
is keep the schools running.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hogan, who successfully sued the state in 1991 over school
construction disparities, said lawmakers shouldn't be surprised by
Tuesday's ruling because they had ample warning that Students FIRST
would likely be declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they went ahead and passed it, anyway,'' said Hogan,
executive director of the Arizona Center for Law in the Public
Interest. ``They deserve to come back in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan originally sued the state on behalf of a group of poor
districts, arguing that funding school construction through local
property taxes has created unconstitutional disparities between
classroom facilities statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed in 1994 and ordered the Legislature to craft a
solution `'within a reasonable time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers attempted to comply in 1996 and 1997, but both efforts
were rejected by the court. In their earlier rulings, the justices
also upheld a June 30 deadline for legislative action set by a
lower-court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rebecca Albrecht of Maricopa County Superior Court ordered
the state Department of Education to halt the distribution of all
public-school funding if lamakers failed to resolve the case before
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's ruling Tuesday extended the deadline until
Aug. 15, a goal Gov. Jane Hull said officials were prepared to
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Most public schools in Arizona begin their fall semesters in
mid- to late August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I . . . want to assure parents in Arizona the schools will be
operating in August,'' said Hull, who petitioned the court to
uphold the law. ``We will be prepared to have a bill to the
justices by Aug. 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Students FIRST _ Fair and Immediate Resources for Students Today
_ called for the state to spend $372 million a year to build, equip
and maintain public schools, replacing the current method of using
tax-backed bonds to build classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The state would also have set minimum adequacy standards and
assured that all public schools met them within five years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan would have given school districts that met
the standards the option of rejecting the state funding and
continuing to use bonds instead.
</P>
<P>
   That so-called ``opt-out'' provision was the main area of
contention over Students FIRST. Hogan argued that it would result
in a two-tiered funding system, one for rich districts and another
for poor ones.
</P>
<P>
   A separate dispute arose over a provision prohibiting districts
that accepted state money from issuing bonds to raise additional
funds. Those districts would have had to use capital overrides for
such purposes, which cost more and raise less than bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Students FIRST would also have lowered the assessment ratios
used to determine the amount of property taxes charged to
businesses to repay the capital overrides, thereby shifting more of
the burden to homeowners. The change wouldn't have affected bond
sales by the opt-out districts.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld the portions of
the law dealing with standards and state funding and even said that
the opt-out provision on its own was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the prohibition on bonding and the reduced
assessment ratios are combined with the opt-out provision, the
justices said, it ``results in systematic, structural differences
in the ability of districts to exceed state minimums through local
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of these structural differences, (Students FIRST) as a
whole continues to formalize and perpetuate a structure that fails
the general and uniform test,'' the justices wrote in their 15-page
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and legislative leaders said they were encouraged that the
court upheld some of the core provisions of the law, which could
wind up being the basis for any new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case of going back to square one,'' Spitzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was willing to say yet which direction any new proposals
would take, but some officials said they would like to return to
the original Students FIRST plan passed by the House. That was
identical to the final version, but without the opt-out provision.
</P>
<P>
   Because that plan would have eliminated all bonding by school
districts, it was widely criticized and was unable to win enough
support to pass the Senate. It also sparked a messy political
battle that resulted in a 29-day special session on the school
finance issue before the compromise opt-out provision was approved.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, said the court ruling might
persuade former opponents of the original plan to reconsider, which
would result in a quick solution to the whole issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction,
also favors returning to that plan. A longtime proponent of
eliminating bonding, Keegan had argued against the opt-out
provision in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from the opinion that the original law is a good
plan,'' Keegan said. ``It works. Republicans and Democrats ought to
be able to read this opinion and see this. Given the time
constraints imposed by the court, it would be foolhardy to start
from square one when we have a constitutional plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Backers of continued bonding said they
still believed that districts have a constitutional right to bond.
Tuesday's ruling didn't directly address that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the original plan predicted another bloody
battle if legislative leaders try to press the ban on bonding, a
battle lawmakers would rather avoid with the election looming.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Johnson, Hull's Democratic opponent in the governor's race,
has already signaled his intention to make school finance a
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already a massive embarrassment for the governor and the
state,'' Johnson said Tuesday during a visit to the Capitol. ``It
just was never designed around equalization. This program was
designed around shifting the taxes from mines and utilities onto
the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Art Hamilton, D-southwest Phoenix, also
used the court ruling as an opportunity to blast Republicans, whom
he accused of catering to business interests in passing Students
FIRST.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they put the interest of kids before those of their
(business) friends, who run this place, we won't ever get this
resolved,'' said Hamilton, who is running for secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said they would look at a variety of options,
including possibly allowing some form of limited bonding in
conjunction with state funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole array of things we can do,'' Groscost said,
``including coming up with an entirely new plan.'' &QL;

RED WINGS WIN STANLEY CUP FOR 2ND TIME IN A ROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year after their first championship in 42 years
was marred by tragedy, the Detroit Red Wings beat the Washington
Capitals on Tuesda night by 4-1 in the MCI Center to sweep the
finals once again in four consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was led by two goals from Doug Brown. The other Detroit
goals were scored by Martin Lapointe and Larry Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   For Scotty Bowman, it was his eighth post-season championship as
a coach, tying him with Toe Blake, his mentor with the Montreal
Canadiens more than three decades ago. The 64-year-old Bowman also
has one cup ring as an executive with Pittsburgh in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Conn Smythe trophy, awarded to the most
valuable player in the post-season tournament, was Steve Yzerman,
the Detroit captain, a 15-year veteran who led his team in the
playoffs with 24 points on 6 goals and 18 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The game, the series, the championship and the entire season
were contested in an emotional and sentimental atmosphere around
the Detroit franchise. Last June, six days after beating
Philadelphia for their first championship since 1955, their
celebration ended prematurely when defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov
and the team masseur Sergei Manatsakanov suffered severe brain
injuries in the crash of a limousine that carried them from a golf
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Konstantinov was part of the crowd, along with
many of the team's fans. Although the Red Wings were the visitors,
they heard the cheers of thousands in this big, new rink downtown
in the District of Columbia. They are one of the National Hockey
League's ``Old Six'' teams, and many of their Michigan-bred fans
have migrated across the country.
</P>
<P>
   When the Detroit players took the ice, in uniforms of blood-red
with trim of bright white, the building was filled with chants of
``Let's Go Red Wings! Let's Go Red Wings!'' Fans near the ice
carried and waved a sign that said ``Hockeytown,'' a trendy
nickname for what is also known as the Motor City and Motown.
During the second intermission, some fans chanted: ``Vladdie!
Vladdie! Vladdie!''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the buzzer ended the game, the ice surface was
decorated with an octopus, for decades the symbol of Detroit's
Stanley Cup playoff aspirations. Moments later, Konstantinov took
the ice in a wheelchair, a spotlight shining on him while his
teammates celebrated at the other end of the ice. The first players
to notice him were the Capitals, and several of them gathered near
him as the teams prepared for the ceremonial handshake across
center ice.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantinov wore a Red Wings jersey and a hat. As his chair was
wheeled to the Red Wings' bench, his teammates saw him and began to
gather around him to hug and smile.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game ended a season that began on Oct. 1 and included
an unprecedented 16-day break to allow participation in the Winter
Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. The regular season ended on April
19. Training camp for the next season begins in about 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit opened the scoring on the power play at 10 minutes 30
seconds of the first period when Brown beat Washington goalie Olaf
Kolzig. It was Brown's third goal of the tournament, second in the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings made it 2-0 at even strength on a goal by Lapointe,
who took a pass from Igor Larionov and slapped from near the blue
line at 2:26 of the second period. It was Lapointe's ninth goal of
the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington came back to cut the lead to 2-1 at 7:49 of the
second period on a goal by Brian Bellows, who knocked in a loose
puck from a scramble near the crease of Detroit goal Chris Osgood.
The play began with a turnover by the Detroit defense.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wings increased the margin to 3-1 at 11:46 of the second
on a power-play goal by Murphy, his third of the post-season.
Murphy one-timed a slap shot from the right-wing circle after Tomas
Holmstrom passed to him after digging the puck away from the
Capitals behind Kolzig's net.

SUCCESS OF WEST INDIAN PARADE BRINGS DISSENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: West Indies)  (lb) 
 By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With its kaleidoscope of colors, ornate costumes and
rollicking steel bands, the West Indian American Day parade has
grown to become New York City's most popular, surpassing even the
St. Patrick's Day parade in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that this growth has also sown dissension, the
carnival's longtime organizers are facing a challenge to their
leadership by many of the band leaders of the parade who question
whether the organizers are capable of handling such a large event
and whether they are doing all they can to attract sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, members from 23 of the 30 bands that play at the
parade created the Carnival Band Leaders Action Committee
International. They have asked the organizers to meet with them to
discuss ways to improve the flow of the often-chaotic and crowded
parade. The group also wants to receive a larger share of corporate
donations to the event and set up a permanent parade office with
full-time staff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the band leaders said, the carnival's organizers have
refused to discuss these issues. Mounting frustration has led some
of the band leaders to say that they are seriously considering a
boycott next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this continues, there's going to be a boycott next year,''
said Desmond Chase, a member of Hawks International, one of the
largest bands that participate in the parade. ``You'll see a parade
with jeans and T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers dismissed such talks and described Chase and his
organization as an insurgent group bent on destroying all that the
organizers have accomplished over the last 30 years. They said that
meetings among those involved in the event are held almost every
week and that any band member has the opportunity to make
suggestions then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if you have a little puppy and you raised it and after
it's a big dog, someone wants to come and take it away, let me ask
you what would you do?'' said Joyce Quamina, business manager of
the West Indian American Day Carnival. ``Desmond Chase and his
group have to take a number and wait in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said the carnival will go on as usual this year because
the bands have already begun preparations and have invested
thousands of dollars buying masks and the fabrics for the costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a boycott from some of the band leaders has
particular resonance because of the pivotal role bands play during
the parade. Each band is, essentially, an entire production in
itself, and includes performers wearing masks and costumes, as well
as the music itself. Their participation is crucial to the parade,
and the bands' preparations often begin a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, which is held on Labor Day weekend, unites people
from Jamaica, Barbados and other Caribbean nations, but its flavor
is clearly from Trinidad and rooted in that nation's carnival, a
celebration that is part religious and part cultural. So in
threatening to boycott the event, the band leaders are in many ways
taking on a cherished event.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that the event, which has steadily been gaining
popularity, attracting up to a million people every year, has
become increasingly unmanageable for the organizers, who, he says,
are unable to handle the complex logistics like coordinating police
presence and negotiating local television rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we need to have a voice in the administration of the
carnival,'' Chase said. ``We don't want to destroy this carnival,
but if left as it is, we'll have no choice. Without our
participation there is no carnival.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the dispute lie some serious issues about the unsteady
pace of the floats, bands and masqueraders moving along the crowded
Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, beginning at Utica
Avenue and ending at Grand Army Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the sidewalks are so cluttered that at times people
have to elbow each other to get a glimpse of the parade. Chase said
he and his group are proposing that the organizers build bleachers
for revelers. Chase also said that the band leaders would like to
share in the roughly $700,000 that organizers raise from corporate
sponsors and vendors, since they are not allowed to solicit
sponsors on their own and often pay as much as $50,000 to make the
costumes and rent loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing is structured properly with full-time staff, we
can maximize sponsorship,'' said Derrick Lewis, a member of the
dissenting group. ``I really don't think the organizers know what
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a city of immigrants, parade organizers said that it
is a testament to their skills that the mostly Caribbean affair has
become the most popular and colorful parade in New York. Ms.
Quamina said that the sponsorship money is used to pay
administrative costs, like posting an insurance bond for the parade
and paying out-of-town performers like the calypso superstar Mighty
Sparrow. But Ms. Quamina remains defiant in dealing with Chase and
his group.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we finish paying, we don't have any money,'' she
said. ``I don't know what nonsense they're talking about. This is
New York, not Trinidad.''

AFFIDAVIT SAYS UNIVERSITY SPIED ON STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a surveillance camera was discovered earlier
this month at City College of New York _ concealed in a smoke
detector outside a student meeting room _ cries of Big Brother
tactics were heard around the campus: The college had strayed into
invasion of privacy and was trying to silence dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Students filed a federal suit and the faculty union head shot
off a letter of protest to the college president. College
officials, meanwhile, asserted that the camera had been installed
to prevent burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   But in an affidavit filed in the students' suit and made public
this week, the college's security chief states that the camera was
installed to monitor not just theft but students as well.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit of Timothy Hubbard, the security director, said
that the college installed the camera in part because it had
received a report that ``students or nonstudents might be planning
to attempt to take over the building sometime around commencement
on June 2, 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered no immediate explanation of the purpose of any
takeover, but City University saw several protests by teachers and
students at commencements this month over the board of trustees'
plan to remove remedial courses from the university's four-year
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny surveillance camera was installed by security officials
on May 29 in a hallway of the academic center and pointed toward
the door to the room where politically active students have often
met. Acting on a tip, however, students found and dismantled it.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the college, Charles DeCicco, said Tuesday that
because of the litigation, Hubbard and other college officials
could not discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But in the affidavit, Hubbard said the camera had no audio
capability and was being used ``to address legitimate security
concerns in a public place.'' The security office does not believe
it violated student rights, Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   But others on campus disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Three graduate students _ Brad Sigal, David Suker and Ydanis
Rodriguez _ filed suit on June 3 against City College and the City
University of New York, charging them with violating their rights
to privacy and political association. They are seeking a protective
order and compensatory and punitive damages, among other things. A
hearing is scheduled on Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely has a chilling effect,'' said Sigal, a graduate
student in history. ``It makes people apprehensive and unwilling to
get involved politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Sohmer, a City College mathematics professor and the
new faculty representative on the university's board of trustees,
called the incident troubling. ``It is inappropriate on a college
campus,'' he said. ``It shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald McGuire, the lawyer for the City College students, said
hiding the camera was reprehensible. ``It is fundamentally
antithetical to free inquiry and a free university,'' he said.
``Security operations of this type will have a chilling effect on
the exercise of First Amendment rights. That is really what's at
issue here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Suker, a graduate student in secondary education and a longtime
campus protester, said he was in the North Academic Center building
on May 29 when a college employee warned him that a hidden camera
had been mounted that morning outside the meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   The building had been the target of student protests before; it
was taken over in a 1991 protest over tuition increases.
</P>
<P>
   Suker took video pictures of the camera and found someone to let
him into a nearby office, where he found a television monitor and a
videocassette recorder that he said were part of the security
system.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Benenson, a mechanical engineering professor at City
College and chairman of its faculty union chapter, said security
officials were correct in saying that there were burglary problems
on campus _ he has lost six computers in his lab in the last two
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the security office had done little to prevent
the thefts, and he had been told to install his own alarms. He said
he and other teachers did not take seriously the security
director's statement in the affidavit that the hidden camera was
also being used to prevent robberies. He considers the surveillance
one more attempt by the college to track politically active
students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't think this is about burglary,'' he said.
``There is a history to this, but what just happened is more
blatant.''

VINCENT HEALEY, 80, ANTI-SUBMARINE SPECIALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.J., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Vincent Patrick Healey, a retired anti-submarine
specialist who, as a young gunnery officer, saw naval combat from
the Philippines to Iwo Jima to Japan itself in World War II, died
on May 30 at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was
80 and lived in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh out of the U.S. Naval Academy in 1940, he was assigned to
the cruiser Astoria. The ship survived the Japanese raid on Pearl
Harbor, and Healey fought in engagements in the Coral Sea and at
Midway before enemy gunfire sank the cruiser in the first battle
for Savo Island in August 1942. He helped save the lives of the
officers and crew around him and for his ``gallantry and
intrepidity'' was awarded the Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   He was reassigned to destroyer duty, serving as gunnery officer
on the Beale, executive officer aboard the Ault and, in August
1945, commanding officer of the Dyson. Throughout the war Healey
took part in operations at the southern Palau Islands, Formosa,
Luzon in the Philippines and the China coast. He participated in
the assault on Iwo Jima and in raids against the group of islands
that includes Okinawa and, finally, against Japan itself.
</P>
<P>
   He then did postgraduate work at the Naval Academy and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He won the Legion of Merit
for his work in anti-submarine warfare and tactical aircraft, ship,
missile and electronic warfare systems while posted to the office
of the chief of naval operations.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired from the Navy in 1972, Healey became a
consultant for aerospace companies and headed the Washington
operations of EDO Corp., an engineering concern.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Bronx in New York City, he was the first native of
the borough to reach the rank of admiral. He attended Fordham
University before his appointment to the Naval Academy in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Healey's first wife, Helen Marie Clarke Healey, died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joan Casey Saenz Healey; five
children from his first marriage, Dominic of Maywood, N.J., John of
New York, Mary Healey of Arlington, Jane Marie Healey Zamm of New
York and Peter of San Diego; and five grandchildren.

ORIOLES SHUT OUT YANKEES, 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Sidney Ponson ascended the mound for Baltimore on
Tuesday night practically unknown outside of his homeland of Aruba,
a young pitcher looking for his first major league victory. Now he
is the primary reason why the New York Yankees are in their first
mini-slump in more than than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson held the Yankees to two hits over six and two-thirds
innings, as the Orioles won, 2-0, their second victory in this
three-game series. The defeat guarantees that the Yankees will lose
a series for the first time since the opening series of the season
against Anaheim. They had played 24 consecutive series which they
had either won or tied, giving them a share of a major league
standard held by the 1912 Boston Red Sox and 1970 Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have lost three of their last four games, all
without their star center fielder Bernie Williams, as well as
shortstop Derek Jeter. Their lead in the American League East,
however, remains quite safe: nine games ahead of the second-place
Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson retired 20 of the first 21 batters he faced before Tino
Martinez drew a two-out walk in the seventh. Jorge Posada pulled a
single off the glove of the first baseman Rafael Palmeiro, and when
Ponson fell behind in the count to Chad Curtis, two balls and no
strikes, Manager Ray Miller of the Orioles replaced Ponson with the
left-hander Arthur Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis began the game with five home runs in 59 at-bats against
left-handers this season, and was 5 for 16 in his career against
Rhodes, so Miller would have been open to considerable
second-guessing had Curtis come up with a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis took two strikes, then swung unsuccessfully at a
neck-high fastball to strike out, flinging his bat in anger. Curtis
has only 7 hits in his last 45 at-bats (.156) with runners in
scoring position. Sidney Ponson has a brand-new identity.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson, 21, is rising from the ashes of what has been a terrible
season for the Orioles. One of only a handful of players from
Aruba, Ponson is the organization's best prospect, having shed 30
pounds and refined command of his breaking pitches. The
right-hander threw extremely well against the Yankees on May 19, in
middle relief _ an effort that was overshadowed the instant Armando
Benitez drilled Tino Martinez with a fastball that evening.
</P>
<P>
   No other pitcher has dominated the Yankees this season the way
Ponson did on Tuesday night. Throwing a fastball clocked as high as
97 miles an hour and complementing it with a curveball and a
changeup, Ponson retired the first eight hitters he faced. With two
out in the third inning, Luis Sojo chopped a grounder over Ponson's
head; Roberto Alomar, the Orioles' second baseman, attempted to
back-hand the ball and failed, a tough play that immediately was
scored a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson kept right on going. The Yankees are perhaps the best
team in baseball at working walks, forcing opposing pitchers deep
into ball-strike counts, but in the first five innings, Ponson
reached two-ball counts only twice, and only one three-ball count.
</P>
<P>
   Following Sojo's hit, Ponson retired 12 consecutive batters, so
that through six innings, he had allowed only that one hit, no
walks, facing one batter over the minimum of 18 at that point. This
was the closest thing to perfection the Yankees had seen since May
17.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu wasn't much worse. He struggled more than Ponson, his
control erratic, the velocity on his fastball dipping to as low as
88 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu, the Yankee pitcher, wasn't much worse. He
struggled more than Ponson, his control erratic, the velocity on
his fastball dipping to as low as 88 m.p.h. He walked Brady
Anderson to lead off the Oriole first and gave up a single to Lenny
Webster opening the third, the first of Webster's three hits
against Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu repeatedly navigated his way through the early inning
squalls, pumping up his fastball when he needed a big pitch. Irabu
got Joe Carter to ground out to end the third inning with a runner
at third. Harold Baines walked and Roberto Alomar walked in the
fourth _ first and second and one out. Then B.J. Surhoff grounded
out and Irabu attacked Cal Ripken with an inside fastball, which
Ripken popped up foul to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Webster started the fifth inning by topping a slow grounder
toward third base, and Scott Brosius charged and gloved it.
Brosius, however, couldn't grip the ball on his first attempt, and
when he did manage to unload a throw, it was low and away. A base
hit, rightly, but Brosius looked disgusted with himself.

   Mike Bordick laced a single to center, with Webster stopping at
second. In a bunt situation, Anderson failed to advance the
runners, popping up, and Carter lofted an easy fly, to center. But
then Harold Baines drove a ball through the middle, as he often
does, to score Webster with the first run.

   Alomar timed a fastball from Irabu perfectly in the sixth
inning, driving it beyond the fence in right-center field, giving
Baltimore a 2-0 advantage. &QL;
