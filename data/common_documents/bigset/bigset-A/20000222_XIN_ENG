<HEADLINE> Vietnam, Italy to Boost Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Italy agreed to
continue cooperating in the projects of supporting Vietnam's small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the garment and textile
industry and the industry building machines for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by Vietnam's Trade Minister Vu Khoan
and visiting Italian Deputy Minister of Trade and Senator Silvia
Barbieri during their talks here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, they also agreed that the Italian government
will facilitate Vietnamese businesses' activities to inquire into
Italy's market and sign contracts with their Italian partners,
thus boosting Vietnam's exports to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vietnamese government will continue improving
administrative procedures and revise the Law on Foreign Investment,
thus facilitating cooperation in investment,trade and other fields
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides maintained that the level of cooperation between
the two countries failed to match up with their potential and they
will thus enhance bilateral cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to increase consultation at the high level,
including the establishment of a consultancy board with the
participation of concerned agencies and businesses of the two
countries, so that businesses of the two countries will find it
easier to share experience, cooperate and do business with each
other.
</P>
<P>
The Italian deputy trade minister stressed the long-term
cooperation between the Italian and Vietnamese governments and
peoples and wished that the two countries' economic and commercial
relations will further develop.
</P>
<P>
Italy will spare no effort in supporting Vietnam at
international forums, particularly in negotiations to join the
World Trade Organization, she told the Vietnamese trade minister.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Vietnam earned 191 million U.S. dollars from exports
to Italy and imported 77 million dollars' worth of goods from the
country.Italy now ranks 26th among foreign investors in Vietnam
with six projects worth 44.038 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Share prices registered a
sharp decline on the Singapore Stock Market Monday, following
Friday's sharp losses on Wall Street and disappointing Singapore
trade figure for January.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) dropped 61.51 points to
end at 2,115.85, recording a 2.8-percent fall.
</P>
<P>
The market volume totaled 543.05 million units valued at 890.5
million Singapore dollars (about 521.89 million U.S. dollars).
Falls outstripped rises by 340 to 39, nearly nine times, with 131
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Goldtrn topped the volume list with a turnover of 51.29 million
units. It was followed by MMI which had 35.57 million done.
EasyKnit was the next with 22.55 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
EasyKnit headed the ascent of the day, climbing up 27 cents to
end at 1.05 Hong Kong dollars. GES edged up 24 cents to finish at
3.36 Singapore dollars. SPH inched up 20 cents to end at 32.4
Singapore dollars.

Creative 50 was down 260 cents to finish at 39 Singapore dollars.
Asean and DBS sank 90 cents to close at 9.1 and 20 U.S. dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said share prices were largely dragged down by Friday's
sharp fall on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
They said the figures from the Trade Development Board of
Singapore also contributed to Monday's decline as they showed that
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports rose a weaker-than-expected 7.
6 percent in January on a year-on-year basis.

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Raise Prices of Oil Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The possibility of price
hikes for petroleum products in India starting from this month
could not be ruled out in view of the major price increase in the
international crude oil market, Indian Finance Minister Yashwant
Sinha said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Domestic oil producers in India were suffering huge losses in
billions of rupees following the hike in oil prices in the
international market, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"To cover up the losses, there is no alternative but to revise
the prices of petroleum products in India," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sinha, crude oil price in the international market
has surged to 30 U.S. dollars per barrel from the earlier 10
dollars and domestic companies now produce only one-third of India
's total requirement of petroleum products.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest Air Show Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Asian Aerospace 2000 (AA
2000), the largest air show in Asia and the second largest in the
world, opened here Monday to embrace exhibitors from more than 30
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech marking the official launch of the event,
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong struck an optimistic note
over Asia's economic recovery and the outlook of the world's
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
He said there are three major trends in the airline business --
more strategic alliances, the upgrade of airports as a result of
the impact of the alliances and further sky liberalization by more
countries.
</P>
<P>
As the first air show held in the new millennium, AA 2000 also
plays host to two high-level international conferences -- the
Millennium Air Power Conference and a special International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) conference.
</P>
<P>
About 500 military and defense industry participants from
around the world, including air chiefs and key industry personnel,
attended the one-day air power conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ICAO conference, held from Monday to Thursday, is expected
to bring together senior officials and representatives of civil
aviation authorities from Asia-Pacific countries and international
aviation organizations.
</P>
<P>
AA 2000 also features spectacular flying displays by leading
aerobatics teams, including the Black Knights of the Singapore Air
Force, La Patrouille de France of the French Air Force and the
Royal Australian Air Force's Roulettes team.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in airship history that three world-class
aerobatics teams perform in an international air show.
</P>
<P>
The flying display will last 90 minutes and feature both
civilian and military fixed-wing and rotary aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Another key attraction of AA 2000 is an exciting line-up of
about 67 flying and static display aircraft.
</P>
<P>
During the exhibition from Tuesday to Sunday, the Eurofighter
Typhoon, together with other military aircraft, will make its
debut in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 of the world's top 100 aerospace companies will be
exhibiting at AA 2000 which is expected to attract 18,000 trade
visitors and official delegations from more than 60 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Aerospace air show, inaugurated in 1981, is held
every two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks aiming to end the
Sudan's 17-year civil war resumed on Monday in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
According to Samson Kwaje, spokesman for the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the six-day talks would focus on
two issues: the separation of religion and state and the right of
self-determination for the south.
</P>
<P>
The talks were brokered by the Inter-governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD), a grouping of regional governments in the
Africa Horn and east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The government delegation is headed by Nafie Ali Nafie, adviser
to the president on peace affairs, while Nhial Deng Nhial, the
SPLA's head of foreign relations, leads the rebel delegation.
</P>
<P>
Two years of negotiations between the government and the rebel
SPLA have made little progress towards ending the conflict, in
which Sudan's Islamist government fought against Christian and
animist rebels in the south, leaving more than 1.5 million people
dead.

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Summit Discusses Burundi Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of
the 18 Burundian conflicting parties, African presidents and
European ministers held a summit here on Monday, focusing on the
Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ninth Great Lakes Summit, Nelson Mandela, new
mediator for the Burundi peace talks and former South African
President, said the peace process has entered a key stage and
urged all parties to work harder to bring the ongoing peace
negotiations to a successful conclusion at an early date.
</P>
<P>
All parties and groups concerned in Burundi, including armed
rebel groups, should be invited to participate in the peace talks,
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
He said it also needs the active involvement of the Burundian
people so as to achieve the reconciliation of all groups and
restart the construction of the nation.
</P>
<P>
However, the main armed rebel group CNDD-FDD (the National
Council of the Defense of Democracy-the Forces of the Defense of
Democracy) failed to turn up at the meeting due to different ideas
over principal issues with the attending parties.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his speech at the summit, Burundian President Pierre
Buyoya thanked the African and international communities for their
support to the peace process in the country and expressed the
determination of his government to strengthen cooperation with all
groups in achieving the final peace.
</P>
<P>
The president also expressed his gratitude to Mandela for his
mediation and welcomed him to visit Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Also delivering speeches at the summit were Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano, South African President Thabo Mbeki
and Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
They all expressed their willingness to support Mandela's
mediation and the peace talks of Burundian conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches, British Minister for Africa Peter Hain and
French Minister for Overseas Development Charles Josselin
expressed the full support of the European Union to the Burundi
peace process and its future economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between ethnic Hutu rebels and an army dominated by
the Tutsi minority has cost 200,000 lives in the tiny central
African state since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, which began in June 1998, have made little
headway.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was appointed by African leaders in December last year
to mediate the stalled peace talks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Officials' Resignations Prove Failure of Humanitarian Program: Iraqi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Said al-Sahhaf said Tuesday that the successive resignations of the
U.N. humanitarian program's high officials working in Iraq prove
undoubtedly the program has failed to meet the minimum need of the
Iraqi people, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf made the remarks in two separate letters sent to
Secretary General of the Arab League Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid and
Foreign Minister of South Africa Nkosazana dlamini-zuma whose
country now chairs the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, top U.N. humanitarian official in Iraq Hans
von Sponeck and Representative of the World Food Program in Iraq
Jutta Burghard resigned in protest at what they said "a human
tragedy" that is happening in Iraq due to the continuation of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf pointed out that resignations of Sponeck and Burghart
came after they had found out that the oil-for-food program, which
allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to buy humanitarian goods
for its people, has failed to meet the minimum level of the Iraqis'
basic needs.
</P>
<P>
In the two letters, Sahhaf held the U.S. and Britain responsible
for the continuation of embargo and its severe impacts on the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British delegates at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the implementation of the oil-
for-food program through deliberately blocking the approval of
Iraqi contracts concluded with foreign companies for the purchase
of humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf called upon the Arab League and the Non-Aligned Movement
to take a clear-cut stand and urge the U.S. and Britain to lift the
sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He also urged these two organizations to exert pressure on the
U.S. and Britain to stop their hostile policy against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck's predecessor Irish Denis Halliday resigned in 1998 for
similar reasons, Sahhaf said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister requested that the two letters be
distributed as a document among the member states of the two
organizations.

Arab countries could offer to Lebanon are to cooperate, make
concerted efforts and adopt a single position against Israel's
repeated attacks on Lebanon, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih
Berri said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the sidelines of the ninth session of
the Arab Parliamentary Union (APU), Berri said Lebanon would never
sign any accord with Israel before any other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon will be brought about
through armed resistance, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied parts of south Lebanon in 1978 and carved out a
self-styled security zone there in 1985 with a claimed aim of
protecting its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading resistance movement to oust Israeli troops and its
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) from the country.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs are in dire need of a "civil rapprochement act" to
prevent Israel from penetrating any other Arab country, Berri
added.
</P>
<P>
On democracy in the Arab world, he called for deepening
democracy and creating a single Arab parliament that is elected by
all Arab states.
</P>
<P>
If the Arabs invest 1 percent in democracy and democratic
culture, they will protect their regimes in a better way than
weapons, said the Lebanese parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
As for the Arab efforts to stop the Israeli attacks on Lebanon,
he expressed appreciation for Algeria's support to Lebanon in
defying Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri quoted Algerian President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika as saying
that "if there was an inch of Lebanon or Syria under occupation,
this means that an inch of Algeria is under occupation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he thanked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for his
recent visit to Lebanon and termed it a message to Israel that
efforts are underway to concretize Arab solidarity with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel blitzed three Lebanese power stations and wounded 20
civilians earlier this month in retaliation to a series of deadly
Hezbollah attacks on Israeli occupation forces. The air raids have
drawn strong condemnations from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which opened on Monday, was attended by 20
APU members.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned About Kosovo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday expressed
grave concern over the situation in Kosovo and called for "more
resolute measures" in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"Open confrontation between the (ethnic) Albanian and Serb
communities is continuing, and new... human fatalities become
known every day," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is also an alarming fact that Albanian extremists do not
even stop before confronting peacekeeping forces and international
structures in order to achieve their goals of fully cleansing
Kosovo of its non-Albanian population," Interfax quoted the
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moscow welcomed the efforts by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the
local U.N. mission to prevent massive riots, and called for "more
resolute measures to achieve the desired result."
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to stabilize the situation in Kosovska
Mitrovica, or in the province as a whole for that matter, by
military and police measures alone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It urged complete enforcement of U.N. Security Council
Resolution 1244, along with talks on Kosovo's status within
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Italy Joins Multilateral Investment Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy has become the 26th
member of the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), an autonomous
fund, administered by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
that promotes private sector growth in Latin America and the
Caribbean, the IDB announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Italy's executive director on the IDB's board of executive
directors, Bruno Mangiatordi, said that the decision of Italy to
join the MIF confirms the traditional support of his country to
the IDB Group and the commitment to favor the development of a
network of small and medium-size enterprises in Latin America and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Italy's participation in the fund became official with the
ratification by Parliament on February 3 of the country's 30-
million-U.S.-dollar contribution to the MIF, to be allotted over a
period of five years.
</P>
<P>
The MIF, which has 1.3 billion dollars in resources, was
established in 1993 to accelerate private sector development and
help improve the climate for investment in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the MIF has approved 306 projects and
two Lines of Activity, with a total financing of 1 billion dollars.
Over half of these resources are targeted to the less developed
countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> EU Vows to Catch Up U.S. in Internet Retailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) needs an
overall Internet strategy to help it catch up the United States in
the fields such as e-commerce, EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Internet retailing today accounts for only 0.2 percent of the
total European Union retail market compared with 1.2 percent in
the United States," Bolkestein told the European Parliament's
economic and monetary committee. "This means that EU citizens
account for 29 U.S. dollars out of 100 U.S. dollars spent on U.S.
websites."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for EU consumer affairs commissioner
David Byrne confirmed Tuesday that he was working a plan to
enhance confidence in cross-border online sales through a network
of complaint "clearinghouses" on each EU member state.
</P>
<P>
A recent finding has found European consumers still do not
trust the Internet because of fears about security and what powers
they have to seek redress should a product they have ordered turn
out to be faulty or fail to arrive.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is seeking
ways to settle disputes in online retailing without the need to go
to court.
</P>
<P>
Now the debate on e-commerce in EU had focused on the legal
right of redress. The EU executive suggests that there should be a
very light and cheap system that would allow people to solve
disputes at an earliest time.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has drafted the policy
on small and medium-scale enterprise (SME) development, State
Minister Cephas Msipa said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The policy maps out strategies to address various elements
pertaining to the development of the small-to-medium enterprise
sector," he told participants at a two-day workshop on partnership
for growth organized by the Scientific and Industrial Research and
Development Center in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said the main goal of the SME policy was to create
employment and attain sustainable sources of income for
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
SME development is an important strategy for achieving
government goals of indigenization of the economy, creating
employment and alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The policy clearly defined how the government, private sector
and other stakeholders could create an enabling environment for
small and medium enterprise to develop.
</P>
<P>
Msipa said the policy framework sought to come up with
strategies to make financing accessible to small and medium-scale
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> France to Help Push Forward Burundi Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- France has expressed its
 willingness to help push forward the deadlocked Burundi peace
process on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to the summit on Burundi which opened Monday
in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, French President Jacques
Chirac said his country is willing to provide experts to the peace
talks facilitator, former South African President Nelson Mandela,
and is ready to provide material assistance for the creation of a
facilitation office at Bujumbura, capital of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"France is determined to back the peace process," said the
President in the message, and "it wants to help the Burundians
break the vicious cycle of senseless violence and economic
paralysis that has for too long undermined the country's stability
and chances for development."
</P>
<P>
He said the international community can best contribute to the
success of the Arusha negotiations by resuming its economic
assistance, thus alleviating the population's suffering and giving
it confidence in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told the summit that France has decided to resume its
structural assistance progressively and is willing to expand the
scope of its action and intensify its commitment to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Once an agreement is reached, said Chirac, France is ready to
provide support for the implementation of the transition and
reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is up to the Burundians themselves to take
up the formidable challenge of achieving reconciliation and the
work for peace must be carried out inside Burundi, within the
framework of the internal partnership.
</P>
<P>
France is an important donor to the ongoing Burundi peace
negotiations, which resumed after Mandela succeeded former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere to become the new mediator last
December.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mandela sent a message to President Chirac, inviting
him to attend the summit now in session in Arusha.

<HEADLINE> Development of Education is Uganda's Top Priority: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Development of education,
especially the primary education, is Uganda's top priority in its
course of national development, a senior government official said
here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Basoga Nsadhu, minister of Information in the President's
Office, made the remarks at a Uganda Television's Talks Show

<HEADLINE> WIPO Takes Action Against Cybersquatting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Arbitration and Mediation
Center of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has
received a total of 89 cases since a procedure to deal with
abusive registrations of domain names on the Internet took effect
in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Several decisions have been issued already, all requiring
transfer of the domain name to the complainant, WIPO said in a
press release here Tuesday. The first decisions involved the
complainants including the World Wrestling Federation, Stella D'
oro Biscuit Co (an affiliate of Nabisco) and the Australian
telecommunications giant Telstra.
</P>
<P>
The cases are being filed under the new Uniform Domain Name
Dispute Resolution Policy applicable to generic top-level domains
(.com,.net and.org) adopted by the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) on August 26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ICANN policy establishes a uniform and mandatory
administrative dispute-resolution system to address cases of bad
faith, abusive registrations, also know as "cybersquatting".
</P>
<P>
Under this system, panels of one or three experts, appointed by
the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center, apply streamlined,
quick and cost-effective procedures to review claims and eliminate
cases of clear abuse of trademark holders' rights, leaving the
more complex cases to the courts.
</P>
<P>
The procedure requires that each case is resolved within a 45-
day period. If the losing party fails to challenge the decision in
a competent court, the registrar is bound to implement the panel's
decisions after a ten-day waiting period.
</P>
<P>
The center is receiving several cases daily. 60 cases were
filed in February 2000, 28 in January 2000 and one in December
1999.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of increase in case filings reflects growing
confidence in the market both in the new procedure as an effective
means of dealing with cybersquatting and in WIPO's administration
of the procedure in an efficient and balanced manner," said WIPO
Assistant Director-General and Director of the center Francis
Gurry.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Defers Decision On "Joint Strike Fighter" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's Flemish socialists
and green parties say that the decision on a possible successor to
the F16 fighter jets is up to the Belgian government but not to
the army, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian parties were reacting to a report on Monday that
the Belgian Airforce is still involved in talks with the American
Defense Department about the Joint Strike Fighter as a possible
F16 successor.
</P>
<P>
The concerned conversion operation would cost one billion
Belgian francs (about 25 million U.S. dollars) per aircraft. In
the initial phase, Belgium would have to pay 10 million euros (
about 10 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The objecting parties would prefer Belgium to invest in a new
transport plane to succeed the Hercules C130. Socialists in
Walloon,the country's French-speaking region, believe the joint
strike fighter is no longer a priority either.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgian Defense Minister Andre Flahaut said that he
did not know anything about the alleged negotiations between the
Belgian army and the pentagon. He also stressed that the Belgian
government will have the last say about the successor to the F16s.

<HEADLINE> 1 in 5 Belgian Truckers Violate Law: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent data showed that
nearly one in five controlled truckers is in violation of relative
Belgian law, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the findings published in the latest annual
statistics of the Bureau of Inland Transport's control service, a
division of the Belgium's Ministry of Transportation, half of the
violators did not respect the amount of mandatory rest-periods
required by law.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many of the violators did not have valid
transportation permits and many are found to be driving
technically-compromised vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The ratio was confirmed again last Friday during a control
executed on the No.17 European highway at Rekkem, on the Belgium-
France border. During the control, 38 fines were immediately
collected and nine legal cases were written for roughly 200
controlled trucks, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Trucker's fatigue is regarded as an important cause of road
accidents. Statistics from the Belgian Institute of Road Safety
indicate that both light-weight and heavy trucks are involved in
10 percent of road accidents, and in 20 percent of fatal road
accidents.In 1998 alone, 300 fatal truck accidents were recorded
from 1,500 road accidents in Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Stronger Military to Guarantee Russian Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin on Tuesday called for strengthened military might
to ensure the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces are the most important guarantor of peace and
tranquillity in Chechnya," Putin told a gathering on the eve of
the Day of Defenders of the Fatherland.
</P>
<P>
"Right now our comrades-in-arms are fighting terrorists and
gangsters. They know what they are fighting for. Their task is to
destroy the breeding ground of banditry, impose security and
stability, restore the rule of law and protect Russia's unity,"the
Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that reforms of the armed forces, guided by a new
military doctrine, will affect Russia's geopolitical situation.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue doing our best to solve your social problems.
Those who defend the Fatherland must constantly feel that the
state is looking after them," Putin told the servicemen.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that together we will restore the prestige of
the armed forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier address in Volgograd, Putin denied the assertion
that the Russian armed forces are falling apart.
</P>
<P>
"All talk of the collapse of the army is an open lie. This is
unfair and disrespectful to the army, to our soldiers and officers,
especially those now fighting in Chechnya," he told a meeting on
social security for servicemen.
</P>
<P>
"The army is doing its duty as it should," Putin said, pledging
that after paying overdue allowances to soldiers and officers the
government will consider raising their allowances.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis Tuesday criticized the Western countries for
their failed policies in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, which
has seen rising violence recently.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his concern over recent developments in Kosovo,
Kaklamanis said while meeting with Czech Republic Foreign Minister
Jan Kavan that unfortunately, costs of the policies implemented in
Kosovo were not taken into consideration by those that bear
responsibility, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The cost was borne by the people of the region and neighboring
countries, he said, adding that those with primary responsibility
were far away and were limited to promises made at no expense.
</P>
<P>
Kavan, who is now in Greece for a visit, will also sign
Wednesday with his Greek counterpart George Papandreou a
memorandum of cooperation for the reconstruction of the Balkans
within the framework of the Stability Pact in the region.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official: Success of U.S. Envoy's Mission Depends on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Whether U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross can succeed in his ongoing mission depends on Israel's
response to the three suggestions raised by the Palestinians to
push forward the stalled peace process, said Palestinian chief
negotiator for the final-status talks Yasser Abed Rabbo here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions, put forward during a meeting attended by U.S.,
Palestinian and Israeli officials in Tel Aviv two weeks ago,
include a time limit to be set by Israel for the implementation of
the third redeployment, inclusion of all the West Bank areas in the
third phase withdrawal except those related to the final status
talks, a clear-cut Israeli promise to hold serious and intensive
talks with a view to reaching a final agreement by the previously-
set deadline of September 13.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo said Israel was not serious in its endeavor to reach an
agreement with the Palestinians on the final status and in
resolving major issues related to the implementation of signed
accords.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate in the final-status talks is related to Israel's
lack of seriousness rather than time or deadline, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ross is scheduled to meet Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah Tuesday evening as part of the
U.S. efforts to salvage the Palestinian-Israeli talks, according to
the Voice of Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
Ross met Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday night in
Jerusalem in an effort to put the stalled talks back on track but
failed to make a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ross said the U.S. administration is
committed to its promises on reviving the peace talks on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he promised Barak that he would do his best during
his talks with Palestinian officials to find an outlet to the
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Barak suggested the two sides reach a framework agreement on the
final status by May but the Palestinians turned down the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Ma'ariv reported that Barak's government will
draw up new maps for the third phase withdrawal from 6.1 percent of
the West Bank and plans for opening the northern safe passage and
resolving the dispute over purchase tax.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo expressed pessimism over the results of Ross' mission,
saying Barak's government puts emphasis on procedural issues while
neglecting those fundamental ones related to the framework
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rudeineh termed Israel's May deadline
as a "waste of time" and a "negative Israeli signal on the
Palestinian track of talks," adding the proposed deadline does not
serve the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision on the maps of the third redeployment, which
should have been carried out on January 20, aroused anger among
Palestinians who said the maps should be drawn up jointly.

UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Special
Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General for Children and
Armed Conflict, Olara Otunn, Tuesday called on the parties to the
conflict in Sudan to take steps to ensure that their forces do not
attack civilian populations and sites.
</P>
<P>
The appeal follows reports that 14 children and a teacher from
the Upper Kaouda Holy Cross School were killed and 17 other
children were injured, in the Nuba Mountain region, on January 25
when a bomb dropped from an aircraft close to a tree where a class
was under way.
</P>
<P>
"I was particularly distressed to learn of the recent killing
and injuring of students at the Holy Cross School," Otunnu said. "
Such attacks are clear violations of relevant international
humanitarian law and the Convention on the Rights of the Child."
</P>
<P>
"During my visits to the Sudan, both the Government and the
Sudan People's Liberation Movement made commitments to ensure the
protection of civilian populations; I call upon both parties to
the conflict to take concrete measures to ensure that their forces
honor these commitments," he said.
</P>

Meanwhile, the U.N. special representative called on the
Sudanese Government to carry out an urgent and full investigation

UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Tuesday announced a new and groundbreaking dimension to its
peacekeeping operations: the deployment of Child Protection
Advisors(CAPs).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> WIPO Handles 20,072 International Trademark Registrations in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) handled a total of 20,072 international
registrations in 1999, as compared with 20,020 in 1998, WIPO
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
WIPO said that the number of registrations under the Madrid
system for the international registration of marks in 1999 was 6.5
percent higher than in 1995, pointing out that the result showed
the international system had continued to prosper although the
European Community introduced its own system since 1996.
</P>
<P>
What's more, WIPO said, the international registrations of 20,
072 in 1999 had an average of 12 countries covered per
registration. This means that the activity in the Madrid system in
that year was equivalent to over 240,000 national trademark
registrations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 64 states were members of the Madrid Union at the
end of 1999, according to WIPO. The current system is governed by
two treaties: the Madrid Agreement, which dates from 1891 and was
revised several times since then, and the Madrid Protocol, which
came into operation in 1996 and introduced some new features into
the system in order to address difficulties that had impeded
adherence by certain countries.
</P>
<P>
A country may adhere to either the agreement or to the protocol
or to both. That is why, of the 64 members of the Madrid Union, 51
states are party to the agreement and 43 are party to the protocol.

HARARE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe will attend a heads of state summit in the Zambian capital
Lusaka on Wednesday to discuss ways of implementing a fragile
peace agreement to end the 17-month civil war in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that
the leaders of all signatories to the Lusaka peace agreement are
also expected to tackle the issue of the Joint Military
Commission set up to monitor the ceasefire in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace accord, signed last year by the DRC and its
allies Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia on the one hand, and the rebel
groups and their backers Uganda, Rwanda on the other, has failed
to stop the conflict.
</P>
<P>
African leaders addressing the U.N. Security Council special
meeting on the DRC war in New York last month have appealed to
send peace-keeping forces to the vast central African country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Sends Troops to Quell Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria sent troops on Tuesday
to the northern city of Kaduna to help quell the spreading
violence following Monday's protests against Sharia law.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they were reinforced by soldiers from one
mechanized division based in the northern state of Kaduna in their
desperate endeavor to restore calm in the state capital.
</P>
<P>
In order to impose a dusk-to-dawn curfew announced by the state
 government, the police reportedly fired at some Moslem and
Christian gangs, leaving corpses on the streets.
</P>
<P>
The curfew was ignored in parts of the city where Christian and
Moslem gangs set up roadblocks to fight each other and the police.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 bodies had been picked up from the streets overnight, a
police source said earlier on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Several buildings, including churches and mosques were set on
fire in the town on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The violence flared up Monday when Christians demonstrated
against the proposed introduction of Islamic Sharia law in the
state.
</P>
<P>
The Sharia issue has become increasingly explosive in Nigeria
since the northern state of Zamfara dominated by Moslems applied
the Islamic law last month.
</P>
<P>
Several other states have also announced their intention to
introduce Sharia, provoking protests from other states in the
Africa's most populous country where the Christians are dominant.

</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council in October 1997 imposed an oil, weapons

</P>

Although the rebels signed a peace accord on July 7, 1998 with

Sankoh, who led the rebel Revolutionary United Front, is
currently chairman of a state commission in charge of strategic
resources, national reconstruction and development in Sierra
Leone.
</P>

sanctions last Friday protested that Sankoh was allowed to visit

CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has called on Egyptian and German businessmen to strengthen

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nepali Ministers' Resignation Threatens PM's Position by Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- With nearly one-third of the
ministers quitting his cabinet Tuesday, the position of Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai as the prime minister of Nepal has been further
weakened.
</P>
<P>
Following the resignation of the finance and education
ministers early this month, 11 more ministers submitted their
resignations on February 18, which were accepted by the king
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Those who quit their positions include five ministers,three
state ministers and three assistant ministers.
</P>
<P>
"Since a majority of the lawmakers of the party have already
expressed no confidence in Prime Minister Bhattarai, it would not
be right for us to continue in our positions," Minister of Water
Resources Govind Raj Joshi told the local press on behalf of all
the resigning cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, 58 lawmakers of the ruling Nepali Congress (
NC)party rebelled against the prime minister and filed a no-
confidence motion to oust him from the position on ground of his
poor governance since he came to power in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The core of the issue lies, in fact, in the decades-old
squabbling over power between the two top leaders of NC, Prime
Minister Bhattarai and NC President B.P. Koirala.
</P>
<P>
Since Bhattarai was appointed as prime minister in May last
year after NC won the general election, the gap between the two
leaders had been widening with the party accusing the government
of going against its directives.
</P>
<P>
Some NC members also accused the prime minister of failing to
show any leadership qualities and turning out to be a weak leader
of a government that has not made any progress. Many of his
ministers are alleged to be indulging in corruption and unethical
behavior.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at the end of last year, 70 pro-Koirala NC lawmakers
launched a signature campaign, asking Bhattarai to step down as
the party's parliamentary leader and the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
After closed-door bargaining, an agreement was reached between
the two leaders, in which Bhattarai agreed to step down around May
this year citing health reasons to defuse the tensions inside the
NC party.
</P>
<P>
However, when Bhattarai made last-minute efforts to save his
position by appointing Ram Chandra Poudel as the deputy prime
minister, the Koirala camp accused Bhattarai of going back on his
promise of a peaceful exit and launched another round of no-
confidence campaign on February 16 to force Bhattarai to step down.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai's fate will be decided on February 26 when the NC
parliamentary group will convene to vote on the rebel lawmakers
petition for the prime minister to step down.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here believe that Bhattarai will most probably be
given time to quit his office with dignity after the conclusion of
the winter session of the parliament at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Although Koirala's supporters outnumber those of Bhattarai, the
prime minister's hands are strengthened to some extent with the
support of second generation leaders Sher Bahadur Deuba and Poudel.
</P>
<P>
Deuba, one of the most influential leaders of the second
generation, insisted that as one of the founders of the Nepali
Congress, Bhattarai should at least be allowed to quit with
dignity instead of being ousted with humiliation.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Poudel maintained that the present crisis
facing the NC should be averted through mutual dialogues and
understanding instead of confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Duncan Injured, Spurs Fall to Suns 98-89 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The San Antonio Spurs are
hoping they did not lose more than just a basketball game last
night against the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
Superstar forward Tim Duncan, arguably the game's best player,
sat out most of the final three quarters of San Antonio's 98-89
setback with an abdominal strain and could miss more action
according to coach Gregg Popovich.
</P>
<P>
"Tim has a lower abdominal strain. That's all I know at this
time," Popovich said. "It hurts to have this happened. We still
have 20 games left, but the guys are professionals and they'll get
through it."
</P>
<P>
Duncan, who has played in all 184 games in his three NBA
seasons, leads the Spurs in scoring, rebounding and minutes played.
The MVP candidate entered the day's game averaging team-bests of
24.4 points and 12.8 rebounds. He managed just four points on 1-of-
5 shooting in 13 minutes before leaving the contest with 11:09
remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old superstar earned NBA Rookie of the Year honors
after being selected by Popovich with the first pick in the 1997
draft.
</P>
<P>
Duncan led the Spurs to their first-ever NBA title last season,
earning Finals Most Valuable Player honors in a 4-1 series win
over the New York Knicks. He made the All-NBA First Team and All-
Defensive First Team last year, averaging 21.7 points, 11.4
rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.52 blocks.

<HEADLINE> Bird Undecided on New Pacers Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Larry Bird, one of the
greatest players in Boston history, said Monday that he would
prefer owning the NBA Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
But the Indiana coach, who has announced plans to leave the
bench at the end of the season, does not anticipate becoming an
owner of either team.
</P>
<P>
"The Pacers are not for sale, the Celtics are not for sale. I
know that. I knew that eight years ago that they weren't for sale,
" Bird said. "You can't buy something that's not for sale."
</P>
<P>
There were reports Bird was interested in buying the Celtics.
Bird has been offered an executive position in the Pacers' front
office but said he was uncertain what he would do when the season
ends.
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you again, I'm not going back there," Bird said of
Boston. "As far as being here, I really don't know yet."

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Hails White Paper On Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- People from all walks of life
in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, today
expressed their strong support for the government's white paper on
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At a local gathering, Song Nanxiong, vice chairman of the
Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, said the white paper "The One-China
Principle and the Taiwan Issue" reaffirmed to the world China's
firm position on the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
" We will study the white paper seriously and improve our work
on cultural exchanges between the two sides of Taiwan Straits," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gu Bin, vice president of Nanjing's Association of Taiwan
Compatriots, said the One-China Principle is the foundation and
precondition for national reunification, and it has won the hearts
of more and more Taiwan compatriots as well as the understanding
of the international community.
</P>
<P>
"We will work hard to deepen the understanding between people
on both sides of the Straits," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Daping, of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Nanjing
municipal government, said Nanjing has over 1,500 Taiwan
enterprises functioning very well in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Only by cooperating with the mainland and realizing
reunification can Taiwan have a bright future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But those seeking so-called Taiwan independence and the
separation of the motherland will become criminals of history," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Also today, social experts in South China's Fujian Province
gathered to express support to the government's white paper.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the One-China Principle is the guarantee of
national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Fujian is the hometown of many Taiwan compatriots and recent
years have seen strengthened cooperation in many areas between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, some 3 million Taiwanese had visited
Fujian, and the province had approved nearly 6,000 Taiwan
investment projects involving 10 billion dollars in contractual
investments.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Taiwan Authorities Should Return to One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan authorities should
see the historical trend clearly and return to the one-China
principle, Ma Man Kei, chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce,
told reporters here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The veteran businessman made the remarks after the white paper
titled "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue" was released
Monday by the Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of
China's State Council.
</P>
<P>
"The white paper is issued at the right time and is of great
importance," Ma said. "It has clarified the stance of the one-
China principle and warned the Taiwan authorities against any
attempt to separate Taiwan from the motherland."
</P>
<P>
The one-China principle takes into consideration the legitimate
interests and requests of the Chinese compatriots in Taiwan,
including their interests involved in world-wide cultural and
trade exchanges, Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
The white paper lists three occasions when the Chinese
government might be forced to adopt drastic measures, including
the use of force, to safeguard the country's sovereignty and
territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification.
</P>
<P>
Ma pointed out that the adoption of non-peaceful measures is
not directed at the Taiwan compatriots, but aims to stop those who
want to separate Taiwan from the motherland and warn foreign
countries against invading Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong and Macao returned to the motherland in
1997 and 1999. Over the past two months since Macao's return,
local residents have enjoyed a normal life, public security has
turned for the better and business people can foresee promising
economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
"The good conditions in Hong Kong and Macao have demonstrated
that the 'one country, two systems' policy is correct and
practical," Ma said, adding that the Chinese government has
announced its readiness to adopt a looser form of the policy for
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan issue is our internal affairs. I expect that it
will be discussed among us like members of a big family on the
basis of the one-China principle. Reunification is a great cause
of the Chinese nation throughout the ages," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma went on to say Taiwan's return to the motherland is the main
trend of history. The white paper will surely win support and
acceptance from the Taiwan compatriots and people around the world.
</P>
<P>
"I advise the Taiwan authorities to return to the one-China
principle and not to do things that would harm the interests of
the country and the people," Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Education Circles in Macao Support White Paper on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- People in the education sector
in the Macao Special Administrative Region held a seminar here on
Tuesday to express their support for the white paper on the Taiwan
issue which China released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Macao Chinese Education Association,
participants in the seminar discussed the significance of the
white paper entitled "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue.
"
</P>
<P>
The white paper reiterated the Chinese government's stance and
policy based on the one-China principle, said Vong Fong Va,
director of the association.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macao have returned to the motherland and the "
one country, two systems" policy has been carried out well. The
sincerity and determination of the central government to implement
the policy are obvious, he said.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis of cross-straits negotiations on the basis of
equality and the one-China principle demonstrates respect for
Taiwan and the Taiwan authorities should value the opportunity and
contribute to the complete reunification of the motherland, the
director said.
</P>
<P>
Some teachers attending the seminar also said the white paper
was released at the right time and is of great significance,
noting that the separatist remarks made by Lee Teng-hui have
harmed cross-straits relations and failed to get Taiwan out of its
political dilemma.
</P>
<P>
The participants said they would help their relatives and
friends in Taiwan better understand the white paper.

<HEADLINE> HK to Make Changes for Better, World-Class Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) - Hong Kong's Deputy Secretary
for the Environment and Food Kim Salkeld called upon the public on
Tuesday to start making changes for a better and world-class
environment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the topic "Working for a World Class Environment"
at a seminar organized by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors,
Salkeld said just a few little changes in habit by a lot of people
and businesses will rapidly add up to a great reduction of
pressure on the environment.
</P>
<P>
If each person in Hong Kong is to reduce the waste they produce
each day by an average just 200 grams (half the dry weight of an
average newspaper), half a million tons of waste would be saved
every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong had been doing very well in various
aspects on improving environmental quality compared with other
places.
</P>
<P>
On energy use, Salkeld pointed out that in the latest reference
year (1994), each person in Hong Kong used energy equivalent to
that produced from 2.2 tons of oil and that was 55 percent above
the world average but less than that in Canada, Australia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
"We also in many ways act as a responsible member of the world
community in reducing the impacts we have on our neighbors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that people in Hong Kong must do better as
they have far less space to deal with waste than any other major
city.
</P>
<P>
Salkeld was pleased to find that there was also a growing sense
of the general public interest in a healthier environment as well
as a growing economic interest in reversing Hong Kong's reputation
for being a polluted city.
</P>
<P>
Apart from legislation to achieve this end, he stressed the
importance for setting standards.
</P>
<P>
These included a reduction of roadside sulfur dioxide levels,
treatment of sewage collected, the recovery and reuse of
construction and demolition material and chemical waste management.

</P>
<P>
Khatami, a new doctor-turned reformist political star, expressed
his confidence that "the May 23 Front" will enjoy a two-third
majority in the 6th Iranian Majlis, which will start work in June
according to relevant regulations.
</P>
<P>
He called on all political parties and groups to accept the
result of the sensitive election, saying the victory of the
reformists is an indication of the will and expectation of the
people.
</P>
<P>
Iran's over 38 million voters showed a strong support for the
reformists with a massive turnout and Iranian Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said over 80 percent of the Iranian
electorate cast their votes in the polling.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Claim Landslide Victory in Crucial Polling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian reformists on Tuesday
claimed a landslide victory in last Friday's crucial parliamentary
poll by having won 109 seats in the 290-member Parliament as vote
counting continues.
</P>
<P>
Of the 191 parliamentarians already elected, 109 are candidates
of the reformist Islamic Iran Participation (IIPF), Mohammed Reza
Khatami, younger brother of the moderate President Mohammed
Khatami, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the "May 23 Front" formed by the IIPF and other
reformist and centralist groups in support of the president have
won 137 out of the 191 seats while the conservatives have only
occupied 39 and the remaining 15 have been occupied by
independents.
</P>
<P>
The vote counting for 260 seats have finished, but 69 seats must
be determined in the second round of polling, but who will win the
30 seats in Tehran constituency will not be announced before
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The initial result showed the reformists, who support the
president and his reform policies, are poised to gain control of
the parliament from the powerful conservatives in the poll held
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, a new doctor-turned reformist political star, expressed
his confidence that "the May 23 Front" will enjoy a two-third
majority in the 6th Iranian Majlis, which will start work in June
according to relevant regulations.
</P>
<P>
He called on all political parties and groups to accept the
result of the sensitive election, saying the victory of the
reformists is an indication of the will and expectation of the
people.
</P>
<P>
Iran's over 38 million voters showed a strong support for the
reformists with a massive turnout and Iranian Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said over 80 percent of the Iranian
electorate cast their votes in the polling.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, a leader of the IIPF, said the reformists will give
priorities to political reforms in order to establish civil
freedom, and push forward developments in other fields such as
economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
He said the reformers will propose a law on political
developments to safeguard the people's rights, including freedom of
expression, private life, and holding gatherings and meetings.
</P>
<P>
He promised the IIPF and the "May 23 Front" will help the
government of President Khatami to solve problems facing the
country, particularly economic issues.
</P>
<P>
"We will hand over some draft bills to new Majlis (parliament)
to ensure civil freedom and developments in all fields within the
constitution and relevant laws, " Khatami said, "with the support
of the new Majlis, the government can solve many proble ms in the
country."
</P>
<P>
Khatami rejected the suggestion that the future reformist-
dominated Majlis will make efforts to revise the constitution,
saying that instead, the reformists will carry out all of articles
in the constitution, particularly those which have not been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Khatami rejected the concern on the possible split among the "
May 23 Front" between the reformists and the centralists, who
support former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, since the
reformists have showed strong opposition to Rafsanjani's candidacy
in the polling.
</P>
<P>
He turned down the view that Rafsanjani will be a hurdle for
the reformists, if he enters the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
"The final result in Tehran constituency has not been announced,
but we are sure the reformists have enough majority in the future
Majlis despite of possible differences among groups and the change
of parliamentarians in their stances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the future Majlis speaker, Khatami said
the reformist coalition will discuss the
issue, but so far the reformists have not made any decision on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Voicing support for the detente foreign policy, Khatami said the
reformers will stand behind the government to establish
and expand relations with all countries on the basis of mutual
respect and equality.
</P>
<P>
According Iranian laws, the Majlis will not make decisions on
foreign policies, but it surely has some influences on foreign
policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has an important position in the region
and the world, and it is ready to improve and expand relations with
its neighbors and other countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about future Tehran-Washington ties, Khatami said
the United States should take actions to change its policies
toward Iran in order to build trust between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has showed some changes in words, but not in actions,
the Iranian nation lacks trust on the U.S." he said, "surely Iran
will not accept the U.S. if it continues interference in others'
internal affairs and sets hurdles for Iranians to have a better
life."

ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Ariana
airlines Tuesday operated its first overseas flight after the
imposition of U.N. sanctions last November to carry 127 Muslims to
Saudi Arabia for the annual Islamic pilgrimage of Hajj, Afghan
Islamic Press (AIP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 left Kandahar, headquarters of the ruling
Taliban militia in southern Afghanistan, at 16:25 Pakistan
standard time (11:25 GMT) for the Saudi city of Jeddah,the
Pakistan-based AIP said, quoting a Taliban spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Ariana airlines would operate three Hajj flights daily.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's Civil Aviation Minister Mulla Akhtar Mansoor told
AIP that the United Nations had formally given permission for
Ariana's Hajj flights.

The U.N. Security Council imposed an air embargo on and frozen
the overseas bank accounts of the Taliban as a result of its
refusal to hand over suspected international terrorist Osama bin
Laden.

The Saudi dissident, accused by the United States of
masterminding the bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya
in 1998, which killed more than 200 people, has been in the

HAVANA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Rene Simoes has
resigned as Jamaica's national soccer coach, the Jamaica Football
Federation said in Kingston on Tuesday.
</P>

Despite their elimination after the first round, Jamaica still
managed a remarkable 2-1 victory over Japan.
</P>
<P>
Simoes, whose first contract expired at the end of 1998, later

<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- China's non-Communist parties
today expressed their firm support of the white paper "The One-
China Principle and the Taiwan Issue" China issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
China's reunification process faces a bright future with the
return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland, and the release
of the white paper has both important realistic significance and
far-reaching historic significance, said leaders of the provincial
committees of the non-Communist parties in southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is a remnant of China's civil war, and none in
the country wants to see a reoccurrence of war. Reunification will
be a blessing for the people of Taiwan, said Liu Futang, vice
chairman of the Hainan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Members of non-communist parties in Shanghai vowed to strive
for the peaceful reunification of China in accord with the basic
principle of "One Country, Two Systems" and President Jiang Zemin'
s eight-point proposition.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Double Omega-3 Egg Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's LTKM Company,
a leading producer of chicken eggs, is targeting to double
production of its low cholesterol Omega-3 eggs to 300,000 per day
within three to five years.
</P>
<P>
This projection was based on the increasing demand for Omega-3
eggs locally, the company's Managing Director Tan Kok said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
LTKM, which is scheduled for listing on the Second Board of the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in March, is the sole producer of
Omega-3 eggs in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The production of Omega-3 eggs is now about 150,000 per day
which represents 15 percent of the company's total daily eggs
production,Tan said, adding that this amount was insufficient to
meet the present demand.
</P>
<P>
Omega-3 eggs contain a higher level of Omega-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acid and more vitamin E, Tan told reporters after a media
tour of the LTKM poultry farm in Durian Tunggal near Malacca, some
145 kilometers south of here, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
Tan said his company is undertaking an expansion plan on its
181.44-hectare farm, of which only 70 percent is occupied and in
the initial stage, the company would construct 10 to 12 additional
sheds and acquire a new cages system.
</P>
<P>
The group also plans to build an additional egg store and
acquire a grading machine to separate the sorting and grading of
its eggs.

<HEADLINE> APEC to Launch Information Technology Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) will launch the first phase of the information
technology (IT) initiative this Friday to keep e-commerce high on
its agenda.
</P>
<P>
The IT initiative would encompass, among other things, the
implementation of relevant multimedia and e-commerce applications
on an immediate basis in selected agencies and schools, the APEC's
Partnership for Equitable Growth (PEG) Chief Executive Officer
Shafiq Sit Abdullah announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IT initiative was derived from a comprehensive action plan
drawn up by the Kuala Lumpur-based PEG to ensure that the 21 APEC
members were in a position to reap the benefits of e-commerce, he
said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
"PEG has been drawing up a comprehensive action plan to ensure
that APEC adopts a better managed liberalization blueprint which
takes into account the speed in which e-commerce would be adopted
by developing countries," Shafiq said.
</P>
<P>
He said the second phase of the IT initiative could then kick
in with PEG's collaboration with other regional initiatives such
as e-ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
All task forces will work toward a comprehensive action plan
which will be presented to APEC economic leaders at the 2000 APEC
leaders informal meeting in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, in
November this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur-based PEG, formed after a mandate was given by
the APEC leaders in Kuala Lumpur two years ago, comprises some top
business personalities in the region with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad as the founding patron.

<HEADLINE> WHO, UNAIDS Launch HIV Vaccine Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (
WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)
have joined forces to launch a WHO-UNAIDS HIV Vaccine Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is set to heighten international cooperation in
AIDS vaccines in the face of mounting urgency as the epidemic
spreads, WHO said in a statement here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The initiative will focus on strengthening the capacity in
developing countries to ensure that vaccine trials are conducted
with the highest ethical and scientific standards.
</P>
<P>
"The new initiative provides an independent forum where
everyone working on HIV vaccines, from North or South, from
industry or from research agencies, and from affected communities,
can identify common ground for collaboration and coordination,"
said Dr Jose Esparza, coordinator of the initiative, which is
guided by a new joint WHO-UNAIDS HIV Vaccine Advisory Committee,
which meets for the first time in Geneva February 21-23.
</P>
<P>
A major challenge facing HIV vaccine development is finding a
vaccine which will be effective worldwide, including developing
countries, where 95 percent of infections occur, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Less than 20 years after AIDS was identified, it has become the
most important infectious disease, the first cause of death in
Africa and the fourth worldwide, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 new HIV infections occur every day, most of
them in developing countries, and over 33 million people now live
with HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
WHO explained that the urgent need to accelerate the
development of an AIDS vaccine prompted UNAIDS and WHO to join
forces and officially establish the HIV Vaccine Initiative to
coordinate that development.
</P>
<P>
It believed that the joint initiative would profit from the
experience of both organizations and from existing wisdom gleaned
from vaccine efforts against two other major killers, tuberculosis
and malaria.

<HEADLINE> EU Air Traffic Shows Upward Trend in 1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- International air routes
within the European Union (EU) carried 154 million passengers in
1997, compared with 110 million in 1993, the EU statistical office,
Eurostat, said in a report published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This represents an increase of 39.4 percent between 1993 and
1997 in intra-EU air traffic.
</P>
<P>
In the case of extra-EU flights, the number of passengers went
up from 123 million in 1993 to 171 million in 1997, which is an
increase of 38.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1997, total air passenger traffic, within the
EU and between the EU and the rest of the world, grew at an
average annual rate of nearly 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
For traffic between EU member states, the busiest intra-EU
routes are those linking Britain and Spain, followed by Germany-
Spain, with 19.5 million and 15.3 million passengers respectively
in 1997, which accounted for 12.7 percent and 10 percent of all
international intra-EU traffic.
</P>
<P>
Other major air routes are Britain-Ireland with 7.7 million
passengers, Britain- Germany with 7.1 million and Britain-France
with 6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The importance of Britain is borne out by the passenger figures
for airports, the Eurostat report said.
</P>
<P>
London's airports dominate city-to-city routes. The busiest
route in the EU, with 3.7 million passengers, links London with
Dublin. Next comes London-Amsterdam with 3 million and London-
Paris with 2.8 million. Of the 10 busiest routes, nine involve
London's airports, according to the report.

BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Legendary coach Ma Junren
became the center of the limelight again on Tuesday as three of
his athletes surpassed the Asian indoor record of the women's 3,
000 meters race at the national indoor championships here.
</P>
<P>
Yin Lili, Dong Yanmei and Li Ji beat the Asian indoor record of
eight minutes and 53.44 seconds, which was set by China's Li
Chunmei, who ran 8:50.68 here today, in Japan last year. Yin won
the finals with a time of 8:46.32.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who headed the China team to the title of the Beijing
International Road Relay on Monday, stood by the side of the track,
as he usually did, yelling to his runners to give out their bests.
</P>
<P>
The former middle school teacher was satisfied with the results,
but refused to offer any predictions for the Sydney Olympic Games
in September.
</P>
<P>
"It's not surprised for them to run into the time of the Asian
record after training in the winter camp," Ma said. "We must take
the qualifications for the Games."
</P>
<P>
Ma is the most successful Chinese long-distance running coach.
As the mentor of Wang Junxia, who broke the world records of women
's 3,000m and 10,000m in 1993, Ma is the best hope for China to
stop a gold drought in the track and field competitions in the
Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> HK's Consumer Price Indices for January Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Consumer Price
Indices (CPI) in overall terms registered a year-on-year rate of
decrease of 5.3 percent in January 2000, larger than the 4-percent
fall in December 1999, the Hong Kong SAR Census and Statistics
Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong SAR Government Secretariat spokesman pointed out
that the larger year-on-year decrease in the CPI was mainly due to
a higher base of comparison in January 1999 than in December 1998,
caused by the removal of the effect of the rates rebate granted
for the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
This was reckoned to account for 1.4 percentage points of the
difference between the year-on-year rates of decrease for December
1999 and January 2000. With this special factor taken aside, the
year-on-year decrease in the CPI had not worsened in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
Larger declines were likewise observed in the three sub-indices.
In January 2000, the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) fell by 4.2 percent,
5.7 percent and 6.2 percent respectively over a year earlier,
having decreased by 2.9 percent, 4.9 percent and 4.1 percent in
December 1999.
</P>
<P>
For discerning the latest trend in consumer prices, it is also
useful to look at the changes in the seasonally adjusted CPIs. The
average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted indices
during the three-month period ended January 2000 were -0.5 percent
for the Composite CPI, -0.4 percent for the CPI(A), -0.4 percent
for the CPI(B) and -0.7 percent for the CPI(C).
</P>
<P>
These were all larger than the average monthly rates of change
recorded during the three-month period ending December 1999.
</P>
<P>
As for the average monthly rate of change in the seasonally
adjusted CPI, the spokesman pointed out that the larger decrease
recorded in the three-month period ending January 2000 than in the
three-month period ending December 1999 was likewise due to the
removal of a special factor in the latest rate of change, which
was the 50 percent rates concession granted in the third quarter
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the more notable price changes in January 2000, the
spokesman observed that the prices of outer-clothing fell further
as greater price discounts were offered to promote sales toward
the Lunar New Year. On the other hand, the prices of vegetables
had a temporary surge amidst the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by component, clothing and footwear registered the
largest year-on-year rates of decrease in January 2000, followed
by housing, durable goods, food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco,
miscellaneous goods and meals bought away from home.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, year-on-year rates of increase were recorded
for fuel and light and transport. As regards miscellaneous
services, the index decreased by 1.1 percent in the Composite CPI
but increased by 0.4 percent in the CPI(A).
</P>
<P>
For the three months ending January 2000, the Composite CPI
fell by 4.5 percent from a year earlier. For the 12 months ending
January 2000, the Composite CPI was on average 4.3 percent lower
than in the preceding 12-month period.

<HEADLINE> China to Shape Competitive Cultural Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- China plans to shape highly
competitive regional and even international cultural organizations
which will be expected to play their part in filling state coffers
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The proposed cultural groups will cover the industries of
entertainment, movie, publications and art trading, according to a
plan released by the Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
The state encourages various forms of investment, including
private funds, to the cultural industry, and will offer soft loans
to new and profitable companies, Li Yuanchao, vice Minister of
Culture, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
With the progress of China's expected entry into the World
Trade Organization, Li said, China will be faced with greater
challenges for intellectual property protection and gaining access
to overseas movies and other publications.
</P>
<P>
"But the abundant cultural heritage from China's 5,000-year
civilization is an economic resource that can be further developed,
" Li said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has worked out its first plan for revitalizing the
cultural industry, listing big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Guangzhou and Xi'an as bases for the industry.
</P>
<P>
State cultural authorities expect the revenue created in the
field to increase by an annual growth rate of 20 percent starting
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cultural industries should take up two percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's cultural products, excluding those
from studios and press, only accounted for 0.26 percent of the GDP
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials pointed out that no cultural company has
been ranked among the country's top 500.
</P>
<P>
The officials also estimated that the total cultural
consumption of the Chinese in 1997 was only 65 billion yuan (7.83
billion U.S. dollars), a far cry from a potential 300 billion the
same year, and the expected 550 billion yuan in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Information Hinders Pak-ASEAN Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The lack of information
about trade and investment is the major factor for the low level
of trade between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and Pakistan, the ASEAN-Pakistan Joint Business Council said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Council Chairman Syed Amin Aljeffri, who was leading an ASEAN
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) delegation for the first
meeting of the council held Monday in Pakistan's southern port
city of Karachi, said the meeting felt that there is indeed ample
potential for business collaboration between ASEAN and Pakistani
businessmen and the information gap was identified as the most
significant factor for the low level of trade between Pakistan and
ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
"There are many products from Pakistan that have good export
potential to ASEAN, while vast scope existed for transferring
entrepreneurship from ASEAN to Pakistan," Aljeffri observed.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said, huge investment potential exists in
Pakistan for ASEAN business such as tourism, mining and
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The council's meeting concluded on Monday evening after
discussing a number of potential areas for expanding trade
cooperation between Pakistan and the ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting, there exist good prospects for
increasing Pakistan's exports of rice, fruits, gems and jewelry,
sports goods, surgical items and other non-traditional items to
ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by the representatives from Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Laos, Singapore and the ASEAN CCI
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups all the 10 countries in Southeast Asia,
including Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the ASEAN-Pakistan Joint Business Council
is to be held in Manila, the Philippines, in April, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges "Specific Gestures" From India for Easing Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan wants India to make "
specific gestures," including early signing of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), to pave the way for easing international
sanctions imposed on India after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May
1998, former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto indicated
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, senior foreign policy advisor to the incumbent
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, arrived here on Monday for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters on Tuesday that Japan looked forward to India
's early signing of the CTBT, saying, "If India is to take this
symbolic decision, it will be able to join the international
stream for non-proliferation ... which would be mutually
beneficial for India and also help in further strengthening
bilateral relations with Japan."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the signing of the CTBT is a decision India
will have to take "by themselves and for themselves."
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
on Tuesday, Hashimoto expressed satisfaction with the fact that
the Indian government was trying to develop a consensus on the
CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also revealed that a Japanese appraisal team from the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund was here last month for talks
on the second phase of the 48.6 billion rupee (1.13 billion U.S.
dollar) Delhi Metro Rail Project.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has released the first tranche of 14.76 billion Japanese
yen which is drawn upon for the project since 1998-99 and has
agreed to extend a soft loan to the extent of 56 percent of the
project cost, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who was prime minister at the time of the Indian and
Pakistani nuclear explosions, had taken a hard stance by
suspending official development assistance to both countries.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also noted on Tuesday that his country desired a
peaceful solution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kargil conflict last year had increased concerns in
the international community that the India-Pakistan problem could
lead to some danger.
</P>
<P>
Any condition of instability in the border areas between India
and Pakistan was a matter of concern for the international
community, he added.

the Internet today for the whopping sum of one yuan (about 0.12 U.
S. dollars), an experiment which may spawn a new era in the
marketing of original music.
</P>
<P>
Lyrics to the song "Making a Phone Call" were written by Li
Xiaolong and Jia Ding. The music was composed and arranged by Bian
Liunian, and performed by popular Beijing singer Man Wenjun.
</P>
<P>
The song was posted on website peoplespace.net on February 5,
the start of the Chinese lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
So far over 5,000 people have paid to listen to it, according
to today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the website started selling the song on
the net to offset the now-common practice of downloading music
without prior consent of copyright owners.
</P>
<P>
The website owner was quoted as saying that selling music on
the Internet can provide big tax breaks for copyright owners,
while listeners benefit from paying bottom-dollar prices for new
sounds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the song will eventually be sold on cassette tapes
and CDs.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Public Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC) today published a list of China's top-ten
investment events of 1999.
</P>
<P>
SDPC spokesman Zheng Xinli said that the publication of this
list is for the purpose of guiding and encouraging public
investment this year.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of China's first securities law, the
approval of the public bidding law by the National People's
Congress (NPC), the State Council's national working conference on
the quality of infrastructure construction, the additional
issuance of 100 billion yuan in T-bond, and the interest rate cuts
instituted by the People's Bank of China led the list.
</P>
<P>
Another noteworthy event was the establishment of China's four
asset management companies which are responsible for debt-to-
equity swaps.
</P>
<P>
All of these events reflect the important role played by
investment in expanding domestic demand, and the positive progress
made in the country's reform of the investment and financial
system.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that investment is still key to realizing
China's GDP target set for this year, but added that the
government will take steps to play down the role of T-bond by
encouraging investment from enterprises and the general public.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Highlight Economic Development in Minority- Inhabited Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to
highlight economic development in minority areas, an official with
the State Ethnic Affairs Commission said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mou Benli, vice minister of the commission, said at a national
meeting on economic work in minority-populated areas that his
commission would take an active role in the economic work.
</P>
<P>
This is the commission's first conference on economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said this year's key task for the commission
is to participate in the development of the western areas
inhabited mostly by ethnic groups. "The development of western
areas provides the ethnic people with the best-ever historical
opportunities," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission will try to raise funds from the cental
government and solicit overseas investment to develop the ethnic
areas.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the minorities and their economy is very
important to the country's revitalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said that the GDP in ethnic areas last year
was 7.8 percent higher than that of 1998, and the standard of
living has been greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Another 5 million people had been helped out of poverty in 1999,
he said, and the commission will continue its efforts in that
regard this year, especially for those people in remote areas.

<HEADLINE> China to Free Arts Professionals from Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to free
professionals in the arts from groups they formally belong to, so
as to encourage a more flexible transfer of people between
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture has listed the reform in its first
comprehensive project for revitalizing the country's cultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
All performing groups directly controlled by the ministry are
to hold public auditions for performers instead of giving them
life employment, Vice Culture Minister Ai Qingchun told Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also form agencies of personnel affairs for
professionals, schedule performances and make other arrangements
for them, Ai said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he promised to provide hefty bonuses to the most
talented performers.
</P>
<P>
Ai said the state will reduce funding to the groups year by
year, and urged them to find other ways to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the ministry had 47 arts groups and other
state-funded organs, with a total work force of over 10,000.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapping Story of Israeli Soldier Proves False </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The story of an Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) soldier being abducted in a Palestinian van on
Monday was fabrication, said a statement released by the office of
the IDF spokesman Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
An IDF patrol sergeant reported Monday morning seeing an IDF
soldier enter a white commercial vehicle driven by a Palestinian as
he was guarding the hitchhiking station at an army base east of
Beit Shemen near the border between Israel and the Palestinian-rule
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The sergeant said he tried to intervene as the soldier's conduct
was something explicitly barred by military hitchhiking
regulations.
</P>
<P>
But the soldier, whom he described as a new recruit wearing a
green beret, first ignored his warning and then pushed him aside
before getting into the van and left, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although a check-up in the military base found no reports of a
missing soldier, a large search involving IDF soldiers, Israel
police, border police, helicopters, tracking dogs and other elite
forces was launched in the Beit Shemen area. The army also notified
the Palestinian police, asking for assistance.
</P>
<P>
During the search, a green beret was found at the entrance to
the Arab village of Qibya. Then a curfew was imposed for a short
period Monday evening on Qibya and the nearby village of Budrus,
but searches in these villages proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The sergeant admitted after a night of questioning that he
fabricated the whole story, although it remained unknown what the
motive behind his fabrication was.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, security has been heightened in cities and
towns, especially on populated areas such as bus stations, shopping
malls, and markets.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli military record till Tuesday, at least four
IDF soldiers have been abducted and then killed by terrorists, and
there have been scores of botched kidnapping attempts.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Headed to Perth 14 Hours after Emergency Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 140 passengers were
to arrive in Perth in the Western Australia state Tuesday night,
more than 14 hours after their Malaysian Airlines plane made an
emergency landing in northwest of the state with a fuel gauge
problem.
</P>
<P>
The 145 passengers were stranded at Learmonth, near Exmouth,
about 1,100 kilometers north of Perth, when flight MH127 en route
to Perth from Kuala Lumpur was forced to land at 3 a.m. (local
time) after reporting a malfunction with the gauge.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Airlines Perth sales and marketing manager Bill Ross
said Tuesday night the passengers were being flown to Perth aboard
a chartered plane and a Perth-bound plane from Kuala Lumpur,
which had been diverted to Learmonth.
</P>
<P>
Passengers had been forced to spend about two hours aboard the
plane at Learmonth before being able to disembark because of a
lack of immigration facilities there.
</P>
<P>
The fuel gauge on the four-year-old A330 aircraft, which was
not due to leave Learmonth until Wednesday, was replaced by
engineers.

<HEADLINE> Another Radio Station Starts Broadcasting in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A new short wave radio
station, Radio Benadir, started its broadcasting on Monday night
in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A group of Somali businessmen have established the radio
station aimed at promoting peace, reconciliation, spreading Islam
and encouraging business activities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamed Mohamud Moallim, director of the new radio
station, Radio Benadir will be broadcasting 13 programs every
week.
</P>
<P>
The radio will be on the air for six hours every day, three
hours in the afternoon and three hours in the evening, Moallim
said.
</P>
<P>
But the programs will be extended as the time passes and add
more emphasis to peace and reconciliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
A part of programs will be given to children, the director
added.
</P>
<P>
Head engineer of the radio station, Sharif Hussein Farah, said
the capacity of the 500-watt transmitter is expected to be
enhanced to 2500 watts in a month.
</P>
<P>
The radio is being heard from the short wave of 49 and 41 meter
bands.
</P>
<P>
According to Farah, the broadcasting has reached throughout the
 continent of Africa and some of the Arab countries including
Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
This is the second private radio station being received clearly
in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Horn Africa FM radio station opened by Somalis businessmen
early last December continues broadcasting programs, mainly
advocating for peace and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
There is also another radio station being under test in Baidoa
run by the Rahanwein Resistance Army, while more radio stations
and televisions are expected to launch their programs soon in
Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Stages Demo Flights in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 757-300, the world'
s latest model of single-aisle jetliner, made two demonstration
flights today in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, in a move to explore the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The 54.4-meter long plane took off from Guangzhou Baiyun
International Airport and flew around the city in drizzling rain.
</P>
<P>
"The feeling of the plane is good," said Li Fenghua, vice-
president of China Southern Airlines, who piloted the plane for a
while over the city. "The system in the cockpit is easier to
operate."
</P>
<P>
The company's chairman of the board Yu Yan'en and head pilot
Hao Jianhua flew the plane as well.
</P>
<P>
China Southern Airlines is a major operator of the Boeing
fleet, having a total of 61 Boeing and 20 Airbus planes.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the Boeing 757-200, the Boeing 757-300 is 7.1
meters longer and has 40 more seats, but its flight range is some
900 kilometers less.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 757 family has exceptionally low cost per seat-mile,
especially the Boeing 757-300, which has the lowest cash seat-mile
cost of any single-aisle plane, said Jack Gucker, Vice President
of Boeing Commercial Airplanes Group.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 757-300 has a maximum flying capability of 6,420
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
 It is also spacious and comfortable, saves fuel and is noise-
restricted, Gucker told reporters while showing them around in the
cabin.
</P>
<P>
 Currently, various airlines in China have a total of 49
Boeing 757-200s.
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration flight is part of a Boeing 757-300 world
tour that started from the United States on February 3. Earlier,
the plane visited Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and
other places.
</P>
<P>
In China, the plane has visited Urumqi, Chengdu, Beijing and
Guangzhou. This afternoon, it will fly to Taipei via Hong Kong.
Officials with different Chinese airlines said the Boeing 757-300
is impressive.
</P>
<P>
The event is believed to be one of the strategies for Boeing,
a leading aircraft manufacturer based in Seattle of the United
States, to explore the market, especially at a time when its
European rival, a four-nation Airbus consortium, tries to expand
its influence worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing's strategy is to continuously introduce new model
airplanes to its customers," said Tom McLean, public relations
director of Boeing China Inc.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has purchased 503 jetliners, 67 percent of which
came from Boeing family.
</P>
<P>
The last Boeing demonstration flight in China was last October,
when the company showcased its Boeing 717, targeting the branch-
line market in the cities of Beijing, Kunming, Wuhan and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Condor airlines of Germany, the launch customer of Boeing 757-
300s, said it has become more competitive since it bought
airplanes of this model in March of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Boeing started co-operation with China in 1972 when China
purchased 10 Boeing 707s.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up: Chinese FM Spokesman's Remarks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- China has no intention to
attend the G-8 summit meeting and relevant activities, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said today.
</P>
<P>
He told a regular press conference that China's stand and views
on the Asia-Pacific affairs and other important international
issues are known to all, saying that the key role the United
Nations and the UN Security Council have played in international
affairs can be irreplaceable. "That view has been the common
understanding of the international community."
</P>
<P>
When commenting on recent clashes in Kosovo between UN peace-
keeping forces and ethnic Albanians, Zhu said that China is deeply
worried about that.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn any violent acts that might bring new instability
to Kosovo, and call on all parties concerned to exercise restraint
and prevent the further deterioration of the situation," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO had seriously violated the United Nations
Charter and principles of the international law by using force on
the sovereign state of Yugoslavia, and also set an extremely
perilous precedent of interfering in other country's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The use of force has also made the regional situation more
complicated, said Zhu, adding that the Resolution 1244 passed by
the UN Security Council has not been carried out effectively, nor
has Kosovo's security situation been apparently improved since the
UN peace-keeping forces and civilian organizations entered Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Iran's parliament election, Zhu said China hopes
the election will help promote Iran's stability and prosperity,
adding that the Chinese government places great importance on
developing its relations with Iran, and is ready to work with the
Islamic Republic to further promote cooperation in political,
economic, cultural and other areas.

The spokesman also urged the United States to grant the normal
trading relations (NTR) status to China completely and
unconditionally, describing the NTR as the basis of bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of the fact that the U.S. government has
made it clear that it will make all-out efforts to do so, and
solve related issue without attaching any conditions, and that
many U.S. congressmen, people of insight and businessmen support
such an action taken by the U.S. government," he said, adding that
"We hope that the U.S. side will honor its commitments earnestly."
</P>
<P>
As referring to recent Sino-U.S. strategic and security
consultations, Zhu said that both sides had in-depth and candid
exchange of views on security, ballistic missile defense and U.S.
arms sale to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also said that Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan's
official visit to Russia, scheduled from February 28 to March 1,
aims at further deepening the existing strategic and cooperative
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Vice-Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will attend the
presidential power transfer ceremonies in Uruguay and Chile on
March 1 and 11 respectively as a special envoy of the Chinese
Government at the invitation of the governments of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Yang will also pay a working visit to Uruguay, Chile, Argentina
and Colombia and hold bilateral political consultations with the
foreign ministries of the four countries from March 1 to 12 at the
invitations of the governments of Uruguay and Chile and that of
the foreign ministries of Argentina and Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel Extend Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Military cooperation between
Turkey and Israel, which used to be focused more on the air forces,
has now extended to the army and navy, local press reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This extended cooperation has taken the form of close
consultation between high-ranking generals of ground and naval
forces from both countries, as well as mutual training programs and
the transfer of Israeli military equipment to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The naval exercises conducted by Turkey, Israel and the United
States, codenamed Reliant Mermaid, have also paved the way for
Ankara and Tel Aviv to cooperate more closely in naval activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel has promised to consult Turkey on any future negotiations
with Syria on matters related to Turkey such as water, terrorism
and Syrian redeployment of troops in the event of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had feared that, in the event of a peace deal between
Israel and Syria, Syrian troops deployed in the Golan Heights, two-
thirds of which now occupied by Israel, might be moved north, near
Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
Israel has assured Turkey that the Syrian troops would be
redeployed to the east after any Israeli withdrawal from the
strategic Golan.
</P>
<P>
Both countries, however, have played down their military
cooperation in such fields so as not to get on their neighbors'
nerves.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance has at times sparked
strong criticism from the Arab world, which fears that the alliance
is targeting third parties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed two agreements on military and defense
cooperation in 1996. Since then, the air forces from both countries
has strengthened cooperation.

DHAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President
Shahabuddin Ahmed said here Tuesday that "democracy is the only
way to run the affairs of the country."
</P>
<P>
The president made the remark when an eight-member delegation
of the Overseas Correspondents Association, Bangladesh made a
courtesy call on him at the President House.
</P>
<P>
The members of the delegation exchanged views with the
president on various topics including the political development of
the country. They also referred to the intolerance among the
political parties in the country, saying that this may hamper
smooth functioning of parliamentary democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin said that the democratic perfection
requires time and that there is nothing to despair of. In spite of
all its shortcomings, democracy is the only way to run the affairs
of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina repeatedly urged the opposition to
discuss problems with the ruling party in the parliament instead
of resorting to confrontation in the streets.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led opposition
alliance is intensifying its anti-government movement, demanding
the resignation of the government and early general elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices extended losses

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo gave great attention to the riots in the northern Kaduna
City over the controversial Islamic Sharia law, the Guardian
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's personal assistant on press relations, Steve Itugbu,
said that the president was on Monday night eagerly awaiting
formal reports on the violence from both the Inspector-General of
police, Musiliu Smith, and Kaduna State Governor Stephen Shekari.
</P>
<P>
The presidential assistant explained that the president could
only react to the crisis after a formal briefing from the
inspector-general of the police, the Kaduna State governor, as
well as the national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the office of the national security adviser
has ruled out a military option as the situation was still under
police control.
</P>
<P>
The Kaduna state government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew
in the city, and police are patrolling in armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people are feared to have been killed in the Monday
clashes between Christians and Moslems in Kaduna, the capital of
Kaduna State.
</P>
<P>
The violence flared up following a march by Christians
protesting against the proposed introduction of Islamic Sharia law
in the state.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 250 Dar es
Salaam- based child labors have escaped from hazardous lives and
enter into productive undertakings with the help of the
International Labor Organization (ILO), Tanzanian media reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ILO, through its International Program for Elimination of
Child Labor (IPEC), has successfully retrieved 250 children from
Vingunguti city dump, Kunduchi sand mining and ferry area along
the Indian Ocean in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The 18-month exercise was executed by a Dar es Salaam-based
child home Dogodogo Center, the Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
 Of the 250 retrieved children, 40 were reunited with their
families, 90 are retained in primary schools and the rest are
undergoing a two-year vocational training, the director of the
center Nicholas Shemsanga was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are now leading decent lives, said the director.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report on the state of education in
Tanzania, more than two million, or 56 percent of the total number
of the primary school age children are not in school, mainly
because of economic reasons. Most of them are forced to work under
poor conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that forging stronger Sino-Turkey ties not only is in
the best interests of the two countries and two peoples but also
will contribute to regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in his meeting with a delegation of the
Grand National Assembly of Turkey led by its speaker Yildirim
Akbulut in this special economic zone this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an intercontinental country in both Asia and Europe, is
an important nation which is influential in the affairs of the
region, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government values its friendship and cooperation
with Turkey and is willing to make concerted efforts with Turkey
for the further promotion of bilateral ties on the basis of Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," he told the guests, adding
that China hoped such ties can be richer in content and more
dynamic in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Sino-Turkey ties can be traced back in history
to ancient times when the world-famous Silk Road linked the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries formed diplomatic ties almost 30 years
ago, Jiang said, bilateral ties have witnessed remarkable progress.
"Frequent high-level exchanges in recent years have greatly pushed
forward our relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked Akbulut to convey his regards to Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel. Akbulut relayed a greeting from President
Demirel to Jiang, and said that his country is looking forward to
Jiang's visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Through this visit, we are deeply impressed by China's
economic development and social progress," Akbulut told Jiang.
</P>
<P>
As a big and important country, China plays a tremendous role
in safeguarding world and regional peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed Turkey's adherence to the "one-China" policy
and its respect for China's sovereign and territorial integrity. "
Turkey opposes the interference of one country into another
country's internal affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has always valued its friendly relations with China in
all fields and hopes to work together with China in international
affairs in an effort to maintain world peace and development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice chairperson of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, was present at the meeting.

ANKARA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on Monday gave no
comments on whether the detentions of three pro-Kurdish mayors in
the southeast would block Turkey's relations with the European
Union, saying the judiciary in Turkey is completely autonomous.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the EU countries should treat with respect and
understanding the sensitivity of Turkey on the subject of its
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Commenting on the victory of Iranian reformers in the recent
Majlis (parliament) elections, Ecevit said on Monday that Iran will
probably not export Islamic revolutionary thoughts any more.
</P>

firmer stand against the separatist movements against Turkey.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and France have been working hard to bring
Israel back to the Grapes of Wrath monitoring group, France's new
ambassador to Israel, Jacques Huntzinger, told the Jerusalem Post
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huntzinger spoke during a ceremony Monday night to inaugurate a
new French Cultural Center in Haifa's French Carmel district,
constructed primarily with French funding.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine will lead a high-level delegation
to visit Israel this week.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- While Prime Minister Ehud Barak is engaged mainly in the
negotiations with Syria and the plans for a Lebanon withdrawal, the
defense sector is concerned that "new Intifada (uprising)" of the
Palestinians will erupt soon after Pope John Paul II's visit.
</P>
<P>
Central Command of Israel Defense Forces, Military Intelligence,
the Shin Bet security service and the office of the coordinator of
government activities in the territories all have issued dire
warnings in the past few weeks that the priority given to the
Syrian track over the Palestinian track is a serious mistake.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Shas party expressed Monday night, for the first time, its
non-confidence in Barak when eight of its 17 Knesset (parliament)
members voted with the opposition Likud in a no-confidence motion
submitted by the Likud on "the prime minister's policy regarding
Palestinian activity in Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The motion was defeated 28-44, with five Shinui legislators
abstaining. The Shas ministers and deputy ministers did not take
part in the vote since voting against the coalition is a ground for
dismissal from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The government also easily survived a second no-confidence
motion sponsored by the United Arab List faction on Barak's social
and economic policy by a vote of 45-26.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak wants the Palestinian National Authority to resume the
negotiations on a framework agreement for the permanent settlement
and to decide, together with Israel, whether to set a new target
date to conclude the agreement, after the original date of February
13 was missed.
</P>
<P>
Barak Monday told U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, who met with the
prime minister shortly after arriving in Israel in an attempt to
kick-start the stalled Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, that a
framework agreement is a "useful and essential" station on the road
to a final deal.
</P>
<P>
Ross will meet Tuesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Attaches Great Importance to Sino-Vietnam Relations: New FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Communist party,
state and people always attach great importance to the
development of the relations of friendly neighborhood with China,
and consider it as a long-term consistent policy, said new Foreign
Minister Nguyen Dy Nien.
</P>
<P>
Nien, who assumed the current position in January, made the
remarks when he was interviewed by Xinhua correspondents here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, he said, the friendly and cooperative
relations between Vietnam and China have developed rapidly, deeply
and extensively in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Nien said: "It has become a fine tradition for leaders of the
two countries to meet regularly which have contributed much to the
development of the friendly and cooperative relations between the
two parties and two peoples."
</P>
<P>
He described the new framework of the two countries' "long-
term stable, future-oriented, good-neighborly and all-round
cooperative relations" defined by General Secretary of the Central
committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu and his
Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin during Phieu's visit to China in
February, 1999, as the guiding policy of strategy for
consolidating and developing the relations of the two parties and
two countries in the 21st century, which he said, will bring the
relations of the two parties and two countries to a new full-
promising development stage.
</P>
<P>
He said the present Vietnam-China relations are developing
vigorously, especially after General Secretary Le Kha Phieu's
official goodwill visit to China in February, 1999, and Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Vietnam in December, 1999.
</P>
<P>
As for his upcoming visit to China, Nien said the purpose of
the visit is to discuss with his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan
and other Chinese colleagues measures and orientation for the
realization of the agreements reached by leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He promised to make joint efforts with the Chinese counterpart
and colleagues to make contribution to the strengthening of the
good friendship tradition and all-round cooperation between the
two countries during his visit to China, his first visit abroad
after he took the post of foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He said at the beginning of the 21st century, Vietnam is
diplomatically facing three big problems, namely international
integration, relations with neighboring countries and big-powers,
and relations with traditional countries and the Non-aligned
movement.
</P>
<P>
He said that Vietnam has to properly handle the four major
relations: the relation between integration and preserving the
national true qualities; the relation between integration and
maintaining security, stability and development of the country;
the relation between the scope and the depth of integration; and
the relation between Vietnam's own interests and its contributions
to mankind.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Mayon Volcano Crater Continues to Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The breaking up of Mt. Mayon's
hardened lava dome at its peak resulted Tuesday in a series of
collapse at the southeastern sector of the volcano's crater,
sending up billowing dust, ash and smoke resembling a powerful
eruption, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Institute on Volcanology and Seismology (Phivocs)
was quoted as saying that strong blast had not yet occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Volcanology agency added that it would need a potent force
from underground to effect a major eruption, and this has not been
detected yet.
</P>
<P>
Ed Laguerta, volcanologist stationed at Lingnon Hill
observatory in Legazpi city 10 kilometers away from Mayon, said a
series of erosions triggered by oozing lava continue to occur,
defacing the volcano's peak.
</P>
<P>
Minor ash falls were reported in Albay's third district,
particularly Ligao, Guinobatan and Oas, as the westerly winds
carry the billowing dusts.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Mayon's lava dome was broken following a lava flow that
started Monday night. From then on, more lava and pyroclastic
materials oozed from the crater towards the southeast slope,
taking the deep Bonga Gully as its path.
</P>
<P>
Bonga Gully was the same path taken by the lava flow during the
volcano's 1993 major eruption, which killed some 70 persons.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Works out Public Investment Program for 2000-2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
has worked out its public investment program for 2000-2002,
focusing on investment that would accelerate economic growth in
rural areas to reduce poverty, the Cambodia Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Planning Ministry Secretary of State Lay Prahas said that it
was a formal national investment program that contains projects
submitted by each ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the program prepared by the Planning Ministry with
technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank, high
priorities are given to health, national and rural transportation
network, education, agriculture and water supply.
</P>
<P>
The health sector takes up nearly one-fourth of the 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars of the three-year plan. Transportation development
projects would require 215 million dollars and projects in
agriculture, water resources and education sectors need more than
164 million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government is planning to request 536 million
dollars from international donors at the Consultative Group
meeting in Paris in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The request is part of the government's 1.4-billion-dollar
development plan over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Donors and government officials have been meeting every three
or four months to monitor the government's progress in fiscal,
forestry, military and civil service reform.
</P>
<P>
At last year's Consultative Group meeting in Tokyo, donors
pledged 470 million dollars for one year period, but it remains
unclear how much pledged money has been disbursed so far.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Agrees to Change Oil Price  Assumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
finally agreed on Tuesday a proposal of the House of
Representatives (DPR) budget committee to change its oil price
assumption in drafting the country's 2000 state budget (from April
to December).
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to change oil price assumption, but, however, we
have yet decided how much the change (of the assumption) will be.
We will discuss such a matter in detail with the committee,"
Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo told a joint hearing with the
House budget committee.
</P>
<P>
The government has set oil price at 18 U.S. dollars per barrel
in the state budget 2000.
</P>
<P>
Previously the budget committee has urged the government to
change the assumption of oil price, considering the rise of crude
oil price to 30 U.S. dollars per barrel in international market.
</P>
<P>
But the government on Monday said that the fixity of crude oil
price at 18 U.S. dollars per barrel was a realistic thing while
setting oil price at 20 U.S. dollars per barrel as urged by the
House budget committee was "too optimistic."
</P>
<P>
Besides oil price assumption, the government also agreed to
increase tax revenues target and the additional funds of the
increased tax revenues will be used to finance government routine
expenditures such as salary hike of civil services and special
allowance for operational activities of the Indonesian police.
</P>
<P>
The government proposed to the House a draft of the state
budget for the fiscal year 2000 under which the country's tax
revenues were expected to reach 97.7 trillion rupiah (14 billion U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also agreed to rise its target
revenues from the privatization program of the state-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
"But the increase of the target will be proceeded carefully to
avoid the fall of share prices of state-owned companies which will
be privatized," Sudibyo added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian House of
Representatives (DPR) called on the government and the Indonesian
military (TNI) not to hesitate in dealing with those who are
trying to launch separatist movements aiming to separate from the
unitary state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
House speaker Akbar Tandjung said here Tuesday, "Against those
who remain to separate from the unitary state of Indonesia, we
urges the government to take decisive measures. We hope that the
government will not hesitate to take (strict) measures against
them," Tandjung told reporters at the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
He said particularly for Aceh issues, that the government also
should not hesitate in taking stern measures against the
separatist movement in the province, but stressed that there
should also be dialogs in a bid to find a way to settle the
problem peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Tengku Abdullah Syafei, Commander of the Free
Aceh Movement (GAM), an armed Acehnese group which has been
fighting against the central government to demand independence of
Aceh province, was reportedly shot in a gun fighting which took
place in Pidie regency, northern Aceh province.
</P>
<P>
The TNI headquarters confirmed the information, saying Syafei
was injured in his leg and was reportedly 'dying,' TNI spokesman
Air Marshall Graito Usodo said.
</P>
<P>
However, the information has been denied by the GAM, saying
that the commander is still fine and staying at his base camp in
Pidie regency.
</P>
<P>
Syafei is the military commander of the GAM which has waged a
guerrilla war against the central government since 1976.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Police Arrest Cult Leader, Seven Followers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese police on Tuesday
arrested Koji Takahashi, leader of the "Life Space" cult, and
seven of his followers on suspicion of leaving a seriously ill man
to die without giving him medical treatment, the Kyodo news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The suspects allegedly took Shinichi Kobayashi, then 66, from a
hospital in Itami, Hyogo Prefecture, to a hotel in Narita, east of
Tokyo, last July 2 while the sick man was being treated for a
brain hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
They allegedly abandoned the patient in the hotel room without
medical equipment after Takahashi administered what the cult calls
"Shakty Pat" therapy, in which the head is pounded.
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi's mummified body was found in the room on November 11,
last year.
</P>
<P>
Takahashi had insisted that the body was still alive and that
Kobayashi would recover in six months, and claimed he died only
when police conducted an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
Takahashi, who was taken from a hotel in Oarai, Ibaraki
Prefecture, to a police station earlier Tuesday, denied the
allegations against him, police said.
</P>
<P>
Life Space, which was founded by Takahashi in 1983, organizes
self-enlightenment seminars. The cult had 10,000 members at its
peak, but the number has since fallen to about 150.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Confident of 2006 World Cup Bid Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The information available
to the government suggested that South Africa had a "more than
realistic"chance of getting the nod from FIFA to host the 2006
World Cup soccer finals, Sport and Recreation Minister Ngconde
Balfour said in Pretoria on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Balfour said South Africa is eligible for hosting the greatest
sport event in the world.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA inspection team will be in South Africa March 9-14 to
assess the country's suitability as the hosts.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we are ready for FIFA inspection and will pass
their rigourous inspection with flying colours," Balfour said.
</P>
<P>
He said the goverment offers full support for the Bid Committee
and said that it had signed all necessary financial guarantees "
assuring FIFA that a World Cup in South Africa would be a secure
investment".
</P>
<P>
Securing the World Cup is expected to provide a tremendous
boost to South Africa's economy. It will also contribute two
percent to the Gross Domestic Product, create 129,000 jobs and add
about 30 billion rand (about five billion U.S. dollars) to the
country.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive officer of the South African 2006 Bid
Committee Danny Jordaan said the body had done the necessary
lobbying to sell a compelling case that it was South Africa's turn
to host the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Our country has the capacity to host an event of the scale of
the World Cup. We have the passion of the fans to count on. We'
ve been tested when this country hosted the '96 African Cup of
Nations and before that '95 Rugby World Cup," Jordaan said.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Promote Loans for Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities have
issued a plan for the further development of college loans for
poor students, Xinhua learned today.
</P>
<P>
According to the guideline jointly issued by the People's Bank
of China and the ministries of education and finance, the loans
are divided into two kinds: state education loans to be provided
by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with a 50 percent
discount on interest payment, and commercial loans to be provided
by various commercial banks and urban and rural credit co-
operatives.
</P>
<P>
The guideline requires financial institutions to quickly
establish a credit registration system for private borrowers and
authorizes them to publish the names of borrowers who default on
loans in newspapers and through other media.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates for commercial education loans can be
somewhat lower than those offered by the central bank, but must
stay within a set range, the guideline says.
</P>
<P>
It also lists qualification requirements for applicants, the
approval procedures, and the roles of schools, students and their
custodians in applying for and repayment of the loans.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, officials at the central bank
expressed the belief that the plan will help all young people in
China get into college regardless of their financial circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Parties Concerned in Kosovo Urged to Exercise Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- China is deeply worried about
the recent clashes in Kosovo between UN peace-keeping forces and
ethnic Albanians, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao at a
regular press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn any violent acts that may bring new instability to
Kosovo, and call on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and
prevent the situation from further deteriorating," Zhu said in
reply to a question on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo issue is a very complicated ethnic and religious
problem rooted in a region of Yugoslavia," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO had seriously violated the United Nations
Charter and principles of the international law by using force on
the sovereign state of Yugoslavia, and also set up a "extremely
perilous example of interfering in other country's internal
affairs".
</P>
<P>
The use of force has also made the regional situation more
complicated, he added.
</P>
<P>
The recent situation in Kosovo has again proved that the
Resolution 1244 passed by the UN Security Council has not been
carried out truly and effectively, neither has Kosovo's security
situation been apparently improved since the UN peace-keeping
forces and civilian organizations entered Kosovo, Zhu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reiterated China's position on the Kosovo issue. He said
that the only way to create necessary conditions for a political
solution to the Kosovo problem is to respect Yugoslavia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, to implement truly and
effectively Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council, and to
fully respect the equal rights of all ethnic groups in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Grant China NTR Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the United
States to grant it the normal trading relations (NTR) status,
citing the NTR as the basis of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a press conference
here this afternoon that China believes the U.S. government should
grant China such a status "completely and unconditionally," and
should not attach any conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of the fact that the U.S. government has
made it clear that it will make all-out efforts to do so, and
solve related issue without attaching any conditions, and that
many U.S. congressmen, people of insight and businessmen support
such an action taken by the U.S. government," he said, adding that
"We hope that the U.S. side will implement its commitments
earnestly."
</P>
<P>
He added that Sino-U.S. agreement on China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is a win-win deal resulting from
long-standing negotiations between the two countries, and achieved
on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual understanding and
mutual compromise.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Sino-U.S. Strategic and Security Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese and U.S. sides made
in-depth and candid exchanges of views on security, ballistic-
missile defense and Taiwan arms-sale issues during their February
17-18 consultations, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at today's press conference when briefing
on the Sino-U.S. strategic and security consultations in Beijing
last week.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side set forth its views and stances on global
security situations and the new security views, among which
ballistic-missile defense systems was one of the central topics.
</P>
<P>
Zhu quoted the U.S. side as replying that its development of
national and theater missile-defense systems (NMD and TMD) is
entirely a counter-measure against "rogue states", and for the
security of the U.S.. The U.S. side also briefed the Chinese side
on their basic plans.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side pointed out, according to Zhu, that such an
excuse stands on no ground. The development plan of NMD and TMD is
detrimental to both global strategic balance and stability, and
regional peace and security. It harms the interests of other
countries as well as of the U.S. itself.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side urged the U.S. side to consider the political
and strategic prices it would have to pay for NMD, and to carry
out no test nor deployment for the plan, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side stressed that the Taiwan issue is the most
important and most sensitive issue at the center of Sino-U.S.
relations, and wished the U.S. side would abide by the three joint
communiques by the two sides, as well as honor its commitments,
saying that handling the Taiwan issue appropriately is crucial to
the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side expressed the Clinton administration's commitment
to developing relations between the two countries, saying that
President Clinton is determined to push the relations further
ahead in the direction of constructive strategic partnership
during the rest of his term, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side said that President Clinton is firmly devoted to
winning Congressional support for granting China the permanent
normal trade relations (NTR) status. Meanwhile, the U.S. side
acknowledges the importance and sensitiveness of the Taiwan issue,
and will abide by the one-China principle, the three joint
communiques, and relevant commitments.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged that the United States government is opposed
to the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, and will block it from
coming into effect, Zhu told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Version of World Employment Report 1998-99 Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese government
officials and scholars attended a ceremony held here today to mark
the launching of the Chinese version of the 1998-99 World
Employment Report.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version is jointly translated and published by the
Institute of International Labor Studies and the China Labor and
Social Security Publishing House, both attached to the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
The participants at today's gathering praised the report.
Professor Liu Qingtang from the Beijing Foreign Trade and Economy
University said it offers local officials and scholars a new way
of thinking about the country's increasingly serious unemployment
problem.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security, since 1995 the International Labor Organization has
published an annual report on global unemployment every one or two
years. The 1998-99 report is the third.
</P>
<P>
This year's report, which focuses on the role of professional
training in increasing employment, analyses different training
systems and strategies in different countries, and proposes the
training methods meant to improve enterprise efficiency and
national competitiveness as well as to raise employment figures.
</P>
<P>
It gives top priority to the prospects of increasing women's
employment and improving the skills and capability of employment
for young people, long-time unemployed people, elderly workers and
handicapped laborers.
</P>
<P>
To successfully improve the quality of laborers, decisions on
professional training must be coordinated between the government,
the employers and the employees, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Retail Giant to Extend Business in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Uchumi, the giant chain of
supermarkets in Kenya, is planning to expand its business into the
east African region, its managing director Titus Mugo said.
</P>
<P>
Uchumi (economy in Kiswahili) has already received proposals
and invitations from Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda to open
new branches there, the East African Standard newspaper Tuesday
quoted Mugo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Uchumi, the largest retail chain in Kenya, now has 17 branches
across the country, employing 1,500 people with an annual turnover
of 6.9 billion shillings (around 94 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The business expansion to the east African region is part of
the company' s comprehensive restructuring of operations which
will include 50-million- shilling investment in information
technology, Mugo said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, all Uchumi branches are to be
computerized and linked with each other to facilitate the
company's ambitious expansion plan, the managing director said,
adding that the company's turnover is expected to be doubled in
three years.

KAMPALA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Party (DP), one

officials, has said that he would run for presidency as a DP
candidate.

After his returning home, Sebaggala as DP's Kampala district
chairman has been riding an unprecedented wave of popularity among
local residents, particularly farmers.

He won mayoral elections in April 1998 and was arrested in the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Urges More Investment in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. ambassador to
Tanzania underscored the great economic potential in the east
African country and urged U.S. businessmen to invest, the Guardian
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a trade and investment dialog between U.S. businessmen and
their Tanzanian counterparts, Ambassador Charles Stith mentioned
political stability, natural resources and cutting-edge policy
initiatives in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania possesses tremendous economic potential and it is
heading in the right direction, the U.S. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He noted Tanzania's performance is strong enough that it has
qualified as one of the six African countries in line for early
consideration for debt relief under the expanded Highly Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
</P>
<P>
But it is not moving as quickly as possible to realize its
potential due to bureaucratic inertia, corruption and poor
infrastructure, Stith was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stronger economic ties between the U.S. and African countries
are not only good for Africa but also good for the U.S., because
the Americans need new markets and investment opportunities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian official figures show the U.S. investments in
Tanzania currently range between 15 million U.S. dollar to 20
million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. are investing in Tanzania's tourism, manufacturing,
construction, transport, petroleum, fishing and agriculture.

TOKYO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued to fall
in Tokyo Tuesday, dragged down by the unwinding of corporate cross-
shareholdings ahead of the March-end book closings.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 153.17 points or 0.78
percent from Monday's close to end at 19,390.58.

<P>
Uncertainty over the course on Wall Street was another factor
discouraging investors from buying stocks, traders said.

faced selling, they said.

Biotechnology-related issues, however, continued to draw buying
on their high-growth potentials.

<HEADLINE> Lava Begins to Ooze out of Mayon Crater in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Mount Mayon's lava dome, the
hardened magma covering the volcano's crater, collapsed Tuesday
morning, followed by a gush of ash laden grayish smoke and lava
flowing some 4 kilometers down the gully facing the Southeast
sector, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
This was preceded by the crater glow which started at about 6 p.
m. Monday which means lava had started to seep out of the cracks
at the volcano's crater.
</P>
<P>
The trail of smoke, which characterized pyroclastic flow,
continued intermittently since Tuesday morning, and ash falls were
confirmed at Albay's third district, specifically the towns of
Camalig, Ligao and Guinobatan.
</P>
<P>
There was, however, no loud explosion.
</P>
<P>
An advisory issued by the Volcanology agency had increased Mt.
Mayon's danger zone at eight kilometers at the Southern sector,
while the six-kilometer danger zone stays at the rest of the areas
surrounding the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Institute on Volcanology and Seismology Phivolcs was
quoted as saying that there are two types of eruption occurring at
Mt. Mayon the "quite" eruption and the pyroclastic flow.
</P>
<P>
Both eruptions are characterized by lava and other volcanic
debris to include rocks and ashes flowing out of the volcano's
crater.
</P>
<P>
All these activities are happening at the Southeastern quadrant
of the volcano, where the crater wall had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have reportedly started evacuating some of the
969 families residing in the six-kilometer danger zone area around
Mayon Volcano which showed sign of an eruption.
</P>

Carrying the phrase "If you have to kill someone..." in its

</P>

The site says a professional killer group has been created this

However, some officials of the NPA said the site may have been

<HEADLINE> WBC Sets Title Bout Date Despite Arguement by Top Contender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Boxing Council
announced here on Monday that Luisito Espinosa of the Philippines
is to fight Guty Espadas of Mexico on April 14 in a featherweight
championship bout in Merida, eastern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The announcement in fact answered the arguement by the title's
No. 1 contender Espinosa that he should not have to fight Espadas
in Mexico to fill the vacant title.
</P>
<P>
He also wanted to have his 55 percent share of the purse
increased.
</P>
<P>
The WBC announced Saturday that it was reconsidering plans for
the match to fill the vacant title, after receiving complaints
from the chief of the Philippine Boxing Federation.
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, the council said the complaint had actually come
from "a source believed linked to attorneys for Luisito Espinosa."
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleged that the February 8 auction of the fight
was irregular and that the WBC had turned to promoter Dan Goossen
of America Presents to represent Espinosa even though the two are
in a court dispute.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A public opinion poll in east
China's Jiangxi Province shows that about 90 percent of the local
residents are satisfied with the work of local police.
</P>
<P>
The two-month survey was conducted by all police stations in
the province.
</P>
<P>
About one million local people from all walks of life took part
in the survey which reviewed the work of more than 10,000
policemen.
</P>
<P>
The respondents gave suggestions to those public security
officers whose job performance has not been satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Peng Huangong, deputy director of the Jiangxi Provincial Public
Security Department, said that opening the public security sector
to public scrutiny is a big step by the province to improve
supervision over local police.
</P>
<P>
According to Peng, police stations elsewhere in the country now
intend to conduct similar polls.

PANZHIHUA (Sichuan), February 22 (Xinhua) -- Panzhihua City, a
rising heavy industrial center on the upper reaches of Yangtze
River, will invest 100 million yuan to build over 30 environmental
projects this year.
</P>
<P>
The city pledged to launch more projects that would tackle
problems in the area such as soil erosion, auto emission and
sewage treatment during China's tenth five-year plan period (2001-
2005).
</P>
<P>
Panzhihua has been described by Chinese experts as the primary
source of pollution on the upper reaches of Yangtze River. More
than 70 outlets where pollutants are discharged are located along
a 103-km section of Jinsha River running through Panzhihua,
spewing 46 tons of industrial and domestic waste into the river a
day.
</P>
<P>
The city government has earmarked one billion yuan for building
more than 1,000 pollution control projects. The Baguanhe Coal
Dressing Plant, the city's leading polluter, has set up a close-
circuit coal filter press system which retrieves 100,000 tons of
coal annually.
</P>
<P>
All newly-built or expanded projects at Panzhihua are required
to have environmental protection features.
</P>
<P>
These measures have slashed the pollutants in the Jinsha River
by 98 percent and the industrial waste down by half.

<HEADLINE> China's Loans Show Sharp Increase in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The latest financial
statistics released by the People's Bank of China show that China'
s monetary supply sustained its growing momentum in January, with
bank loans increasing sharply.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of residents' deposits also hit a record
last month to reach the six trillion yuan mark, according to the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January, the outstanding money in circulation
plus corporate deposits and savings deposits (M2) was 12.122
trillion yuan, up 14.9 percent from the same period last year; the
outstanding cash plus demand deposits (M1) was 4.657 trillion yuan,
up 19.4 percent; and the outstanding cash in circulation (M0) was
1.6094 trillion yuan, up 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
The net cash input in the month was 263.8 billion yuan,
according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated growth of M0 and M1 indicates that enterprises
and residents tend to hold more current deposits and cash, which
is beneficial for short-term economic recovery and the
implementation of policies concerning the expansion of domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of total loans was 9.3838 trillion yuan,
up 12.8 percent from the same period last year, while the
outstanding amount of total deposits was 10.7778 trillion yuan, up
12.3 percent, of which urban and rural residents' deposits
increased 11 percent to reach 6.0242 trillion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Jurists Call for Containment of Taiwan Splittist Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese jurists and
lawyers in Beijing gathered today to discuss the Chinese
government's just-issued white paper on the Taiwan issue, calling
for clear understanding of and adherence to the "one China"
principle and containing splittist forces.
</P>
<P>
They spoke highly of the white paper, hailing it as an
important document on the Taiwan issue following the successful
returns of Hong Kong and Macao to China, and saying it will help
the Taiwan public to understand the stance of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the Ministry of Justice and
attended by researchers and professors from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, Foreign Affairs College and the Chinese
University of Political Science and Law, as well as some
celebrated lawyers in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to the international law, sovereignty is the supreme
power of a country and cannot be divided, jurists said.
</P>
<P>
When the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of
China in 1949, it became the only legitimate government
representing China in the world, thus it should be entitled to
sovereignty over China, including Taiwan, in terms of nomology,
they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that the "one China" principle lays the
foundation and precondition for the peaceful reunification of the
motherland, but the splittist activities of Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui
have not only obstructed the development of cross-straits
relations, but also posed potential threats to peace and stability
of Asia-Pacific regions and even the world.
</P>
<P>
The jurists restated that the eight-point propositions, put
forward by President Jiang Zemin in January 1995 for the
development of cross-Straits relations and the acceleration of the
peaceful reunification of China, be further upheld.
</P>
<P>
Minister Gao Changli said that in the fight against splittist
forces, the legal profession, as well as those working for the
government, must toe the line of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party and use legal means to counter Lee Teng-
hui's attempt to legalize his "state-to-state" remarks.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Approval of Oil Equipment for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq should be allowed to
import millions of U.S. dollars worth of spare parts to sustain
its oil industry and help ease surging world oil prices, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have recommended to the Security Council that they should
allow Iraq to import millions of dollars worth of spare parts to
be able to sustain that industry as some of it is still on hold,
blocked by council members," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has indicated that without the spare parts necessary to
repair its industry, it may have to cut back on its production,"
Annan, who is on his first visit to Australia, told the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that it would be released shortly because you cannot
run an oil industry without essential spare parts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the collapse of the Iraqi oil industry would not
only hit the world economy, but would also harm the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials warned last week that Baghdad may cut crude oil
production if the United States continued to hold up approval of
oil equipment sales to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hans von Sponeck, the head of the U.N. humanitarian program
that allows Baghdad to sell oil to buy food, medicine and other
supplies, resigned last week, criticizing the program as
inadequate. His predecessor resigned two years ago for the same
reasons.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that as we search for a more effective way we
will be able to come up with something that will spare the
population," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that I will be looking into when I go back.
Hans von Sponeck is meeting me in New York and we'll review the
situation and see what steps could be taken to make the regime
more effective," he added.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday received
a grant from Japan to purchase audio visual equipment for its
National Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
The grant amounting to 1.55 million ringgit (about 0.4 million
U.S. dollars) is timely as the gallery is improving its facilities
with contemporary and high-tech equipment, Malaysian Foreign
Ministry Secretary-General Abdul Kadir Mohamad said here at the
exchange of notes on the grant with Hideki Harashima, the Japanese
ambassador to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He believed the gallery has the potential to scale to new
heights and provide the public with deeper understanding and
appreciation of arts, with greater support from the government,
the private sector and international grants like the Japanese
Cultural Grant.
</P>
<P>
With the latest grant, Japan has altogether contributed 48
million ringgit (about 12.6 million dollars) in cultural aid to
Malaysia since 1978, assisting Malaysia in many fields of culture
such as arts, sports education and broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> Mayon Volcano Eruption Eminent: Volcanologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Volcanologists confirmed
Tuesday the abnormal condition of Mount Mayon in central
Philippines has intensified as two episodes of lava trickles were
observed Monday night, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologist Ted Sandoval of the Philippine Institute on
Volcanology and Seismology (Philvocs) was quoted in a prediction
as saying that a full-blown eruption might occur "anytime."
</P>
<P>
"The condition is critical and has been in the uptrend since
last week's hoisting of Alert Level Three. The trickles are signs
that the lava dome at the crater is accumulating," Sandoval said.
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said crater glows became visible starting 6:10 p.m.
Monday and was followed by the two successive lava trickles two
hours later.
</P>
<P>
"Eruption might occur anytime depending on the magma's fate of
ascent," said Alex Baloloy, another volcanologist.
</P>
<P>
Disaster control officials have reportedly beefed up
preparations for mass evacuation and relief operations with round-
the-clock ready vehicles, communication facilities in place.
</P>
<P>
Mayon Mountain, located in Albay, a southeastern province on
Luzon island, began to show unstable signs since June 22 last year
and its latest major eruption was in 1993, killing some 70 people.

<HEADLINE> Macao Newspaper Comments on White Paper About Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on the White Paper
about the Taiwan issue released Monday by the Chinese government,
the Macao Daily News said Tuesday that the one-China principle has
no room for compromise.
</P>
<P>
The white paper serves as a strong warning and counterattack to
the separatist forces in Taiwan represented by Lee Teng-hui, and a
reminder of the mainland's policy after the upcoming election in
Taiwan, the newspaper said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that there is no room for compromise in terms of
the One-China principle, and that whether the cross-Straits
relations can step out of the current low ebb depends on whether
the Taiwan authorities will come back to the one-China position,"
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the international background, the One-China
principle can be taken as a dividing line to differentiate the
stances of various countries in face of the cross-Straits issue,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also noted that the Chinese government has never
ruled out the use of force to resolve the Taiwan issue, and the
white paper makes clearer statement about the conditions of
resorting to force.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan authorities and the international community should
pay enough attention to the statement and should not underestimate
it," the newspaper said.

visa-free access to holders of Macao SAR passport before his tour
which is expected to take place at the end of May, as related work

<P>
The Chinese-language newspaper "Ta Kung Pao" said that the
white paper explicates in detail the basic stance and policy of
the Chinese government on the One-China principle as well as its
attitude and proposition on a number of issues related to the
cross-Straits relations under the One-China principle.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, which will serve as an important guiding
document, affirmed the Chinese people's determination on solving
the Taiwan issue early and realizing the ultimate reunification of
the motherland, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Wen Wei Po" pointed out in an editorial that the white paper
is a further step in conveying to the international community and
the Taiwan Island the following message: the Chinese government
will resolutely uphold the One-China principle, and is full of
determination and capable of safeguarding the country's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland, and
the successful implementation of the "one country, two systems"
principle demonstrate that the principle is full of vitality and
is entirely applicable to Taiwan, the editorial said, expressing
the hope that more Taiwan compatriots will come to Hong Kong and
Macao to see with their own eyes the feasibility and the
rationality of the principle.
</P>
<P>
"The Sun" said in an editorial that historical facts show that
a united China has always led to prosperous times, while the state
became weak and people suffered when the country was fragmented.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper slammed the United States for its policy on the
Taiwan issue, which it said would put China in the danger of a
civil war.
</P>
<P>
"Sing Pao Daily News" said the cross-Straits relations must
progress positively, no matter who will become the future leader
of the Taiwan Island.
</P>
<P>
If the United States favors the enforcement of the U.S.-Taiwan
relation and insists on putting Taiwan into its missile defense
plan, the Taiwan leader would act more scrupulously and resulted
in a more serious situation on the Taiwan Straits, the newspaper
warned.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Mission to Go to Indonesia to Arrange PM's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will send a fact-
finding mission to Indonesia soon to identify areas for
cooperation and assistance to accelerate the latter's economic
recovery, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The mission will precede Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's visit to Indonesia at the invitation of President
Abdurrahman Wahid, he told reporters after opening an
international symposium on Malaysian business in the new era
organized by the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute in
Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian president's invitation was handed over to
Mahathir by Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that he will make the visit as soon as possible,
according to Syed Hamid.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's upcoming visit to Indonesia will be a follow-up to
his brief meeting with Wahid at the UNCTAD conference in Bangkok
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Mahathir had informed the Indonesian foreign
minister that he would like to bring along the private sector
during the coming trip to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said Mahathir had instructed him to make arrangements for
the visit, including sending the fact-finding mission whose report
will be submitted to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has raised several matters, including special
overseas funding, to hasten its economic recovery, Syed Hamid said,
adding"We have to look within our capabilities and the interest
that Malaysians have."
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid stressed that Malaysia looked forward to creating
partnership with Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Clash in New York Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bradley questioned the vice president for his failure to ask
President Bill Clinton to issue an executive order outlawing
racial profiling. Gore shot back, saying that racial profiling
practically began in Bradley's New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"If you elect me to the presidency, the first civil rights act
of the 21st century will be a federal law outlawing racial
profiling," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
"I am questioning why you haven't done that or why you haven't
made this happen in the past seven years," Bradley responded.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic rivals also argued about affirmative action, a
program to protect rights of the African Americans, and their
merit records when both were senators.
</P>
<P>
Bradley charged that Gore sought to eliminate affirmative
action early in the Clinton administration and also voted against
denying tax-exempt status to schools that commit racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"You're sounding a little desperate because you are trying to
build yourself up by tearing everyone else down," Gore responded,
saying Bradley's accusations were "phony and scurrilous."
</P>
<P>
Having lost to Gore in Iowa's caucus January 24 and in New
Hampshire's primary February 1 and legged far behind in national
polls, Bradley admitted that he must chalk up some primary
victories soon to keep his fading presidential hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
Presidential nomination might be settled on March 7, or "Super
Tuesday," when New York, California, Ohio and a dozen other states
finish holding presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
The next debate between the two Democratic rivals, their final
showdown before "Super Tuesday", is set for March 1 in California.
</P>
<P>
Bradley expressed that hope that if he wins in Washington state
primary next week it would give him a needed boost into the March
7 primaries and caucuses.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Introduce Tough Laws Against Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to introduce
severe laws within the next few months to curb rampant organized
crime and underworld activities, the official Daily News reported
here Tuesday quoting a senior minister.
</P>
<P>
"Organized crime is one of the pressing problems in our society
today and we should take stern measures to combat this menace
effectively," Minister of Justice G.L. Peiris was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police said there are at least 18 crime gangs operating in
capital Colombo alone, linking with contract killings,
prostitution, extortion, robberies, kidnapping, drug trafficking,
gun-running, money laundering and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Early on Monday, six armed men robbed 1.2 million rupees (168,
000 U.S. dollars) from an outlet of the U.S. fast-food giant
MacDonalds in downtown Colombo, the latest evidence of the
organized crime waves.
</P>
<P>
Peiris instructed the Law Commission to formulate laws which
will make membership of an organized criminal gang unlawful.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the commission to give top priority to drafting
rulings to combat crime by organized groups.
</P>
<P>
The commission will study similar legal procedures in other
countries like the United States and China in formulating the
legislation, which is expected to be introduced in Parliament this
year.
</P>
<P>
Peiris said that the prevailing laws of evidence were outdated
and accused persons in criminal proceedings were afforded a great
deal of protection.
</P>
<P>
He added that protection available to the ordinary criminal
will not be applicable to those involved in organized crime.

BANGKOK, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaria and meningitis are
posing a serious threat to Thai soldiers posted in border areas,
particularly along the Thai-Myanmese border, "Bangkok Post"
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Medical Department Bunlert Chantharapas was
quoted as saying on Monday that the resurgence of malaria and
meningitis had become quite serious and threatened the health of
soldiers stationed in border areas.
</P>
<P>
Many of them have already died from malaria and many are still
bedridden from the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Medical Department has tried in vain to control its spread,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
It was an uphill task to fight malaria and other contagious
diseases on the border as they were brought into the country by
refugees from neighboring countries, Bunlert said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the spread of malaria, the Thai army has distributed
doxycycline to soldiers in those areas.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Science Important Tool to Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright delivered a speech here Monday at a national
science meeting, saying good science is one of the tools most
vital to good diplomacy in a world being changed by science.
</P>
<P>
At the 2000 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS), the secretary talked about the
intersections between science and diplomacy, and how they are
making a difference on issues and in parts of the globe that
matter to Americans.
</P>
<P>
For example, Albright said, the science alert on the
stratospheric ozone loss led to an international agreement known
as the Montreal Protocol, under which ozone-depleting chemicals
were to be phased out around the world.
</P>
<P>
"From microbes to missiles, the threats we face could come from
almost anywhere on earth. International cooperation is essential
to respond to such challenges," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
Both cooperation and diplomacy are required in addressing the
challenges, but not sufficient. If negotiations are actually to
solve problems, rather than merely paper them over, they must
often be informed by first-rate scientific advice, the secretary
said.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, Albright said, U.S. diplomats work closely
with scientists on water issues that are critical to the search
for a comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
And in the global fight against narcotics trafficking, the U.S.
has been helped by science on alternative crops to coca, marijuana
and opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
Albright mentioned the AIDS pandemic is among a number of
issues that once were viewed simply as health matters. However, "
In recent years, we have recognized it as a foreign policy
challenge," and "that is why we launched a diplomatic initiative
last year to urge foreign leaders to put more money and muscle
into the fight against AIDS."
</P>
<P>
She also talked of the foods produced under transgenetic
technology, which is opposed by some foreign countries and some
people at home.
</P>
<P>
She said controversy at the biosafety negotiation held last
month in Montreal, Canada, shows that simply having good science
is not always enough, and that the science must be part of a
larger long-term strategy to educate the public and work with
governments to address concerns and find practical solutions.
</P>
<P>
Albright said next month she will issue a policy statement
setting forth her commitment to enhancing the department's ability
to handle scientific and technological issues.
</P>
<P>
She will appoint a science advisor as soon as possible, who
will be placed within the Under Secretariat for Global Affairs. A
science directorate within the Bureau of Oceans and International
Environmental and Scientific Affairs will also be established.

therefore we have to seek grants from overseas," Forestry and
Plantations Minister Nur Mahmudi Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
Boasting the world's second richest forests and biological
diversity, Indonesia plays a pivotal role in maintaining the world
's lungs. But the country's forests are badly damaged by
overlogging, exacerbated by massive forest fires in the late 1990s.

WELLINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Team New Zealand won race
two of the America's Cup finals series by 2 minutes 43 seconds
over challenger Prada Challenge of Italy Tuesday afternoon on
Hauraki Gulf off Auckland, the biggest city of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealanders blitzed the Italians from the outset,
crossing the start line 18 seconds in the lead.
</P>
<P>
The first leg proved disastrous for the Italian challengers,
with a bag wrapping itself around their keel and a crewmember
suffering a bad gash to the head, his blood spilling over the
starboard side.
</P>
<P>
The Italian had to be taken off the boat by an ambulance boat
to receive stitches for his head wound.
</P>
<P>
Prada made inroads through legs two and three, but Team New
Zealand powered on for a convincing win.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the tournament, the two teams are scheduled
to have nine races, with each race worth one point, and the first
boat to win five points will win the cup. Now Team New Zealand
leads two-nil in the series.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Not to Leave Before E.Timorese Get Ready to Rule: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations wanted
East Timorese to be in position to run their newly-independent
state before the U.N. transitional authority withdraws, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in a position to give you a specific date but we are
working hand in glove with the East Timorese leadership and will
continue to do that," Annan told the Australian National Press
Club.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we will not leave before the job is done," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.'s two-year mandate ends in August next year, with East
Timorese independence leaders keen to take control soon after.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the U.N. should be guided by specific achievements
rather than an arbitrary timetable.
</P>
<P>
"I trust that the East Timorese leadership will work with us in
this direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to linger, we don't want to stay much longer
than is necessary," he said. "On the other hand, I think it would
be irresponsible not to do as much as we can before we leave."

<HEADLINE> KFOR Peacekeepers, Ethnic Albanians Clash in Kosovo Town Mitrovica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Tensions heightened Monday in
the northern Kosovo town of Mitrovica where KFOR peacekeepers
clashed with a crowd of ethnic Albanians protesting the ethnic
division of the volatile city.
</P>
<P>
Two French soldiers and more than 20 Kosovo Albanians were left
wounded in the afternoon clash, Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
reported. The KFOR soldiers and international police forces used
teargas and batons to disperse the crowd trying to storm the
bridge over the Ibar river, which divides Kosovska Mitrovica into
Serb- and Albanian-dominated sides.
</P>
<P>
The French and Danish peacekeepers formed a defense line with
tanks and armed vehicles to block the passage of the protesters
into the Serb-dominated north. Meanwhile, more than 2,000 Serb
residents gathered near the northern side of the bridge, ready to
fight.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between peacekeepers and protesters lasted more
than one hour, which subsided by early evening.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian protesters were estimated at over 60,000,
including about 20,000 people walking from the provincial capital
Pristina, 40 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident was the second of its kind after a February 5
clash between Albanians and peacekeepers in which some French
soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks, armed violence between Serb and
Albanian residents in Mitrovica has left at least nine people from
both sides dead and about 20 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The clashes were triggered by a late February 3 Albanian
grenade attack on a Serb cafe in the north of Mitrovica, in which
12 young Serb people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Monday's clash took place when the KFOR troops continued a
large-scale search for weapons and paramilitary criminals in the
city. On Sunday, U.S. soldiers were attacked by Serb residents
with rocks and bottles when they searched Serb houses and schools.

<HEADLINE> More Italians to Spend Holidays at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 21 (Xinhua) -- More Italians are choosing to
vacation at home, rather than going abroad as many did for the
past decade, according to a latest poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll report released Monday said among the 2,030 persons
interviewed, the number of those who have opted to vacation in
Italy this year saw a 3 percent rise over 1999.
</P>
<P>
Aureliano Bonini, president of the survey-conductor Trademark
Italia and Sociometrica, attributed the rise in those who want to
stay at home to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar or the concept
that foreign destinations have become "almost domestic."
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that over 50 percent of those interviewed
choose the seaside for their holidays, while those who favor
famous art cities decreased by 5.7 percent, followed by those who
prefer to visit countries outside Europe, down 4.5 percent, and
visits to mountain sites were down 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among foreign destinations, islands in the Indian Ocean or the
Caribbean have definitely fallen off, but the attraction remains
strong for Cuba, Santo Domingo, the United States, Brazil and the
Egyptian Red Sea, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that 12 percent of those interviewed surfed
the internet for vacation plans.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Urges Disarming Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Ilir
Meta on Monday urged more efforts for a nationwide campaign to
collect weapons among citizens so as to create an investment-
friendly environment.
</P>
<P>
At the conference on the collection of weapons in Albania, Meta
said that not only government bodies, but also the entire Albanian
society, political parties, and civil societies should be
concerned with the disarming process.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said disarmament of weapons among the people
is a process which Albanian media should also play a sensitizing
role.
</P>
<P>
About 1 million weapons were looted from army depots in 1997
unrest. Only 18 percent of the looted weapons have been collected,
according to Dr. Alfred Moisiu, chairman of the Albanian
Association of Northern Atlantic (AANC).
</P>
<P>
"Possession of weapons by the people has lead to the removal of
investors from Albania. Several Albanian investors are currently
investing abroad, because they feel more secure there," Moisiu
said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was sponsored by the AANC and the United Nations
Development Program.

<P>
WARSAW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A Polish Foreign Ministry note
said Monday that what Polish border police did was "legal" when
arresting dozens of Belarussian citizens last week in the Polish
city of Gizicko near the Poland-Belarus borderline.
</P>
<P>
The note was a response to a Belarussian Foreign Ministry note
issued last Tuesday protesting that on February 13, 47 Belarussian
citizens were detained and repatriated by force by the Polish
border police who gave them no chance to contact the Belarus
consulate and took away their papers illegally.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Foreign Ministry replied that the police action
accords with regulations and targets all foreigners engaged in
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
It said that investigations proved the repatriated Belarussians
were engaged in trade during their stay in Poland, which did not
correspond to what they had declared to do when they entered the
country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Bodies Called to Prepare For SEA Games  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) called sports organization officials to attend a
meeting on Monday to discuss the country's preparation for the
2001 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
KONI vice chairman Arie Sudewo said after the meeting that the
results would be brought to the SEA Games Federation council
meeting in Kuala Lumpur from March 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed which sports would possibly be featured in the
next Games. We don't want athletes from some sports to be
unrepresented and feel forced by KONI to fight to be featured,"
Arie was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arie, who is also the centralized training executive director
for the 2000 Olympics, 2001 SEA Games and 2002 Asian Games, said
he still had no idea of the number of sports to be featured next
year.
</P>
<P>
"Ten members of the SEA Games Federation will decide which
sports will be featured in next year's Games. However, Indonesia
needs to lobby participating countries to support sports in which
we excel, to be featured in the biennial event. KONI will also
urge sports organizations to lobby their international and Asian
federations to feature the sports," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Olympics preparation, Arie said athletes who
had qualified for the quadrennial event in Sydney in September
still had a chance not to compete due to their performance during
the training programs.
</P>
<P>
"If any athletes show a flat or decreasing graphic of
performance, KONI will think twice about sending them to the
Olympics. By joining the training center, we hope athletes will
improve their performances," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Uber Cup Team Members Come Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Uber Cup team has
drawn criticisms from former athletes and officials despite it
reached the final stage of the event in Kuala Lumpur in May, the
Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Former badminton queen Susi Susanti said that she expected her
juniors to be more serious in their international performances.
</P>
<P>
"I see that some of my juniors have yet to realize their
responsibilities as national shuttlers. Sometimes they don't
realize that they are competing for the country, PBSI (the
Badminton Association of Indonesia) and themselves," Susi said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia defeated Hong Kong of China 3-1 in the playoffs to
claim the third place ticket to the final stage. South Korea and
Japan have already earned two tickets. The three countries will
join Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden from the European zone,
defending champions China and host Malaysia in the event.
</P>
<P>
Susi said the shuttlers never appeared guilty when they failed
at a tournament.
</P>
<P>
"They don't feel sorry about their failure and only think that
their opponents are better. They don't realize that their loss may
have been due to their own lack of self-discipline," said the 1992
Olympic Games gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
Former PBSI chairman Surjadi urged PBSI officials to pay
shuttlers more attention to overcome influences in the dormitory.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still paying attention to our athlete's performances in
tournaments. I see that the real world has influenced the life in
the dormitories and that has made athletes more likely to break
PBSI rules," he said.
</P>
<P>
Surjadi said due to this influence, PBSI officials needed to
sacrifice more to groom their athletes better.
</P>
<P>
"What happens in their surroundings will also influence their
personal life and it gets carried on court. PBSI needs to pay
attention to this matter," he added.
</P>
<P>
The National Sports Council (KONI)'s vice chairman Arie Sudewo
and chairman of PBSI board of patrons Try Sutrisno shared the same
feelings on PBSI's need to groom younger female athletes to
replace their seniors.
</P>
<P>
Arie said coaches would have to evaluate the shuttler's
performances in the qualification rounds.
</P>
<P>
"Coaches still have time to improve athletes performance before
competing in Kuala Lumpur. At least, our shuttlers know the
strength of their Asian opponents," he said.
</P>
<P>
Try said: "I only want to see PBSI groom young athletes who are
ready to replace their seniors in international events."

DALIAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was recently held in
Dalian City, northeast China's Liaoning Province, to award
fishermen and sailors for their bravery in rescuing shipwreck
victims in the Bohai Sea last October.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, the provincial government announced that

Dalian. The rescuers reportedly cut the fishing lines from their
ships and released the captured fish before hurrying to save
passengers and crew on the sinking ship.

<P>
Some 163 of the 165 people on board the Shenglu were rescued.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seeks 2.4 Bln Dollars to Save Rainforests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
called for international bailout funds totaling about 2.4 billion
U.S. dollars to help save the country's tropical rainforests.
</P>
<P>
"We need 22.2 trillion rupiah (about 2.9 billion U.S. dollars)
to restore the ravaged forests... We only have 4 trillion rupiah,
therefore we have to seek grants from overseas," Forestry and
Plantations Minister Nur Mahmudi Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
Boasting the world's second richest forests and biological
diversity, Indonesia plays a pivotal role in maintaining the world
's lungs. But the country's forests are badly damaged by
overlogging, exacerbated by massive forest fires in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
More than 6.3 million hectares of forests in Kalimantan and
Sumatera are now moribund due to the overlogging by forest
concession holders, the minister was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the forests would become desert lands if
reforestation is not carried out immediately.
</P>
<P>
While the World Bank is expected to provide the lion's share of
the reforestationfunds, Ismail said he would visit donor countries
such as Japan and the United States next month to seek help.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, President Abdurrahman Wahid Monday called for
joint efforts to preserve the country's coral reefs which have
been ravaged by overfishing and dredging.
</P>
<P>
In a campaign to protect the country's maritime resources, the
president said 68 percent of Indonesia's coral reefs are badly
damaged and that only 6 percent now remains in its natural state.
</P>
<P>
"We must make an effort to protect our coral reefs," the
president was quoted by the Indonesian Observer as saying.

<HEADLINE> Italian Red Tape Scares Off Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy's red tape has scared off
most foreign investment into the country, a study by the Business
International Institute said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about what was the number one thing
the government should do to attract foreign investment, foreign
multinational companies in Italy agreed the Italian government
needed to pare back bureaucratic and administrative procedures.
</P>
<P>
A good 45.2 percent of those questioned saw red tape as the
most urgent problem when it comes to trying to do business in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Tax breaks were seen as the next most important thing and cost
of labor came in third.
</P>
<P>
Foreign managers also asked for greater security and wanted to
see more infrastructures, financial incentives, research and
innovation.
</P>
<P>
"Italy attracts scant foreign investment," said Elido Fazi,
director general of Business International.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, Italy attracted only 1 percent of incoming foreign
investments. The United Kingdom attracted 24 times more," Fazi
reported.
</P>
<P>
Red tape not only curbs investment but fuels the danger that
companies will transfer their business abroad, Fazi added.

BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign businesses will be
allowed to prospect for minerals in China, the English-language

</P>
<P>
The businesses should be foreign-invested joint ventures or
cooperative companies, foreign working bodies or foreign
representative offices that have officially registered with China'

</P>
<P>
They must have licenses to operate in the country, according to

The policy is a "big event in the introduction of foreign funds
into China's prospecting of mineral resources," Zhong Weizhi,
director of the Geographical Prospecting Department, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, China banned foreign businesses from prospecting or
qualifying as geological prospectors in the country.
</P>
<P>
To carry out their businesses in China, foreign investors had
to depend on local geographic departments and leave them the
actual leadership of field work.

<HEADLINE> Beckham to Play for England  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- David Beckham will definitely
play for England against Argentins, despite being dropped by
Manchester United in a key English premier league game against
Leeds United on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC reports on Monday, English manager Kevin
Keegan shrugged off suggestions that the midfielder would be in
the wrong frame of mind for Wednesday's friendly at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
Beckham has been dogged by reports of a training ground bust-up
with his manager Sir Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
"There was absolutely no problem with David," said Keegan after
the squad met up at their Bisham Abbey headquarters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"He trained this morning, and I think he was just glad to get
out on to a pitch and train. He's always enjoyed his training.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened at the weekend, so I'm not going to
comment. But as far as I am concerned he's going to play on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"From a purely selfish point of view, because he didn't play on
Sunday he couldn't get injured.
</P>
<P>
"It's a Manchester United thing. It's between Alex Ferguson and
David Beckham, and as far as I am concerned he's in the right
frame of mind to play for England and will play, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happens at Manchester United training
sessions but he trains well with us and he's always on time for
his meals,"he said.
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry about David Beckham - he will be all right," added
the manager.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson dropped the 24-year-old for Sunday's victory at Leeds -
reportedly because he missed training on Friday to look after his
ill son.
</P>
<P>
Keegan could be just the man to settle the United star, who is
reported to be "furious" at his treatment by Ferguson and the
threat of a 50,000 pounds fine.
</P>
<P>
Keegan is famed for his man-management techniques and the break
from Old Trafford will give both men the chance to cool off.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Beckham and his Spice Girl wife, Victoria,
said his absence from United training was a direct result of his
baby Brooklyn suffering from gastro-enteritis.
</P>
<P>
Caroline McAteer, of Outside Organisation, said: "Brooklyn was
coughing and being sick on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"He was quite bad in the middle of the night. The doctor was
called out and said he has a touch of gastro-enteritis."
</P>
<P>
But more than one newspaper has noted that the illness which
prevented Beckham from training did not stop Victoria from
attending the finale of London Fashion Week.

<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Sunderland is no longer the
only side in the English Premiership without a nickname after the
club styled itself the Black Cats.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken following a poll of fans, with 48% of
the 10,000 votes cast in favour of the new name. In second place
was the Mackems, with 37%.
</P>
<P>
The new nickname is derived from a battery of guns set at the
mouth of the River Wear in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
The club was formerly known as the Rokerites, after its old
ground at Roker Park.
</P>
<P>
But it has been without a nickname since moving to the Stadium
of Light in 1997.
</P>

been counted and a clear winner identified, the Black Cats will be
established as the official Sunderland nickname."

<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Chelsea star Celestine Babayaro, missing since the end of the
African Cup of Nations, is trapped in the north of Nigeria,
according to local reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The player failed to return to his Premiership side after
Nigeria's controversial defeat on penalties to Cameroon in the
final of the competition eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
Babayaro was named in the Chelsea squad to face Gillingham in
their FA Cup quarter-final last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His failure to show up prompted the club to say that it planned
to contact FIFA in a bid to track the wayward left-back down.
</P>
<P>
A man described as the 21-year-old's "guardian", Alhaji Sabo
Babayaro, said: "He has been in Kaduna resting his groin injury.
</P>
<P>
"He was supposed to leave Kaduna for Lagos today on his way
back to London, but as I speak to you now there is a civil
disturbance in the city over Sharia so Celestine is trapped."
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations have been held in the city against the
imposition of strict Islamic "Sharia" law.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Chelsea nor the NFA have contacted Celestine about his
whereabouts," said Alhaji Sabo Babayaro, adding that both Chelsea
and the Nigerian Football Association had the player's home number
in Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
The NFA had also been searching for Babayaro in the hope that
he could represent Nigeria's under-23 squad in its Olympic
qualification match against Uganda at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Two other members of the Super Eagles team - Kanu of Arsenal
and AC Milan defender Taribo West - have also made no contact with

When asked about Merson's announcement at a press conference on
Monday, Keegan said: "That's his right. I respect that, and he
knows what he wants to do.
</P>
<P>
"But he's playing really well, and my message to him is to put
another three months on to that - I think that would suit Aston
Villa fans and John Gregory - and don't close the door on yourself.
"
</P>
<P>
Leicester boss Martin O'Neill has asked Keegan not to play
Emile Heskey, fearing an injury before Sunday's Worthington Cup
final.
</P>
<P>
But the England boss said he may still decide to use the
striker.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "From a Leicester City point of view they have had
so many injuries that the worst thing in the world would be for
Emile Heskey to play for England and pick up an injury that would
keep him out of the Leicester side.
</P>
<P>
"But you could argue there's a lot of clubs that have big
matches this weekend, and if I think it's right to play him I'll
play him," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Former England manager Glenn
Hoddle has launched an attack on the Football Association chiefs
who sacked him from the position last year.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle, who recently returned to the game as temporary boss of
Southampton, blamed weak management.
</P>
<P>
The former Spurs and England star, also criticised for his use
of a faith healer to help injured players, then claimed that other
former England bosses Bobby Robson and Kevin Keegan had also
visited a healer.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle, whose departure came amid a furore over his
controversial comments on disabled people, said: "There was a
temporary chairman (Geoff Thompson), temporary chief executive (
David Davies) - there were other agendas going on.
</P>
<P>
"If Keith (Wiseman) and Graham (Kelly) had been there I might
still have been in the job now.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to work for people that on something so small
like this they were trying to get me out of a job.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is if you had strong management it wouldn't
have been a problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't stab me in the back; all they showed was not
strong management."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle then defended his use of faith healers, saying: "I've
seen how players got healed and how they got over injuries much
more quickly with healers.
</P>
<P>
"Bobby Robson used a healer in 1990 for the World Cup, and I
think Kevin Keegan's been to a healer when he was at Southampton,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Regional Summit Calls for Peace, Stability in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The one-day regional summit on
Burundi peace process ended in Arusha, Tanzania, Monday evening
with a call to the people of Burundi to show commitment and
determination in working for total peace and stability in their
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued at the end of the summit, the
regional leaders noted with regret that the security situation in
Burundi is deteriorating further as fighting still continues,
claiming the lives of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
They called on the government of Burundi to disband all
regroupment camps as agreed at a previous summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by heads of state from Uganda, Tanzania,
Kenya, Burundi, Mozambique and South Africa, was satisfied that
Nelson Mandela, as the new facilitator of the peace process in
Burundi, had done a commendable job within a short time.
</P>
<P>
The participants reiterated their firm position that there is
no alternative to a negotiated settlement, urging the parties
concerned to take the interests of the Burundi nation at heart and
reach a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the summit in his capacity as chairman of the Arusha
 Initiative on the Burundi Peace Initiative, Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni equated the conflict in Burundi to the colonial
era where tricks of divide and rule were employed to cause chaos
among Africans.
</P>
<P>
Such tricks promoted parochialism, sectarianism and poor
leadership, a situation similar to the one presently prevailing in
Burundi, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Mandela blamed the escalation of the conflict
on a lack of will to compromise among all the groups concerned.
This lack of will led to continued fighting which was held
responsible for loss of so many innocent lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit also paid tribute to late Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere for his efforts made for peace not only in Burundi but
also on the entire continent of Africa.

LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people are feared to
have been killed in clashes on Monday between Christians and
Muslims in Kaduna, capital of Nigeria's northern Kaduna State.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from the Kaduna said the violence flared
following a march by Christians protesting against the proposed
introduction of Islamic law Sharia in the state.

quickly degenerated into fighting. The main Kaduna market was set
on fire.

The authorities have imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Kaduna
and police are patrolling in armoured vehicles, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to State Governor Stephen Shekari, anybody found on

TEHRAN -- Iranian reformists on Tuesday claimed a landslide
victory in last Friday's crucial parliamentary poll by having won
109 seats in the 290-member Parliament as vote counting continues.
</P>
<P>
Of the 191 parliamentarians already elected, 109 are candidates
of the reformist Islamic Iran Participation (IIPF), Mohammed Reza
Khatami, younger brother of the moderate President Mohammed
Khatami, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the "May 23 Front" formed by the IIPF and other
reformist and centralist groups in support of the president have
won 137 out of the 191 seats while the conservatives have only
occupied 39 and the remaining 15 have been occupied by
independents. (Iran-Reformist-Polling)

talks, a clear-cut Israeli promise to hold serious and intensive
talks with a view to reaching a final agreement by the previously-

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Poll Results Reflect Desire for Reforms in Iran by Liu Guoyuan, Rong Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The emerging victory of
reformists over conservatives in Iran's 6th election of Majlis
(parliament) is an apparent reflection of the prevailing desire for
reforms toward more freedom, more democracy and, above all, a
better life in the Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
Although it still takes days to know the final results of the
parliamentary poll, the initial results demonstrate the reformist
Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) has won 109 out of the 191
seats determined for the expanded 290-seat Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The "May 23 Front," a reformist coalition with centralists,
which includes IIPF, has already gained 137 seats while the
conservatives has got only 39, the initial results also indicate.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian people first expressed their desire for changes in
May 1997 by standing behind Mohammad Khatami, an isolated leftist
minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, against Majlis Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, a prominent figure from the powerful
conservative camp.
</P>
<P>
Since he came to power, President Khatami has upheld the slogan
of political reforms and launched a broad series of social and
cultural opening measures, including encouragement of free speech,
free press and free assemblies, to lessen restrictions long imposed
on Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, the moderate president initiated a foreign
policy of detente to ease the tensions with the outside world. The
policy broke effectively the isolation Iran had suffered since the
1979 Islamic revolution and strengthened its role in regional and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, the powerful conservatives, who have dominated the
Iranian political arena for a decade, sensed a threat from the
political reforms to the Islamic system and values. They spared no
efforts to contain Khatami's reform plans as they were in control
of the country's important organs.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives sought to prohibit the installation of
satellite dishes, close newspapers and arrest pressmen on the
charge of insulting the Islamic values, among other things.
</P>
<P>
During the week ahead of the Friday polling, tens of thousands
of feverish students participated in gatherings and demonstrations
to express their support for Khatami and reformists.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis polling, which was attended by about 5,700 candidates
and over 30 million voters, have been viewed by most analysts as a
referendum of the people on President Khatami's reform policies.
And the initial results have shown that people stand by their
president.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say reformers may finally get 75 percent of the total
seats in the new parliament, an absolute majority which can help
them push through Khatami's reform policies.
</P>
<P>
However, the reformist control of the parliament is not the sole
condition for real changes to take place in the Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
It is true that the Majlis is a powerful institution, but there
are other institutions such as the Council of Guardians and the
State Expediency Council which have their own role in framing the
policy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the reformist camp itself may lack the real unity to
push through their plans.
</P>
<P>
"On the face of it, a large number of candidates professed to be
Khatami's supporters in order to be elected and there is no
guarantee that they will remain faithful to him," the Iran News
daily said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The centrists within the reformist camp, who are strong
supporters of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, have clearly
stated their emphasis on economic issues to differentiate
themselves from other reformers, who attach more importance to
political development.
</P>
<P>
Many observers believe a triangle power balance may emerge in
the new Majlis after it officially kicks off works in June.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Refutes U.S. Claims of Iraq Being Isolated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz on Tuesday dismissed claims by U.S. officials that Iraq
is isolated by the world community, saying Iraq is just outside of
the "American club."
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I ridicule the statement made by American officials
that Iraq is isolated by the international community. Iraq is not
outside of the international community, Iraq is outside of the
'American club,'" Aziz told an academic symposium attended by a
French delegation of politicians and academics.
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between the 'American club' and the
international community, and I think the presence of French
academics in Baghdad is one of the examples that Iraq is in the
heart of the international community," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The French delegation, led by Michel Grimard, head of a
Christian movement, arrived here on Saturday on a fact-finding
mission to see the impact of the U.N. sanctions on the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the international community has witnessed mounting
calls for lifting the sanctions off Iraq, and even 70 U.S.
congressmen have urged the U.S. administration to free Iraq from
the embargo.
</P>
<P>
He added there is no legitimate basis to continue the sanctions,
which he said have amounted to the level of genocide.
</P>
<P>
Aziz slammed what he called "the hypocrisy of the American
policy," citing the holding of Iraqi contracts by the U.S. and
British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee, or the 661
committee.
</P>
<P>
"(U.S. Secretary of State) Albright says that 'we care about the
Iraqi people more than the Iraqi government,' but her
representative at the 661 committee puts on hold all the contracts
that will help the Iraqi people have better electricity, better
clean water, better sewage system, better schools, better
hospitals..." he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain are setting obstacles to the implementation
of the oil-for-food program, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Every day, there is deliberate attempt by the American
administration and its ally the British government to undermine
this program which was their creation in 1995."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British delegates at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the implementation of the oil-
for-food program by deliberately blocking the approval of Iraqi
contracts concluded with foreign companies for the purchases of
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian program, now in its seventh phase, allows Iraq
to sell oil and use the revenue to buy food, medicine and
infrastructure-related materials for its people who have been
severely hit by the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Still Demands Pinochet Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After examining a confidential medical report received from
London last week, the Swiss authorities said that they still
wanted Pinochet extradited, stressing that the medical report
contained no significantly new information.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman, Folco Galli, was quoted as saying that Britain's
conclusion that Pinochet is too ill to be extradited was known
beforehand, adding that Switzerland does not consider ill health
as sufficient grounds to turn down an extradition request.
</P>
<P>
The medical report was released by Britain last week after a
High Court order to make it available to those countries which had
asked for Pinochet's extradition. Switzerland, Spain, France and
Belgium, had until today to make their positions on the report
known to London.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is seeking the general's extradition in connection
with the disappearance of a dual Swiss-Chilean citizen, Alexis
Jaccard, in Argentina in 1977. Spain wants Pinochet to answer
charges of torture and human rights abuses relating to his time in
power in the 1970s and 80s.

<HEADLINE> Greece Voices Concern Over Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday voiced once
again its concern over the deteriorating situation in the Yugoslav
province of Kososo, which has seen rising violence between NATO-
led peacekeepers, ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said that Greece
wished the development of a multiethnic community, with full
respect for the human rights of all those living in Kosovo, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis
Tuesday also accused the Western countries of implementing the
failed policies in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The costs of the policies implemented in Kosovo were not taken
into consideration by those that bear responsibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
The speaker stated that the cost was borne by the people of the
region and neighboring countries, but those with primary
responsibility were far away and were limited to promises made at
no expense.
</P>
<P>
As a NATO member, Greece also participates in the peacekeeping
force in Kosovo, with a strong battalion of 1,200 soldiers being
stationed in Urosevac and Kosovo Polje in the province's south,
but a Greek company of 120 men has been ordered to rush to the
northern city of Mitrovica where two French soldiers were wounded
and one ethnic Albanian sniper died in a recent gunfight.
</P>
<P>
So far, several Greek soldiers have lost their lives in
accidents in Kosovo.

"We'll be able to sum up the final results of the operation
shortly," he told reporters in Volgograd Tuesday, praising the
servicemen's performance in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"Very few expected the Russian servicemen, armed forces and
interior troops to act so precisely and professionally, and to
fulfill the tasks set by the political leadership with such
courage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to convey our profound gratitude to them for
this," Putin said on the eve of the Day of Defenders of the
Fatherland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian federal forces have imposed a ban on the
movement of people and vehicles throughout Chechnya through
February 24 amid threats of Chechen terrorist acts around February
23, the 55th anniversary of the mass deportation of ethnic
Chechens to Central Asia during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
"This is a temporary measure to prevent possible terrorist acts
by Chechen militants," the Interfax news agency reported, citing
the press service for the Russian envoy to Chechnya, Deputy Prime
Minister Nikolai Koshman.
</P>
<P>
Security has also been heightened in Moscow and other main
cities and key installations around Russia.
</P>
<P>
Fighting continued Tuesday in the southern mountainous regions
of Chechnya, and there were unconfirmed reports that several
members of a Russian border guard squad were killed when a large
group of Chechen rebels tried to break into neighboring Georgia,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Two wounded Russians were evacuated under sniper fire from the
battlefield near Omi-Chu village near Chechnya's Argun gorge.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult now to establish the exact losses. All
measures are being taken to aid the wounded," Interfax quoted a
spokesman for the North Caucasus border guard unit as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Chechens were attempting to evacuate a number of rebel
leaders, including President Aslan Maskhadov and senior commander
Shamil Basayev, out of the embattled republic, Interfax said,
citing military sources.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports that three federal helicopters went
down in Chechnya in the past two days.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economists Revise Up Growth Estimates for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. business economists
revised up Tuesday their estimates of economic growth for 2000,
saying that the Federal Reserve needs to tighten further its
monetary policy to get the economy to slow measurably.
</P>
<P>
The National Association for Business Economics (NABE)
predicted in its latest economic outlook that the gross domestic
product (GDP), the nation's total economic output, would slow
slightly to 3.8 percent this year, after three straight years of
growth at 4 percent or higher. But the group's forecast of 3.8
percent GDP growth this year reflected an upward revision from a
November survey which had projected a 3.2 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
For 2001, the NABE projected the U.S. economy will grow by 3
percent, which would be the slowest annual growth rate since a 2.7
percent increase in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The economists said the slowdown will be the work of the
Federal Reserve, which has already raised interest rates four
times since June in an effort to keep inflation from getting out
of hand. The latest increase occurred on February 2, a quarter-
point move that left the federal funds rate at 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NABE expected the Federal Reserve's funds rate target to be
increased by 0.5 percentage point more this year, and believed
that this rise in rates will be adequate to bring GDP growth down
to a sustainable rate before year-end.
</P>
<P>
The economic strength this year will keep the unemployment rate
hovering around the current 40-year low of 4 percent. The group
forecast an average jobless rate this year of 4.1 percent, even
better than last year's average of 4.2 percent. But the slower
growth will see the jobless rate start to creep up in 2001, rising
to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent surge in oil prices, inflation was forecast
to remain contained with consumer prices rising by just 2.5
percent this year, compared to a 2.6 percent increase last year,
when measured from the fourth quarter. The CPI was forecast to be
up just 2.6 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The business group pinpointed a sudden plunge in the high-
flying stock market as the greatest threat to the expansion with
20 percent of those surveyed ranking a "stock market bubble" as
the economy's most serious problem, double the percentage citing
this threat last year.

<HEADLINE> Belgium's Post Office to be Privatized Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government said
Tuesday the country's state post office, La Poste, will become a
privately-held company from the beginning of March.
</P>
<P>
"This makes La Poste very much like a normal company," said
Elke Jeurissen, spokeswoman for Belgium's Telecommunications and
Privatizations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The privatized postal service company will have assets of 28
billion Belgian francs (696.3 million U.S. dollars) and a
workforce of some 42,000, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures, partnerships and a flotation could all be
considered in the future for postal service privatization,
Jeurissen said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a type of company that is much clear to the market if,
for example, you want to split the company into different units
and look for partners... you can do so," she said, adding a
partner for the whole company was also possible.
</P>
<P>
The government took the step to boost competition for postal
service. "This widens the possibilities of the company in a free
market," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"The market plan has to be finalized by the end of March. It is
really a strategic, operational plan on an organizational and
financial level, concerning structures and so on," she said.
</P>
<P>
Jeurissen also cited domestic mail, courier express services
and e-commerce as business areas where joint ventures might be
undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Under a European Union (EU) law, EU member countries were to
have liberalized by the beginning of February express mail and
post items weighing more than 350 grams to full competition. The
bulk of the postal services business is still controlled by
national monopolies EU-wide.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt's government has said
state debt could be further reduced through the proceeds arising
from selling state-owned businesses.

<HEADLINE> Greece Announces New Measures Against Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The measures, which was announced by Greek Interior Minister
Vaso Papandreou and Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysohoidis,
includes the granting of more responsibilities and resources to
800 municipal authorities, the hiring of 5,100 permanent and
seasonal forest firefighters, the purchase of two new Canadair-
type aircraft and seven fire-fighting helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The new measures will be introduced after the April 9 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
State agencies working in the area of forest fire prevention
and forest protection started their seasonal preparations two
months earlier than they did last year, in an effort to reach
higher levels of preparedness.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Greece has taken a series of effective
measures as part of its efforts to prevent and fight against
forest fires in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there was a record low for the last 25 years in the
area of forest land destroyed by fires.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires reportedly destroyed 19,500 hectares less forest
land and pasture than the previous year, although there was an
increase in the number of fires.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Buy More Patrol Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Panama needs to increase
its patrol fleet after the U.S. troops left the country, to deal
with the drug-trafficking airplanes, director of the National
Airspace Service (NAS) Maximo Carrizo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Carrizo, Panama only has four helicopters and
three airplanes to patrol its airspace, so the country is planning
to buy at least 10 airplanes from Canada, the United States,
Brazil, Spain or France.
</P>
<P>
"We already have an amount to buy equipment and repair
equipment, to increase the air fleet by two or three helicopters
within the next eight weeks," Carrizo said.
</P>
<P>
The NAS director also said that the drug-trafficking airplanes
using the Panamanian airspace come from Colombia en route to
Central America where drug is transported to the United States by
land.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Justice Minister Winston Spadafora recently sent to
the United States a list of things needed by the country for the
drugs traffic fight, that could be solved with what Washington has
on sight to give Colombia and the neighboring nations.

<HEADLINE> Fight for German CDU Leadership Becomes White-hot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 22 (Xinhua) --The rivalry for the leadership
in Germany's Christian Democratic Union CDU heated up Tuesday as
the contenders launched first prudent attacks in the run-up to the
election of a new chairman in April.
</P>
<P>
"The battle to become CDU helmsman is getting harsher," said
the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
</P>
<P>
There are two main candidates seeking for the position as new
chairman of CDU, neither has formally declared they are running
for the post.
</P>
<P>
57-year-old Volker Ruehe, the former German defense minister
and CDU secretary general, appears to be the choice of party
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Another candidate is 45-year-old Angela Merkel, an eastern
German physicist and the former environment minister under Helmut
Kohl. Merkel has been the secretary general of CDU since 1998
after the election defeat of Kohl. She is favored by moderates and
younger party members.
</P>
<P>
The CDU is the Germany's main opposition party and is recently
reeling under a finance scandal which has included secret bank
accounts, undeclared donations and million of marks gone missing.
</P>
<P>
The former chairman of CDU Kohl faces a criminal probe after
admitting he took over one million dollars in undeclared donations.
His successor Wolfgang Schaeuble announced he was resigning last
week over a 100000 marks (50500 dollar) cash donation from an arms
dealer.
</P>
<P>
So far Merkel and Ruehe had been racing to control favorable
position but avoided naming each other or mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
But all this changed Tuesday when Ruehe said to a B.Z.
newspaper: "(It can be questioned) if someone who was secretary
general for two years like myself or served as Kohl's deputy for
eight years was closer to the system."
</P>
<P>
Ruehe has denied knowing about the CDU's slush funds and Swiss
bank accounts despite holding the secretary general post under
Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Merkel denied also a report of the Bild that she would refuse
to serve under Thuringia's CDU Prime Minister Bernhard Vogel and
North Rhine-Westphalia state CDU leader Juegern Ruettgers. Both
men have been named as possible candidates for the CDU leadership.
</P>
<P>
There are still big hurdles for Merkel and Ruehe before the
party elects a new chairman at a convention on April 9-11 in Essen.
</P>
<P>
At present Ruehe faces a crucial test in Schleswig-Holstein
state elections this Sunday where he is running as the CDU
candidate against the present Prime Minister Heide Simonis (SPD)
who is a Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's trusted follower.
</P>
<P>
Before the scandal of donation was exposed last November Ruehe
had been leading in the opinion polls. But the financial scandal
of CDU seriously disrupted his election campaign. According to the
polls he falls behind Simonis by nearly 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
For Merkel the most important is to overcome fears among
conservatives members of the CDU. It is very difficult for a woman
to lead a still male-dominated and socially conservative party in
Germany.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Needs to Build up Skilled Work Force: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa needs to
build up a strong skilled labor force so as to ensure its economic
growth, Jos Gerson, chief economist of Merrill Lynch, an
international conglomerate, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's long-term economic prosperity hinges largely on
the speed at which it is able to expand its skilled work force, he
told the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.
</P>
<P>
According to the economist, South Africa should take action to
rectify the shortfall of skilled work force in three key areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Launching an intensive education program, especially for
the majority of the people;
</P>
<P>
-- Heightening efforts on the crime front with a view to
stemming skills emigration and,
</P>
<P>
-- Urgently revising a national immigration and work permit
policy that " turned away skilled foreigners who wished to live
and work in South Africa."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Reactivate Safety Task Team Against Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) --The South African
government will reactivate the rural safety task team set up two
years ago to curb farm killings in the country, official sources
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to presidential aide Parks Mankahlana, the decision
was made at a meeting earlier in the day between President Thabo
Mbeki and agricultural leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The main aim of the meeting was to promote greater
co-ordination between the government and the agricultural sector,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rural safety task team spokesman Superintendent
Martin Aylward said that "the team will now function as a priority
committee within police structures."
</P>
<P>
"It will comprise representatives from the agricultural sector,
the defense force, the police and other parties concerned,"he
said.
</P>
<P>
The rural task force was established in 1998 at an anti-crime
meeting in South Africa to coordinate efforts to stem criminal
attacks on farmers.
</P>
<P>
The decision to reactivate the team followed a spate of farm
killings since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Superintendent Johan Strauss of the Crime and
Information Analysis Centre, nine people were killed in six
attacks during last week alone.
</P>
<P>
The number of farm attacks has risen to 72 a month, said an
agricultural union in an open letter to Mbeki on Tuesday, adding
that an average of 14 farmers were being murdered per month.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that you and your government come clear about the
crime situation. Failure to do so will be construed as a
condonation of farm attacks and murders," the union said in the
letter.

<HEADLINE> IRA Denies Disarmament Offer Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army
Tuesday denied reports that it would be prepared to start
disarming in return for a scaling down of the British military
presence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
A senior IRA source told the BBC that it had also ruled out a
time-frame for handing in its weapons and was not interested in
what has been described as a 'day of reconciliation' with the
British forces.
</P>
<P>
The briefing followed widespread media speculation about moves
try to break the current deadlock in the Northern Ireland peace
process.
</P>
<P>
It also indicates a hardening of attitudes in the republican
movement against the prospect of disarmament in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The IRA's proposals for dealing with the arms issue were put to
General de Chastelain's International Decommissioning Commission
on the day the political institutions were suspended and have
since been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The IRA source said there was no linkage to demilitarization by
British forces in Northern Ireland, no time-frame and that notions
about a decommissioning gesture were also wrong.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to media speculation that the IRA were prepared
to make a declaration in three months' time that the war was over,
and that they would also make a gesture of disarmament in the
context of a so-called national day of reconciliation, when all of
those involved in the conflict would put weapons beyond use.
</P>
<P>
The source did not spell out what the IRA had offered in its
statement to the decommissioning body, which was passed on to the
British and Irish governments in an attempt to halt the suspension
of the assembly on 11 February.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated that the IRA would or consider decommissioning
only after the political process in Northern Ireland was working
and after there was a change in the security situation in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for paramilitary decommissioning contained in the
Good Friday Agreement which led to the establishment of Northern
Ireland's power-sharing executive in December, was May 2000.
</P>
<P>
But the context of the IRA's suggestion for "putting weapons
beyond use" is understood to stretch beyond May of this year and
involve other methods for dealing with the weapons issue than are
outlined in current legislation.
</P>
<P>
The IRA briefing came after the British government ruled out
any possibility of the Army taking part in a "guns swap" with
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday urged African leaders to make efforts to put an end to the
civil war in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In a speech beamed via satellite to peace negotiators in
Tanzania, Clinton said the United States supports efforts to
resolve the civil war in Burundi, where fighting between Hutu
rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army has last several years.
</P>
<P>
"It requires courage for these leaders to accept the risks of
peacemaking. The courageous and brave thing to do is to find
reconciliation and to give everyone a role to play in Burundi's
future," said Clinton, who made the speech at the invitation of
former South African president Nelson Mandela, who took over last
month as mediator for talks on peaceful settlement of the Burundi
's civil war. The Talks had lasted for 20 months by August last
year and then stalled after the previous mediator, former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere became too ill to continue. He
died of leukemia in October.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, six African heads of state converged on Arusha to
hear Mandela's assessment of the progress of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised that the United States would do "all it can"
to help the negotiations succeed.

<HEADLINE> Four Countries Challenge Pinochet's Medical Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua)-- British Home Secretary Jack
Straw is on Tuesday under renewed pressure to extradite former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet after four countries challenged
Britain's medical evidence declaring the retired general unfit for
trial.
</P>
<P>
France, Switzerland, Belgium and Spain have lodged last-minute
challenges to the medical report, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
France is calling for a new medical examination after Straw
said last month that the evidence led him to be "minded" not to
extradite the general, who is accused of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has called for extradition proceedings to go ahead,
whatever state of health the 84-year-old is in.
</P>
<P>
Belgian judge Damien Vandermeersch has told Straw he considers
Pinochet fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
And Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose initial extradition
request led to the general's arrest in London in 1998, has
reportedly asked Britain for permission to carry out a fresh
medical examination after Spanish doctors said the report showed
the general was fit enough to be tried.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said Straw would now be
considering the submissions before making a final decision - which
may well not come before next week.
</P>
<P>
That announcement could in turn give rise to fresh legal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
It is extremely unlikely that the general will agree to undergo
any further medical tests at the request of the other states and
the home secretary has no power to order him to submit to an
examination.
</P>
<P>
The medical report was released last week to the four countries
seeking the general's extradition, after a British High Court
overturned Straw's decision to keep its contents secret.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pinochet supporters say he is too frail to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the report, leaked to Spanish newspapers within hours
of the court order to release it, revealed that the medical
experts had found evidence of "extensive brain damage" in the
general, linked to a series of strokes.
</P>
<P>
The general was suffering from memory loss and had difficulties
expressing himself and understanding complicated phrases, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Rebound But Tech Stocks Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Blue chip stocks on Wall
Street rebounded Tuesday from a steep falling in the previous
session but the technology shares fell again.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session today, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 85.32 at 10,304.84. The blue chip index fell as much as 115
points early in the session.
</P>
<P>
The broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index rose 6.08 at 1,352.17 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 29.62 at 4,382.12.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell early in the day after William McDonough,
president of the New York Federal Reserve, said the Federal would
likely raise interest rates to cool off the U.S. economy. The
index gained ground in afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned last week
that the rates would be raised to fight off the building-up of
inflation which, he said, remains a threat to the economy. The
warning dragged the Dow index 295 points lower and the Nasdaq
index down 137 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite continued to fall on concerns about higher
rates today. The sentiment on the rates hurt the big names
including Intel and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE rose 3.45 at 590.12 and the American Stock Exchange
index rose 2.50 at 934.46. But the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies fell 4.74 at 540.95.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange with 1,681 down, 1,390 up and 444 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 971.03 million shares from 1.03 billion
in the previous session.

LOS ANGELES, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A new study shows that
Americans spent an average 21 hours online at work last month --
more than twice the amount they did at home.
</P>
<P>
This is partly because their employers offered faster

had nothing to do with work. The most popular site both at home
and at work was eBay, an auction site offering everything from
Beanie Babies to limousines.
</P>
<P>
Visits to adult Internet sites declined during office hours,
according to the survey. About 12 percent of users accessed
pornographic sites at work, compared to 23 percent at home.

<P>
Many employees may not be aware that an increasing number of
companies are monitoring their mouse clicks. Seeking a way to
eliminate Internet abuse, in fact, some companies in the United
States are using software to filter out gambling and adult sites.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Tighter Mining Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
said Tuesday the cyanide spill that had killed tons of fish in
central European rivers prompted the urgent need for stricter
controls in the European mining industry.
</P>
<P>
The group for environmental protection said the accident at a
gold mine in Baia Mare, Romania, was "not only predictable, but
preventable," and that it was due to improper planning and waste
disposal facilities.
</P>
<P>
The cyanide was used to separate gold from ore extracted by the
mine. The spill accident which happened in January 30 was
triggered when the earthen walls of a reservoir owned by the gold
mine washed away in a downpour, sending cyanide-laced water into a
nearby creek, and later into the Tisza River.
</P>
<P>
The WWF's European Policy Office director, Tony Long, said at a
new briefing that the mining industry must set up systems of waste
storage that "don't devastate the environment with predictable and
unnecessary regularity."
</P>
<P>
The WWF also said current technology was capable of eliminating,
or substantially reducing most of the environmental impacts of
mining.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner for environment Margot Wallstroem has
said the European Union had to consider tighter environmental
regulation for the mining industry. She visited the contaminated
area in central Europe last week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Repeats Offer of Dialogue With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON. February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
made a gesture for unconditional dialogue with Iran at the time
when a newly elected Iranian parliament is prepared to hold its
first session.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin, welcoming the Iranian
parliamentary elections last Friday, hoped the newly elected
reformist members of parliament would lead to rapprochement
between the two nations after more than 20 years of hostility.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States was prepared for a dialogue in which
both sides bring their concerns to the table -- in essence the
same unconditional dialogue Washington has been offering since
Iranians elected President Mohammad Khatami in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rubin repeated the list of issues that the United States would
put at the top of its agenda in any dialogue with Iran -- Iran's
opposition to the Middle East peace process, nuclear programs and
so-called support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has flatly rejected all the allegations
imposed upon by Washington and demanded an end to economic
sanctions and unfreeze Iranian assets frozen after the 1979
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Rubin cautioned that any change in relations with Iran would
take time and the United States would watch "very closely"
developments the Iran parliament could bring about.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow these developments very closely and make any
appropriate responses based on what we think will best promote the
prospect for dealing with our concerns and dealing with Iran's
potential role in the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Teheran, newly elected parliamentary members, whom
Washington sees as pro-West reformists, said at a news conference
Tuesday that their victory should not be seen as evidence Iran had
set aside revolutionary principles to please the West -- in
particular the United States.
</P>
<P>
"In the past the United States supported one of the most
repressive regimes in history, which was the Shah's regime," said
Mohammad Reza Khatami, leader of the Islamic Iran Participation
Front.
</P>
<P>
"Now we still face hostile sanctions and allegations (of
support for terrorism) against us that are unproven. There is a
better tone but no practical steps to pull down the wall of
mistrust," Khatami said.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Opens Seminar on Technology Opportunities in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 Canadian
technology companies were seeking cooperative opportunities with
China at a day-long seminar opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Participants showed high interest and confidence in the vast
market potential for high-tech development in China, a country of
1.2 billion people with a fastest economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Denis Colbourne, president of DC-Technologies Ltd., told the
seminar about success of Notel Networks Corp. in China, saying
that Canada's high-tech giant has earned an annual billion U.S.
dollars in revenue in China.
</P>
<P>
Colbourne, who used to be Chairman of Shanghai Nortel
Semiconductor Corporation, believed that Notel's 28 years in China
showed "opportunities are very real" and that Canadian companies
are determined to succeed in China.
</P>
<P>
Mario Poirier, general manager and chief technology of M3i
Systems, discussed his experience in doing business in China. He
described China as a trust-worthy country, although he also noted
differences may need "patience" for Canadian companies in business
deals.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, among others, introduced a number of technology
events and functions to be held in China in the year 2000,
including the 4th China International Electronic Commerce Summit
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Mei Ping was present at the seminar, where
Chinese officials reported on China's technology programs and
demand for cooperation with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says It May Arrest Cuban Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Saturday, the U.S. State Department summoned the acting
chief of the Cuban interest section in Washington and requested
the withdrawal of a diplomat in the section within seven days,
charging him of spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cuban government rejected the charges and said it
would not withdraw the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"Should this diplomat fail to depart the United States by that
time, he will no longer enjoy the privileges and immunities
conferred by the Vienna Convention ... and will become subject to
the laws of the United States," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. side has informed the Cuban government
that the diplomat has now been declared "persona non grata" and is
ordered to depart the United States territory no later than 1:30 p.
m.Eastern Standard Time next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the Cuban government will abide by standard
diplomatic practice, as outlined in the Vienna Convention, and
that the diplomat in question will depart the United States by the
deadline," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Should this diplomat fail to depart the United States by that
time, he will no longer enjoy the privileges and immunities
conferred by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and
will become subject to the laws of the United States. We will no
longer recognize his authority to perform functions in the United
States for the Cuban government," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the diplomat will be arrested, Rubin said, "He would
be subject to our laws, and if there were grounds for his arrest,
he would be arrested."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has imposed an embargo against Cuba for decades and
the two countries have been in a dispute over the custody of a six-
year Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, who was brought to the United
States by illegal immigrants.
