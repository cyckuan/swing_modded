<HEADLINE> Opening of Thailand-Cambodia Border Checkpoints  to Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The clash between Cambodian
troops and Khmer Rouge forces last weekend would postpone the
opening of any permanent checkpoint at the Thai-Cambodian border,
"The Nation" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the three permanent checkpoints, which the Thai
and Cambodian governments agreed to set up last November to
facilitate border trade, depended on the Cambodians, the paper

Thailand will start negotiations for the opening of the
checkpoints soon after the border situation returns to normal,
Vinij Krachangsonthi, commander of the first army region, was
quoted as saying on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Take Steps to Correct BOP Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today that Malaysia should take steps to
correct the country's current balance of payment (BOP) deficit,
which reached 18 billion Malaysia Ringgit (7.2 billion US dollars)
at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national economic forum on "Reducing the BOP
Deficit" here today, Mahathir said slowing down growth and
fiddling with interest rates and exchange rates were not the
solution to address the balance of payment deficit problem
affecting Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Fiddling with interest rates is a two-edged weapon," he said,
adding the solution lies in increasing exports and reducing
imports.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir called on Malaysian manufacturers to achieve economy
of scale by looking not just at the domestic market but also the
global market as well.
</P>
<P>
Apart from achieving economy of scale, manufacturing in large
quantities in products like building materials, steel, plastics,
motor vehicles, electrical appliances as well as those using local
raw materials, would stimulate support industries, minimize
imports and earn export earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the outflow of funds from Malaysians vacationing
abroad and students studying abroad, Mahathir said, domestic
tourism must be highly developed while more educational
institutions must be set up in Malaysia to counter these outflows.
</P>
<P>
On recommendations by some experts to slow down the economy to
overcome the BOP deficit, Mahathir said there was no constant
relationship between the two, adding that low growth in many
European and North American countries were accompanied by high
deficits in the BOP.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to Malaysia's trade deficit with Japan, which amounted
to 19.5 billion Ringgit (about 7.8 billion dollars), the prime
minister said it was the deficit with Japan that was causing the
negative imbalances in Malaysia's total trade.
</P>
<P>
"If the trade with Japan is corrected then there should be no
deficit in Malaysia's trade," Mahathir added.

TOKYO -- The cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
resigned en masse today, paving the way for Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) President Ryutaro Hashimoto to be named the next
premier later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Hashimoto, 58, is certain to be elected Japan's
53rd prime minister in a special parliamentary session thanks to
solid majority support from the three-party ruling coalition in
both houses of parliament. He will be the first LDP premier in
nearly two and a half years after his party lost its 38-year grip
over power in August 1993 following a series of scandals.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The blizzard that paralyzed the eastern U.S. for
the past two days could cost the nation as much as 17 billion
U.S. dollars in lost production and sales, according to an
economist.
</P>
<P>
David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington,
Massachusetts, said because of the storm, the nation could lost 10
billion dollars in lost production and 7 billion dollars in lost
sales. The storm, one of the worst in history, buried most of the
nation's eastern states with two to three feet of snow, shutting
down governments, closing businesses, canceling school classes,
blocking highways and disrupting commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW -- Russian troops blockaded the Chechen gunmen holding
at least 160 hostages in southern Russia Thursday as they expected
the overnight negotiations to end the crisis without further
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 Chechen terrorists, headed by Salman Raduyev, the
son-in-law of rebel Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed into
Kizlyar Tuesday and took 3,000 people into the city hospital as
hostages. After releasing the majority of the hostages Wednesday,
they set out in 11 buses and two trucks and then stopped for the
night in the village of Pervomaiskaya in the southern Russian
republic of Dagestan. Russian forces appeared to have halted the
rebel convoy around midday, preventing them from crossing into
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
VIENNA -- Envoys of the former warring sides in Bosnia resumed
talks here Wednesday to foster confidence and stability in Bosnia
in the wake of the signing of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The talks, under the aegis of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), began last Thursday. Hungarian
diplomat Istvan Gyarmati, who is chairing the negotiations, said
he presented to the various sides a tentative accord drafted
during the four-day break.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped recent "relatively minor violations" of the
Bosnia accord -- including rocket attacks in Sarajevo and in the
southern Bosnian town of Mostar -- would not complicate the task,
and he was confident of a successful January 26 conclusion to the
talks, as specified by the Dayton agreement.

<HEADLINE> Video Games Have Low Educational Value: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Video games have been proved
of little educational value as they are promised, an education
expert said in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kline, professor from the Simon Fraser University of
Canada, told an international meeting held in Hobart in Australia
that video games offered little help in enhancing children's
ability of learning, analysis, critique and intellectual inquiry.
</P>
<P>
There was a growing fear that video games might have even more
harmful effects because of the obsessive way children used them,
he told the Australia and New Zealand Conference on the First
Years of School.
</P>
<P>
According to results of studies carried out by the university,
video games entertain and distract children.
</P>
<P>
"Children prefer video games not because of what they learn
while playing them, but because the experience of play is more
exciting and engaging than anything else," Kline said.
</P>
<P>
Studies showed that children didn't want to play the Ms PacMan
spelling game or Math Blaster in which they can learn something,
because the games simply do not offer the emotional highs and
lows.
</P>
<P>
Kline said that video games failed to deliver the educational
value that was promised in marketing campaigns. What they offered
had little to do with improving computer literacy and skills,
making learning more fun and encouraging creativity exploration.
</P>
<P>
What attract children to video games are realistic visuals,
fantastic themes, simple and high level of player control, and
repetition.
</P>
<P>
A survey by Kline's Media Analysis Laboratory showed that more
than half of boys aged between eight and 12 played video games
more than ten hours a week.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem was made worse by new generation of
video games that can compete with television in realistic visuals.
</P>
<P>
He noted that according to data obtained by him, Australia had
similar problems as in Canada.
</P>
<P>
He said that video games were being marketed as a new
psychedelic drug. They needed fundamental changes before they
deserved a place in school, he said.

PHNOM PENH, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. military chief today
ended his two-day visit to Cambodia, with the promise of continued

HANOI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 2.5 million overseas
Vietnamese "officially" sent an estimated 700 million U.S. dollars
back home last year, giving the Vietnam economy a substantial

The amount, however, was a small proportion of what was
smuggled home in suitcases and through unofficial channels, the
English-language Vietnam News said.
</P>

Even so, large-scale investment by Vietnamese expatriates,
still lags behind official expectations and overseas Vietnamese
come 19th on the country's list of foreign investors.
</P>

Some 76 projects with Vietnamese expatriate investment got
official approval last year. About 55 projects worth a total of

BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 40,000 Thai illegal
immigrants are believed to be working in Japan and about 7,000 are

</P>
<P>
Of those Thais in Japanese prisons, about 60 percent are

workers, according to Prasit Chaithongphan, director-general of

They have been sentenced to at least six months each and are

The workers entered Japan on a tourist visa, holding forged
passports, or are smuggled into Japan by unscrupulous job
placement companies.
</P>
<P>
Most Thai people do not cooperate with the department in taking
legal action against job brokers who cheat them, because they

<HEADLINE> Australian Unemployment Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian unemployment
rate dropped markedly in December last year after rising to 8.6
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The figures released today by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) proved to be another surprise for most local
economic forecasters who used to expect employment to shrink at
the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent on a seasonally
adjusted basis in December, half a percentage point lower than in
the previous month, ABS announced today.
</P>
<P>
Previous market expectations put employment at a fall of 45,000
in December with unemployment rate remaining static at 8.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, ABS figures showed that total employment
actually rose by 4,900 to 8.342 million in seasonally adjusted
terms in the month.
</P>
<P>
The surprising increase of employment was due to a lower
participation rate, or the proportion of working-age people who
are in or seeking a job.
</P>
<P>
Participation rate dropped to 63.8 percent in December from
64.2 percent in November on a seasonally adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
ABS job vacancies fell by 2.8 percent in the three months to
November, in line with the steady growth of employment.
</P>
<P>
Today's job figures showed how bewildered the local economic
analysts are by the mixed signals of a soft landing of the
Australian economy. Most of them predicted that employment would
fall in December after a record rise of 112,000 in November.
</P>
<P>
Today's job figures attracted much spotlight because it
effectively wiped out any possibilities of an interest rate cut
before May.

<HEADLINE> Murayama Cabinet Resigns en Masse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The cabinet of Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama resigned en masse today, paving the way for
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Ryutaro Hashimoto to be
named the next premier later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Hashimoto, 58, is certain to be elected Japan's
53rd prime minister in a special parliamentary session thanks to
solid majority support from the three-party ruling coalition in
both houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He will be the first LDP premier in nearly two and a half years
after his party lost its 38-year grip over power in August 1993
following a series of scandals.
</P>
<P>
The LDP returned to the ruling camp in June 1994 under the
current coalition made up of the LDP, the Socialists and the
Sakigake Party (New Party).
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the governing bloc formally endorsed Hashimoto as
its joint candidate to replace the Socialist party's Murayama, 71,
who announced his resignation last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) will back
its President Ichiro Ozawa, 53, in the parliamentary election in
the afternoon. The Japanese Communist Party will put forward
another candidate.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto plans to inaugurate his cabinet in the evening but
Murayama and Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura, leader of the
smaller coalition party Sakigake, said they would not join the new
cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Snow Storm Could Cost US 17 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The blizzard that paralyzed
the eastern U.S. for the past two days could cost the nation as
much as 17 billion dollars in lost production and sales, according
to an economist.
</P>
<P>
David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington,
Massachusetts, said because of the storm, the nation could lost 10
billion dollars in lost production and 7 billion dollars in lost
sales.
</P>
<P>
The storm, one of the worst in history, buried most of the
nation's eastern states with two to three feet of snow, shutting
down governments, closing businesses, canceling school classes,
blocking highways and disrupting commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
"It had a significant impact, because it affected a large part
of the country for a long time," Wyss was quoted by a United Press
International report as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the major cost of the storm is not direct damages or
cleanup costs, but lost production, which he said totaled almost
10 billion dollars. He said transportation and construction were
the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Airports in major cities along the East Coast reopened today
after a two-day shutdown that stranded thousands of passengers at
terminals.
</P>
<P>
Because of deep snow, most builders in the East would shut down
for a couple of weeks, said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the
National Association of Home Builders. He said the storm would
skew the monthly data on housing starts and sales.
</P>
<P>
The second biggest cost of the storm was lost sales,
representing as much as seven billion dollars, according Wyss's
estimates. The major retailers' association put the cost at three
billion dollars to five billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wyss warned lost sales could push some retailers into
bankruptcy, because many of them were counting on steady sales of
winter merchandise to make up for a disappointing Christmas
season.
</P>
<P>
But not all businesses were losing money. Some businesses, like
auto body shops and other repair stores, enjoyed brisk business
because of the storm.

SUZHOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou City in east China's
Jiangsu Province, revoked the licenses of 1,368 foreign-funded
enterprises after looking into whether they were acting in
compliance with their contracts.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve management in foreign-funded enterprises,
the city closed those that were not registered with the local
Industry and Commerce Administration, or whose registration had
been nullified, or could not continue operating, or the terms of
whose contract had expired.
</P>

The number of foreign-funded enterprises approved by the city
since 1984 is 7,586, with imported funds reaching 7.06 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Industrial Park, developed co-operatively with
Singapore in 1994, attracted more than two billion US dollars in

<HEADLINE> Afghan Government Unveils New Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani's key commander Ahmed Shah Masood unveiled a four-point
peace plan in Kabul, said local press here today.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in Kabul on Wednesday, Masood said
that to transfer power and restore peace in the country,
oppositions must agree on a cease-fire, open highways, exchange
prisoners and begin political talks.
</P>
<P>
He said last month Rabbani had declared his willingness to sit
down with the opposition and discuss a plan for the transfer of
power from him to some kind of setup.
</P>
<P>
He added the Kabul government had decided to send delegations
to negotiate with rival faction leaders and seek their cooperation
for a peaceful solution to the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Another report said the Taliban student militia had rejected to
receive Rabbani in Taliban's headquarters Kandahar located in the
south.
</P>
<P>
The report said Rabbani could only be welcomed in their
headquarters if he clearly announced his intention about visiting
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Rabbani was rejected in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Rashid Dostum, who controls northern Afghanistan,
refused to receive him in Mazar-i-Sharif in the north.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's close ally Abdur Rasool Sayaf is still trying to
arrange a meeting in eastern Jalalabad with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a
main rival of Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan and Iran Wednesday agreed to work closely
for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan during a two-day visit of
Iranian Foreign Minister Akbar Velayati to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
UN special envoy Mehmud Mestiri will arrive here Friday to
start a new round of peace efforts on the Afghan crisis.

<HEADLINE> France to Invest More in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- France's investment in
Brazil is set to soar over the next few years, reversing the big
fall since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Investment will increase from the current 2.8 billion
U.S. dollars to some 20 billion dollars over the next few years,
said Yves Galland, French minister-delegate in charge of finance
and foreign trade, who is in Brazil on a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of its intention, Galland confirmed that French
car-maker Renault will set up a one-billion-dollar plant in Brazil
capable of producing 100,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
He said France wants to revert the downward trend of investment
in Brazil. In 1987, French investment accounted for 27 percent of
the total foreign capital in Brazil. But the figure dropped to 7
percent in 1990 and 2.31 percent in 1994, he said.

<HEADLINE> German, Costa Rica Agents Cooperate in Searching Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's Foreign Minister
Fernando Naranjo confirmed last night the presence of four German
agents in the country to collaborate in the search for two
kidnapped Europeans, including one German national.
</P>
<P>
The German "police advisors" arrived in Costa Rica Monday or
Tuesday to advise Costa Rican police on investigation and search
techniques to discover the whereabouts of the kidnappers, a local
newspaper today quoted Naranjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister rejected the claim that the German experts
belong to a special assault or military team.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, Nicola Fleutchaus, a German tourist, 24, and her
Swiss guide, Regula Susana Sigfried, 50, were abducted in the
Nicaragua border zone by nine men wearing ski masks and armed with
AK-47 rifles.
</P>
<P>
Despite impassioned pleas by Costa Rican authorities to start
negotiations with the kidnappers after the search to locate the
victims resulted in failure, the kidnappers have kept silent.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Alejandro Soto Tuesday night had denied
the presence of German police in Costa Rica, saying, "I cannot
confirm it" for fear of jeopardizing police operations.

<HEADLINE> Job Search for Shanghai College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- College students in Shanghai,
China's largest city, have begun seeking jobs seven months ahead
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Over 45,000 college students will graduate in Shanghai this
year, an increase of 10 percent over last year, but demand for
college grads in some state-owned enterprises' is lower than it
was in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Officials attribute this to staff reductions due to structural
changes.
</P>
<P>
Students majoring in foreign languages and computer science are
still in great demand, but banking and finance, communication and
transportation, and aeronautics and astronautics will account for
the largest number.
</P>
<P>
According to 1995 statistics, Sino-foreign joint ventures
attracted more students good at English and computer science, and
twelve percent of the students found jobs in foreign-funded
enterprises and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Some state-owned enterprises which provide more training
opportunities and have insurance benefits have first pick, and
departments with lower salaries attract fewer students.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this situation conforms to the nature of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that the number of college grads in 1995
was the highest since the foundation of the new China in 1949.

<HEADLINE> Sluggish Securities Trading for December in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The securities trade volume in
Shanghai, China's financial hub, dropped to 36.93 billion yuan in
December, 19.8 percent less than in November, according to
statistics released by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The stock market's drop was not reversed by the acquisition of
shares of "Xingye Real Estate" as had been expected. The All Stock
Index dipped 85.85 points, or 13.39 percent, to 555.29, and trade
volume totalled 9.952 billion yuan, down by nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Christmas holidays forced the B-share index to slide by
5.83 percent to record lows, and only 229 million yuan worth of
B-shares were traded, 45 percent less than in November.
</P>
<P>
The treasury bond market, however, performed strongly.
</P>
<P>
Re-purchase of treasury bonds was very active, creating a
record daily trade volume and earning ratio. Treasury bonds
trading was worth 18.055 billion yuan, accounting for 77.24
percent of the bond market total. On the last trading day in
December, however, prices of re-purchased bonds all dropped below
what they were in November.
</P>
<P>
Prices on the spot bond market dropped sharply early last month
and rose in late December. Official statistics show that trade
volume on the bond spot market increased to 5.319 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical, railway, and electricity sectors issued
bonds, which analysts said would breathe new life into the silent
secondary bond market.
</P>
<P>
The funds market continued the slide in November. All 12 funds
dipped between 2.5 and 16.5 percent, and trade volume dwindled
to 2.609 billion yuan, a 60 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest securities market, is now trading 220
stocks, 12 funds, and 12 treasury bonds. In 1995, securities trade
volume reached a record of 5.49 trillion yuan in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Encircle Chechen Hostage-Takers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops blockaded the
Chechen gunmen holding at least 160 hostages in southern Russia
Thursday as they expected the overnight negotiations to end the
crisis without further sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 Chechen terrorists, headed by Salman Raduyev, the
son-in-law of rebel Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed into
Kizlyar Tuesday and took 3,000 people into the city hospital as
hostages.
</P>
<P>
After releasing the majority of the hostages Wednesday, they
set out in 11 buses and two trucks and then stopped for the night
in the village of Pervomaiskaya in the southern Russian republic
of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces appeared to have halted the rebel convoy around
midday, preventing them from crossing into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
As night fell, Russian television showed footage of the rebels
setting up defensive positions in trenches and barricades in
Pervomaiskaya as Russian troops and armour massed in snow-covered
fields outside the village.
</P>
<P>
Helicopter gunships that had flown over the sky withdrew while
most of the Russian troops pulled back about five kilometers. Some
160 military vehicles waited outside the village but there was no
clear sign they were planning to attack.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted a local official as saying he expected the
convoy to remain blockaded through the night.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, quoted by Interfax, said the
Russian interior ministry troops and special forces following the
convoy were "sufficient" if the rebels decided to "use violence
against the hostages."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin insisted on punishing the
terrorists without risking the hostages' lives.
</P>
<P>
Moscow also warned the gunmen that their families and relatives
would be persecuted and the Daghestani people would hate all the
Chechens for what they did to the innocent Kizlyar civilians.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists threatened to kill the hostages, many of whom
are women and children, if they cannot have a safe passage back to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said that about seven policemen, 13 Chechen
fighters and 12 others were killed during the fighting in Kizlyar.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen demanded that all Russian troops leave Chechnya and
its neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was a repeat of a raid by Chechen guerrillas when
they took about 1,500 people hostage in Southern Russia for a
week in June.
</P>
<P>
About 150 people died in the fighting before most hostages were
released and the fighters offered safe passage to Chechnya.

CHENGDU, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province has developed
into China's largest natural gas base.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said that 45 percent of China's gas
output of 16 billion cubic meters last year came from Sichuan,
which turned out 7.187 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the interior Sichuan basin has 180,000
square kilometers of areas abounding in natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have discovered 241 gas structures and 353 potential
ones as well as 54 oil- and gas-bearing structures. They have
opened 82 gas and 12 oil fields.
</P>
<P>
At present, Sichuan not only supplies gas to its 700 major
enterprises and 1.36 million urban households, but also provides
it to neighboring Yunnan and Guizhou provinces.
</P>
<P>
The province has vowed to further cooperate with the outside
world, and employ scientific management to turn out an annual
output of at least eight billion cubic meters of natural gas by
the year 2000.

TEGUCIGALPA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- On orders of the United
Nations, 120 Honduran soldiers returned Tuesday from Haiti after
they performed part of their duties to re-establish democracy in
Haiti in four months.
</P>
<P>
The troops, from the Lempira II tactic group, returned home
three months ahead without payment due to financial difficulties
in the United Nations, the Honduran Armed Forces said.
</P>
<P>
Efrain Guevara, commander of the contingent, said the lack of
payment did not affect the mission "because we are not mercenaries
and we went there to put Honduras on a pedestal, not just to earn
money."
</P>
<P>
The Honduran soldiers were sent to Haiti to maintain order
during the December 17 elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached between the Honduran military
authorities and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, each
Honduran soldier participating in the U.N. peace-keeping mission
in Haiti would be paid 1,500 U.S. dollars per month, but the
U.N. failed to honor the promise due to financial troubles in the
world body.

Honduran troops at the Tegucigalpa airforce base, expressed his

<P>
Stockholm, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Acid rain, pollution, fungus
and depletion of the ozone layer are causing serious and
increasing damage to forests in Europe, particularly in the east,
a United Nations survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
The survey, started in 1986, showed that the number of trees
damaged is increasing year by year. Some 26 per cent of broadleaf
trees and 28 per cent of coniferous trees in Europe were damaged
by abnormal leaf fall in 1994, four percentage points higher than
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain, drought, ozone and fungus are among the factors
blamed for the problem.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit countries are those which discharge large amounts
of sulphur and nitrogen into the air, such as Czechoslovakia and
Poland, where 60 and 55 per cent of forests have been seriously
damaged, said the report released by the UN Economic Commission
for Europe.
</P>
<P>
More than 35 per cent of trees in Slovakia, Belarus and
Denmark have also been seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
The least affected countries are Portugal, with 6 per cent,
Austria at 8 per cent and France at 8 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The survey defines trees with a quarter of their leaves falling
down due to unnormal reasons as badly damaged trees.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway in Reducing Soil Erosion on Loess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in reducing
soil erosion on the loess through years of efforts in
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the amount of soil and sand washed away
from the experimental areas on the loess has dropped from an
annual of 2,899 tons per square kilometer before 1980 to 1,130
tons per sq km during the 1991-95 period.
</P>
<P>
The loess consists of Shaanxi, Shanxi and Gansu provinces and
Ningxia and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
It is the worst soil erosion area in the world, and one of
China's poverty stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of
Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources and localities
have joined hands to organize 350 scientific workers to make an
investigation on the area and find ways to solve the erosion
problem.
</P>
<P>
They have set up 11 experimental areas, applied 58 research
findings and planted trees and grass to improve local ecological
conditions and people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
As a result, people in these areas have an average of 546.4
kilograms of grain and 1,336 yuan per capita.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's foreign exchange
reserve has reached a record high of 11.8 billion U.S. dollars,
announced Deputy-Chairman of the National Bank Harshegyi Frigyes
at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Frigyes explained that the increase in the reserve was due
mainly to last year's record high privatization income of 3.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve was less than 7 billion dollars at
the start of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is set to decrease because Hungary will pay off
foreign debts of 3 billion U.S. dollars by April, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Steps up Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A three-year campaign against
drug abuse and drug trafficking will start in Vietnam this year.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, announced in December, aims to eliminate opium
cultivation, impose stricter control on drug trafficking routes
and enhance drug rehabilitation and education programs.
</P>
<P>
The government stepped up its war against drugs late last year
by publicly burning 329.85 kilograms of opium and 895 grams of
heroin, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The biggest single haul caught a man trafficking 23 kilograms
of opium, the English-language Vietnam News said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the opium came from either mountainous areas in the
country or neighboring countries like Laos, the newspaper said and
65 per cent of the estimated 200,000 addicts in the country live
in mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
Residents in these areas are being encouraged to grow cash
crops like coffee instead of cultivating opium poppy.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 cases of drug trafficking have been uncovered over
the past few years in Vietnam and more than 10,000 drug
traffickers have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is increasingly linked with the spread of HIV and
AIDS. Around 80 percent of HIV carriers found in the country are
intravenous drug abusers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- England coach Terry Venables
said that he would resign after the 1996 European Football
Champiomships this summer at their own threshold, revealled by the
Football Association (FA) in a news conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The coach said he needed more time to fight court cases and
clear his name.
</P>
<P>
Venables had a talk again Wednesday with FA chief executive
Graham Kelly discussing over whether he should be given a two-year
contract extension through the 1998 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
Venables informed Kelly last month of his plans to resign, and
he did not change his mind when the two met again Wednesday,
according to the FA spokesman David Davies.
</P>
<P>
Venables is involved in numerous troubles including a dismissal
suit against his former club Tottenham, a libel suit against
Tottenham head Alan Sugar, and suits against the British
Broadcasting Corporation and the Daily Mirror newspaper over
allegations about his business affairs.
</P>
<P>
The spokeman also showed the deep disappointment of FA over his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan was immediately listed among the
favorites to replace Venables, while the Middlesbrough manager
Bryan Robson and Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson, as well as Jack
Charlton, who resigned last month as Ireland manager, were all
among the contenders' list.

NANJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of east

resident foreign enterprises by using a system of requiring
foreigners to pay up taxes before leaving the country.

According to a local source, a total of 202 foreign enterprises
have set up offices in Nanjing. Of these, some 126 have registered
for taxation purposes.
</P>
<P>
The source said that most of these have rented hotel and office
space for various businesses and often change their address,
causing difficulties for the tax department. Some of them evade
taxes in this way.
</P>
<P>
However, under the new system, personnel of foreign offices, in
addition to paying taxes through normal channels, will have to pay
all their taxes before they can go through exit formalities.

<HEADLINE> SFO Considering Examining Baring Papers in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Serious Fraud Office
(SFO) is considering sending officials to Singapore to examine
papers related to the collapse of Barings, SFO said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The possibility follows the decision by the accountancy firm
Price Waterhouse, the liquidator of Barings Futures Singapore
(BFS), to give the SFO access to documents for which the SFO had
been fighting through courts.
</P>
<P>
The SFO had previously been denied access to the papers and
last May applied to a Singapore court for the right to see them.
</P>
<P>
A SFO spokeswoman said, "We've reached an agreement with the
liquidators of Barings Futures Singapore. We are considering what,
if any, further investigations need to be made."
</P>
<P>
The SFO scaled down its investigation into the collapse of
Britain's oldest merchant bank after concluding the best place for
Leeson to be tried was Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The SFO said that it found no evidence of criminal activity in
UK related to the bank's collapse on the basis of information
available. But the investigation has not ceased and could be
reactivated if evidence of criminal activity surfaces in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Nick Leeson, the general manager of BFS whose unauthorized
trading activities led to the bank's collapse last February, has
just begun a 6.5-year prison sentence in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The SFO has not ruled out bringing prosecutions against former
London-based employees of Barings.

WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today nominated Admiral Joseph Prueher, vice chief of naval
operations at the Pentagon, to replace Admiral Richard Macke as

Prueher, 53, is the Navy's No. 2 officer and his nomination is

<HEADLINE> Life Coming to Normal But Losses Heavy in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Public schools reopened,
planes soared out of the three major airports, mail delivery
resumed and employees started to work in New York City after two
days of snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said plows had gotten to 100 percent of
all main roads, 94 percent of all secondary roads and 76 percent
of all tertiary ones, and many of the blocked streets would be
cleared today.
</P>
<P>
Although many residents in the city are still mounting snow in
the street and at their door steps to make way out and digging
their cars out of piling snow, most of the New Yorkers can move
from street to street today.
</P>
<P>
The city's 1,100 schools reopened today though some of them
opened later than usual. Flights began taking off from cleared
runways though port authorities warned that the 5,000 flights that
had been canceled because of the snowstorm would mean snags for
days.
</P>
<P>
The worst snowstorm in 70 years, which started on Sunday and
lasted to mid-Monday, struck the eastern region of the United
States and left the New York metropolitan and 10 states buried and
paralyzed under 18 inches to three feet of snow.
</P>
<P>
The blizzard forced airports closed, railway and highway
traffic paralyzed, school classes canceled and many institutions
non-operational in New York and many other cities in the region.
Several states had declared state of emergency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The snowstorm has not only put the city's residents to
inconvenience, but also brought the city to heavy economic loss.
The city's comptroller, Alan Hevesi, said Tuesday that the price
tag to the city because of snow removal and lost tax revenues and
fees would be 23 million dollars. However, other city officials
estimated that the blizzard has already cost the city's economy
more than 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chief economist for city comptroller, Jacques Jiha,
estimated that the city's business and stores lose about 500
million dollars every day the city is shut down. The downturn in
sales will translate into a 3 million dollars decline in sales tax
revenues, Hevesi predicted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city would lose 6 million dollars from decline
in parking ticket and parking meter proceeds, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled 97.19 to close at 5032.94 here today.
</P>
<P>
Stocks have dropped sharply for the second day in a row, as a
quick resolution to the federal budget impasse seemed hopeless and
corporate earnings would fall.
</P>
<P>
Investors in stocks fear that if a budget agreement is not
reached soon in Washington, bond investors will continue to push
interest rates higher. Higher interest rates would increase
corporate costs and erode away corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues led advancers by 4 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange with 525 up, 1,962 down and 608 unchanged. A heavy volume
of over 400 million shares changed hands.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States expects
continuity in its relationship with Japan once Ryutaro Hashimoto
becomes new Japanese prime minister, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
"We expect continuity in our relationships with Japan," White
House Press Secretary Mike McCurry told reporters at a news

discussions, political matters that affect our work together
across the globe or in the security areas so vital to the national
security of both the United States and Japan," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that relationship will continue," McCurry noted, "if
Mr. Hashimoto is indeed designated we would of course extend to
him our congratulations."
</P>

Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama announced his

WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A 120-car freight train
derailed today in western U.S., spilling thousands of gallons of
hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Pacific freight train jumped tracks about 23 miles
southwest of Gila Bend, a small community in southwestern Arizona
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The locomotive and the first 23 cars went off track. A tanker
spilled about 20,000 gallons of hazardous distillate, a spokesman
for Southern Pacific said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Arizona said there were no injuries. Two crewmen,
appeared to be uninjured, were airlifted to a Phoenix hospital for
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the derailment was not immediately known, but
Southern Pacific ruled out sabotage.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Proposes New Idea on Arms Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), has suggested that all groups in
Northern Ireland, which possess arms, oversee the disposal of
their own weapons, reported BBC TV this evening.
</P>
<P>
The idea is part of Sinn Fein's submission to the international
commission in charge of arms decommissioning process in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein spokesman Martin McGuinness reiterated that arms
decommissioning would still have to take place after a political
settlement in the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Sinn Fein wanted to remove the IRA's
guns and guns held by Protestant groups as well as those held by
the British army in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
British government sources said that Sinn Fein's proposal was
in response to a series of options laid out by the government nine
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The government believed that there are questions of
verification, validation and public safety which would have to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
But the suggestion is interesting and perhaps encouraging, and
the government will look very closely at the idea, the government
officials said.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Considering New Operation in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council is considering sending a new U.N. force of up to 5,000 to
Croatia's Eastern Slavonia, U.N. diplomats said here today.
</P>
<P>
It is 4,000 fewer than the original estimate of U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who said previously in a
report at least 9,000 troops were needed in the area.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, which is now under control of minority Serbs,
will be reintegrated into Croatia after one or two years of
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
An agreement has already been reached on the reintegration by
Serbia and Croatia. Under the agreement signed last November, an
international force is required to both disarm the Serb Militia
and protect Serbian residence from any attacks by the Croatian
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States insisted that the United Nations
should take up the job, although NATO-led troops were across the
border in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
U.N. diplomats said that the United States had made compromise
by allowing NATO force to support the upcoming U.N. force if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the new U.N. force would be known as UNTES, the
U.N. Transitional Authority in Eastern Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
But now it is not quite clear whether the U.N. force will be
authorized to disarm the Serb militiamen with force under Chapter
7 of the U.N. Charter. Russia maintains that the disarmament
should be voluntary.
</P>
<P>
UNTES will replace the United Nations Confidence Restoration
Force (UNCRO) whose mandate will expire on January 15.

<HEADLINE> Three Suspects Involved in Killing Industrialist Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Istanbul police today announced
the identification of three suspects who are believed to have been
involved in Tuesday's killing of Ozdemir Sabanci, one of Turkey's
leading industrialists.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul police chief Orhan Tasanlar revealed that one of the
suspects was Fehriye Erdal, a girl aged 19, who had worked in the
twin-tower of Sabanci Holding for six months as a cleaner.
</P>
<P>
Tasanlar told the Istanbul-based private television ATV tonight
that Erdal, who had entrance card to the 25th floor where the high
ranking executives work, helped two other gunmen enter the
building and carried out the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Erdal and the two other suspects, Ismail Akkol, 23, and Mustafa
Duyar, 25, were members of the outlawed "Revolutionary People's
Liberation Party / Front (DHKP/C)."
</P>
<P>
The police chief said all the three had been involved in
illegal activities and recorded by local police before the
assassination which shocked the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
They have escaped from their workplaces and homes after the
killing of Ozdemir Sabanci, 54, the youngest of Sabanci's five
brother family and chief executive of Toyota automobile plant in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Sabanci family is one of Turkey's two leading
industrialist dynasties, with business ranging from automobiles to
textiles and banking.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul police issued photos of the three suspects to local
media, asking for help to catch the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Two aides of Ozdemir Sabanci were also gunned down in the
well-planned attack, which some newspapers said was aimed at
dragging Turkey into another period of chaos.
</P>
<P>
The extreme leftist group of DHKP/C increased its violent
activities in 1995. At least 20 policemen and security officers
were killed by the group.
</P>
<P>
The assassination of Ozdemir Sabanci was the first case
ever targeted at a leading industrialist.

important role in maintaining peace and stability in the Gulf
region.

China hopes that all nations in the Gulf enhance cooperation
and expand relations on the basis of mutual respect and
non-interference of each other's internal affairs so as to to
promote peace, stability and development, he added.
