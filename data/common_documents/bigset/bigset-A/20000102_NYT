SENSORS CAN'T SPOT NEW YEAR'S GUNSHOTS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a high-tech effort to stamp out the firing of guns into
the air during New Year's eve, falling bullets wounded a sheriff's
deputy and a 12-year-old boy in separate incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Their wounds weren't serious. The off-duty deputy took a bullet
in the shoulder while celebrating the holiday with friends in
Temple City, northeast of downtown Los Angeles. The boy, in
South-Central Los Angeles, was hit by a small bullet that lodged in
his scalp until doctors plucked it out with tweezers.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries came as a depressing reminder for police of the
tradition's enduring popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think about the consequences,'' said Sgt. Larry
Meyer with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, north of L.A.
``Those bullets do come down somewhere. They don't just
evaporate.''
</P>
<P>
   A new surveillance system designed to pinpoint the location of
gunfire was overloaded with fireworks, masking gunfire. After the
stroke of midnight, a barrage of 700 tiny explosions flooded the
Shotspotter system's acoustic sensors. Most of the blasts were
probably fireworks, said Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Deputy
Bruce Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A backfire, a gunshot, a firecracker they're all going to
sound the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the sheriff's department received 323 phoned-in
reports of gunshots throughout the entire county, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers at police stations throughout Los Angeles estimated
they took fewer complaints than last year about celebratory
gunfire. The drop, they said, was probably caused by the same cold,
damp weather that doused many of the city's official millennium
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, someone in Temple Heights was blazing away shortly after
midnight. Sheriff's Deputy Steven Toly, 37, was standing outside a
house on Golden West Avenue when a bullet fell from the sky and
pierced his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bullet was quickly removed, Toly was expected to
remain hospitalized Saturday night so doctors could watch for signs
of infection, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Central Los Angeles, a 12-year-old boy watching the New
Year's festivities outside was struck in the head by a .22-caliber
bullet. The boy, whose name was withheld by police, was rushed to a
hospital, where doctors removed the bullet and sealed the wound
with two stitches, said Officer Trevion Stokes of the Los Angeles
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made in either case.
</P>
<P>
   Catching those responsible for such senseless injuries is
difficult at best, authorities say. Bullets can travel far before
falling back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said he heard automatic gunfire in the distance Sunday
morning from his Oxnard home. But even he didn't bother to report
it to police, since he had no idea where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you get someone to tell you, it was that guy right
there, it's very difficult to make an arrest,'' he said.

DAFOE A POSITIVE THINKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Another tie wasn't what the Bruins needed.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2-2 decision Saturday &UR;  &LR; night against the Devils at the
FleetCenter didn't turn out so bad, especially considering the way
it started, with New Jersey's Scott Niedermayer crashing into
Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe 22 seconds into the game, resulting in a
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a replay yet, but I don't think I'm going to
fall into the corner by myself,'' Dafoe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start the game that way, the first minute, you have another
bad-luck situation,'' Dafoe said. ``We could have thrown it in and
said, `I guess this isn't our night,' but the guys fought really
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As ties go, this one wasn't that bad, but Dafoe wants more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting sick of these ties, the losses and ties,'' Dafoe
said. ``That's a good hockey club on that side. We played them
tough. I don't think they outplayed us by any means. It's an
important point for us. It's not a victory, there's still a sour
taste in our mouths, but we're playing better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie to you, I don't think our mind-set is on
top of the world right now, but we're finding the positives out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dafoe feels confident on the ice, although his statistics
are not as stellar as last season, when he compiled a 32-23-11 with
a 1.99 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good out there, although I don't have the personal
numbers like last season,'' Dafoe said. ``That bothers me, but I
think it's coming and right now I'm trying to look for victories. I
don't care about my numbers. I'm trying to get the wins for all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question Dafoe respects the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big, there's no doubt they like to throw the puck at
the net and crash,'' he said. ``On their power play, they stick
someone right in front and they're very tough to see around and
they do create havoc and that's why they're successful at it. And,
obviously, with the new (crease) rule change, it benefits that type
of team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pesky, they're big and tough, and they like to stir
things up, no question. It's a very smart hockey team from the
goaltender all the way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe realizes the Bruins are still a young team with a few
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team tends to be harder on themselves than the older guys
who have been through this many times before and they know how to
snap out of it,'' Dafoe said. ``That could be a reason as to why we
have slow starts, not being fired up as much as we should be. We're
not walking around with smiles on our faces, but we're not dragging
our heads, either.''

BRUINS, DEVILS DO THE SPLITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It wasn't a victory, but it wasn't a loss. What it
really turned into was a baby step forward in the Bruins' quest to
climb out of their protracted slump.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison, who played with a torn tendon in his right wrist
and is mulling whether to have surgery, scored two goals for the
Bruins Saturday &UR;  &LR; night as they battled to a 2-2 tie with the New
Jersey Devils at the FleetCenter. The Bruins are hoping this is the
beginning of more than just a new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a terrible streak going right now but I have to
admit, the last five or six games we've definitely played hard,''
said goalie Byron Dafoe, who made 31 saves and was instrumental in
the team getting a point. ``As a result, we've gotten a point in
four of the last five games. We're not getting the victories but
we're at least turning the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are now winless in their last seven games (0-5-2) and
2-9-5 in their last 16.
</P>
<P>
   Bad breaks have been a recurring theme in the hometown team's
problems. Boston got another one Saturday &UR;  &LR; night when the Devils
scored a controversial goal just 22 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey center Bobby Holik fired the puck to defenseman Scott
Niedermayer, who was in front of the Bruins' net. Niedermayer
hooked and upended Don Sweeney into Dafoe, knocking the goalie out
of the play. With the puck lying in front and Sweeney and Dafoe out
of commission, Niedermayer backhanded it into the cage for the 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the replay yet but I don't think I'm going to
fall into the corner by myself,'' said Dafoe. ``The referee tried
to explain to me that he thought Donny hit him into me but I've got
a question about how Donny ends up on his butt as well. My concern
is that they're taking out the crease rule and that's all fine, but
I think the refs have to realize the goalie is still sacred
territory. Whether you're in the crease or at the top of the
crease, you can't be interfered with. That's taking away from my
job. That's what bothered me about the non-call.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said he thought it was a clear case of
goaltender interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a player right out like that and throw him on
the goaltender . . . it's just that with a team with a little bit
of lack of confidence like ours right now, something like that
happens and they get away with it, it's a battle to get back up
there,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   But battle back the Bruins did.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, who missed the last three games, got his first goal at
15:45 of the opening period. Kyle McLaren, a step inside the blue
line, fired the puck toward the net and Allison tipped it past
Martin Brodeur for his eighth goal of the season to pull the Bruins
even.
</P>
<P>
   As often has been the case, though, the Bruins squandered some
terrific offensive chances in the second period and shortly
thereafter, the Devils regained the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a power play midway through the period and
applied some serious pressure with Andre Savage and Joe Thornton
both getting a couple of shots at Brodeur but failing to convert.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that man-advantage expired, left wing Patrik
Elias put the Devils back in front. Elias gained the blue line and
beat McLaren inside the left circle, slaloming through the slot,
switching from backhand to forehand, and beating Dafoe at 10:03 for
his 10th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe kept it close. About 11 minutes into the middle period,
New Jersey rookie sensation Scott Gomez made a terrific feed to
Holik, but Dafoe turned it aside. At 15:45, Dafoe snared a tricky
shot by Gomez. And early in the third, center Denis Pederson made a
nice bid but Dafoe blocked it with his body.
</P>
<P>
   Allison came through again at 6:50 when he converted on a
three-on-one break. Charging up ice with Allison and Sergei
Samsonov, Anson Carter dished a pass from the right circle across
the slot to Allison, who backhanded it home for the 2-2 tie. It was
Allison's fifth goal in his last three games.
</P>
<P>
   The club lost Thornton to the penalty box with 41.6 seconds left
in regulation when he and veteran defenseman Ken Daneyko squared
off. Though Thornton delivered the better of the blows, bloodying
Daneyko's nose, Burns would have preferred to have Thornton, the
club's only natural center in the lineup who could take faceoffs,
available for the overtime. It caught the coach by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did because I only have one real centerman who can take
draws and play that position,'' said Burns. ``It probably was a
good tactic to go after him. But Joe didn't back up, you've got to
give him credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, it was Allison who deserved a lot of the credit
for bringing his A game despite playing in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, he's such a big part of this hockey
club,'' said Dafoe. ``He just brings a lot to the board for us both
offensively and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   But for how long remains to be seen.

L.A. PARTIES CALLED EMBARRASSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich and Rick Orlov  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hours after the world's greatest cities celebrated the New Year
in spectacular fashion, ``Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno looked up at
the glowing Hollywood sign and likened it to a sleazy strip-joint
placard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any cheesier than that,'' Leno said, gesturing
to the giant real estate sign as it pulsed with 2.7 million watts
of red, white, blue, orange, purple and yellow lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Paris thing, that paled in comparison. Who needs the
Eiffel Tower when you got this,'' Leno mocked, moments after he
helped Mayor Richard Riordan flip a switch to start the light show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a sign that says 'all-naked inside.' It's like
we're outside of a strip joint.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno wasn't the only one who said he was embarrassed by Los
Angeles' offering to the global millennium celebrations,
highlighted by massive crowds for ornate public events from the
capitals of Asia to Paris, London and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   From the San Fernando Valley to the streets of Crenshaw,
residents complained that a lack of planning and coordination by
city officials left Los Angeles looking like a dopey cow town on
the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty pathetic,'' said James Altenburg, a 25-year-old
Franklin Hills resident who watched the city-sponsored events with
his family on television.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve revelers at Van Nuys Airport -- one of five
sparsely attended city-sponsored events that were supposed to draw
400,000 people -- grumbled that the city's Valley Spectacular fell
far short of the billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty low turnout. It's disappointing,'' said
Dianna Sanders, who ventured among the crowd of a few hundred at
the Valley event with her parents, her husband, and her
16-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Hollywood sign on a giant-screen TV, Kelly Colla
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching all the other celebrations around the world on
television and then L.A. does this,'' she said. ``It was kind of
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The lighting of the famed Hollywood sign had been sold for
months by Riordan and the city's cultural commissioners as a
once-in-a-lifetime blockbuster event, featuring fireworks, lasers,
skywriters, and even parachuting daredevils.
</P>
<P>
   But compared to the televised images of other celebrations
around the globe, the entertainment capital of the world's official
millennium extravaganza fizzled and flopped like a third-rate
dinner-theater show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hoopla, there were no fireworks, no lasers, no
skywriters -- and no, not even the parachuting daredevils showed
up. But those 50-foot letters on the famed sign did glow.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Noelia Rodriguez said Saturday the city never
planned to have one spectacular event such as at Times Square or
the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is just too big -- more than 400 square miles --
and there's no one place where people get together,'' Rodriguez
said. ``Maybe some day in the future that will happen, but we don't
have that history here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time Los Angeles has even tried to have a
New Year's Eve celebration,'' she said, ``and the thought was to
celebrate the diversity of the city and bring the party to the
different neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather, however, didn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected rainstorm kept crowds low at the five community
events and prevented the parachuting daredevils from floating down
around the Hollywood sign.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a lack of rain in the months leading up to the new
millennium celebrations prompted city fire officials call off the
Hollywood-sign fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   What Rodriguez could not explain, however, were the differing
stories that came out late Friday as to why plans for a laser show
at the sign were scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rodriguez said she was told the Federal Aviation
Administration objected to the lasers, citing concerns the powerful
lights would impact on air traffic in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never that,'' disagreed Al Nodal, general manager of
the city's Cultural Affairs Department, which organized the city's
five community events, including the Hollywood-sign affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided a couple of weeks ago to scrap the laser show
because it wouldn't look good on TV,'' Nodal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this was a TV event and not a lot of people could get
up to the Hollywood sign, we decided to drop the lasers and go with
what we had. And I thought it looked pretty good on television and
in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Punt, director of administration for the department,
attributed the scaled-back show to a misunderstanding between the
different officials involved. Punt said the laser show was ``an
artist's concept'' that was later abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   But production crews working on the event said they were well
aware of the final plans for at least two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes even the greatest shows get scaled back because of
events that cannot be controlled,'' said a senior production
executive who asked not to be named. ``We shot for the stars and
grabbed for the moon on the way back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone involved, however, acknowledged that the laser
show was originally advertised as one of the selling points for the
city's celebration, and details of the scaled-back production were
not publicly disclosed until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost for the community parties was $4 million, with
the city providing $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   There was no cost to use the Hollywood sign, which is on city
property maintained by the Recreation and Parks Department. Private
firms that make use of the sign pay a fee that goes into a trust
fund established to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other city-sponsored events, Nodal blamed the rain
and cold that suddenly swept in for diminishing attendance.
</P>
<P>
   `'We gave out 300,000 tickets and if it wasn't for the weather,
we would have had just as big a turnout as any other city,'' Nodal
said. ``Even with the weather, we had large crowds at different
events, such as at Olvera Street to hear Los Lobos.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sad is that this is the first time we've tried this and
we were hurt by the weather,'' Nodal said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood sign has been washed in light before, but the
letters themselves have never been individually set aglow,
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lighting a white sign this size is not difficult. But the fact
that this sign is on the side of a 200-foot cliff, is four and a
half stories tall and 400 feet long -- that's what made this
difficult,'' said Bob Barnhart, a Los Angeles lighting designer who
managed and designed the sign lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they brought me in about a month ago, all of the other
plans were already off the drawing board,'' Barnhart said. ``They
never asked me to do anything but light the sign.''
</P>
<P>
   After experiencing Hollywood's magic up close, Leno gushed
Saturday morning that there would be no way to calm down and
quickly go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the tens of thousands filling the Mall at the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the millions in New York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   This was the party to be at, Leno sacastically rejoiced. And the
late-night talk-show king said there was only one way to fittingly
follow it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go home,'' he said, ``and watch a Dukes of Hazard
marathon.''

HUSAK PUT IN TOO DEEP A HOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Whether it was accurate or not, Stanford
quarterback Todd Husak didn't have a problem pointing a finger of
blame following Saturday's Rose Bowl loss to Wisconsin. And the
finger was pointed squarely into the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of throws,'' Husak said when asked what was the
difference in the Badgers' 17-9 victory. ``If I make them, we win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is too simple an explanation for a difficult
loss. Sure, there were a couple of balls that Husak could have
thrown better including one that sailed over a wide-open DeRonnie
Pitts deep down the middle of the field with the Cardinal trailing
by a point in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a good throw there, it's a touchdown,'' said Husak, a
6-foot-3, 210-pound Long Beach native and St. John Bosco graduate.
Husak completed 17 passes in 34 attempts for 258 yards and didn't
throw a touchdown pass for the first time his 22 starts at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But, the errant throws had nothing to do with Stanford's horrid
rushing performance minus-5 yards on 27 attempts. Four sacks for
minus-43 yards contributed greatly to that dismal total.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their quarterback is real good,'' Wisconsin linebacker Donnell
Thompson said. ``But when you shut down the run, they became
one-dimensional. And when they are one-dimensional, they are a lot
easier to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick had a similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd didn't lose this game for us,'' Diedrick said. ``It was
pretty much a situation where (Wisconsin) dominated the line of
scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's offense entered the Rose Bowl averaging 37 points and
467 yards per game. Their lowest scoring output this year came in
an embarrassing 69-17 season-opening loss to Texas, but the
Cardinal managed to gain 394 yards in that contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too good of an offense to only score nine points in the
biggest game of the year,'' Husak said. ``It was our biggest stage
of the year, we had the chance to step it up and we didn't. That is
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, in the other locker room there was a different
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the game, you have to expect they will score more
than points,'' Wisconsin safety Jason Doering said. ``This is a
team averaging more than 30 points per game, so we knew they were
capable of putting up big numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers never materialized on Saturday because Wisconsin's
defensive front manhandled a Stanford offensive line playing
without its All Pac-10 center Mike McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to shut them down because we could read them and
know a little about what they were doing,'' Wisconsin linebacker
Chris Ghidorzi said. ``We made some big plays and had a great
second half. We were having fun out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin kicker Vitaly Pisetsky could have sealed the win with
a 34-yard field goal in the game's final moments, but he missed
wide left and Husak returned with a chance to engineer a game-tying
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Husak began the final drive by connecting with Dave Davis for 5
yards and then hit Tafiti Uso twice for a total of 31 yards to move
the ball to the Wisconsin 45-yard line. After an incomplete pass,
two penalties and a sack, Husak hit Pitts for a 15-yard gain to set
up 4th-and-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the way things went for us all year,'' Husak said.
``We came through when we needed to. I figured that would happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   After a delay-of-game penalty, Husak rolled right and slipped to
the turf while trying to duck Wisconsin defensive end Ben Herbert.
He had intended to stop and throw the ball down the far sideline to
running back Coy Wire.

   ``From what I heard, Coy was open on the play,'' Husak said.
``If I could have gotten away from the defender like I've done
hundreds of time, maybe we could have moved the chains. It's one of
those things when we were one big play away.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the big play never came won't soil a tremendous
career that Husak put together. He entered Stanford with little
expectations and leaves as the fifth-leading passer in school
history. But, at least for a while, Husak's thoughts will remain on
how his Stanford career concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a great defensive game, but I feel like we gave
this one away,'' he said. ``It hurts when you don't get it done.''

CONNER WINS GRUDGE MATCH WITH JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Last week, Dennis Conner gave Nippon
skipper Peter Gilmour a vicious tongue lashing for consorting with
the enemy. Saturday, Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes lashed Gilmour again,
beating him in the first day of the semifinal America's Cup trials
by 55 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Both by tradition and percentage, the winner of a match race
among the IACC Class 75-footers is the boat that gets the first
windshift in the beat up the first leg.
</P>
<P>
   That rule held true in all three races Saturday in the opening
of the Louis Vuitton Cup leading to the America's Cup match next
month.
</P>
<P>
   With winds building above 15 knots from the northwest, the six
remaining challengers dueled in choppy seas that flashed with
occasional bursts of sunlight as low, steamy clouds scudded across
Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The grudge match of the day was between Team Dennis Conner in
Stars &AMP; Stripes and Japan's Nippon team sailing in Asura. Conner
derided the Japanese team last week for helping New Zealand in
practice races.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nippon's aggressive skipper _ the native Australian Gilmour
_ was no match for the Stars &AMP; Stripes combination of Ken Read of
Newport, R.I., at the wheel, and 20-year veteran Tom Whidden of
Essex, Conn., calling tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Whirling through a lively prestart sequence, both skippers
struggled for control, but coming off the line, Stars &AMP; Stripes was
positioned to the left and capitalized on a favorable shift as
Whidden kept the dark blue boat from San Diego to the left.
</P>
<P>
   After a drag race to the left for about one minute, Gilmour was
forced to tack away to the right, letting Stars &AMP; Stripes sail
along smoothly in the moderately high winds.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the two crossed paths again, the Japanese boat was
well behind Stars &AMP; Stripes, having sailed slower and getting
forced off to the right side of the course, with Stars &AMP; Stripes
staying closer to the middle.
</P>
<P>
   At the first rounding at the windward mark, Read and Whidden had
given Stars &AMP; Stripes a 17-second lead, one they would build on all
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But even in moderate conditions, a breakdown can strike like
lightning, wipe out a big lead, or take a boat off course. On the
fifth leg, Stars &AMP; Stripes' comfort zone evaporated when the car
got stuck in the spinnaker track, making it impossible to slide the
spinnaker pole into proper position.
</P>
<P>
   For about 2 miles of the leg, crew members worked frantically
with a hacksaw to try cutting the car free, but to no avail. The
crew set the square spinnaker for the final 3 miles, and despite
the pole sticking up at an unwieldy angle, the boat surfed home
through the building seas for a convincing drubbing of Asura.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great race,'' said Whidden, ``and there are going
to be a lot of great races. We got a little jump first and were
glad to have it the way Peter Gilmour kept coming after us all day.
After that first jump, we didn't take much out of them for the rest
of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Whidden said the afterguard did not ease off a bit to rest on
their lead, as was suggested. ``You can never do that with Gilmour.
We had to keep the hammer down all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   In another matchup of leaders, Italy's Prada took on Dawn
Riley's America True, whose skipper John Cutler forced Prada away
just at the gun to take the slight lead across the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   For a long drag race out to the left, the boats looked fairly
even in pure speed before Prada tacked away looking for a
right-hand advantage. After three more minutes, skipper Francesco
De Angeles wheeled Italy's silver and red hull, Luna Rossa (Red
Moon), back across the course to check in with Riley's canary
yellow America True. Italy was slightly ahead on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Twice more Luna Rossa attacked on starboard, and twice made
important gains on America True. By the top mark, Prada's lead was
13 seconds. But down the run, America True, flying a large
asymmetrical headsail, was not able to take much out of Prada,
which flew a more conventional headsail. By the downwind mark,
Prada had a 24-second lead (2 boat lengths), and powered back up
the second beat, applying only loose cover to America True and
allowing it to stretch the lead to comfortable proportions and win
by a full minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was a good, close race today,'' said Riley. ``I do
the runners (backstay winches), and we had a lot of tacks. It was
one great race, and they got the right side of the course. But
we're pleased with our boat and our speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The third race of the day was between AmericaOne, skippered by
Paul Cayard, and Le Defi Francais, sailed by Bertrand Pace.
</P>
<P>
   From the first mix-up in the prestart maneuvering to the first
drag race up the left side of the course to the windward mark,
Cayard's new boat, hull 61, showed blazing speed, rounding 27
seconds ahead of France and never looking back. On the last leg,
Cayard eased off the accelerator and France edged up, though never
seriously threatening. The margin was 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Each boat will sail 10 races in this semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   Pairings for Sunday feature Stars &AMP; Stripes against Prada,
AmericaOne against America True, and France against Nippon.

 &HT;    `Peanuts' creator officially retires, but characters to continue
in other formats
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His message begins, with perfect rightness, ``Dear
Friends'' _ for who in the world doesn't feel like a close personal
pal of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy and all the other
pint-sized legends of ``Peanuts''?
</P>
<P>
   Today Charles M. Schulz bids farewell to his daily installments
of ``Peanuts'' with the letter to readers, bringing to a close the
half-century run of the world's most beloved comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Peanuts'' world won't close up shop. New Sunday strips
will run until Feb. 13, when Schulz plans a final farewell. After
that, newspapers will continue to run daily and Sunday reprints
from the last 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Peanuts'' characters will loom large as ever in a $1
billion-a-year worldwide empire of theme park attractions, videos,
books and other licensed products (would you believe a chain of
Snoopy Place restaurants based in Singapore?).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the day-to-day narrative of ``Peanuts,'' the
ever-unfolding comedy (with streaks of high drama!) is done. For
Charlie Brown, the yearning for the little red-haired girl will be
forever unrequited; the successful football kick (with Lucy
diabolically ``holding'') unconsummated. Schulz, 77 and receiving
chemotherapy for colon cancer, has decided to give up the rigors of
the strip in order to recover his health. Assuming the treatments
are successful, he hopes to concentrate on select ``Peanuts''
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Braddock, a former Atlantan who is creative director for
Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates in Santa Rosa, Calif. (the
six-person studio that coordinates all ``Peanuts'' products), is in
regular contact with Schulz at his California home and says that he
is looking forward to writing screenplays for more ``Peanuts''
animated videos when his cancer treatments are complete. Already in
production in London is ``It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown,''
first of a series of new videos contracted with Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   As for the reprints, they will commence in newspapers Tuesday
with classic strips from as far back as 1974, a cut-off date
stipulated by the cartoonist even though he's been drawing Charlie
Brown and a few other characters since 1950. A spokesman for United
Media, which syndicates the strip to 2,600 papers worldwide,
explained that by 1974, all of the major characters _ including Pig
Pen, Peppermint Patty and Woodstock _ had been introduced, and the
strip had basically achievcurrent look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Schulz isn't as fond of reprinting his earliest strips,
because his drawing style has constantly evolved,'' says Lisa
Wilson of United Media. ``For many younger readers, the '70s strips
will be brand new. We hope that with these reprints we can cushion
the shock of Mr. Schulz's retirement _ give people their daily dose
of `Peanuts' comfort and joy.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who lives for those injections is Sandy
Norman, a homemaker who for the Christmas holidays decorated two
rooms of her Rockmart home with ornaments and plush figures of
Snoopy and Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a cool yet classy dog,'' Norman said of the
multiple-role-playing canine. ``The `Peanuts' characters may be
retiring but I believe there is too much history around for them to
fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Goldfinger of Stone Mountain, Ga., saluted her longtime
favorite, Charlie Brown, who ``thinks he's a loser but he's not,
because he keeps on trying no matter how often the `kite-eating'
tree chomps his kite. Thank you, Charles Schulz, for keeping the
kid alive in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Luckovich, Atlanta Constitution editorial cartoonist, says
that one of the biggest thrills of his career was being asked by
Sparky (as Schulz's friends call him) to advise him on the choice
between two possible endings to a ``Peanuts'' strip. Schulz took
the Atlantan's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Luckovich said many of the nation's foremost syndicated
cartoonists are conspiring to pool their talents and create ``a
very big surprise for Sparky'' in late May, when he will be honored
with the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award at the National
Cartoonists Society Reuben Awards convention in New York. As
recently as last spring, Schulz was spotted outside a convention
hall, tossing a baseball with friends _ keeping in touch with the
all-American wellspring of Charlie Brown's angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparky's a very nice, gentle person, and some people may even
think he's difficult to approach, because he's so shy,'' Luckovich
says. ``I think there's still some Charliein him, after
all.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of Snoopy, too, perhaps. Like the shyest of humans,
Snoopy never spoke, but he had a bold, colorful interior life that
we could telepathically share by means of thought balloons. Like
Snoopy, Schulz could play myriad roles in his own mind. Fittingly,
it's Snoopy that we see in today's final ``Peanuts'' strip, mulling
over the typewriter that's magically balanced on the peak of the
doghouse roof.
</P>
<P>
   It's a portrait of the artist as a young beagle, dreamily
scanning the horizon, interpreting the clouds.

 &HT;    TV 1999: Funny strange, not funny ha-ha
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sitcoms looked pretty sickly and the teen
obsession was a flop, but hourlong dramas made a comeback and one
measly game show changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   Television watchers in 1999 not only chose mature women over
teeny-boppers, they picked Regis Philbin, of all people, over
everybody. It was, to say the least, a curious year trend-wise.
</P>
<P>
   The maturity factor was definitely dominant. The top-rated new
drama last fall was ``Judging Amy,'' about a soft-hearted, late-30s
judge and her sixty-something mother. Close behind was ``Once and
Again,'' about forty-something lovers, and the fast-paced political
saga ``The West Wing.'' The most talked-about new drama last year
was HBO's daring ``The Sopranos,'' about a wacky family of mobsters
led by a cold-blooded but emotionally fragile killer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fox's high-school sudser ``Manchester Prep'' was axed
before its debut, and the promoted-to-death, post-college angst
drama ``Wasteland'' was unwatched-to-death before Thanksgiving. So
much for the networks' plan to revive their sagging viewership with
an infusion of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, acting on a hunch, ABC programming chief Stu
Bloomberg decided to make an American version of a game show that
was a phenomenon in England. There were hopes for its success, but
nobody imagined that ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' would become
a mega-hit. During one of the program's subsequent outings,
``Millionaire'' grabbed seven of the Top 10 slots in the Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived as a one-week experiment, ``Millionaire'' will return
for a third run Jan. 11. Its success has spawned Fox's ``Greed''
and two more entries on the horizon: CBS' ``Winning Lines'' (Jan.
8) and NBC's ``Twenty One'' (Jan. 9).
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a decade, there were more new dramas than
sitcoms last fall _ no small surprise given the current economics
of production and syndication. Dramas cost twice as much as sitcoms
to produce and are much more difficult to sell as syndicated
reruns. But that didn't stop the networks from buying more of them
in '99. And the old ones continued to thrive: ``ER'' ruled the
roost in the ratings, followed by such popular hours as ``Touched
by an Angel,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``The Practice'' and ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and, to a less
spectacular degree, ``Stark Raving Mad'' and ``Sports Night''
(which is really more drama than comedy), new sitcoms were
uninspired and unfunny in 1999. ``Oh, Grow Up'' tried to make us
laugh at three guys in their 30s suffering from a bad case of
arrested development, and ``Love and Money'' proposed the exhausted
premise of romance between a wealthy blueblood and a working-class
stiff. Even I can't remember the forgettable ``Then Came You'' _
and I reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' has such clever writing and physical comedy
(the episode in which Grace's water bra sprang a leak was a
classic) that hardly anybody has bothered to complain about the
show's gay characters. Maybe Jerry Falwell learned his lesson after
trying to out Tinky Winky.
</P>
<P>
   On the news front, President Clinton's impeachment was old news
and hardly anybody watched the Senate vote in '99. Millions (70
million to be exact) did tune in for Barbara Walters'
mother-daughter chat with Monica Lewinsky, however. The news from
that much-watched debacle? Monica has exquisite taste in lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   The news stories that made the biggest splash on TV in 1999 were
the Columbine High School shootings and the death of John Kennedy
Jr. The Columbine mayhem once again stirred the debate about live
breaking news: Is it helpful, intrusive or dangerous? If the young
killers had access to a TV, they might have seen the live shots of
students escaping and taken action. The Kennedy crash raised
questions of propriety, as the TV networks spent most of a week
treating the death as a national crisis rather than the awful
tragedy it was.
</P>
<P>
   The year also saw a continuation of TV's merger madness. With
audiences shrinking and revenues dwindling, the networks are
offering themselves up for ``big bidness'' marriages. CBS and
Viacom united in a $37 billion deal, the largest media merger in
history (surpassing Disney's acquisition of ABC a few years ago),
bringing together the aging baby boomer programming of CBS and the
youth-skewed shows of Viacom's MTV and Nickelodeon. A less
spectacular deal ($400 million) united General Electric-owned NBC
with Paxson Communications, owner of PAX TV.
</P>
<P>
   As television rolls into the next century _ with the promise or
threat of HDTV and hundreds more channels _ it's anybody's guess
what the next batch of trends will be. Sitcom revival? Death of
newsmagazines? Return of quality miniseries? Anything's possible.

 &HT;    THE HARD WORK BEGINS MONDAY IN SYRIA-ISRAEL TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ This time around, it will not be enough to just meet
each other face to face. When Syrian and Israeli negotiators meet
Monday at a secluded West Virginia resort, they confront the tough
details of peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The round of talks could last a week to ten days and follows the
breakthrough last month, when the two countries held their first
formal negotiations in almost four years. They are officially in a
state of war.
</P>
<P>
   A peace deal could end Israel's war in southern Lebanon, a
country largely controlled by Syria, and open Israel's relations
with most of the Arab world. Syria could regain control of the
Golan Heights plateau, which Israel captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak flew to the talks Sunday after
seeking the support of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who leads the powerful
Shas political party. Barak also met with residents of the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were part of a campaign in preparation for a
referendum required to approve a peace deal, which Barak concedes
will require ``painful'' concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second day of the new millennium we are on a mission on
behalf of our people to bring security and peace to Israel,'' Barak
said at the Tel Aviv airport. ``We don't need to wait for another
millennium, another century, or even another 10 years to find a way
to make peace with our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli newspapers reported Sunday that officials in Jerusalem
hoped the meetings will end with a joint statement on the outline
for continued negotiations _ short of the preliminary agreement
originally sought.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. mediators set the talks in Shepherdstown, W. VA., about 70
miles from Washington, in an effort to focus the negotiators and
distance the media. The talks will be held at the Clarion Hotel and
Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy, en route to Shepherdstown, told
Israel's army radio that Israel will ask Syrian President Hafez
Assad to join the talks to prove he is serious about peace. So far,
protocol at the talks has been unbalanced _ Barak has headed the
Israeli team while Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa heads
the Syrian side.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the talks are getting to the nitty-gritty, Barak
expanded his small entourage to include former Israeli Army chief
of staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak.
</P>
<P>
   Shahak, now Israel's tourism minister, negotiated with Syrian
military leaders in 1995. They focused on security matters, which
could be the toughest part of the agenda now. At issue is so-called
``demilitarization,'' just how much military might the two
countries can keep near their borders.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in early December, Shahak stressed that Israel
may concede land, but it will not compromise on security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be reasonable, but we are not going to be
flexible on security,'' Shahak said. ``We have to be convinced. The
Israeli people have to be convinced that they are serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Shahak repeated a now-famous question that he asked Syrian
officials during talks three years ago. Why, he asked, does Syria
station most of its large army on the border with Israel, even
though that border is less than five percent of Syria's
international boundaries?
</P>
<P>
   Syrian officials note that their capital, Damascus, is less than
40 miles from Israeli-controlled territory and Israel's army.
Electronic Israeli listening posts can spy on Syrians in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   As Syrian Foreign Minister al-Sharaa flew to the United States
on Sunday, leading his country's delegation, the Syrian press
expressed doubts over Israel's sincerity since the December
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making progress or suffering a failure is in the hands of the
parties in the peace talks _ especially Israel, which did not give
even a single proof of good intentions. All it offered were words
and promises, which no serious progress could be built on,'' the
Syrian daily, al-Thawra, wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's talks will be opened at noon EST by President Clinton,
who will preside over the first day. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will remain with the negotiations.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Wall Street, the 1990s ended in a virtual dead
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The total amount of money raised in the United States by
investment banks, $2.1 trillion, almost reached the record amount
raised in 1998. And the total number of stock and bond offerings in
American markets _ 17,030 _ also fell just shy of the 1998 total,
according to Thomson Financial/Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many ways, 1999 was a phenomenal year that will be
remembered on Wall Street mostly for its feverish market for
first-time stock offerings and for the era of European mega-mergers
it ushered in. ``It was a pretty extraordinary year in a whole
bunch of respects,'' said Mark Tercek, co-head of the
stock-underwriting business at Goldman Sachs Group.
</P>
<P>
   Never before had investors pumped so much money into shares of
companies selling stock for the first time, many of them
technology-based start-ups that had not earned a nickel of profit.
Never before had the shares of so many newly public companies
proceeded to soar, routinely doubling and often tripling from their
offering prices.
</P>
<P>
   Previous years are linked in the minds of many investors to the
spectacular debuts of particular companies: Netscape in 1995, Yahoo
in 1996, eBay in 1998. But 1999 was so chock-full of stock
offerings that rose like rockets, it is likely to be remembered for
its strength and breadth, rather than for specific success stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The powerful aftermarket performance has been in the tech,
telecom and media area,'' said Richard Kauffman, managing director
of stock underwriting at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``If a
company is outside that area, it is very hard to get deals done.''
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case, at least 90 cents of every dollar raised
from investors came through sales of bonds, but the $2 trillion
American bond market drew relatively scant attention. Certainly, it
was a year in which technology stocks reigned and almost all other
investments got short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is truly a reflection that this whole notion about this new
economy that everyone's talking about, is, in fact, real,'' said
Alan Sheriff, managing director of stock underwriting at Credit
Suisse First Boston. To understand just how much the sands have
shifted, Sheriff said, ``Don't just look at what deals got done,
look at what didn't get done.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a small number of big stock offerings by
blue-chip corporations, such as United Parcel Service's $5.47
billion initial public offering, traditional industries barely
tapped the American stock market in 1999. In general, investment
bankers wanted to sell stock for two kinds of companies: dominant,
extremely profitable franchises or anything with a dot-com attached
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two investment banks separated themselves from the competition,
underwriting plenty of both kinds of stocks. Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ran neck-and-neck all year as the
leading managers of stock offerings, which yield considerably
bigger fees than bond offerings do.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Goldman, Sachs came out ahead, raising $33.7 billion
to Morgan Stanley's $32.7 billion. Goldman's own initial public
offering, which raised $3.66 billion in May and transformed the
last big private partnership on Wall Street, made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the perennial leader in total underwriting,
though not this year in fees, ranked a distant third in stock
underwriting with $17.8 billion, followed closely by Credit Suisse
First Boston. Powered by the technology banking team it hired away
from Deutsche Bank, First Boston became a formidable competitor to
the biggest investment banks in stock underwriting. First Boston
managed 111 offerings that raised $15 billion last year, up from
just $4.5 billion in 34 offerings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill again was the dominant underwriter of bonds, raising
$299 billion through more than 1,800 offerings in a year that was
disrupted by concerns about whether the coming of the year 2000
would alter investor behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Quigley, head of Merrill's global debt-origination business,
said corporate borrowers rushed to issue bonds, in some cases in
mammoth offerings, in the first half of the year out of fear that
demand would dry up as the year-end approached. For their part,
investors stored up cash with the hope of swooping in on bargains
created by the anticipated dislocation in bond markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter, people realized that that investment
strategy was somewhat flawed and they had to fast-forward their
investment plans,'' Quigley said. ``Those fears really dissipated
and money started coming back in the marketplace. We finished the
year pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said he expected that strength to carry into January, as
some borrowers rushed to sell bonds before the Federal Reserve
Board meets again in early February. The Fed governors are widely
expected to raise interest rates again at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Siegel, the head of Morgan Stanley's bond-underwriting
business, said the most notable development in 1999 was the speed
with which corporations, such as Ford Motor and DuPont, were able
to sell billions of dollars' worth of bonds to investors around the
world. In one case last fall, he said, Morgan Stanley rounded up
buyers for $7 billion of DuPont bonds in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great example of the tremendous liquidity in the
market,'' Siegel said. ``The fourth quarter was the slowest quarter
of the year in terms of new-issue volume but activity didn't fall
off a cliff as some were expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said an ongoing boom in corporate mergers and
acquisitions should continue to fuel activity in the bond markets.
``Some borrowers have pent-up financing needs that they've delayed
because of concerns over Y2K,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, Morgan Stanley and Goldman, Sachs also
battled with Merrill for the crown in mergers and acquisitions.
Each of the three New York-based firms advised on deals announced
in 1999 with a combined value of more than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman ranked first, with 417 deals globally, worth $1.3
trillion. Morgan Stanley edged out Merrill Lynch, with each
advising on deals worth about $1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As long as the economies in Europe and the United States remain
healthy, merger activity is likely to continue unabated, said
Steven Heller, the head of Goldman's mergers business. ``It is hard
to find a geographic or industry sector that will not be active''
in 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of mergers swept across Europe in 1999, some of them
leaping across national borders and others having a distinctly
American, hostile flavor to them. At year-end, Vodafone AirTouch, a
British telecommunications company, was pressing an unsolicited
$148 billion bid for Mannesmann of Germany. Goldman is Vodafone's
main adviser and Morgan Stanley and Merrill are among the firms
advising Mannesmann on its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Levy, the head of Merrill's mergers business, predicted
that 2000 would be a much bigger year for mergers. ``The celestial
bodies are all going to be in alignment this year for a very, very
active merger business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One big factor, Levy said, will be the pressure some American
companies will feel to complete acquisitions before accounting rule
changes eliminate transactions structured as ``poolings of
interests,'' in which the acquiring company simply combines the
other company's financial statements. Levy said he also expected
financial-services companies to take advantage of recent changes in
laws that have kept banks, investment banks and insurance companies
out of one another's businesses for decades.
</P>
<P>
   All told, investment banks took in about $3.23 billion in fees
for advising on mergers that were consummated in 1999, up about 11
percent from $2.9 billion in 1998, according to Securities Data.
That came on top of $12.1 billion in disclosed fees from
underwriting sales of stock and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley came out ahead of Goldman, Sachs in fees from
underwriting that were reported to Securities Data, taking in about
$1.9 billion, compared with about $1.75 billion for Goldman, Sachs.
Merrill Lynch, which ranked third with $1.5 billion in fees, was
the only one of the top five firms to take in less in fees for
underwriting last year than in 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those standings demonstrate how much more lucrative it is to
underwrite stocks than bonds. Investment banks receive as much as 7
percent of the proceeds from initial public offerings of stock,
compared with fractions of 1 percent of the proceeds from big
corporate bond offerings.
</P>
<P>
   That is why investment bankers are cheering for a continuation
of the boom in initial stock offerings and are happy to see newly
public technology companies lining up to sell more stock in
follow-on offerings. ``There could be more IPOs this year than last
year,'' said Tercek of Goldman. ``But we think there could be more
volume done on the follow-on side. It's going to be the follow-ons
that make or break those companies.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Americans have not shopped abroad for stocks with
fervor since 1993. And the truth is, they have had little need to
wander the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the three major American stock indexes produced
double-digit returns for the fifth year in a row _ an unprecedented
feat _ and the technology-heavy Nasdaq index popped off the old
charts.
</P>
<P>
   But investors with wanderlust were probably rewarded in 1999.
After running well ahead of the pack for four years, the American
stock market trailed the foreign market average. From 1995 through
1998, U.S. stocks outperformed those everywhere else by an average
of 22.9 percentage points a year, according to performance indexes
compiled by Morgan Stanley Capital International.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, though, the rest of the world's stock markets, taken
as a whole, rose 28.8 percent, well ahead of the 20.9 percent gain
in the United States, according to Morgan Stanley.
   Stocks in emerging markets bounced back from a dismal 1998 to
lead the way with a gain of 63.7 percent. Europe, which was fairly
competitive with the United States in 1997 and 1998, did well again
for local investors. But the unexpected decline of Europe's new
11-nation currency, the euro, against the dollar, eroded most of
the gains for American investors. The Morgan Stanley index of the
11 euro markets and Britain, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland climbed
14.1 percent in dollar terms last year. In local currency, the
index gained 27.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the big surprise was Japan, whose stocks rose 60.6
percent in dollar terms after a decade in the doldrums. From its
high at the end of 1989, the Japanese stock market plunged 58
percent in dollar terms to its low in October 1998. Even with this
year's rally, Japanese stocks are still 16.1 percent below their
1989 peak in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Japanese equities, Americans have been
selling more foreign stocks than they have been buying in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change. Many Americans are noticing that their
portfolios are not doing as well as the big-name stock indexes
might suggest. At the end of the year, according to Salomon Smith
Barney, about two-thirds of the stocks traded on the New York Stock
Exchange were at least 20 percent below their 52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   And a failure of U.S. stock indexes to meet investors' extremely
high expectations could spur more portfolio adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman Sachs, says
that opportunities in foreign markets could become attractive to
American investors this year. ``We see two catalysts for increased
U.S. participation in non-U.S. equities,'' she wrote in her Year
2000 outlook. ``First, if U.S. returns are good, not great,
investors may be willing to move out along the perceived risk
curve. Second, global economic conditions are less worrisome than
they have been in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally last year in emerging markets was powered by a
faster-than-expected improvement in local economies, especially in
Asia, and the ease with which Brazil and its investors negotiated
that country's currency decline last January.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best performers in dollar terms were: Russia, up 246.2
percent; Turkey, up 244.4 percent; Malaysia, 111.6 percent;
Indonesia, 92 percent; South Korea, 90.2 percent; India, 84.7
percent; and Brazil, 73 percent. Except for South Korea, all these
markets had fallen sharply in 1998. Russia's stock index, in dollar
terms, is still 141 percent from its 1997 high, although it rallied
sharply New Year's Eve on the news of President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The leading performers among major companies in emerging markets
were: Infosys Technologies of India, up 858.3 percent; SK Telecom
of South Korea, up 620.9 percent; and United Microelectronics of
Taiwan, up 228.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend that these markets, which suffered during
the global financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, should outdo Wall
Street again this year, though performance in one year is no
guarantee of future returns.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pelosky, global emerging-markets strategist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, said that gains could become more concentrated
in a few big and well-known companies, mirroring some of the shift
to a narrow group of leaders in the American stock market. ``The
top 100 stocks in the Morgan Stanley emerging- markets index have
already significantly outperformed the rest of the stocks in the
index this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in European stocks was led by technology, media and
telecommunications companies, as was the American stock market.
Over the last three months, the technology, media and
telecommunications stocks in a Merrill Lynch index of European
stocks have jumped 57 percent while the rest of the stocks in the
index are up just 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The top gainers included: Nokia of Finland, up 194.7 percent,
Ericsson of Sweden, up 168.9 percent; and Deutsche Telekom of
Germany, up 116.3 percent. The best markets, in dollar terms, were:
Finland, up 150.7 percent; France, up 28 percent; and Germany, up
18.7 percent. Italy fell 1.5 percent while Belgium plunged 15.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year could be more difficult for European stocks if, as
some analysts expect, the rebound in economic growth there is
strong enough to force the European Central Bank to start raising
interest rates. Higher rates make financing more costly for
companies and serve to depress corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reasonably cautious on the European market for the
year,'' said Plum Shipton, European equity strategist for Merrill
Lynch in London, because of the threat of higher interest rates and
the already high valuation of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, investors began scrambling back into stocks as the
government worked to shore up the banking system and as the first
signs of economic recovery appeared. The rush of mutual fund
managers and institutional investors _ who had ignored Japan for
years _ was one of the more important market moves of 1999. Their
purchases of Japanese stocks increased demand for the yen and
pushed the currency to a four-year high against the dollar. The
yen's surge forced the Japanese government to intervene repeatedly
in the currency markets in a futile attempt to curb the currency's
rise, lest Japanese exports be priced out of foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Like Europe and the United States, much of the stock rally in
Japan has come on the back of technology and telecommunications
stocks. And like Europe, Japan provided a currency lesson for
American investors. In this case, it was a positive one, with about
25 percent of the returns posted by American investors coming from
the rise in the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big stocks to post outsized gains were Softbank Corp.,
up 1,485 percent, but still well below its 1996 high, and Kyocera
Corp., up 389.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Allan, a senior vice president and longtime Japan
watcher at Scudder Kemper Investments, says the pace of economic
growth bears watching. ``Many Japanese are still worried about
losing their jobs,'' she said, and that fear is dampening the
consumer spending needed to push the economy ahead. ``Increased
consumer spending is key for a second leg of the economic
recovery.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Half awake in the dawn, I knew I was in a bedroom in Berlin. In
the bed an attractive young German woman was having a bad dream.
She tossed and turned and uttered anguished cries. Suddenly I was
in the dream. A U-boat with a knight's head on the conning tower
was cruising through the Atlantic's gray depths. Around it exploded
a half-dozen depth charges. The boat tilted on its side and began
to sink.
</P>
<P>
   Now I _ and the woman _ were inside the boat, watching the
drowning men gasp for a last breath as the water rose around them.
We swam through the chaos until we reached the control room, where
the captain, the woman's husband, awaited death with stoic
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Then we were outside the U-boat again. Out of the depths swam a
gigantic angel, as large as the boat, with huge staring eyes and a
fixed hieratic smile. This incredible creature embraced the dying
boat in its immense arms. Back in the Berlin bedroom the woman
awoke and thought: ``The Path. The angel is part of the Path.''
</P>
<P>
   I awoke in my bedroom on East 72nd Street in Manhattan and raced
to my computer. In an hour I had written the first chapter of my
1994 novel, ``Loyalties.'' In succeeding years I've puzzled more
than once about where this vision came from. It utterly defies
rational analysis. I was not thinking about writing a novel about
the German resistance to Hitler, which is what the book became. I
had only the dimmest knowledge about these tragic patriots, gleaned
from reading Anthony Cave Brown's ``Bodyguard of Lies'' two or
three years earlier. Why did it erupt in my imagination?
</P>
<P>
   I had a similar experience with my 1992 novel, ``Over There.''
This was a book I had planned to write for years. It was going to
be about my father, who had been promoted from sergeant to
lieutenant during the battle of the Argonne. ``Teddy Fleming as the
immortal sergeant'' was the way I summed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, one morning I awoke with a vision of a drunken white
colonel driving a car down a highway outside San Antonio at
suicidal speed. Beside him sat a frowning black sergeant. The
colonel had a name: Malvern Hill Bliss. He was the son of a
Maryland Confederate who had lost a leg in the Civil War battle of
Malvern Hill. He was a Catholic whose wife and son had recently
been killed by a Moro guerrilla in Mindinao. He was driving to a
brothel where (I knew) Gen. John J. Pershing would interrupt Bliss'
drunken amours to tell him that President Wilson had made Pershing
head of the American Expeditionary Force and that he was taking
Bliss to Europe with him to command a division.
</P>
<P>
   In this whirling kaleidoscope Teddy Fleming as the immortal
sergeant virtually vanished. In the final version of the novel he
had little more than a walk-on part. This outburst of imagination
was almost as mysterious as the birth of ``Loyalties.'' But I could
at least glimpse what my imagination was telling me. In most
histories and novels, World War I seemed to be the triumph of death
over life. My imagination was urging me to write a different book.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing was taking Bliss to Europe with him because he, too,
had been wounded by death, the soldier's enemy. He had lost his
wife and three children 15 months before, in a fire in their San
Francisco quarters. He was summoning Bliss, the one man who
understood what he felt, to help him confront death's terrific
challenge, as well as the awesome task of rescuing the French and
British from the brink of collapse and defeat. In a landscape of
death ``Over There'' became a life-affirming book.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences have convinced me that Cushing Strout, the
Cornell critic, knows whereof he speaks in his brilliant book ``The
Veracious Imagination.'' He argues that the imagination is not
simply a mental device that ``makes things up.'' On the contrary,
it is an intellectual tool, closely wedded to the writer's
intelligence. What it chooses to imagine for a novel is integrally
connected to the essence of what the writer, consciously or
unconsciously, wants to say about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The visionary flash that gave birth to my 1987 novel, ``Time And
Tide,'' illustrates this insight. I had been in the Navy during
World War II and for 25 years had tried to write a novel about my
experience. But I could never devise a satisfactory plot. One
evening I was researching the battle of Savo Island for an article.
This 1942 clash off Guadalcanal was a dolorous American defeat. The
conduct of the heavy cruiser USS Chicago was baffling. She had
sailed  &UR; away  &LR; from the Japanese enemy after taking a single hit.
After the battle, in which four other cruisers were sunk, the
Chicago's captain was relieved in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   In a swirling moment I suddenly saw the story that had eluded me
for so long. The cruiser's captain, flamboyant, career-driven
Winfield Kemble, would be relieved by his modest, low-keyed
Annapolis roommate and best friend, Arthur McKay, who has orders to
find out what happened off Savo that night and to make Kemble the
scapegoat for the defeat. The imaginary ship would be the USS
Jefferson City, a fitting name for the metaphor of American society
that I hoped to make her.
</P>
<P>
   The two captains would sum up the clash of ambition and
integrity and friendship that often rolls American military men and
their wives at the higher levels of command and also affects
boardrooms and executive suites in peacetime America.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a novel emerges simply as a voice, saying something
that sounds almost silly at first. In the late '60s I spent four
years writing a history of the U.S. Military Academy at West Poimet many officers' wives and found them fascinating. They saw the
Army experience in ways dramatically different from their husbands.
For the next few years I heard a voice whispering:
</P>
<P>
   The officers wives
</P>
<P>
   The officers' wives
</P>
<P>
   That's what we'll be
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't make much sense. Ten years later the entire novel _
the three very different women who were main characters, their
husbands, their children _ surfaced, fully developed, ready to
write. The song was sung at a party in the first chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Tavern,'' my 1975 novel set in Revolutionary New
Jersey, had an even stranger genesis. I saw a man making a toast:
``Here's to all those that we love. Here's to all them that love
us.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowded room responds: ``Here's to all them that love those
that love them. Love those that love them that love us!'' These
words turned out to be the last lines of the novel. They were the
key to the main character, Jonathan Gifford, the ex-British officer
who dominates the book.
</P>
<P>
   My latest novel, ``Hours of Gladness,'' emerged as a single
word: Mick. Then it became Mick O'Day. The name kept pushing
against my consciousness. Slowly the character appeared: an
Irish-American spiritually wounded by Vietnam, living with his
fellow Irish-Americans in a New Jersey shore town with the
Vietnamese woman he loved now a refugee living nearby, untouchable,
alienated forever.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me how or why these things happen in my head. I only
hope my brand of Strout's veracious imagination keeps working. At
the moment another voice is whispering, ``My three beauties.'' It
has something to do with my father and his two hell-raising
brothers. So far that's all I know. But I suspect there's more to
come.

   Vigorous low pressure moving northeast from the central
Mississippi Valley will produce widespread inclement weather from
the eastern Plains to the interior Northeast. Rain will be locally
heavy near the path of the low-pressure center as it moves from
eastern Missouri early Monday to the eastern Great Lakes Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   As the low strengthens Monday afternoon, gusty winds will import
colder air through the Great Lakes states into the central
Mississippi Valley. As a result, rain will mix with snow and some
sleet over parts of the central and southern Great Lakes states
Monday afternoon. The mixture will change to snow overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Farther to the southwest, the rain will change quickly to snow
in the southern Missouri valley Monday where accumulations up to a
few inches are possible. Meanwhile, the northern Plains will have
chilly winds and scattered light snow and flurries.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the East Coast states will be unusually mild, but chilly
air will linger north of a front in northern New England. Some
sunshine will bathe areas of the Middle Atlantic and Southeast
coast where temperatures in the 60s and 70s will be common. Clouds
will thicken near the Appalachians as showers approach from the
west. A few thunderstorms will precede a cold front in the interior
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will cover most of the West. Rain and mountain snow
will develop near the northwest coast as a warm front approaches.
Elsewhere in the West, generally dry weather will prevail, although
a few mountain snow showers will occur in the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Cold Bay's Coldest
</P>
<P>
   In much of the contiguous United States, a mild December
punctuated another very mild year. In stark contrast, Cold Bay,
Alaska, lived up to its name by measuring its coldest December and
coldest year on record. Cold Bay is 30 miles from the end of the
Alaskan peninsula at the beginning of the Aleutian archipelago.
Arctic air masses approaching from the interior of the state are
typically modified by the surrounding waters. In the past year an
unusual number of surges of chill from over the frozen waters of
the Bering Sea to the north led to the record chill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Half awake in the dawn, I knew I was in a bedroom in Berlin. In
the bed an attractive young German woman was having a bad dream.
She tossed and turned and uttered anguished cries. Suddenly I was
in the dream. A U-boat with a knight's head on the conning tower
was cruising through the Atlantic's gray depths. Around it exploded
a half-dozen depth charges. The boat tilted on its side and began
to sink.
</P>
<P>
   Now I _ and the woman _ were inside the boat, watching the
drowning men gasp for a last breath as the water rose around them.
We swam through the chaos until we reached the control room, where
the captain, the woman's husband, awaited death with stoic
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Then we were outside the U-boat again. Out of the depths swam a
gigantic angel, as large as the boat, with huge staring eyes and a
fixed hieratic smile. This incredible creature embraced the dying
boat in its immense arms. Back in the Berlin bedroom the woman
awoke and thought: ``The Path. The angel is part of the Path.''
</P>
<P>
   I awoke in my bedroom on East 72nd Street in Manhattan and raced
to my computer. In an hour I had written the first chapter of my
1994 novel, ``Loyalties.'' In succeeding years I've puzzled more
than once about where this vision came from. It utterly defies
rational analysis. I was not thinking about writing a novel about
the German resistance to Hitler, which is what the book became. I
had only the dimmest knowledge about these tragic patriots, gleaned
from reading Anthony Cave Brown's ``Bodyguard of Lies'' two or
three years earlier. Why did it erupt in my imagination?
</P>
<P>
   I had a similar experience with my 1992 novel, ``Over There.''
This was a book I had planned to write for years. It was going to
be about my father, who had been promoted from sergeant to
lieutenant during the battle of the Argonne. ``Teddy Fleming as the
immortal sergeant'' was the way I summed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, one morning I awoke with a vision of a drunken white
colonel driving a car down a highway outside San Antonio at
suicidal speed. Beside him sat a frowning black sergeant. The
colonel had a name: Malvern Hill Bliss. He was the son of a
Maryland Confederate who had lost a leg in the Civil War battle of
Malvern Hill. He was a Catholic whose wife and son had recently
been killed by a Moro guerrilla in Mindinao. He was driving to a
brothel where (I knew) Gen. John J. Pershing would interrupt Bliss'
drunken amours to tell him that President Wilson had made Pershing
head of the American Expeditionary Force and that he was taking
Bliss to Europe with him to command a division.
</P>
<P>
   In this whirling kaleidoscope Teddy Fleming as the immortal
sergeant virtually vanished. In the final version of the novel he
had little more than a walk-on part. This outburst of imagination
was almost as mysterious as the birth of ``Loyalties.'' But I could
at least glimpse what my imagination was telling me. In most
histories and novels, World War I seemed to be the triumph of death
over life. My imagination was urging me to write a different book.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing was taking Bliss to Europe with him because he, too,
had been wounded b, the soldier's enemy. He had lost his
wife and three children 15 months before, in a fire in their San
Francisco quarters. He was summoning Bliss, the one man who
understood what he felt, to help him confront death's terrific
challenge, as well as the awesome task of rescuing the French and
British from the brink of collapse and defeat. In a landscape of
death ``Over There'' became a life-affirming book.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences have convinced me that Cushing Strout, the
Cornell critic, knows whereof he speaks in his brilliant book ``The
Veracious Imagination.'' He argues that the imagination is not
simply a mental device that ``makes things up.'' On the contrary,
it is an intellectual tool, closely wedded to the writer's
intelligence. What it chooses to imagine for a novel is integrally
connected to the essence of what the writer, consciously or
unconsciously, wants to say abosubject.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The visionary flash that gave birth to my 1987 novel, ``Time And
Tide,'' illustrates this insight. I had been in the Navy during
World War II and for 25 years had tried to write a novel about my
experience. But I could never devise a satisfactory plot. One
evening I was researching the battle of Savo Island for an article.
This 1942 clash off Guadalcanal was a dolorous American defeat. The
conduct of the heavy cruiser USS Chicago was baffling. She had
sailed  &UR; away  &LR; from the Japanese enemy after taking a single hit.
After the battle, in which four other cruisers were sunk, the
Chicago's captain was relieved in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   In a swirling moment I suddenly saw the story that had eluded me
for so long. The cruiser's captain, flamboyant, career-driven
Winfield Kemble, would be relieved by his modest, low-keyed
Annapolis roommate and best friend, Arthur McKay, who has orders to
find out what happened off Savo that night and to make Kemble the
scapegoat for the defeat. The imaginary ship would be the USS
Jefferson City, a fitting name for the metaphor of American society
that I hoped to make her.
</P>
<P>
   The two captains would sum up the clash of ambition and
integrity and friendship that often rolls American military men and
their wives at the higher levels of command and also affects
boardrooms and executive suites in peacetime America.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a novel emerges simply as a voice, saying something
that sounds almost silly at first. In the late '60s I spent four
years writing a history of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
I met many officers' wives and found them fascinating. They saw the
Army experience in ways dramatically different from their husbands.
For the next few years I heard a voice whispering:
</P>
<P>
   The officers wives
</P>
<P>
   The officers' wives
</P>
<P>
   That's what we'll be
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't make much sense. Ten years later the entire novel _
the three very different women who were main characters, their
husbands, their children _ surfaced, fully developed, ready to
write. The song was sung at a party in the first chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Tavern,'' my 1975 novel set in Revolutionary New
Jersey, had an even stranger genesis. I saw a man making a toast:
``Here's to all those that we love. Here's to all them that love
us.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowded room responds: ``Here's to all them that love those
that love them. Love those that love them that love us!'' These
words turned out to be the last lines of the novel. They were the
key to the main character, Jonathan Gifford, the ex-British officer
who dominates the book.
</P>
<P>
   My latest novel, ``Hours of Gladness,'' emerged as a single
word: Mick. Then it became Mick O'Day. The name kept pushing
against my consciousness. Slowly the character appeared: an
Irish-American spiritually wounded by Vietnam, living with his
fellow Irish-Americans in a New Jersey shore town with the
Vietnamese woman he loved now a refugee living nearby, untouchable,
alienated forever.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me how or why these things happen in my head. I only
hope my brand of Strout's veracious imagination keeps working. At
the moment another voice is whispering, ``My three beauties.'' It
has something to do with my father and his two hell-raising
brothers. So far that's all I know. But I suspect there's more to
come.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a late Friday afternoon in December, when most Silicon Valley
executives were heading to their Napa Valley estates for the
weekend, Vinod Khosla was tucked away in his office in Menlo Park,
Calif., talking about God.
</P>
<P>
   As an 11-year-old growing up in his native India, he says, he
came to believe that organized religion was just a centuries-old
form of social control; a fear of God was the only way to make an
unruly population behave.
</P>
<P>
   But such notions now are outdated, he says, adding that in the
next 100 years, ``traditional religion will be as relevant as witch
doctors are today.'' That is especially true, he continues, for
religious leaders like the pope, who ``chooses to talk about gays,
abortion and priests not being women, when he could use his power
in better ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas from one of Silicon Valley's premier venture
capitalists are not standard dot-com fare. But then, Khosla, a
partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, is far from typical.
In the 15 years he has been a Kleiner Perkins partner, he has had
little time for small thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Khosla started his first company at age 25. Two years later, he
co-founded Sun Microsystems. At age 44, his vision has turned
metaphysical, to a time when human thought melds with computer
intelligence, blurring the lines between people and machines.
</P>
<P>
   But four years ago, ideas of a more immediate and practical
nature resulted in his most ambitious project to date. He was
struck by the notion that as the Internet was transformed into a
mass medium, telecommunications companies would soon need equipment
to push data over fiber optic networks faster and more cheaply. No
such technology existed at the time. So Khosla, who typically
concentrates on investing in promising companies, set out to find a
team of entrepreneurs to create the next generation of computer
networking.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, optical networking, as the idea came to be known, was
one of the hottest new areas in the technology sector, reaping rich
rewards for Khosla, Kleiner Perkins and the companies they had
backed. To name just the highlights, Cerent Corp. was sold to Cisco
Systems for $7.3 billion in stock, the most ever paid for a private
technology company; Siara Systems, which has yet to test a product,
announced in November it was being sold to Redback Networks for an
astounding $4.3 billion in stock; and Juniper Networks, a maker of
optical networking equipment, has seen its shares jump 900 percent
since it went public in June, giving it a market value of more than
$17.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Khosla's personality both attracts and repels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is probably the biggest thinker I have ever seen,'' said
Joe Kraus, a co-founder of Excite, the Kleiner Perkins-backed
search engine that merged last year with another of the firm's
companies, the high-speed cable Internet service (At)Home. ``But
the challenge is in the presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Khosla is often described as abrasive and overbearing, a
busybody who is loath to let entrepreneurs run their own show. But
loyalists say his strength is the ability to spot opportunities
that others miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I can be too `in love' with my companies,'' he
says. ``But I've earned the freedom to be honest and more blunt.''
On his desk sits a Beanie Baby rhinoceros given to him by his four
children as a reminder of how bruising he can be. But ultimately
the only thing that matters, he says, ``is whether entrepreneurs
come back or not.''
</P>
<P>
   And come back they do, if only because his laserlike focus
commands attention in a Valley filled with white noise and hype.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Russo, Cerent's former chief executive, said some in
Silicon Valley use a Hollywood metaphor to describe Khosla: ``Vinod
is the worst director of movies, but he is the best picker of
scripts.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many who have worked closely with Khosla say they would
consider it again. Among them is Kraus, who met Khosla, an early
backer of Excite, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd need a vacation before I decided to do that again,''
allows Kraus, now a senior vice president of content at
Excite(AT)Home. ``But I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a man whose ideas Khosla once described as ``amateur
hour.'' Worse, on April Fool's Day in 1996, Khosla tricked Kraus,
then 25 years old, into believing that Excite's public stock
offering had been canceled hours before the stock began trading.
(Khosla said he let Kraus stew for a half-hour before letting him
in on the joke.)
</P>
<P>
   But in the summer of 1996, their relationship nearly ended.
Kraus recalls one afternoon when Khosla had chided him once too
many times about an executive Khosla disliked. ``I absolutely lost
it,'' Kraus says of the incident. ``I hung up on him. After that, I
sat there stunned in my chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Kraus' cellular phone rang. ``Vinod was on
the phone, laughing,'' Kraus recalls. ``He said, `That's so
good.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was classic Vinod.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this characteristic of unrelentingness,'' says George
Bell, the president of Excite(AT)Home. ``At the end of the day, you
just want to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tales make Khosla cringe. For him, playing devil's advocate
_ no matter how painful it can be _ is essential to helping
entrepreneurs think critically. ``I like having impact,'' he says.
``They'll also tell you that they didn't doubt my loyalty or my
passion.'' Still, to make sure entrepreneurs he has not worked with
know what is in store, he demands that they speak to past
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Khosla grew up in New Delhi, where he earned a degree in
electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology. In
1976, he moved to the United States with his childhood girlfriend,
now his wife, Neeru, and got a master's degree in biomedical
engineering from Carnegie-Mellon University. He then moved to Palo
Alto, Calif., where he earned an MBA at Stanford University in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That year he co-founded his first company, Daisy Systems, a
now-defunct concern that specialized in computer-aided design. But
more importantly, he began formulating his ideas about networking
computers. He wanted to build a workstation that would handle the
complex operations that a mainframe computer could, but that was
inexpensive and easy to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, a Stanford secretary suggested that Khosla meet a
German graduate student, Andreas Bechtolsheim, who was then
licensing such a computer design for $10,000 to local companies.
Khosla suggested they build it themselves, and in February 1982,
Sun Microsystems was born. Khosla became chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While the two men remain close friends, Khosla's intensity was
too much for the corporate suite, say former associates. Scott
McNealy, a friend who shared a townhouse with Khosla and his wife
at one time, had joined Sun at Khosla's urging and was later named
president. But while Khosla was credited with the vision to build a
Fortune 500 company, he was not as smooth as McNealy. So in 1984,
Khosla was replaced by his former roommate. Friends say he was
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Today he says, ``I think I helped in some way to change the way
computing was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Khosla, then a 30-year-old multimillionaire,
joined Kleiner but also indulged in a number of diversions. He took
up skydiving and whitewater rafting, undertook a worldwide search
to find an architect to build his Portola Valley home in the style
of Frank Lloyd Wright, threw away his calendar for a year and
started renovating a vineyard on his property. Today, his Three Dog
Vineyards, named for his pets, makes 1,000 bottles of cabernet
sauvignon a year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not all his early Kleiner ventures were blessed. One troubled
company was Go Corp., which in the late 1980s promised the first
pen-operated computer. After spending six years and more than $75
million, Go went bust. Khosla also had a hand in the 3DO Co., a
game maker that has survived but failed to deliver as promised.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Valley say Khosla most excels at networking _ and
they're not just talking about a system for connecting computers.
For example, Khosla met Pradeep Sindhu, the entrepreneur behind
Juniper Networks, through Bechtolsheim in early 1996. At the time,
he says, Sindhu was trying to figure out how to make cheaper
routers. Khosla suggested he try to make them more efficient
instead and provided $200,000 in seed money.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions helped crystallize Khosla's ideas about optical
networking. Later that year, he met another entrepreneur who wanted
to increase network efficiency. That relationship spawned two
companies: Cerent, which now makes boxes to increase traffic over
networks, and Siara, which is still developing a product. And
Khosla says he is backing several other companies in the optical
networking field.
</P>
<P>
   If Khosla cherishes anything besides work, which he calls his
``hobby,'' it is his children. ``I still cut my 11-year-old
daughter's hair,'' he says, giggling with delight. ``I love taking
the girls shopping for clothes. I like to hear them talk.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The walls of his office are plastered with their photographs,
and his assistant keeps a log of how many times he misses dinner
with his family. Last June was a bad month: He was away eight
nights.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He often loads the family into their GMC Suburban, he says, and
heads to Big Sur, where he built a house with stunning views of the
Pacific. Like most Silicon Valley tycoons, he has a trophy car, a
Lamborghini, but the car, like his personal wealth, is not
discussed. Whatever the accuracy of Forbes magazine's estimate that
he is worth more than $1 billion, Khosla's good life includes
annual family trips to Aspen, Hawaii and Deer Valley.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a two-hour interview, Khosla has steered the
conversation to what inspires him most _ the future of technology.
One day, human thoughts will be downloaded into computers, he
predicts. ``Experience is a collection of memories and rules that
get imbedded in the brain,'' he observes. ``So when is a human not
a computer?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He then falls silent, in a rare moment of self-consciousness.
``I should shut up,'' he says finally. ``I don't want to sound
weird.''
</P>
<P>
   But such notions are already legend among those who know him
well. Bechtolsheim says his friend's fascination with the
relationship of religion and computers drives him professionally as
well as personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impressed by the power of the pope and is probably trying
to see how he can replicate it at a high-tech company,''
Bechtolsheim chuckles. ``It's the ultimate leverage.''

E-COMMERCE REPORT: MANUFACTURERS GRAPPLE WITH ONLINE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as Amazon.com has, for better or worse, led millions of
would-be entrepreneurs toward the e-commerce promised land, so too
has the success of Dell Computer Corp. led countless manufacturers
to believe that their future success rides on the ability to sell
directly to consumers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits are manifest: tighter control of inventory, better
information about customers and, most of all, a simpler
distribution system with no retailers or distributors to inflate
the price of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers who have ventured onto the Web have found it can
be an inhospitable place, however _ and not just because e-commerce
sites are such cash-hungry ventures. More to the point,
manufacturers have discovered that unless they can convince their
retail partners and distributors they are not out to steal sales
from them, bad things can happen to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers and distributors are not above reminding
their suppliers that they can choose not to carry their products,
for instance, or can relegate their products to the bottom shelf,
and thereby eliminate the riches manufacturers hope to gain from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The industry term for this issue is ``channel conflict,'' and as
is the case with many conundrums caused by the Internet, there are
few clear answers to the questions raised. Yet the issue will arise
with greater frequency and is certain to affect the future of Web
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by Mainspring Inc., a consulting
firm in Cambridge, Mass., several issues determine the success of
direct sales by manufacturers on the Web. First, they must have a
product that lends itself to Internet selling. Custom items like
wedding dresses, for example, would not make good Web products,
while jeans would. Second, they must consider whether they could
fulfill orders efficiently on their own. In this respect,
refrigerators would not be a likely candidate, while small
appliances might work.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Chu, a Mainspring analyst, says that once a manufacturer
has determined it can sell products online at a profit, it must
consider whether its brick-and-mortar distributors are strong
enough to retaliate. If a manufacturer dominates a market, he says,
retailers will be much less likely to object, because they need to
carry its products to survive. Likewise, if the industry as a whole
is moving toward a direct-selling approach _ as happened in the PC
industry _ retailers will have no choice but to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the answers to these questions, Chu says,
manufacturers can choose one of three options _ start an e-commerce
site while appeasing distributors, avoid selling on the Web
altogether or sell on the Web with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is one recent example of a manufacturer selling with
impunity, although it has made some tacit concessions to resellers.
``We're in what's best described as a period of detente with
retailers,'' said Vada Manager, a Nike spokesman. ``Of course, when
a manufacturer as large as Nike with as much market share sells
online, retailers will react with some uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   To mollify retailers, Manager said, Nike sent a letter before
and immediately after the company began selling products on its Web
site last February, explaining how the site would not undermine
their efforts. Among other things, the company stressed that
Nike.com never sells at prices lower than retail, and that it would
promote a ``store locator'' function on the site, allowing users to
find retailers in their area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the company has ``been able to navigate
the shark-infested waters of channel conflict'' by being extra kind
to its largest resellers, like Venator Group, which owns Foot
Locker, Champs Sports and a number of other sporting goods chains.
Nike allowed Venator to sell the Air2 Max shoe exclusively last
year in its retail stores and online _ ``which probably netted them
$200 million in revenue,'' Manager said.
</P>
<P>
   More concrete examples are evident in Compaq Computer Corp.'s
appeasement of distributors and retailers since it began selling
computers online about five years ago. According to Mainspring,
Compaq experienced a 12 percent drop in commercial PC revenues in
recent years as a result of retailiation from resellers who
objected to the manufacturer's online selling.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, however, Compaq has gone to great lengths to
bring its resellers back into the fold by committing more resources
to the sales and advertising efforts of companies that sell Compaq
products to business customers. At the same time, it has begun a
program whereby retailers like Radio Shack earn an undisclosed fee
for every Compaq computer bought from one of the 9,000 Compaq
Internet kiosks the company has placed in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always marvel at the fact that their notebook computers
can do what a mainframe did 10 years ago,'' said Jim Finlaw, a
Compaq spokesman. ``But people don't look at the evolution of how
this stuff is sold, too. The channel will evolve. It's in constant
motion.''
</P>
<P>
   While some manufacturers have established an Internet presence,
far more have avoided the direct-selling model altogether. In some
cases, however, companies are actually doing both. Procter &AMP;
Gamble, for one, has opted not to sell its vast lineup of beauty
care products online but has instead created an entirely new brand
of personalized beauty products, Reflect.com, to sell on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was P &AMP; G's genius to remove the barrier of channel
conflict by forming a new brand,'' said Andrew Swinand, director of
marketing for Reflect, which was formed in September and is
majority-owned by Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts often say the direct-sales model benefits consumers
primarily by allowing manufacturers to offer lower prices _ an
argument Swinand disputes. ``That ends up hurting brand equity,''
he said, because consumers may then associate the brand with
lower-priced, lower-quality companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Orlowski, vice president of information systems with the
National Association of Manufacturers, says: ``There's a lot more
talk about how e-commerce is good for manufacturers than there is
proof that it's good for every industry. It's a real tough sell in
general, because no one wants to add staff or re-engineer their
business processes without a guarantee there'll be revenue there to
support it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that Dell was built to work this way from the
start, because they were selling direct,'' Orlowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Such caveats aside, Anne Standley, who prepared a recent report
on channel conflict for Mindspring, said consumers can still expect
manufacturers to get online and at least prepare to sell. ``A lot
of e-commerce is trial and error,'' Ms. Standley said. ``If
manufacturers don't face the high risk of alienating retailers, at
least they should get online to get that process going sooner, so
they'll be ready to take advantage of technology that's not
available now.''

NEW TOOLS FOR SNIFFING OUT TAX CHEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Been cutting corners on your income tax return? Claiming more in
charitable deductions than you gave away? Understating income from
your business?
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the decade, it will probably be much tougher to
shortchange Uncle Sam _ or state tax agencies, for that matter _
than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   At present, a big decline in audits and other enforcement
efforts by the Internal Revenue Service, which has suffered from
budget cuts and is under orders from Congress to focus on helping
taxpayers instead of finding tax cheats, has encouraged many people
to play fast and loose with their income tax returns, according to
tax professionals and IRS workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation could change significantly, thanks to new
technology being designed for the IRS to improve service to
taxpayers. It can also be used to track known tax cheats and to
identify patterns of cheating and fraud. Some states have already
acquired a version of the technology and used it with promising
results.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, being developed for the IRS by Computer Sciences
Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., will be able to feed data from every
entry on every tax return, personal or corporate, through filters
to identify patterns of taxpayer conduct. Those taxpayers whose
returns suggest that they are highly likely to owe more taxes could
then quickly be sorted out and their tax returns audited.
</P>
<P>
   That is not, however, where IRS officials want to focus public
attention. The IRS commissioner, Charles Rossotti, wants to
emphasize improved service to what he calls the IRS customers, and
new technology is the key to that goal. Rossotti says that by
focusing on helping people who want to comply, the IRS can bring in
much more money than by focusing on willful tax avoidance and
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cosgrave, the IRS chief information officer, said, ``In our
effort to run the IRS more like a business, we are trying to bring
in a lot of commercial practices'' that are intended to raise more
revenue through making compliance easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thrust of computer modernization is to help us
provide better service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgrave acknowledged that the data-mining technology eventually
would allow the IRS to find both outright frauds and small-scale
cheating. In its current customer-friendly mode, the IRS does not
like to call taxpayers cheats when they cut a few corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that stuff `math errors,''' Cosgrave said, but of
course when the IRS finds them, it then corrects the ``errors'' and
bills the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The database technology that the IRS will install to track tax
returns will be similar in many ways to the databases used by
American Express, Citibank and other big credit issuers to decide
which charges to approve and which advertisements to slip in the
mail with monthly bills. Identifying the behavior patterns of
customers is one of the most valuable features of these databases.
</P>
<P>
   In two years or so, the IRS hopes to start building twin
databases on each segment of taxpayers, such as salaried workers,
small businesses and large corporations. In each segment, one
database will be designed to take in revenue rapidly and issue
refunds, while the second will compile and store data that can be
mined for information by auditors and by customer-service agents
helping people at walk-in centers.
</P>
<P>
   With quick and easy access to data about individual taxpayers,
both auditors and tax collectors will be able to identify targets
better and spend less time on clerical chores, Cosgrave said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kansas Revenue Department has already installed a modern
computer system based on this type of technology that allows it to
look up information on individual taxpayers quickly, often
resolving such problems as a lost check by issuing a new one in
less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few years, once all the kinks are worked out, the
system will also be used to look for patterns of cheating, said Pat
Compton, a management analyst with the Kansas Revenue Department.
</P>
<P>
   For example, by analyzing sales-tax reports from convenience
stores, the state could identify enterprises that appeared most
likely to be shutting off their cash registers and not paying taxes
on every sale.
</P>
<P>
   And in about two years, Mrs. Compton said, the state will be
able to resume intense efforts to identify inflated claims for
Kansas' property-tax rebate. ``We have cut back on the scrutiny
because of trying to get the new system up and running smoothly,
but that is an area where people try to claim the maximum $600 even
if they are entitled to less,'' she said, ``and with our new
systems we will be able to identify those people much more
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Howard, vice president of data warehousing at Oracle
Corp., a California software company that sells large database
systems, said that by mining its database, a tax authority could
find patterns that were not intuitive or obvious.
</P>
<P>
   He said behaviors that tax authorities traditionally associated
with noncompliance might turn out, on analysis of the details in
milions of tax returns, to be much less significant than other
unseen factors.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the kind of unexpected results that data-mining
produces, he cited the experience of a telecommunications company
that he declined to identify. The company wanted to stem the loss
of customers to competitors and, by mining its database, discovered
that people who bought its voice-mail service rarely defected, a
linkage no one had previously noticed. He said the company then
decided to give away the voice-mail service to retain customers.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Sparrow, a Harvard University expert on fraud who is an
IRS consultant, has written extensively about how government
agencies tend to identify a fraud and then focus increasing
resources on it, even as the crooks move on to new frauds.
</P>
<P>
   He has urged the IRS to design its database to facilitate hunts
for ``dynamic fraud,'' in which the theft technique changes
rapidly, but the IRS has made little use of his services, he has
said, since Rossotti was appointed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   How a database is designed can limit its use as a
fraud-detection tool, several database experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgrave said that ``absolutely the way you design your database
up front has a lot to do with'' its utility as a fraud-detection
tool. He said that the creation of the twin databases would go a
long way to making the planned new systems useful for fraud
detection.
</P>
<P>
   He said detailed decisions at the IRS about how much the new
technology would be focused on fraud detection vs. customer service
were still six to 18 months away.

ADM. ELMO ZUMWALT, 79, NAVY REFORMER AND VIETNAM COMMANDER 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Va., N.C., Calif.) (nk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., who as chief of naval operations in
the early 1970s ordered the Navy to end racial discrimination and
demeaning restrictions on sailors, then faced a haunting personal
tragedy that he related to ordering the deployment of the defoliate
Agent Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday at the Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C. He was 79 and lived in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from surgery for a cancerous chest
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1970, when Zumwalt, at 49, became the youngest man to
serve as the Navy's top-ranking uniformed officer, re-enlistments
were plunging in the face of an unpopular war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to make naval service an appealing career again, Zumwalt
issued 121 directives over the next four years, highly publicized
Z-Grams (Z for Zumwalt) that sought to change the way the Navy had
done things for almost two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including many retired admirals, asserted that Zumwalt
had created a permissive atmosphere endangering shipboard
discipline, and these accusations were fueled by racial incidents
on the aircraft carriers Kitty Hawk and Constellation in 1972.
Zumwalt believed that the antipathy toward his changes reflected
racial prejudice, and in November 1972 he summoned senior officers
to the Pentagon and accused them of ignoring his directives on race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite resistance, he made progress as chief of naval
operations. Re-enlistments by first-term sailors rose sharply, the
number of black personnel increased, and the first black admiral,
Samuel L. Gravely Jr., was appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt retired in 1974, but a decade later he was back in the
public eye, enmeshed in family anguish arising from the Vietnam
War. While serving as commander of American naval forces in Vietnam
from 1968 to 1970, he had ordered the spraying of the defoliant
Agent Orange in the Mekong Delta, seeking to deny cover to enemy
snipers on the river banks where his patrol boats operated. One
boat commander was Lt. Elmo Zumwalt III, his son.
</P>
<P>
   The two wrote a book, ``My Father, My Son'' (Macmillan, 1986),
telling of the younger Zumwalt's battle against cancer that both
men attributed to Agent Orange's toxic byproduct, dioxin. The story
was made into a CBS television dramatic production with the same
title, which was broadcast in May 1988. Three months later, Elmo
Zumwalt III died of cancer at age 42, leaving a wife and two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Elmo Russell Zumwalt Jr. was born in San Francisco on Nov. 29,
1920, the son of doctors, and was reared in Tulare, Calif., where
he was given the nickname Bud. He would carry it throughout his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1942, won a Bronze
Star on a destroyer in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines
in 1944 and served on the battleship Wisconsin in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he came to the attention of Paul H. Nitze,
the veteran Washington foreign-policy adviser, after writing a
paper on Soviet politics at the National War College. During the
Cuban missile crisis he was an aide to Nitze, who was assistant
secretary of defense for international security affairs, and when
Nitze became secretary of the Navy in 1963, he was his executive
assistant. On Nitze's recommendation, he was named a rear admiral
in 1965, at age 44 the youngest officer ever to attain that rank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 he was promoted to the three-star rank of vice admiral,
ahead of 130 flag officers, and was named the commander of American
naval forces in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt, who had opposed American ground involvement in Vietnam
since the early 1960s and would later write how ``I thought it was
the wrong war, in the wrong place, at the wrong time,'' oversaw the
``brown water Navy.'' That was a flotilla of more than 1,000 armed
small boats deployed in the Mekong Delta to deny Vietcong and North
Vietnamese soldiers use of thousands of miles of waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington, Zumwalt took on another formidable task
_ remaking the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I became chief of naval operations, racism and sexism
were still an integral part of the Navy tradition,'' he recalled.
There had never been a black admiral, black officers had few
prospects for advancement, and women were not permitted to serve on
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1970, Zumwalt issued what he would call his most
important directive, ``Equal Opportunity in the Navy.'' It required
ship, base and aircraft commanders to appoint a minority-group
member as a special assistant for minority affairs, demanded that
the Navy fight housing discrimination against black sailors in
cities where they were based, ordered that suitable cosmetics and
food for black personnel be stocked in Navy exchanges and required
that books by and about black Americans be made available in Navy
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no black Navy, no white Navy _ just one Navy _ the
United States Navy,'' Zumwalt declared.
</P>
<P>
   Another Z-Gram permitted women to serve on ships. Because women
were barred by law from ships that could be engaged in combat, a
hospital ship, the Sanctuary, was designated in 1972 to break
tradition, but not without some protests from wives of career
enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt also drew up a Z-Gram he first called ``Mickey Mouse,
Elimination of,'' but eventually renamed ``Demeaning and Abrasive
Regulations, Elimination of,'' an effort to remove some of the
restrictions on sailors' personal freedom.

   He gave a go-ahead for beards and mustaches, which were already
permitted but generally frowned upon, and he allowed sailors to
have sideburns, which he himself wore to maximum authorized length,
the middle of the ear lobe. He permitted sailors to wear civilian
clothes on base when not on duty, authorized liquor in officers'
quarters and beer in senior enlisted men's barracks, liberalized
overnight liberty policies and set 15 minutes as the maximum time a
sailor should have to wait in line for anything. And he made
recruitment advertisements peppier, in a 1970s sort of way _ one
described the Navy as the place ``where the mod look began.''

   While his changes gained wide public attention, Zumwalt spent
most of his time as chief of naval operations and a member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff dealing with matters related to the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Playboy in June 1974, shortly before his
retirement, he remarked, ``There's a good deal of indecision as to
whether I am a drooling-fang militarist or a bleeding-heart
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters the previous month, Zumwalt said the
Soviet Union had the capacity to control sea lanes in a crisis and
foresaw a reversal of that situation only if Congress adequately
financed a multibillion-dollar naval construction program that he
had instituted.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir ``On Watch'' (Quadrangle, 1976) he contended that
the Russians had gained more from limitations on strategic weapons
than the United States had.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt ran as a Democrat for the Senate in Virginia in 1976 but
was defeated by Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr., an independent. The admiral
later served on many corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   His son Elmo III left the Navy in 1970 and became a lawyer in
North Carolina. In 1983, he was stricken with lymphoma, a cancer of
the lymphatic system, and in 1985 he was found to have Hodgkin's
disease, an unrelated form of lymph-node cancer. Elmo III's son,
Elmo IV, known as Russell, was born in 1977, with a severe learning
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt and his son attributed the cancers and the boy's brain
disorder to the Agent Orange defoliant, deployed by Zumwalt in the
Mekong Delta. Many Vietnam veterans had told of suffering from
nervous disorders, cancers and skin problems and of having had
children with serious birth defects, attributing these to the
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Father, My Son,'' Elmo Zumwalt III wrote: ``I do not
second-guess the decisions Dad made in Vietnam, nor do I doubt for
a minute that the saving of human life was always his first
priority in his conduct of the war. I have the greatest love and
admiration for him as a man, and the deepest respect for him as a
military leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt wrote: ``Knowing what I know now, I still would have
ordered the defoliation to achieve the objectives it did. But that
does not ease the sorrow I feel for Elmo, or the anguish his
illness, and Russell's disability, give me. It is the first thing I
think of when I awake in the morning, and the last thing I remember
when I go to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Mouza, a son, James, two daughters,
Ann and Mouza, a sister, a brother, and six grandchildren.
</P>

<P>
   In January 1998, President Clinton presented Zumwalt the Medal
of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. He was cited for
fighting discrimination against minorities and women in the Navy
and for his work on behalf of a foundation seeking bone-marrow
donors for cancer patients.

 &HT;    EXPERTS LOOK FOR LINGERING Y2K BUGS AS BUSINESSES OPEN MONDAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As factories, doctors' offices, banks and other
businesses resume full operations Monday, computer experts will be
watching for Y2K bugs to pop out.
</P>
<P>
   But countries that already have resumed their work week after
the holiday reported no significant Y2K problems on Sunday,
suggesting computers will also operate smoothly in the United
States. For example, stock markets in Kuwait and Egypt opened
Sunday and reported no computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   With each upbeat report, computer monitors around the world have
been growing more confident about declaring victory over the Y2K
bug, a software flaw that could have caused older computers to
misinterpret the year ``00,'' misreading it as 1900 rather than
2000. That flaw had the potential to cause massive failures of
computerized equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have worked hardest on the problem, there is ``a
great sense of relief and accomplishment,'' John Koskinen,
President Clinton's top Y2K adviser, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the triumph over Y2K appears so sweeping that many
skeptics are now saying the effort to avert computer meltdown
amounted to overkill. They question whether the U.S. government
needed to spend $8.5 billion fixing federal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen said he knows of no corporate chief executives who
think the $100 billion they spent was a waste. As business owners
tested their computers, they discovered serious Y2K problems that
could have shut down operations on Jan. 1. The effort to wipe out
those bugs was so intensive and successful that naysayers now
wrongly think there never was a problem. ``Maybe we made it look
too easy,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Y2K skeptics are pointing to the quiet date rollover in
smaller countries, saying that despite minimal spending in such
places, computers did not fail.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said there are three reasons why less developed
countries did so well. For one, smaller countries have far fewer
computers, so they had less to fix, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, those countries tend to use standardized software taken
``off the shelf,'' he said. That means the expensive checking and
testing was done by wealthy countries, and poorer nations were able
to obtain standardized ``patches'' developed by others.
</P>
<P>
   And third, poorer countries were able to absorb the lessons
learned by rich countries, he said. Some equipment that programmers
initially feared would have Y2K problems turned out to be in good
shape. Those programmers were then able to tell their poorer
counterparts what not to bother checking so they could focus their
efforts where most needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said that in some ways, the Y2K bug has left the world
a better place by spurring international cooperation on information
technology. Also, the tests for Y2K bugs have forced businesses and
governmental agencies to complete inventories of equipment and
software and better organize those systems. For example, the
federal government retired about 20 percent of its computerized
systems, leaving agencies with more consolidated and updated
operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Sunday on the CBS program ``Face the Nation,'' Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson agreed that federal expenditures on Y2K
fixes have prepared the country for the new century. ``This was
worth it,'' he said. ``In this case the fizzle was good.''

`THE FAN-MAKER'S INQUISITION': THE REVOLUTION, WITH A SADISTIC
SPIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A fan is like the thighs of a woman,'' is the first line of
``The Fan-Maker's Inquisition,'' Rikki Ducornet's new novel, and
that simile summons up contradictory reactions. For one thing it is
a bit of a stretch, and that gives it a contrived, even a smug
quality. But it is also a provocative image, the fan that opens and
closes like Ms. Ducornet's story itself, which soon unfolds into a
knowing, smoldering historical tableau. By the end of this novel,
which is set in revolutionary France, Ms. Ducornet has taken us on
a moral and philosophical journey through two highly fraught
epochs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fan-Maker's Inquisition'' is an impressive performance by
a novelist whose vocabulary sweats with a kind of lyrical heat. But
impressive as Ms. Ducornet is as a stylist and a reimaginer of
historical passions, her novel is not so much a story or an
intrigue as a series of discourses, which, interesting and eloquent
though they may be, do not provide for much narrative momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ducornet, whose previous books, including ``Entering Fire''
and ``The Jade Cabinet,'' have explored the connections between
history and eroticism, sets this new novel inside a revolutionary
courtroom in Paris. A fan maker named Gabrielle, a coolly liberal
woman, is being questioned by what is identified simply as the
Comite, which is enforcing the revolution at its most repressive
and puritanical.
</P>
<P>
   One area of inquiry is Gabrielle's friendship with the notorious
libertine the Marquis de Sade, who is in prison for sexual
offenses. A painted fan showing naked figures, including an aroused
Sade, that has been seized in Gabrielle's studio is another. And so
is a subversive manuscript that Gabrielle has written with Sade, a
book that tells the cruelly demented history of the Spanish
Inquisition in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom scene is presented as a kind of annotated
transcript. The Comite asks questions or gives orders (``Are you a
Christian?''), and Gabrielle responds (``I've had since infancy an
allergy to nuns and priests''). She also reads aloud from letters
that Sade has sent her from prison, and she recites extracts from
the book they have written together.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial proceeds, a tableau of religious and revolutionary
fanaticism takes shape, one in which the French Revolution with its
daily quota of heads falling into baskets echoes the Inquisition
perpetrated by the mad and murderous Bishop Landa two centuries
before.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ducornet works out this theme with considerable rhetorical
verve and imagination. Her Sade, who speaks to us on his own in the
second half of the novel (the trial of Gabrielle having ended), is
a compelling figure, full of bitter wit and sarcastic rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Revolution has embraced sexual prudery with the same
passion a necrophiliac embraces corpses,'' he says at one point.
``Robespierre _ I know his type well _ hates a good time.''
Similarly, Ms. Ducornet's scenes of righteous, God-inspired carnage
in the Maya city of Mani, where Bishop Landa's sleep is troubled by
erotic dreams, are exercises in a kind of condensed horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when he saw a bell rope hanging, Landa imagined
himself dangling at the end. But then he recalled the nefarious
influences under which the imagination _ that most dangerous of
human faculties _ fell sway. Unchecked, it is the imagination that
causes the most havoc, he would remind himself. And so he chased
this image from his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one wants to ask, what does all this eloquence add up to?
Ms. Ducornet seems intent on drawing lessons from episodes of
historical fanaticism. But the lessons she draws have a warmed-over
quality: that imagination is dangerous to political power, and it
was for acts of the imagination that Sade was punished; that
revolutions cannot tolerate sensual liberation; that murder is an
act of sexual repression; that those responsible for the
revolution's many severed heads were more criminal than those, like
Sade, who rotted in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The libertine acts upon his instincts knowing that the world
is without God and that his actions are impelled by his nature,''
Gabrielle reads in a letter from Sade. ``The corrupt ecclesiastic
acts in the name of God to justify, as Landa did, the worst crimes.
The crimes done in God's name are always the worst, crimes that the
libertine only imagines in his black room lit by fairy lights.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, not successfully surmounted by Ms. Ducornet, has to
do with the device of the trial itself. The interrogator for the
Comite here is simply not very convincing, especially in his
condemnation of Sade's and Gabrielle's anticlerical sentiment. At
times the interrogator uses the sort of profane language that might
be used in The New Yorker these days but that seems out of place in
an 18th-century courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript also reproduces cries from the courtroom gallery
(``The whore's an atheist!'') and bracketed descriptions of
Gabrielle (``She clenches her fists, perhaps to keep from
trembling'') that appear unlikely in a trial transcript. In other
words Ms. Ducornet, searching for dramatic effect, cheats a bit on
her own format, and this robs her novel of some of its originality.
</P>
<P>
   This is too bad, especially given that Ms. Ducornet's concepts _
the fan maker herself, the correspondence with Sade, the subversive
manuscript showing the crimes that can be committed in the name of
God _ are unusual and compelling. Robespierre once said that terror
was an emanation of virtue. Ms. Ducornet, in making that idea the
center of a work of fiction, has produced a novel with serious
flaws. But she also shows herself to be a writer of eloquence and
an unsparing vision that, while not fully honed in this book, is
often startling and evocative.

INTERNET PIONEER TO BE NAMED TOP FCC TECHNOLOGIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa.)   (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission plans to announce on
Monday that it has appointed a pioneering computer scientist and
telecommunications expert as the agency's chief technologist.
</P>
<P>
   The appointee, David J. Farber, a University of Pennsylvania
professor, drew attention last year when he served as a Justice
Department expert witness in the Microsoft antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   Farber, who is currently the Alfred Fitler Moore Professor of
Telecommunications Systems at the University of Pennsylvania, will
keep his teaching position there even after moving to Washington to
work full-time for the FCC later this month.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer of the Internet, Farber helped develop the first
electronic telephone switches while at Bell Laboratories in the
1960s. During the 1970s, he conducted ground-breaking work in
networked computing systems at the University of California at
Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Notably outspoken on technology policy issues, Farber is perhaps
best known in the Internet community for his influential e-mail
distribution list, which he calls ``Interesting People.'' To about
25,000 people each day he sends tidbits of information, forwarded
from other e-mails and a steady stream of his own thoughts and
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   An inveterate traveler and a self-described gadget freak, Farber
has been known to brief his e-mail correspondents on such
adventures as his visit to Akihabara, the high-technology shopping
district in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Saturday, Farber said that he would
be allowed to maintain his list while working for the FCC. ``I
couldn't have accepted the job otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a government witness at the Microsoft trial last year, Farber
argued against one of Microsoft's main contentions: that the way
the company had chosen to integrate its browser software into its
Windows operating system was the only possible technical
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, designers have a huge amount of flexibility in how
to package these files, the same way you have a large amount of
flexibility in how you put things in a grocery bag, as long as you
don't crush stuff,'' he said in court. ``Software is infinitely
malleable.''
</P>
<P>
   His point rebutted Microsoft's argument that its decision to
integrate its browser into the operating system was purely
technical and not motivated by a desire to cripple the company's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Farber, 65, said that he would get involved in a variety of
technology issues at the FCC, including high-speed and wireless
networks, and the impact of the Internet on media the agency now
regulates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a struggle for radio spectrum,'' he said, ``and that
is one of the issues we will have to grapple with.'' Another focus
will be the convergence of communications and computing
technologies and the infusion of Internet technology into the
nation's communications system.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to understand and speak out on the social,
political and economic implications of the Internet, Farber has
maintained a quirky sense of independence from many of the
bureaucratic positions of both large high technology companies and
governments.
</P>
<P>
   For a time recently, his e-mail carried the following tag line,
alluding to the movement of electronic information: ``Photons have
neither morals or visas.''

<P>
   After a year of big gambles, the biggest of all may be the wager
that our exalted Internet, held together with baling wire and
chewing gum in every conceivable way _ legally, structurally,
economically _ is going to be able to withstand the coming heavy
weather of a truly global, unregulated economy.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the question is whether we will be able to withstand
a global, unregulated Internet.
</P>

   In either case, here at ground zero _ in the United States,
capital of global capitalism _ stock market experts are beginning
to acknowledge what some of us have suspected for a long time:
Technology stocks, in particular, are being kept aloft on their own
hot air.
</P>
<P>
   People buy them because they are performing better than regular
stocks; they are performing better than regular stocks because
people keep buying them.
</P>
<P>
   And the mystery surrounding Internet stock valuations _ what are
the criteria? _ may have been solved last week by Michael
Mauboussin, the chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The more popular the World Wide Web site, he declared, the
higher its ``ranking,'' the more the company is worth.
</P>
<P>
   Just like high school: Web sites with the highest valuations are
like football captains or cheerleaders, whose top-of-the-chart
popularity ratings give them far greater currency in the social
order than, for example, the shy, geeky nerds who may excel in art
or science.
</P>
<P>
   Upon these things our new economy is built.
</P>
<P>
   Now take this relatively microcosmic situation _ that the
Internet stock market in the United States is a popularity contest,
based on consumer moods and filled with millions of networked
investors bluffing the financial markets like a poker game _ and
consider what the ripple effect might be on an expanding global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, some big thinkers _ most notably, Manuel Castells,
author in 1998 of ``The Information Age: Economy, Society and
Culture'' _ start to get a little skittish about our big Internet
gamble. In an essay titled, ``Information Technology and Global
Capitalism,'' Castells presents a chilling argument.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the globalization of largely unregulated and
increasingly fluid financial markets, he says, ``we may have
created an automaton.'' By that, he means ``an electronic-based
system of financial transactions which overwhelms controls and
regulations by governments, international institutions and private
financial firms, as well as individual investors, consumers and
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Castells' essay is included in a book to be published in London
early this year called ``On the Edge: Essays on a Runaway World,''
edited by Anthony Giddens, the director of the London School of
Economics, and Will Hutton, the editor of The Observer in London.
</P>
<P>
   Castells does not mean the term ``automaton'' literally. There
are as yet few instances of financial transactions fully automated
beyond the bounds of human intervention _ particularly after
computer programs helped induce the stock market crash of October
1987 and the Securities and Exchange Commission began setting some
limits on program trading.
</P>
<P>
   But he cites a trend toward the computerization of trading
systems: Nasdaq in the United States; Eurex in the German bond
market; M, the French futures exchange; the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, and private trading networks like
Instinet, owned by Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Castells argues that these increasingly interconnected
electronic networks, combined with domestic deregulation, the
liberal flow of financial transactions across national borders and
a constant, international flow of market-related news and
information over the Internet, make the ``nightmare'' of watching
machines take control seem ``on the edge of becoming reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of networked computers with minds of their own is not
new. But the computers envisioned in science fiction may belong to
Mensa, the social network for those with the highest IQs; the
network of Castells' nightmare is a dumb brute, knee-jerking to
information turbulences that are amplified by inputs from millions
of individual investors, creating ever-greater complexity and
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The automaton is only the first problem that Castells cites for
the future of today's go-go Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although American industry has managed to gut its labor
movement, he says, Europe and Japan are less thrilled about the
potential for ``productivity'' technology that first takes away
jobs, then dismantles government supports.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we like it or not, he continues, if they believe that
network technology will do either of these things, ``there will be
a backlash of social struggles, and political reactions, that will
simply block reform and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the United States is now interdependent on global
economic performance, such a backlash ``will ultimately exhaust the
growth capacity of the U.S. economy,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
   Castells' belief, which is bound to be deeply unpopular in the
United States, is that healthy global capitalism requires global
financial regulations. Further, he argues that those regulations
must take into account not only technological productivity and
growth spurred by capital investment but also ``socio-institutional
engineering'' that respects, values and includes people and
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one in the U.S. government, and certainly no one
who is rolling in Internet clover, wants to touch this issue. Why
would they? The United States is far and away the world leader in
the information industries. And access to more and more global
markets _ in part by dismantling regulations and government
controls _ has been one of the hallmarks of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   We ignore such issues at our own peril, Castells says. The
fragility of global capitalism is such that a new round of
instability, ``perhaps induced by the collapse of Internet stocks,
or by a sudden panic around electronic trading networks,'' he
writes, could trigger a stampede toward the exits.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, ``there could be governments or significant
segments of society opting out of global capitalism,'' he suggests
_ ``not necessarily to build an alternative system, but just to
recover some degree of control over their lives and values.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE PARTY'S NEVER OVER IN THE NEW TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York awoke on Saturday morning to discover that
Times Square was still there. Perhaps the place should be checked
every morning. Times Square, after all, is dedicated to the passing
moment. When its moment passes, the spirits of place will not look
back for long.
</P>
<P>
   But until that day comes, Times Square will remain the ultimate
crossroads of space and time. These dimensions warped into a
heightened configuration on Friday night, when thousands gathered
to watch the ball drop as the Earth revolved New York City into the
new millennium's dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Even ephemeral things have a history, however. And the spectacle
we see at Times Square first took shape in 1932 in the imagination
of the German architect Oskar Nitzchke.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Nitzchke began to design a project he called la
Maison de la Publicite (Publicity House). Intended for a site on
the Champs-Elysees, the proposed building featured what people
would later call a media wall. An immense crane, attached to the
building's roof line, would be constantly at work, arranging and
rearranging an ever-changing array of illuminated commercial signs
deployed across a metal grid facade.
</P>
<P>
   Though the project was never realized, Nitzchke's media wall has
haunted the minds of architects ever since, most notably, perhaps,
the Anglo-Italian team of Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, when the team presented its winning design for the
Pompidou Center in Paris, Rogers and Piano proposed that such a
wall be erected on the main facade of the immense cultural
supermarket. In addition to the exterior escalator, one of the
world's most popular attractions, the wall would be encrusted with
electronic signs and projection screens.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Nitzchke's plan, this apparatus was intended to
disseminate social and cultural information rather than to promote
commercial wares. In their presentation drawings, the Pompidou's
architects included images of soldiers in the Vietnam war. A ``Live
Center of Information'' was how they defined the entire project.
But their wall, too, remained unbuilt.
</P>
<P>
   It is helpful to keep these two precedents in mind when you gaze
around Times Square these days. Many New Yorkers profess to be
appalled by what they see there. They rant about Disneyfication,
about media power, as if it would be better for these potent
cultural and economic forces to remain unexpressed in the urban
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Henry James didn't like the skyscrapers of Wall Street,
and Lewis Mumford didn't like Rockefeller Center. No one ever
accused New Yorkers of being less than expert at not liking things.
</P>
<P>
   To my eye, however, Times Square has become something
extraordinary: It is one large building turned inside out: a
megastructure de la publicite. Though composed of individual
towers, built by different developers, designed by different
architects and inhabited by different tenants, the place is driven
by a single purpose: distraction.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings form a continuous grid on which the signs
advertise various options for distraction even as they provide a
spectacular version of it.
</P>
<P>
   Distraction was the subject of an important book by Siegfried
Kracauer, Nitzchke's contemporary and fellow German. First
published in 1930 in Frankfurter Zeitung, one of Germany's most
prestigious papers in the Weimar period, Kracauer's ``Salaried
Masses'' analyzes the restlessness of the country's white-collar
workers. It is a chilling essay.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rise of Hitler it depicted the conditions that
enabled a dictator to attain power. Cut loose from cultural
tradition, the country's middle class sought escapes into the
fantasy world provided by what Kracauer called the ``distraction
industries,'' or what we would call mass media and popular
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus primed, the public was ready to be held in thrall by the
pageantry of Nazism and the party's simplistic narrative of
national redemption. The audience for the big fantasy was prepared
to embrace the Big Lie.
</P>
<P>
   At Times Square the distraction industries have been coaxed into
exposing themselves in public, urban space. And they do so at a
time when they are among the leading industries in the world today.
The spectacle is both marvelous and horrifying. A place of
indiscriminate illusion, it also sits on a bedrock of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Look one way, you see MTV. Shift your gaze, and behold Nasdaq.
Not since Versailles, perhaps, has a society's cultural essence
been so accurately portrayed. And it is better to have them out in
the open in the heart of the city than dispersed via cables and
airways.
</P>
<P>
   A vision of Times Square as Media Central was sketched out in
The New York Times in November 1992, in an article that included
designs by Tibor Kalman, James Wines, Studio Asymptote and Hodgetts
&AMP; Fung. After the collapse of the original plan to build four
office towers of nearly identical design, to house investment firms
and the like, it occurred to this observer that a golden
opportunity had arisen.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment of Times Square could revitalize the meaning
of the street. It could bring together in urban space the producers
and consumers of information and popular entertainment. Investment
and law firms had little to do with the historic identity of the
place. The street offered an ideal medium for bringing modern media
giants into physical proximity with their audience.
</P>
<P>
   This concept has now been realized on a scale that was scarcely
imaginable just seven years ago. The result is a geographic
concentration of publishing, entertainment and news organizations
without historical precedent. The creation of storefront
broadcasting studios, record outlets, movie theaters and live
performance spaces has, in turn, generated street life of
unparalleled vitality.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year every day has been like New Year's Eve.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Some people who work in Times Square are overwhelmed by the
daytime crowds. It can take 15 minutes just to cross the square,
they say. They must add another half-hour to lunch time. Stout
shoes are recommended for hazarding a short walk up Broadway. Don't
even think about dashing around the corner to buy a paper.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, am overwhelmed, but in a positive sense. It amazes me
that such a transformation could have happened so quickly. It could
never have happened purely by design. The convergence of the
mediacracy was a collective achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``interim plan,'' orchestrated by Rebecca
Robertson, former president of the 42nd Street Development Project,
after the collapse of the initial four-tower scheme, is no longer
interim. It has become, in effect, the plan. Instead of the uniform
design originally envisioned, we have the visual and functional
diversity that Ms. Robertson fought for. Reuters and Conde Nast are
being absorbed into the mix. Publicity House has found its public.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, I miss the 42nd Street of my youth, when you could
catch two double features for under $2 and enjoy erotic fantasies
about the ``City of Night.'' Yet even in those days Times Square
was a place for nostalgia. We would go there to wallow in what the
French call nostalgie de la boue: the yen for dissolute amusements
that we were free to enjoy because we were essentially tourists,
visitors from alien social and intellectual spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I can't claim to be a tourist here. After all, I work for
the news organization that gave Times Square its name. I like being
part of this new megastructure and dread the thought that the
company might move.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is a living link in the evolution of media culture and
public life from the 19th century to the present. It stands for the
possibility that even amid the distraction industries there is room
for independent reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I wouldn't object if the distractions got even more out of
control. There is an apocalyptic undercurrent sloshing around the
new Times Square. It rose to hysterical waves last week with the
approach of New Year's Eve, as fantasies of terrorist attacks and
news reports of security precautions surged into public view.
</P>
<P>
   But even on a so-called ordinary day the place seems to hover on
the verge of chaos. Nathaniel West's vision of a berserk Los
Angeles comes to mind. One pop-star fan will step on another fan's
toe, and within seconds Times Square will be convulsed with panic.
Police forces will march in to secure the peace.
</P>
<P>
   There is truth to these fantasies, also. They express an
instinctive fear of power and authority, as now represented by the
media and the economic forces behind them. The vision we had on New
Year's Eve _ of a police army called in to protect a carnival _ is
a memorable one, even for a society so driven to distraction that
it can scarcely find the time or place for remembering last week's
news, much less Oskar Nitzchke.

ST. PETERSBURG TIMES DEBT IS PAID BACK BY ITS PARENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that ensured the durability of one of the country's
most unusual newspaper ownership arrangements, the company that
publishes The St. Petersburg Times has paid off a $30-million debt
to the nonprofit institute that owns it.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Barnes, chief executive of Times Publishing, parent of
The St. Petersburg Times, said in a Dec. 26 letter in the newspaper
that the debt to the Poynter Institute for Media Studies had been
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never burned a mortgage,'' Barnes wrote, ``but it must
feel the same. Ownership is secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The payment of the debt was the final act of a 1990 settlement
that ended the Texas financier Robert Bass' battle for control of
Times Publishing. The St. Petersburg Times, with a daily
circulation of 314,000, is one of the nation's most respected
regional newspapers, and numbered among the nation's 10 best
newspapers in a recent Columbia Journalism Review survey.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of independent newspapers dwindled in the last 30
years, the owners of The St. Petersburg Times, The Day in New
London, Conn., and The Delaware State News, in Dover, Del.,
developed unconventional arrangements to avoid the sale of their
publications _ a frequent consequence of inheritance taxes and
squabbles among heirs.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer among this group was Nelson Poynter, who before his
death in 1978 established the nonprofit Poynter Institute and left
his controlling shares in Times Publishing to the institute. Those
shares are voted by the publishing company's chief executive,
Barnes, who has named Paul Tash, his second-in-command at The
Times, as his successor, though he has not announced retirement
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The institute and the publishing company have a symbiotic
partnership. The institute's financing is derived directly from the
profits of Times Publishing. The publishing company's independence
from the market-driven need for high margins is based on its
ownership by a nonprofit foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Smyth, chief executive of Independent Newspapers, an Arizona
company that owns 30 small newspapers _ the largest is the
23,000-circulation Delaware State News _ said last week that
Poynter's efforts had inspired him to create his own nonprofit
ownership arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The debt was the legacy of a two-year battle with Bass. After
acquiring a substantial portion of the common stock in Times
Publishing from the heirs of Poynter's sister, Ellen Jamison
Poynter, Bass mounted a challenge for control of the newspaper.
That challenge ended with the legal settlement in 1990.

 &HT;    POPE URGES END TO EXPLOITATION AND NEGLECT OF CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By ADAM FREEMAN 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY _ Tens of thousands of youngsters and their parents
filled St. Peter's Square beyond capacity Sunday to join Pope John
Paul II in urging an end to the exploitation and neglect of
children.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, arriving in the 16th Century Baroque square a little
before noon to lead the Celebration of Children, was greeted by
cheering and singing.
</P>
<P>
   The first major celebration thrown specifically for the Holy
Year was dedicated to the world's children, with a special emphasis
on the ``baby-soldiers'' who are forcibly conscripted to fight in
the many civil wars being waged around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Among the special guests at the celebration were a handful of
children from Sierra Leone. Event organizers said they had been
``re-civilianized'' after being forced to carry automatic weapons
and hand grenades during the civil war that has gripped the West
African nation for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the morning, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, chairman of
the Central Committee for the Grand Jubilee of the Year 2000,
presided over a mass in St. Peter's Basilica. During the ceremony
he encouraged people to remember that children are innocent victims
of wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remember the famous photo taken in 1972 of a nude child
that was running terrified down a street of Vietnam trying to
escape from a bomb of napalm,'' said Etchegaray, who noted that in
the 21st Century there remain ``children that carry rifles,
children mutilated by mines, refugee children. . . starving, stray
children on the streets like dogs lost without a collar.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican hosted more than 50,000 participants, including
parents and their children who arrived from 30 countries, including
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Romans opened their homes to host many of the children who came
from developing nations. Some of them had the costs of their trip
paid by the Roma Soccer Club, one of the biggest in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   During his noon message, John Paul greeted his young guests in
Italian, English, French, Spanish and Polish, his mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of a new year, dear children and young
people, we cannot forget all those of your own age who are
suffering hunger or violence, and those who are victims of hideous
forms of exploitation,'' declared the 79-year-old pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's event was part of Jubilee 2000, which began on
Christmas Eve and will last for more than a year. It will close on
Jan. 6, 2000, the Day of the Epiphany. More than 30 million Roman
Catholic pilgrims are expected to make the trip to Rome for the
celebrations.

   Music rarely divides itself into eras as neatly as it did with
the century that just ended. The 1900s were the disc era, when both
musicians and listeners took for granted that music could be
captured and repeated. Not too long from now it may be seen as a
brief historical interlude between sheet music and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The phonograph was treated as a dictation machine for a decade
after Thomas Edison invented it in 1877. Cylinders of recorded
music were first sold in 1890. But in 1901 the cylinder gave way to
the disc, and the rest is in the grooves. Recording preserved music
that would have vanished into the air, and it changed practically
everything else that was related, from the length of songs to the
way they were performed, learned, sold and savored. It catalyzed a
century of mind-boggling musical invention in blues, jazz, show
tunes, country-and-western, gospel, salsa, soul, rock, hip-hop and
all their subgenres, along with international idioms from bossa
nova to juju to reggae. The immediacy and portability of recordings
established a new, intimate relationship between performers and
listeners, while ideas bounced around the world, leaving no style
completely pure.
</P>
<P>
   As 1999 ended, the popular-music critics of The New York Times
convened to select 25 albums representing turning points and
pinnacles in 20th-century popular music. As we argued, we found
ourselves reflecting our own place and time, concentrating on
American music and with a slightly foreshortened focus on the years
since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   We accepted one anachronism: choosing albums, not singles, for
performers throughout the century, although the LP was introduced
only in 1948. Faced with an abundance of deserving music, we also
slipped in a few hits collections and compilations. By necessity
much is left out, but the chosen albums are a foundation for
understanding the popular music of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Every short list suggests another, much longer one of alternate
possibilities. Below are our selections for the most significant
albums of the last century, in chronological order, along with
another 25 worthy contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ENRICO CARUSO: ``The Greatest Tenor in the World'' (RCA Red
Seal, 1902-20). A chance intersection between a rising star tenor
and a nascent medium begot the disembodied voice of Caruso,
floating from more than a million gramophones, letting the world
know that music no longer had to be a site-specific experience. A
powerful, exactinr, Caruso went from recording 10 sides in
one day in a hotel room for $50 to laboring tirelessly in the
studio to overcome the many limitations of the process, becoming
the first of a new kind of pop star experienced three minutes at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   LOUIS ARMSTRONG: ``Hot Fives &AMP; Sevens'' (JSP or Columbia,
1925-1928). You can't miss the annunciatory power of these
recordings, threshold moments for both arrangements and
improvisation in jazz, as Louis Armstrong seized the foreground to
become jazz's first dominating soloist. Depending on whether you go
for Columbia's four volumes (no hiss, muted sound) or JSP's three
(preferred; slight hiss, vibrant sound), you'll need at least
Volume I, with the indelible ``Muskrat Ramble,'' the first scat
vocal on ``Heebie Jeebies'' and the take-no-prisoners ``Cornet Chop
Suey.'' You'll also need a later volume, from after the virtuosic
pianist Earl Hines arrived and deepened the music, preferably one
including ``West End Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   AL JOLSON: ``Vol. 3: The Twenties: From Broadway to Hollywood''
(Pearl Flapper, 1926-36). Al Jolson's substantial legacy remains a
sore spot. He was a Jewish immigrant who gained fame by donning
blackface, the last obvious minstrel but hardly the last
race-crossing star. He was also a shtick-loving ham, weeping and
whistling on cue, joking and bantering and delivering dramatic
monologues; he bridged vaudeville and modern pop. Jolson's was the
first voice heard in a film, crooning in ``The Jazz Singer'' in
1926, and he was arguably the first modern celebrity. Though
minstrelsy disturbs us now, his talents were huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BRISTOL SESSIONS'' (Country Music Foundation, 1927). This
historic recording session in Bristol, Tenn., by the Victor talent
scout Ralph Peer provided the lasting foundation for country music
and heavily influenced the development of blues and folk. In
response to an open call for talent, little-known musicians
streamed down from the hills to Peer's makeshift studio. Among the
arrivals were two very different acts that would become the
standard-bearers of country music: a yodeling, tuberculosis-plagued
rambler with the blues, named Jimmie Rodgers, and a
husband-wife-cousin team called the Carter Family, whose harmonies,
picking and songbook changed the face of Southern music.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT JOHNSON: ``King of the Delta Blues Singers'' (Columbia,
1936-37). Perhaps Robert Johnson was just one of many itinerant
blues singers picking his way around the Mississippi Delta. But the
few songs he recorded come out of a loudspeaker with a piercing,
unforgettable intensity: tales of love in vain, fast cars, betrayal
and revenge, with the devil on his trail and in his head. Johnson's
stoic, syncopated guitar and his otherworldly voice were his
citadel in a world stacked against him. His songs provided a
repertory and attitude for rockers and rappers, haunting American
music in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   BILLIE HOLIDAY, Greatest Hits (Columbia/Legacy, 1935-41).
Recorded music is, in part, the story of a singer's relationship to
a microphone. Amplification allowed vocalists to turn songs into
private disclosures as well as public announcements. Billie Holiday
was the greatest inhabitant of this ground between the secret and
the shared. She knew how to give flirtation an edge; she could
despair without dissolving. This compilation, featuring
collaborators like Count Basie and Lester Young, is illuminated by
her elegance, never overshadowed by her personal tragedy.

1999: EXTRAORDINARY WINNERS BUT MORE LOSERS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When they were hot, they were very, very hot. But
when they were not, they were losers.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the stock market in 1999 was of stocks that flew
higher than at any time in the last decade. Enough of them soared
that the major market indexes all closed the year at record highs.
The best-performing stocks leaped not hundreds, but thousands of
percentage points. By that standard, it was the year of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, all that prosperity hid some weaknesses. With interest
rates rising and oil prices soaring, many stocks struggled. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 19.5 percent during
the year, but more stocks in the index fell than rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index leaped 85.6 percent _ a performance
that exceeded the gain for any major index in any year in the
history of stock markets in the United States. But there were a lot
of Nasdaq losers as well, and the index of financial stocks listed
on that market ended the year down 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate just how great a year it was for the winners,
compare Qualcomm, the best-performing stock of 1999 (among those
that began the year over $5 a share) with the top performers of
previous years. Qualcomm rose 2,619 percent in 1999. Twelve other
stocks on Nasdaq that started the year over $5 managed to climb at
least 1,000 percent. A further seven issues rose at least 900
percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the first nine years of the decade, only one
such stock ever rose as much as 900 percent in a year. That was
Amazon.com, which soared 966 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most amazing stock of the year was Xcelera.com,
formerly known as Scandinavia. Once a closed-end fund specializing
in Scandinavian stocks, and then an operating company that owned a
hotel in the Canary Islands, it made a small investment in an
Internet company last year. Before it disclosed that investment,
the family of Alexander Vik, the company's chief executive, was
given options to buy a million shares of stock, at a price of $3.25
each. The shares ended 1998 at $3.75, or $1.25 adjusted for two
subsequent splits. They ended 1999 at $139.50, an increase of
11,060 percent. The Viks' option position is now valued at $415
million.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no shortage of hot initial public offerings in
1999. Where it once was deemed embarrassing for an offering to
double during the first day, since it indicated that the
underwriter had underestimated demand and failed to get the best
deal for the company going public, it now seems to be a badge of
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Just why that should be so is an interesting question. Perhaps
companies think that the amount of money being raised is relatively
small compared to the prestige of having a stock deemed to be hot,
and figure that in any case, they can always raise more capital
later. Perhaps they are happy to be able to provide a quick profit
for friends and family members allowed to buy shares at the
offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the market is just too hot for the underwriters to
deal with. Last month, Goldman, Sachs tripled the planned offering
price for FreeMarkets, one of a number of companies trying to find
a niche helping businesses get better deals, at lower transaction
costs, by using the Internet. Priced at $48 a share, up from a
planned range of $14 to $16, the shares leaped to $290 the first
day and ended the year at $341.31.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors was involved in two initial public offerings
during the year. One was for a company with a long business history
that included substantial profits. Buyers in that deal suffered.
The other company had almost no history. It became one of the most
successful offerings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The poor performer was Delphi Automotive Systems, GM's parts
operations. It went public in February at $17 a share and ended the
year down 7 percent, at $15.75.
</P>
<P>
   The other offering was Commerce One, another company hoping to
prosper in the business-to-business internet arena, and which GM
has agreed to use to buy products from suppliers. Commerce One went
public in July at $7 a share (adjusted for a subsequent split),
closed the first day at $20.33, and ended the year at $196.50, for
a gain from the offering price of 2,707 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GM hopes to save money by buying through Commerce One, but it
will be a long time, if ever, before its savings from those
purchases equal its paper profit on its investment in Commerce One.
It has an option to buy 14.4 million shares of Commerce One _ now
valued at $2.8 billion _ for a total price of $480.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One's offering was the second-most successful of 1999,
in terms of performance from the offering price, according to
calculations by Thomson Financial/Securities Data. The winner was
Internet Capital Group, a company that invests in other Internet
companies. It more than doubled its first day of trading, Aug. 5,
and that was just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the year ended, the stock was at $170 a share, even
after splitting two for one. That compared with an offering price,
adjusted for the split, of $6, and a first-day close of $12.22. The
company, which since its inception in 1996 has reported losses of
$112 million on revenue of $15 million, now has a market value of
$44 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some initial offerings that looked great the first day, however,
soon looked quite ill. Value America, an Internet retailer, went
public in April at $23 a share and traded as high as $74.25 the
first day. It ended the year at $5.06 after announcing plans to lay
off many of its employees. Another retailer, eToys, ended the year
at $26.25, above its offering price of $20, but far below the high
of $86 reached in October.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the moves made by the winners reflects the
speculative fever gripping the market and is based on hopes that as
the Internet transforms the economy, companies that did not exist a
few years ago will become giants.
</P>
<P>
   In all that, the example of Yahoo, one of the first of the
Internet companies to go public, stands out as the shining example.
It more than doubled the day it went public _ April 15, 1996 _ and
within a few months had fallen back to the offering price. But an
investor who put $1,000 into the stock at the close of trading that
first day, and held on, would now have stock worth $80,500. That is
more than 10 times as much as someone who bought Microsoft the day
it went public in 1986 would have had after the same amount of
time.

   Bill Miller did the near impossible _ again. The fund he
manages, Legg Mason Value Trust, beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index in 1999. It has been that kind of decade for
Miller, 49, a former military intelligence officer and philosophy
student given to quoting Shakespeare and William James. Even as
investors piled into index funds, his fund beat the S&AMP;P 500 in each
of the last nine years, the only fund to do so, according to Lipper
Inc. (Peter Lynch's consecutive win streak lasted seven years.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Value Trust returned 26.3 percent, compared with the
S&AMP;P's 20.6 percent gain. Miller bet big a few years ago on
technology stocks, including America Online, but in December said
he now favors financial stocks, bonds, turnaround companies and
small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Ring of Real Money
</P>
<P>
   What product blew off the shelves in '99? Cellular phones. What
stock blew off the charts? Qualcomm, which owns valuable patents on
a fast-growing cell phone technology and decided to jettison its
phone-making operation during the year. The stock had surged
twentyfold in late December when a PaineWebber analyst said it
could double in the next 12 months, causing yet another buying
frenzy. On the last day of the year, the stock split four for one,
ending the year with a 2,619 percent gain. During the year,
Qualcomm's market value soared from less than $4 billion to $116
billion, after issuing more shares.
</P>
<P>
   A few million here, a few million there, and it adds up to real
money for Irwin Mark Jacobs, 65, an engineer who founded and runs
Qualcomm in San Diego. A year ago, Jacobs was awarded a bundle of
options, now valued at $648.7 million. As of the most recent
regulatory filing, he and his family own or have options on at
least 44 million shares, worth close to $8 billion.

groceries, greeting cards, junk? In a year of Internet frenzy,
paper millionaires were minted almost daily as companies with nary
a profit and often no sales issued stock to the public and watched
it soar. But the most likely route to riches seemed to be creating
a company that would provide services to other companies exploiting
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai Technologies hit it right with a process to speed up
delivery of content over the Internet. It was begun by an MIT
professor, Thomson Leighton, and a student, Daniel Lewin, each of
whom held 9.6 million shares, according to a regulatory filing. If
they have held on, those stakes are now worth $3.145 billion
 &UR; apiece. &LR;  The stock rose 458 percent on its first day of trading in
late October, and by the end of the year, it was up 1,160 percent.
On average, IPO's gained 67 percent in their first day of trading
this year.

   Still Thirsty
</P>
<P>
   Not every portfolio overflowed with profits last year. Warren E.
Buffet, the investing sage from Omaha, Neb., saw the share price of
his Berkshire Hathaway holding company decline 20 percent, for its
first negative year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging it down was a big stake in Coca-Cola, the longtime
beverage of champions that failed to clear government hurdles to
acquisitions abroad and experienced slowing sales. In Europe, Coke
drinkers were sickened in a contamination scare. Coke shareholders
swooned, too, as the stock lost more than 11 percent of its value.
The pressure proved too much for M. Douglas Ivester, who abruptly
announced his early retirement after just two years as Coke's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were left to wonder whether Coke and some other blue
chips known for years of rapid global growth had seen their best
days. Other notable decliners were Gillette, Xerox and Pfizer.

<P>
   Vladimir Putin is Russia's Mr. Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone admires him. Like a young prince, he exudes the charm
of political freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Constantly on the move, this man with a sailor's gait still
appears to be shy, even though in a mere five months he has
ascended from being an unknown bureaucrat to prime minister and now
_ as of New Year's Eve _ to acting president of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And the people's affection for the young, dynamic politician,
who is never at a loss for words, has been growing even as he has
tried to avoid being labeled a Russian
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long yearned for light at the end of the tunnel, and
with Putin we have received hope that we are going to see it after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Putin, 47, a former KGB official and, more recently,
head of the domestic intelligence agency, has for months exercised
control of the military and much of the government's daily
operation, given the increasing inconsistency and infirmity of the
68-year-old Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   By now, I honestly believe, Putin is ready to work selflessly
for the good of this humiliated country.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who think that Putin's popularity is
exclusively the result of the Chechen factor _ that is, his tough
prosecution of what the Kremlin has called a ``fight against
Islamic bandits and terrorists'' in the rebellious republic of
Chechnya. I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is the focus of many old and new aspirations of the
Russian people: for a strong arm, for youthfulness and integrity of
political leadership, and for national revival. Liberals and
patriots, pro-marketeers and statists, rich and poor, generals and
human-rights activists are equally willing to stake their hopes on
him.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Putin showed the rare talent of being all
things to all men. Placing their bets on him were men as different
as media mogul Boris Berezovsky, economic reformer Yegor T. Gaidar
and former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi, who led a '93 coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   In August, when Yeltsin _ with his corruption scandals, health
debacles and single-digit approval ratings _ abruptly named Putin
heir-apparent, it was predicted that surely this would nip Putin's
career in the bud. Actually Putin appeared to thrive on the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 19, when Russia's parliamentary elections were
dominated by the new pro-government Unity political bloc, and other
candidates who backed Putin, the Kremlin has been in a state of
euphoric glee. At last it found a winner! Although Yeltsin could be
rightly criticized for a lot of things and certainly lost plenty of
authority, it must be admitted that he was determined to keep the
country under control _ indeed to his last political breath.
</P>
<P>
   To Putin's credit, however, the hoopla did not swell his head.
He seemed little inclined to overrate his own success: One has to
hand it to him. Presumably, he realized that soon enough there
would be harder things to accomplish. Now, the most difficult
questions he may be asking himself are these: What is my most
effective political resource? How long will this training flight
last? What will I have to face when I touch down?
</P>
<P>
   Being a sensible person, Putin must realize that there is a good
deal of the irrational and fairytale-like in the popular affection
for him, which is generally characteristic of the Russian people.
Putin says he will improve the people's life, and they believe him.
He says he will get the better of the Chechen rebels, and everyone
gives a cheer. He swears he will uproot corruption, and we
desperately want to take it on trust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lurking behind Putin's sudden and effortless emergence are
some formidable problems. Suppose, as everyone is predicting, he
does win the election, which is now rescheduled for March 26, and
he becomes Yeltsin's successor?
</P>
<P>
   What will happen the day after he is installed at the Kremlin?
Who will be the first to enter his office and get down to real
work? Will he have anyone to rely on? His ``king makers,'' perhaps?
Or an enchanted nation of people who, having cast their votes, will
expect him to wave his magic wand and put all things right?
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd of eager political associates, itching to share
the ``spoils of war'' and bust through the Kremlin gate, there are
none disinterested enough to share the burden and responsibility of
stabilizing the country.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is one thing to say: ``I assume responsibility for
Chechnya,'' using Yeltsin's backing and power, but quite another to
run the country full-time.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Kremlin's aggressiveness in the run-up to the
December parliamentary election certainly was Putin's most
effective resource. The public was treated to a barrage of
pro-Chechen-war, pro-government, pro-Putin, anti-opposition
propaganda on the major national media outlets, which are
monopolized and controlled by the Kremlin and its allies such as
Berezovsky. But popularity cannot be kept up indefinitely by these
means alone.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, by tacitly encouraging the persecution of his
political opponents, Putin not only made powerful rivals but also
effectively brought them to a boiling point. Very soon he will need
to set efficient policies _ economic, financial, social, scientific
and cultural. Will Putin be able to mobilize the type of contacts
and resources he needs for this?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's political demise, as well as a ``change of guard'' at
the top, will surely reanimate the political power blocs that have,
especially in recent months, been deactivated and suppressed by the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Putin has won out because his approval ratings have
soared to a dizzy height. I am afraid that in the long term,
however, the backing of his newfound liberal Kremlin allies will
not be strong enough. Putin's political fate largely hinges on
himself. Above all, on his readiness to meet halfway those who are
currently, and somewhat artificially, presented as his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's tradition of intrigue and ugly power politics,
even if Putin does achieve success in the presidential election, he
will have an uphill struggle lying ahead.

 &HT;    
 By JOHN LLOYD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state.
 &HT;    Billions of dollars of foreign aid have poured into its reforms.
 &HT;    Bitter struggles have been waged between Russia's free-market
radicals and their Communist or nationalist foes, most
significantly in 1993, when armed struggle broke out between the
parliament and President Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    Great privations have been visited on the country in the name of
necessary sacrifice.
 &HT;    Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better? Russians,
free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their nation has shrunk
_ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by the people.
 &HT;    The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of the
state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year since the
Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it
grew, at best, by less than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially
nonexistent in Soviet times, is now officially 12 percent and may
really be 25 percent.
 &HT;    Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed.
 &HT;    ``There was a debate about institutions and infrastructure back
in 1990,'' says Joseph Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World
Bank, whose earlier work on imperfect information and markets has
put him in line for a Nobel prize. ``I remember talking to a
conference in Prague in 1991 on the theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos
Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards themselves?') in a situation of
rapid privatization. There were already differences between (us
Western reformers) then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary.
 &HT;    ``They thought you needed to pursue privatization rapidly and
that infrastructure would follow,'' Stiglitz says. ``It was a
divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation. In Warsaw in 1989, he
explained market economics to the Solidarity activists about to be
thrust into power.
 &HT;    That December, the first Polish post-Communist government was
quailing before price liberalization. Late at night in the office
of the finance minister, Sachs had got on the phone and harangued
American officials until they promised to nudge the IMF into
providing $1 billion in support for the Polish currency.
 &HT;    His myth as the economic liberator was born, and with it a
mechanism known as ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    This was shorthand for a raft of measures _ price
liberalization, budget stabilization, a slashing of subsidies _
undertaken more or less simultaneously to ``shock'' the economy
into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery.
 &HT;    The young reformers in Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs
and his mechanism their way forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team in the Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall.
 &HT;    Both men proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and
impatiently, while Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed
the IMF and the World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to Russia's government as acting prime minister. But he
needed much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any
other Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy. But its
release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with the effect of
wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough _
without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, was
to observe later, any therapy.
 &HT;    The shock was such that by April 1992 the slender parliamentary
majority the government commanded for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, economist Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has
characterized Russian reform right up till now _ a guerrilla
struggle with a hostile, often violently hostile, legislature.
 &HT;    The free-market reformers hoped the West would back them as soon
as they took office. But the West did not. This, for many insiders,
was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in (to Russia). When South
Korea ran into difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six
months. ... The intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people
were better placed than the reformers to make the changes. The
problem was the financial scale.''
 &HT;    Thus, the economic radicals, East and West, charge that we lost
Russia. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision _ Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of the Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed
for this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with Summers and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War.
 &HT;    ``The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it wasn't going
to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was the Russians
themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do, the absence of
a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency.
 &HT;    After Yeltsin won the '93 battle with parliament by bringing in
the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on Russia policy to
Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of congratulations that is
still interpreted by the opposition as glorying in the blood of
those who died as the parliament building was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending.
 &HT;    So long as Yeltsin was president and a few reformers remained in
government, the official view in the West was that reform was on
track and our money was keeping it so. The officials knew what was
happening, but the West was locked into a desperate struggle to
preserve reform and to keep the Communists out of power. They would
not give up as long as ``our guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say we have lost Russia _ through
our own actions and mistakes. Lost because we pursued agendas that
were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost because we encouraged
and supported precisely those men in the government dacha, who were
hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies, as some now recommend, would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration.''
 &HT;    Its re-entry into the world is indeed a vast endeavor, he says,
but one to which we are, if not central, not marginal either.
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation.
 &HT;    Russia never was ours to lose. It must find itself; until then,
we can do little more than watch, offering an occasional bit of
encouragement from the sidelines.

 By JOHN LLOYD  
 Fe New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state.
 &HT;    Billions of dollars of foreign aid have poured into its reforms.
 &HT;    Bitter struggles have been waged between Russia's free-market
radicals and their Communist or nationalist foes, most
significantly in 1993, when armed struggle broke out between the
parliament and President Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    Great privations have been visited on the country in the name of
necessary sacrifice.
 &HT;    Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better? Russians,
free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their nation has shrunk
_ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by the people.
 &HT;    The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of the
state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year since the
Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it
grew, at best, by less than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially
nonexistent in Soviet times, is now officially 12 percent and may
really be 25 percent.
 &HT;    Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed.
 &HT;    ``There was a debate about institutions and infrastructure back
in 1990,'' says Joseph Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World
Bank, whose earlier work on imperfect information and markets has
put him in line for a Nobel prize. ``I remember talking to a
conference in Prague in 1991 on the theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos
Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards themselves?') in a situation of
rapid privatization. There were already differences between (us
Western reformers) then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary.
 &HT;    ``They thought you needed to pursue privatization rapidly and
that infrastructure would follow,'' Stiglitz says. ``It was a
divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation. In Warsaw in 1989, he
explained market economics to the Solidarity activists about to be
thrust into power.
 &HT;    That December, the first Polish post-Communist government was
quailing before price liberalization. Late at night in the office
of the finance minister, Sachs had got on the phone and harangued
American officials until they promised to nudge the IMF into
providing $1 billion in support for the Polish currency.
 &HT;    His myth as the economic liberator was born, and with it a
mechanism known as ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    This was shorthand for a raft of measures _ price
liberalization, budget stabilization, a slashing of subsidies _
undertaken more or less simultaneously to ``shock'' the economy
into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery.
 &HT;    The young reformers in Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs
and his mechanism their way forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team iinance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall.
 &HT;    Both men proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and
impatiently, while Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed
the IMF and the World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to Russia's government as acting prime minister. But he
needed much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any
other Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy. But its
release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with the effect of
wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough _
without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, was
to observe later, any therapy.
 &HT;    The shock was such that by April 1992 the slender parliamentary
majority the government commanded for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, economist Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has
characterized Russian reform right up till now _ a guerrilla
struggle with a hostile, often violently hostile, legislature.
 &HT;    The free-market reformers hoped the West would back them as soon
as they took office. But the West did not. This, for many insiders,
was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in (to Russia). When South
Korea ran into difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six
months. ... The intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people
were better placed than the reformers to make the changes. The
problem was the financial scale.''
 &HT;    Thus, the economic radicals, East and West, charge that we lost
Russia. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision _ Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of the Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed
for this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with Summers and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War.
 &HT;    ``The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it wasn't going
to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was the Russians
themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do, the absence of
a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as

<P>
   The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define
its ``national interest'' in the absence of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   That we do not know how to think about what follows the
U.S.-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to
the ``post-Cold War period.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such periods of transition are very important because they
offer strategic opportunities. During these fluid times, one can
affect the shape of the world to come. The enormity of the moment
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was more than just a traditional global
competitor. It strove to lead a universal socialist alternative to
markets and democracy. The Soviet Union quarantined itself and many
often-unwitting captives and clients from the rigors of
international capitalism. In the end, it sowed the seeds of its own
destruction, becoming in isolation an economic and technological
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   But this is only part of the story. The Soviet Union's collapse
coincided with another great revolution. Dramatic changes in
information technology and the growth of ``knowledge-based''
industries altered the very basis of economic dynamism,
accelerating already noticeable trends in economic interaction that
often circumvented and ignored state boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   As competition for capital investment has intensified, states
have faced difficult choices about their internal economic,
political and social structures.
</P>
<P>
   As the prototype of this ``new economy,'' the United States has
seen its economic influence grow _ and with it, its diplomatic
influence. America has emerged as both the principal benefactor of
these simultaneous revolutions and their beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   In a Republican administration American foreign policy should
refocus the United States on the national interest and the pursuit
of key priorities. Power matters, both the exercise of power by the
United States and the ability of others to exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many in the United States are _ and have always been _
uncomfortable with the notions of power politics, great powers and
power balances.
</P>
<P>
   In an extreme form, this discomfort leads instead to a reflexive
appeal to notions of international law and norms, and the belief
that the support of many states _ or even better, of institutions
like the United Nations _ is essential to the legitimate exercise
of power. The ``national interest'' is replaced with ``humanitarian
interests'' or the interests of ``the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The belief that the United States is exercising power
legitimately only when it is doing so on behalf of someone or
something else is strongly reflected in policies of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is nothing wrong with doing something that
benefits all humanity, but that is, in a sense, a second-order
effect.
</P>
<P>
   America's pursuit of the national interest will create
conditions that promote freedom, markets and peace. Its pursuit of
national interests after World War II led to a more prosperous and
democratic world. This can happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has often been so anxious to find
multilateral solutions to problems that it has signed agreements
that are not in America's interest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the arguments about U.S. ratification of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty are instructive. Since 1992, the
United States has refrained unilaterally from testing nuclear
weapons. It is an example to the rest of the world yet does not tie
its own hands ``in perpetuity'' if testing becomes necessary again.
</P>
<P>
   But in pursuit of a ``norm'' against the acquisition of nuclear
weapons, the United States signed a treaty that was not verifiable,
did not deal with the threat of the development of nuclear weapons
by rogue states, and threatened the reliability of the nuclear
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate congressional concerns about the substance of the
treaty were ignored during negotiations. When faced with the defeat
of a bad treaty, the administration attacked the motives of its
opponents _ incredibly branding longstanding internationalists like
Sens. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and John Warner (R-Va.) as
isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's attachment to largely symbolic
agreements and its pursuit of, at best, illusory ``norms'' of
international behavior have become an epidemic. That is not
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it isolationist to suggest that the United States has
a special role in the world and should not adhere to every
international convention and agreement that someone thinks to
propose.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that a few big powers, such as Russia, can
radically affect international peace, stability and prosperity.
These states are capable of disruption on a grand scale, and their
fits of anger or acts of beneficence affect hundreds of millions of
people. By reason of size, geographic position, economic potential
and military strength, they are capable of influencing American
welfare for good or ill.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, that kind of power is usually accompanied by a sense
of entitlement to play a decisive role in international politics.
</P>
<P>
   Great powers do not just mind their own business. Some worry
that this view of the world ignores the role of values,
particularly human rights and the promotion of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are those who would draw a sharp line between
power politics and a principled foreign policy based on values.
This polarized view _ you are either a realist or devoted to norms
and values _ may be just fine in academic debate, but it is a
disaster for American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   American values are universal. People want to say what they
think, worship as they wish, and elect those who govern them. The
triumph of these values is most assuredly easier when the
international balance of power favors those who believe in them.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes that favorable balance of power takes time to
achieve, both internationally and within a society. And in the
meantime, it is simply not possible to ignore and isolate other
powerful states that do not share those values.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is a good example. Few would deny that the collapse
of the Soviet Union profoundly transformed the picture of democracy
and human rights in eastern and central Europe and the former
Soviet territories. Nothing improved human rights as much as the
collapse of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States pursued a policy that
promoted political liberty, using every instrument from the Voice
of America to direct presidential intervention on behalf of
dissidents. But it lost sight neither of the importance of the
geopolitical relationship with Moscow nor of the absolute necessity
of retaining robust American military power to deter an all-out
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, President Reagan's challenge to Soviet power was
both resolute and well timed. It included intense substantive
engagements with Moscow across the entire range of issues captured
in a classic ``four-part agenda'' _ arms control, human rights,
economic issues and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration then focused greater attention on
rolling back Soviet power in central and eastern Europe. As the
Soviet Union's might waned, it could no longer defend its interests
and gave up peacefully (thankfully) to the West _ a tremendous
victory for Western power and also for human liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is fortunate to count among its
friends several great powers, it is important not to take them for
granted _ so that there is a firm foundation when it comes time to
rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia presents a different challenge. It still has many
of the attributes of a great power: a large population, vast
territory and military potential. But its economic weakness and
problems of national identity threaten to overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is determined to assert itself in the world and often
does so in ways that are at once haphazard and threatening to
American interests. The picture is complicated by Russia's own
internal transition _ one that the United States wants to see
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The old Soviet system has broken down, and some of the basic
elements of democratic development are in place. People are free to
say what they think, vote for whom they please, and (for the most
part) worship freely. But the democratic fragments are not
institutionalized _ and with the exception of the Communist Party,
political parties are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in his last months as president, few paid attention
to Boris Yeltsin's decrees. Arguably, the Russian government has
been mired in inaction and stagnation for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic troubles and its high-level corruption have
been widely discussed. Its economy is not becoming a market but is
mutating into something else. Widespread barter, banks that are not
banks, billions of rubles stashed abroad and in mattresses at home,
and bizarre privatization schemes that have enriched the so-called
reformers give Moscow's economy a medieval tinge.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for U.S. policy is that the Clinton administration's
embrace of Yeltsin and those who were thought to be reformers
around him simply failed. Clearly the United States had to deal
with the head of state, and Yeltsin was Russia's president.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. support for democracy and economic reform became
support for Yeltsin. His agenda became the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The United States certified that reform was taking place where
it was not, continuing to disburse money from the International
Monetary Fund in the absence of any evidence of serious change.
</P>
<P>
   The curious privatization methods were hailed as economic
liberalization; the looting of the country's assets by powerful
people either went unnoticed or was ignored. The realities in
Russia simply did not accord with the administration's script about
Russian economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not be faulted for trying to help. But,
as the Russian reformer Grigori Yavlinsky has said, the United
States should have ``told the truth'' about what was happening. Now
we have a dual credibility problem _ with Russians and with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of life in the Russian economy. The financial
crash of August 1998 forced import substitution, and domestic
production has increased as the resilient Russian people have taken
matters into their own hands. Rising oil prices have helped as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But these are short-term fixes. There is no longer a consensus
in America or Europe on what to do next with Russia. Frustrated
expectations and ``Russia fatigue'' are direct consequences of the
``happy talk'' in which the Clinton administration engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic future is now in the hands of the Russians.
The country is not without assets, including its natural resources
and an educated population. It is up to Russia to make structural
reforms, particularly concerning the rule of law and the tax codes,
so that investors _ foreign and domestic _ will provide the capital
needed for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity will arise once there is a new government after
the March 26 presidential election. But the cultural changes
ultimately needed to sustain a functioning civil society and a
market-based economy may take a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Western openness to Russia's people, particularly its youth, in
exchange programs and contact with the private sector and
educational opportunities can help that process. It is also
important to engage the leadership of Russia's diverse regions,
where economic and social policies are increasingly pursued
independently of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. policy must concentrate on the important
security agenda with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, it must recognize that American security is threatened
less by Russia's strength than by its weakness and incoherence.
This suggests immediate attention to the safety and security of
Moscow's nuclear forces and stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program should be funded fully and pursued
aggressively. (Because American contractors do most of the work,
the risk of the diversion of funds is low.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, Washington must begin a comprehensive discussion with
Moscow on the changing nuclear threat. Much has been made by
Russian military officials about their increased reliance on
nuclear weapons in the face of their declining conventional
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian deterrent is more than adequate against the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, and vice versa. But that fact need no longer be
enshrined in a treaty that is almost 30 years old and is a relic of
a profoundly adversarial relationship between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was intended to prevent the
development of national missile defenses in the Cold War security
environment. Today, the principal concerns are nuclear threats from
the Iraqs and North Koreas of the world and the possibility of
unauthorized releases as nuclear weapons spread.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, in fact, lives closer to those threats than Washington
does. It ought to be possible to engage the Russians in a
discussion of the changed threat environment, their possible
responses, and the relationship of strategic offensive-force
reductions to the deployment of defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should make clear that it prefers to move
cooperatively toward a new offense-defense mix, but that it is
prepared to do so unilaterally. Moscow should understand too that
any possibilities for sharing technology or information in these
areas would depend heavily on its record _ problematic to date _ on
the proliferation of ballistic-missile and other technologies
related to weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish in the extreme to share defenses with Moscow
if it either leaks or deliberately transfers weapons technologies
to the very states against which America is defending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the United States needs to recognize that Russia is a
great power, and that we will always have interests that conflict
as well as coincide. The war in Chechnya, located in the oil-rich
Caucasus, is particularly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Vladimir Putin used the war to stir
nationalism at home while fueling his own political fortunes. The
Russitary was uncharacteristically blunt and vocal in
asserting its duty to defend the integrity of the Russian
Federation _ an unwelcome development in civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Putin is acting president, the long-term effect on
Russia's political culture should not be underestimated. And the
war has affected relations between Russia and its neighbors in the
Caucasus, as Yeltsin's Kremlin hurled charges of harboring and
abetting Chechen terrorists against states as diverse as Saudi
Arabia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The war is a reminder of the vulnerability of the small, new
states around Russia and of America's interest in their
independence. If they can become stronger, they will be less
tempting to Russia. But much depends on the ability of these states
to reform their economies and political systems _ a process, to
date, whose success is mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile America can exercise power without arrogance and
pursue its interests without hectoring and bluster. When it does so
in concert with those who share its core values, the world becomes
more prosperous, democratic and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   That has been America's special role in the past, and it should
be again as we enter the next century.

<P>
   The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define
its ``national interest'' in the absence of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   That we do not know how to think about what follows the
U.S.-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to
the ``post-Cold War period.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such periods of transition are very important because they
offer strategic opportunities. During these fluid times, one can
affect the shape of the world to come. The enormity of the moment
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was more than just a traditional global
competitor. It strove to lead a universal socialist alternative to
markets and democracy. The Soviet Union quarantined itself and many
often-unwitting captives and clients from the rigors of
international capitalism. In the end, it sowed the seeds of its own
destruction, becoming in isolation an economic and technological
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   But this is only part of the story. The Soviet Union's collapse
coincided with another great revolution. Dramatic changes in
information technology and the growth of ``knowledge-based''
industries altered the very basis of economic dynamism,
accelerating already noticeable trends in economic interaction that
often circumvented and ignored state boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   As competition for capital investment has intensified, states
have faced difficult choices about their internal economic,
political and social structures.
</P>
<P>
   As the prototype of this ``new economy,'' the United States has
seen its economic influence grow _ and with it, its diplomatic
influence. America has emerged as both the principal benefactor of
these simultaneous revolutions and their beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   In a Republican administration American foreign policy should
refocus the United States on the national interest and the pursuit
of key priorities. Power matters, both the exercise of power by the
United States and the ability of others to exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many in the United States are _ and have always been _
uncomfortable with the notions of power politics, great powers and
power balances.
</P>
<P>
   In an extreme form, this discomfort leads instead to a reflexive
appeal to notions of international law and norms, and the belief
that the support of many states _ or even better, of institutions
like the United Nations _ is essential to the legitimate exercise
of power. The ``national interest'' is replaced with ``humanitarian
interests'' or the interests of ``the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The belief that the United States is exercising power
legitimately only when it is doing so on behalf of someone or
something else is strongly reflected in policies of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is nothing wrong with doing something that
benefits all humanity, but that is, in a sense, a second-order
effect.
</P>
<P>
   America's pursuit of the national interest will create
conditions that promote freedom, markets and peace. Its pursuit of
national interests after World War II led to a more prosperous and
democratic world. This can happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has often been so anxious to find
multilateral solutions to problems that it has signed agreements
that are not in America's interest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the arguments about U.S. ratification of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty are instructive. Since 1992, the
United States has refrained unilaterally from testing nuclear
weapons. It is an example to the rest of the world yet does not tie
its own hands ``in perpetuity'' if testing becomes necessary again.
</P>
<P>
   But in pursuit of a ``norm'' against the acquisition of nuclear
weapons, the United States signed a treaty that was not verifiable,
did not deal with the threat of the development of nuclear weapons
by rogue states, and threatened the reliability of the nuclear
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate congressional concerns about the substance of the
treaty were ignored during negotiations. When faced with the defeat
of a bad treaty, the administration attacked the motives of its
opponents _ incredibly branding longstanding internationalists like
Sens. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and John Warner (R-Va.) as
isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's attachment to largely symbolic
agreements and its pursuit of, at best, illusory ``norms'' of
international behavior have become an epidemic. That is not
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it isolationist to suggest that the United States has
a special role in the world and should not adhere to every
international convention and agreement that someone thinks to
propose.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that a few big powers, such as Russia, can
radically affect international peace, stability and prosperity.
These states are capable of disruption on a grand scale, and their
fits of anger or acts of beneficence affect hundreds of millions of
people. By reason of size, geographic position, economic potential
and military strength, they are capable of influencing American
welfare for good or ill.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, that kind of power is usually accompanied by a sense
of entitlement to play a decisive role in international politics.
</P>
<P>
   Great powers do not just mind their own business. Some worry
that this view of the world ignores the role of values,
particularly human rights and the promotion of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are those who would draw a sharp line between
power politics and a principled foreign policy based on values.
This polarized view _ you are either a realist or devoted to norms
and values _ may be just fine in academic debate, but it is a
disaster for American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   American values are universal. People want to say what they
think, worship as they wish, and elect those who govern them. The
triumph of these values is most assuredly easier when the
international balance of power favors those who believe in them.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes that favorable balance of power takes time to
achieve, both internationally and within a society. And in the
meantime, it is simply not possible to ignore and isolate other
powerful states that do not share those values.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is a good example. Few would deny that the collapse
of the Soviet Union profoundly transformed the picture of democracy
and human rights in eastern and central Europe and the former
Soviet territories. Nothing improved human rights as much as the
collapse of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States pursued a policy that
promoted political liberty, using every instrument from the Voice
of America to direct presidential intervention on behalf of
dissidents. But it lost sight neither of the importance of the
geopolitical relationship with Moscow nor of the absolute necessity
of retaining robust American military power to deter an all-out
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, President Reagan's challenge to Soviet power was
both resolute and well timed. It included intense substantive
engagements with Moscow across the entire range of issues captured
in a classic ``four-part agenda'' _ arms control, human rights,
economic issues and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration then focused greater attention on
rolling back Soviet power in central and eastern Europe. As the
Soviet Union's might waned, it could no longer defend its interests
and gave up peacefully (thankfully) to the West _ a tremendous
victory for Western power and also for human liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is fortunate to count among its
friends several great powers, it is important not to take them for
granted _ so that there is a firm foundation when it comes time to
rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia presents a different challenge. It still has many
of the attributes of a great power: a large population, vast
territory and military potential. But its economic weakness and
problems of national identity threaten to overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is determined to assert itself in the world and often
does so in ways that are at once haphazard and threatening to
American interests. The picture is complicated by Russia's own
internal transition _ one that the United States wants to see
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The old Soviet system has broken down, and some of the basic
elements of democratic development are in place. People are free to
say what they think, vote for whom they please, and (for the most
part) worship freely. But the democratic fragments are not
institutionalized _ and with the exception of the Communist Party,
political parties are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in his last months as president, few paid attention
to Boris Yeltsin's decrees. Arguably, the Russian government has
been mired in inaction and stagnation for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic troubles and its high-level corruption have
been widely discussed. Its economy is not becoming a market but is
mutating into something else. Widespread barter, banks that are not
banks, billions of rubles stashed abroad and in mattresses at home,
and bizarre privatization schemes that have enriched the so-called
reformers give Moscow's economy a medieval tinge.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for U.S. policy is that the Clinton administration's
embrace of Yeltsin and those who were thought to be reformers
around him simply failed. Clearly the United States had to deal
with the head of state, and Yeltsin was Russia's president.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. support for democracy and economic reform became
support for Yeltsin. His agenda became the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The United States certified that reform was taking place where
it was not, continuing to disburse money from the International
Monetary Fund in the absence of any evidence of serious change.
</P>
<P>
   The curious privatization methods were hailed as economic
liberalization; the looting of the country's assets by powerful
people either went unnoticed or was ignored. The realities in
Russia simply did not accord with the administration's script about
Russian economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not be faulted for trying to help. But,
as the Russian reformer Grigori Yavlinsky has said, the United
States should have ``told the truth'' about what was happening. Now
we have a dual credibility problem _ with Russians and with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of life in the Russian economy. The financial
crash of August 1998 forced import substitution, and domestic
production has increased as the resilient Russian people have taken
matters into their own hands. Rising oil prices have helped as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But these are short-term fixes. There is no longer a consensus
in America or Europe on what to do next with Russia. Frustrated
expectations and ``Russia fatigue'' are direct consequences of the
``happy talk'' in which the Clinton administration engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic future is now in the hands of the Russians.
The country is not without assets, including its natural resources
and an educated population. It is up to Russia to make structural
reforms, particularly concerning the rule of law and the tax codes,
so that investors _ foreign and domestic _ will provide the capital
needed for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity will arise once there is a new government after
the March 26 presidential election. But the cultural changes
ultimately needed to sustain a functioning civil society and a
market-based economy may take a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Western openness to Russia's people, particularly its youth, in
exchange programs and contact with the private sector and
educational opportunities can help that process. It is also
important to engage the leadership of Russia's diverse regions,
where economic and social policies are increasingly pursued
independently of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. policy must concentrate on the important
security agenda with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, it must recognize that American security is threatened
less by Russia's strength than by its weakness and incoherence.
This suggests immediate attention to the safety and security of
Moscow's nuclear forces and stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program should be funded fully and pursued
aggressively. (Because American contractors do most of the work,
the risk of the diversion of funds is low.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, Washington must begin a comprehensive discussion with
Moscow on the changing nuclear threat. Much has been made by
Russian military officials about their increased reliance on
nuclear weapons in the face of their declining conventional
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian deterrent is more than adequate against the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, and vice versa. But that fact need no longer be
enshrined in a treaty that is almost 30 years old and is a relic of
a profoundly adversarial relationship between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was intended to prevent the
development of national missile defenses in the Cold War security
environment. Today, the principal concerns are nuclear threats from
the Iraqs and North Koreas of the world and the possibility of
unauthorized releases as nuclear weapons spread.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, in fact, lives closer to those threats than Washington
does. It ought to be possible to engage the Russians in a
discussion of the changed threat environment, their possible
responses, and the relationship of strategic offensive-force
reductions to the deployment of defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should make clear that it prefers to move
cooperatively toward a new offense-defense mix, but that it is
prepared to do so unilaterally. Moscow should understand too that
any possibilities for sharing technology or information in these
areas would depend heavily on its record _ problematic to date _ on
the proliferation of ballistic-missile and other technologies
related to weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish in the extreme to share defenses with Moscow
if it either leaks or deliberately transfers weapons technologies
to the very states against which America is defending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the United States needs to recognize that Russia is a
great power, and that we will always have interests that conflict
as well as coincide. The war in Chechnya, located in the oil-rich
Caucasus, is particularly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Vladimir Putin used the war to stir
nationalism at home while fueling his own political fortunes. The
Russian military was uncharacteristically blunt and vocal in
asserting its duty to defend the integrity of the Russian
Federation _ an unwelcome development in civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Putin is acting president, the long-term effect on
Russia's political culture should not be underestimated. And the
war has affected relations between Russia and its neighbors in the
Caucasus, as Yeltsin's Kremlin hurled charges of harboring and
abetting Chechen terrorists against states as diverse as Saudi
Arabia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The war is a reminder of the vulnerability of the small, new
states around Russia and of America's interest in their
independence. If they can become stronger, they will be less
tempting to Russia. But much depends on the ability of these states
to reform their economies and political systems _ a process, to
date, whose success is mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile America can exercise power without arrogance and
pursue its interests without hectoring and bluster. When it does so
in concert with those who share its core values, the world becomes
more prosperous, democratic and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   That has been America's special role in the past, and it should
be again as we enter the next century.

A RECORD YEAR FOR HIT MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Beginning with ``The Matrix'' on Easter weekend and
accelerating into hyperdrive with the success of ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' American moviegoers went on a
nine-month binge that drew record crowds to theaters, created a
record number of $100 million hits and shattered several
long-cherished assumptions about how the film business works.
</P>
<P>
   Although final figures for the year will not be available until
later this week, it is abundantly clear that 1999 was the second
consecutive record year at the nation's box offices.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitor Relations, the Los Angeles-based company that monitors
box-office performance, estimates that Americans spent $7.5 billion
on movie tickets last year, an increase of 8 percent over $6.95
billion in 1998. Some of that increase reflects higher ticket
prices, but even in terms of ticket sales _ the number of people
attending movies _ it will be a record year.
</P>
<P>
   There was much talk in Hollywood in 1999 that the basic rules
upon which the studios have operated for years were subtly
changing, that such safe bets as big stars in long-popular genres
were not as reliable as before, that young adults in particular
preferred a more frenetic, MTV-like style of moviemaking, and that
there was, perhaps, a growing disconnect between what people wanted
to see and what studios were producing.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers tell a different story. The movies that did best
at the box office were generally sequels,  and other
mainstream films with big stars in recognizable genres.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were some enormous surprise hits _ ``The Sixth
Sense'' in second place for the year, ``The Matrix'' in fifth,
``The Blair Witch Project'' in 10th and ``Double Jeopardy'' in 12th
_ the year's Top 20 offerings included a new ``Star Wars'' movie
(No. 1 for the year), a James Bond movie (14th place), two sequels
(``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' in 3rd place and ``Toy
Story 2'' in 4th), five remakes of movies or television series
(``Tarzan'' in 6th place, ``The Mummy'' in 8th, ``Wild Wild West''
in 13th, ``Inspector Gadget'' in 18th and ``The Haunting'' in 19th)
and movies featuring box-office-friendly stars like Adam Sandler
(``Big Daddy,'' No. 7) and Julia Roberts (``Runaway Bride,'' No. 9,
and ``Notting Hill,'' No. 11).
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the talk about how 1999 broke all the rules in
terms of what films had mass appeal, I think when you look at this
list it's still pretty traditional in terms of genres and
ratings,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor
Relations. ``Most are still star-driven. And the traditional
narrative still rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of surprise hits (before its release, no one
predicted that ``The Sixth Sense'' would make more than $275
million, and counting) was often taken as proof that the studios
had lost contact with movie audiences. But studio executives said
unpredictability was just the nature of such a risky business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's impossible to predict $200 million movies
like `Sixth Sense,''' said Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the
Paramount Motion Picture Group. ``But I wouldn't say you're
blindsided. I'd say you're pleasantly surprised. We knew `Double
Jeopardy' was going to be a successful movie, and I would have bet
it was going to make plus or minus $100 million. Would I have been
more comfortable betting less than more? Sure. We were pleasantly
surprised. I'll take pleasantly surprised all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   What struck many film executives about the year-end list was its
eclectic nature, spanning genres from romantic comedy to
action-thriller to horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the good news today is that there seems to be room for
everybody,'' said Jeff Blake, president of distribution for
Columbia Pictures. ``The audience has expanded, so you will be able
to do specialized films for a specific audience. Yet when you do
have a wide-appeal hit, the reward is even greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Amir Malin, president of Artisan Entertainment, the company that
released the year's most unexpected phenomenon, ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' found something troubling about it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of is reminiscent of the beginning of `A Tale of Two
Cities': it was the best of times and the worst of times,'' Malin
said. ``The reality is that most of the box office was generated by
a handful of films. The Top 20 films account for a good amount of
the year's box office, especially the last three or four months.
Drama films, art films and more specialized films have had a very
problematic time.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to ``Ride With the Devil,'' ``Music of the Heart,''
``Tumbleweeds'' and even ``Boys Don't Cry,'' which drew much
acclaim, but not great ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily quality oriented,'' Malin said. ``With so
many things coming at us from so many different perspectives,
audiences were much more selective about what they wanted to see.
And they were going to see more marketable films.''

</P>
<P>
   What struck Dergarabedian about the year was the relentlessness
with which people went to the movies and the scope of their
appetite. Over the summer there were nine consecutive weekends when
a different movie was No. 1 at the box office, and the year ended
with 17 films earning more than $100 million, another record. Some
of the films currently in theaters, like ``Sleepy Hollow'' and
``Stuart Little,'' are expected to earn more than $100 million, so
the record number is likely to reach perhaps 20 films, he said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Phantom Menace' really got people into theaters and it got
people encouraged about more moviegoing,'' he said. ``People saw
the trailers, they saw the posters, and it was a snowball effect
that carried through the summer and right through the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the year ended on a bit of a whimper, largely
because the Christmas and New Year's holidays each fell on a
weekend, which depresses ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some films showed unexpected strength in the final
weekend of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Initial estimates had ``Stuart Little'' in first place for the
New Year's weekend with $16 million and a cumulative total of $79.7
million since its opening on Dec. 17. Sales on New Year's weekend
represented an increase of 35 percent from the Christmas weekend.
Since Christmas Eve, ``Stuart Little'' earned $52 million, making
it the most profitable family-oriented film ever for this 10-day
period, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Stuart Little,'' which apparently benefited from strong
word-of-mouth, ``Galaxy Quest'' did as well, earning an estimated
$9.7 million for the New Year's weekend, which, even though it only
landed in sixth place for the weekend, was a 38 percent increase
over its Christmas weekend opening.
</P>
<P>
   The word of mouth was not so good for ``Man on the Moon,'' the
Milos Forman film in which Jim Carrey plays the comedian Andy
Kaufman. It was in ninth place on its second weekend, below ``Deuce
Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' earning just $5.2 million, a decrease of 31
percent from Christmas weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers was estimating strong numbers for its two films,
$13.2 million for the weekend for ``The Green Mile,'' an
astonishing increase of 42 percent, and $13 million for ``Any Given
Sunday,'' a second weekend decrease of only 4 percent. Other
studios, however, were questioning Warner's estimates and saying
that their numbers had ``Toy Story 2'' (with an estimated $12.1
million) and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' ($12 million) ahead of
both of the Warner films. Final and more accurate numbers (not
based on studio estimates) will be available later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the films sent out in limited release _ that is, to only a
handful of theaters so that they qualify for the Academy Awards
before going into wider release later this month _ Norman Jewison's
``Hurricane'' had an extremely strong opening this weekend. It
earned $295,000 in 11 theaters for a per-theater average of nearly
$27,000, more than double what other December limited releases had
earned. The film, starring Denzel Washington as the boxer Hurricane
Carter, will open in more theaters on Friday before going into
nationwide release on Jan. 14.

PATENTS: PUTTING BAR CODES ON PILLS; PATENTS PASS A MILESTONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, Scott Sullivan had a hallway conversation at
work with Robert Hess about an idea: putting Braille on pills.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan, a patent agent, and Hess, a patent lawyer,
realized their concept had a flaw. What if one of the raised dots
chipped off? A blind person might misread the pill and take the
wrong medication. But as they tossed the notion around and realized
that Braille was just a code, it came to them: Why not use a bar
code instead?
</P>
<P>
   The two refined their idea and first applied for a patent in
1994. Given the vagaries of the patenting process, they could not
have hoped to time their patent to issue within days of a study
released by the Institute of Medicine that cited medical errors as
a major killer in U.S. hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what happened. At the end of November the report
made headlines with the declaratt each year tens of
thousands of people die as a result of such mistakes, many of which
are blunders with drugs. It said that every year more than 7,000
patients died because they got the wrong medicine, or took medicine
in the wrong doses or at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Sullivan and Hess received their patent for a
method of placing a machine-readable bar-code on pills so that the
medication could be identified and tracked.
</P>
<P>
   Many health-care professionals say medication errors stem not
from incompetence but from confusion. Drugs often have look-alike
labels or sound-alike names, and come in similar shapes and colors.
The inventors say the addition of a bar code to every pill would
allow nurses, doctors, paramedics, other health-care professionals
and even people at home to always know the type and dosage of
medicine being used.
</P>
<P>
   The patent covers addition of a bar code in different ways,
depending on whether a pill is a coated tablet, or a porous, chalky
pill, or a gel capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use an ink,'' Sullivan said. ``The pill shoots between
two rollers and the bar code is printed. Colors can be chosen so
you can print a bar code the same way you print `Advil' on a
tablet. The resolution is much better for printing `Advil' than for
`M&AMP;Ms.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such printing will not work on porous pills like aspirin. ``You
can't coat the pill, because you want it to dissolve immediately,''
Sullivan said. ``If you coat aspirin, it ends up in the intestine
and not the stomach and changes the way it works. But you can print
the bar code on a gel strip that is like Scotch tape, apply a
little moisture and stick it on.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar code could consist of up to 15 digits, Sullivan said,
and might be based on the National Drug Code that the federal
government uses to assign numbers to pharmaceuticals. Once pills
are bar-coded, a patient or a health-care worker would simply scan
the medicine with a hand-held device. The scanner would read the
bar code and identify the drug. It would also be linked to a
central database.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar code addresses a file,'' Sullivan continued. ``It
wouldn't be just 15 characters of information. You'd open up the
file, and it would say `Welcome to Prozac,' and here's 20 to 30
pages of information.''
</P>
<P>
   That data would include all the information that is normally
printed on inserts handed out with drug prescriptions, like the
hazards of taking a drug in combination with other pills, or the
risks for people with certain medical conditions. ``The user could
also upload information about a patient, like what drugs they use,
or allergies, and that could trigger an alarm,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors maintain that bar codes on pills could eliminate
many medical hazards that arise from drug mistakes. They say
medication mix-ups, tampering or switching of brand-name drugs for
generic ones would be greatly reduced. They also contend that their
patent would enable hospitals and clinics to buy drugs in bulk
form, without the costly and wasteful packaging now used to reduce
mistakes in identifying pills.
</P>
<P>
   They envision a ``robotic pharmacist'' using their pills to
alleviate the workload in pharmacies. And they say paramedics who
treat unconscious patients would be able to scan drugs found at the
scene to determine what they are.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan acknowledges that the bar-code system must be
standardized so that all drug manufacturers use the same system, in
order for all pills to be readable by any scanner and linked to a
common database.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the government to standardize something, because
someone has to decide what the numbers mean,'' Sullivan said. He
and Hess have written to several members of Congress to suggest
their idea and ask for help. They received patent 5,992,742.
</P>
<P>
   Patents Pass a Milestone
</P>
<P>
   Just before the 20th century came to an end, the Patent and
Trademark Office passed a milestone of its own. On Dec. 7, the
agency issued patent No. 6,000,000. It was awarded to Jeffrey
Hawkins, of Redwood City, Calif., and Michael Albanese of Los
Gatos, Calif., for an ``extendible method and apparatus for
synchronizing multiple files on two different computer systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent No. 1 was issued in 1836. It took 75 years for the first
million patents to follow, a milestone reached in 1911. The
2-million mark was passed in 1936, and 3 million in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Either patenting has become more popular, or the Patent and
Trademark Office has grown more efficient: Patent 4,000,000 was
issued in 1976, and it took just 15 years for the next million
patents to win approval. Only eight years have passed between the
5-millionth and the 6-millionth.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

POLITICAL FUROR OVER MOVING OF HUNGARY'S CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DONALD G. MCNEIL JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ And now, said Hungary one day late: Let the
millennial celebrations begin.
</P>
<P>
   Not the worldwide ones, but rather those marking 1,000 years
since Hungary became a nation. And what a nationdswept
battlefield settled by Siberian horsemen on the doorstep of Europe,
a vast plain whose borders have always been up for grabs, a history
of angry subjugation at the hands of Ottomans, Austrians and
Soviets, a disenfranchised nobility scattered across the globe, and
all of it linked by a language whose only living relative _ and not
a close one at that _ is Finnish.
</P>
<P>
   And the only nation on earth whose nationhood historically
resided in a crown. Not in a crowned head nor an imperial line, and
not remotely in the consent of the governed nor in any sceptered
isle, but in the physical lump of bejeweled gold itself: the sacred
crown of St. Stephen, presented to him by Pope Sylvester II exactly
1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy lies the pillow that wears the crown _ because the
simple act of moving it has split the Hungarian nation.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of this new millennium, in a glorious
procession fraught with pomp and armored cars, that venerable crown
with the pearl tassels, the rainbow of icons and the bent cross was
transferred from a small room in the national museum to the ornate
rotunda of the spectacular houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1945, we protected this crown from both the fascists and
the eastern dangers,'' intoned Jozsef Vitez, the last surviving
member of the old Cards, looking resplendent in his historic
hussar's uniform but a bit bowed beneath its heavy shako. ``I am
handing it over to you _ guard it as we did,'' he concluded to one
of the newly reconstituted Crown Guards, who stood before him
looking boyishly nervous behind his drawn saber.
</P>
<P>
   But what right, demanded the opposition parliamentarians who
boycotted the ceremony, does a king's crown have to a place of
honor in a republican democracy?
</P>
<P>
   What right, retorted the government that not only moved the
crown but tried to write a reference to it into the constitution,
do our liberal opponents have to deny Hungarians the symbol of
their traditions?
</P>
<P>
   What, ask many average Hungarians, is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   A full answer is tricky. The government says honoring the crown
is simply part of the 1,000th birthday festivities, on which it
will spend $140 million this year, commissioning new statues,
films, symphonies and conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The government's critics say the crown is part of the mantle of
righteousness it has drawn around itself as it intimidates those
who oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   They say corruption, xenophobia and a dangerous pan-Hungarian
nationalism are on the rise and the government abets them because
its allies include small right-wing parties and opportunistic
tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   Elemer Hankiss, a sociologist and political commentator who is
optimistic about Hungary's future, calls it all an
``inside-the-Budapest-Beltway battle.'' Right-wingers still
dreaming of Greater Hungary are only 2 percent of the populace, he
said, and ``Crown-gate is a stupid issue'' dividing former allies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For an Eastern European country, Hungary is doing relatively
well. It has the fastest-growing economy in the first wave of
candidates to join the European Union. Elections have been held
since 1989 without problems. But some observers say they spot
anti-democratic trends.
</P>
<P>
   In February, for example, about 300 skinheads met at Budapest's
mountaintop castle to mourn the Waffen-SS troops and their
Hungarian Arrow allies who died there.
</P>
<P>
   When the police appeared at their nightclub to check passports,
they rioted.
</P>
<P>
   Quieter anti-Semitic and anti-gypsy incidents, like threatening
letters, have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crown ceremony Saturday drew groups of men waving the flags
of the Arpad family, who led the first Hungarians over the
Carpathians in the 890s. Others carried the flags of Greater
Hungary, showing the borders before chunks were lost to Romania,
Slovakia and the Ukraine in the treaties ending World War I. To
some, their yearnings have disconcerting echoes of Greater
Deutschland of the 1930s and Slobodan Milosevic's Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, some of the flag-bearers waiting in the snow to
see the crown Saturday said they were detained on sight by the
police for two hours. Their Hungarian Truth and Life Party is a
small member of the ruling coalition, which suggests that the
police aren't politically influenced, even if they haven't yet
grasped freedom of assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hungarians even worry about the revival of the old nobles
association, while others consider it harmless nostalgia. Counts
and princes from the Hungarian diaspora pop up everywhere, from
Laszlo Almasy of ``The English Patient'' to the Eszterhazys who
figure in the South African wine industry. But there is little fear
they will demand ancient lands back; they couldn't even get
Parliament to restore the florid titles they lost under communist
rule.
</P>
<P>
   To historians, the new fight over St. Stephen's legacy is
frustrating, because the crown has been kicked around plenty over
the centuries, and this looks like a whole new political football
league.
</P>
<P>
   The crown was given to Stephen, known here as Istvan, when he
was merely king, but he had embraced Christianity and agreed to
spread it in the way then fashionable _ by the battle ax.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being bent by some clumsy retainer, the crown was lost
on a roadside by Otto of Bavaria circa 1310, stolen by the pregnant
widow of Albert von Hapsburg for her unborn son in 1439, ransomed
back in 1463, shuttled back and forth between Buda, Bratislava and
Vienna on Hapsburgian whims, and buried for four years in a futile
attempt to save it from Austrian troops crushing the Hungarian
rebellion of 1848.
</P>
<P>
   It even spent 33 years in Fort Knox, Ky. As the Third Reich fell
in 1945, the Crown Guards fled west with it to evade pro-Nazi
putschists and invading Soviet troops, and surrendered to Americans
instead. President Carter returned it during a brief 1978 thaw in
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   (Stephen's right hand, by the way, has separately toured Europe
as a holy relic and was also Allied war booty very briefly. It now
rests in St. Stephen's Basilica in downtown Budapest. The rest of
his body is in the royal tombs in Szekesfehervom, but where exactly
is unclear because they were vandalized under Ottoman rule.)
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, historians say, this latest move to another
nitrogen-filled glass box has left behind the delicate cloak of St.
Stephen, the only element of the royal paraphernalia that everyone
agrees really is 1,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pains me personally that this group is broken up,'' said
Atilla Zsoldos, a medieval historian. ``You can't just haul a
1,000-year-old piece of textile from place to place.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Even if Stephen actually wore the cloak, the other items that
followed the crown in Saturday night's procession _ a sword,
scepter and orb _ probably were acquired later and officially
declared his former property by later kings, who in the old days
could legally pull such shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   The sacred crown itself is suspect because it is riveted of gold
bands of different chemical make-up, one with Greek writing and one
with Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Among its icons are King Geza I and Emperor Michael VII of
Byzantium _ both of whom ruled after Stephen's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this act,'' said Balint Magyar, president of the Alliance
of Free Democrats, who were in the government but are now in
opposition, ``they have transformed the crown from an honored piece
of our history into a tool of their daily political goals. If they
think it doesn't belong in a museum, they don't understand 20th
century Hungarian history.''
</P>
<P>
   Magyar feels a certain family expertise; his great-great
grandfather was the prime minister who buried the crown to save it
in 1849.
</P>
<P>
   The government's allies scoff. ``We want to honor the crown
without over-emphasizing it,'' said Bela Pokol, a leader of the
conservative Smallholders Party. His party formed the new ruling
coalition with the Fidesz-Hungarian Civic party, which began as an
anti-Communist youth movement in the 1980s, but has shifted _ some
say opportunistically after election losses _ into a mixed
traditionalist, Christian, pro-big-business stance.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance, which embodies urbanized intellectualism, ``always
opposes traditional values,'' Pokol said. He also criticized the
media as ``unbalanced in favor of liberal/leftist/Socialist
circles.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk is how the government gets portrayed as
anti-intellectual _ which in eastern Europe is sometimes read as
anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Pokol's liberal targets accuse the government of
throttling them. Last year it cut 90 percent of its grant to the
Institute for the History of 1956, a think tank of academics once
jailed for opposing the Stalinist crushing of Hungary's 1956
rebellion. The money went to a rival think tank favored by Prime
Minister Viktor Orban, who wasn't even born until 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The government also closed the country's second-biggest paper,
the liberal Kurir, letting the Post Office Bank that owned it
shutter it as a money loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is freedom of the press here, but there's pressure
too,'' said Gabor Szucs, Kurir's last editor. ``It's like the
Chinese proverb: To scare the monkeys, kill a chicken in front of
them. They sent a message _ behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a grenade was thrown at the offices of a weekly
paper that accused relatives of party officials, including Orban's
father, of enriching themselves and evading taxes. The party sued.
A few weeks earlier, the car of a satiric journalist was
anonymously firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been arrested. Hankiss said he thought even such
events were overblown in a country still learning how to respond to
free speech with more speech instead of with the 1956 bullet holes
that still dot downtown walls.
</P>
<P>
   But the joke among some of those watching the parade Saturday
was that Orban wants the crown nearer his office so he can try it
on at night.

   FCC to Pick Chief Technologist
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission plans to announce Monday
that it has appointed David J. Farber, a pioneering computer
scientist and telecommunications expert, as the agency's chief

   The Peril of Direct Internet Sales
</P>
<P>
   Just as Amazon.com has led millions of would-be entrepreneurs
toward the e-commerce promised land, so too has the success of Dell
Computer led countless manufacturers to believe that their future
success rides on the ability to sell directly to consumers over the
Internet. But manufacturers who have ventured onto the Web have
found that unless they can convince their retail partners and
distributors they are not out to steal sales from them, bad things
can happen to the bottom line.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A top aide to Russia's acting president, Vladimir
Putin, said Sunday that it is all but impossible for Putin to lose
the presidential election tentatively set for March. For now, at
least, no one seemed to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   After cramming his first two days as acting president with
campaign-style speeches, news conferences, a trip to a war zone and
a chat with President Clinton, Putin kept away from cameras Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But his staff kept the publicity going, suggesting in a news
briefing that Putin is so confident of victory in March that he
will do little traditional campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Putin will run any special election campaign as
he will have to combine the duties of president and prime
minister,'' said Igor Shabdurasulov, the first deputy chief of the
presidential staff.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he was reluctant to make political forecasts,
Shabdurasulov said it was unrealistic to believe that anyone could
beat Putin.
</P>
<P>
   It will be better if Putin wins an outright majority in the
first round of voting, he said, because a runoff election would
only ``waste time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin had been working hard to establish just such an air
of invincibility about Putin even before President Boris Yeltsin
dumbfounded the nation on Friday by resigning and handing Putin the
job of running the country. But for once the optimism seems
justified, even though political half-lives here are as often
measured in months as in years.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's only serious rival so far, the former foreign minister
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, suffered a huge blow when his
political party, Fatherland-All Russia, stumbled in last month's
parliamentary elections. Another contender, Grigory Yavlinsky, the
leader of the liberal Yabloko Party, also faded after the party's
candidates did not do as well in that election as it had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only the Communist Party, which can count on a solid
25 percent to 30 percent of the vote in any election, but not much
more.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Sunday, Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, warned that the mounting casualties among Russian soldiers
in the fierce battle for Chechnya's capital, Grozny, could pose
political problems for Putin if the conflict is not settled soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can't bring this to an end _ a peaceful end _ quickly,
if the costs become too high for the Russians, and the resistance
is increasing, this could become an albatross around his neck in
March,'' Berger said on the ABC interview program ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   If Putin or his aides share that view, however, they are
concealing it nicely. Despite complaints from the West about the
brutality of the war, it has remained the engine of Putin's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Returning Saturday afternoon from a highly publicized trip to
the Chechnya front, Putin said he believes that ``everything we
have done so far has been justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in remarks carried on the Moscow news station Echo
Moskvy, Putin added that the Kremlin has ``no intention to liberate
anything by acting hastily.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to act in the best possible way, which means as few
losses as possible among our servicemen and no losses among the
civilian population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of what already is starting to look like an event-a-day
campaign schedule, Putin was scheduled to meet Sunday with newly
elected members of the lower house of parliament. But all Russia
traditionally rests and celebrates in the days after the New Year,
and not enough legislators could be rounded up for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Shabdurasulov, the presidential aide, sketched out in
barest detail Putin's plans for his transition into the presidency
and for the campaign _ plans more notable for what was not
mentioned than for what was.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that Putin probably will make few changes
in the government he inherited from Yeltsin, although one
presidential adviser, Tatiana Dyachenko, ``probably would change
her status.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyachenko, Yeltsin's 39-year-old daughter, is a crucial
Kremlin political strategist who is rumored to have been behind
Putin's swift rise to power. Shabdurasulov's ambiguous language
left it unclear whether she will remain in the Kremlin or leav her father.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Shabdurasulov said no one had decided whether to
accept the offers of two of Yeltsin's allies, Anatoly Chubais and
Boris Berezovsky, to work in Putin's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, an architect of the economic reforms that ended with
last year's disastrous financial collapse, now runs the nation's
electricity monopoly. Berezovsky, a tycoon who was a major
financier of Yeltsin's 1996 re-election campaign, is said to be a
close friend of Ms. Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's political class will be closely watching the fates of
the three to see whether Putin is setting an independent course or
is _ as critics charge _ a tool for extending the Yeltsin clan's
reign beyond that of its patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   The only sour note Sunday came from the media empire of another
tycoon, Boris Gusinsky, a bitter foe of Berezovsky and now, it
seems, of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly news magazine program ``Itogi,'' broadcast Sunday
night on Gusinsky's NTV network, charged that Kremlin strategists
and KGB veterans like Putin had plotted Yeltsin's resignation for
months _ perhaps without Yeltsin's consent _ in an effort to
prolong their own power.
</P>
<P>
   The program also suggested that they had probably succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broad opportunities now open up for Putin,'' it said. ``The
chances of his competitors for the post of president are now at an
incredibly low level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin has now received a full arsenal of power, almost
unlimited power, and with all of his qualities there is no need to
doubt that the president will use all of the levers to hold onto
this power.''

 SANTIAGO: she said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viviana Uribe, a 48-year-old human rights activist with a warm
smile and confident countenance, dug through her pocketbook for
some pills as she prepared to leave her Santiago apartment to do
some errands the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better, I really do,'' she said in a strong,
steady voice. ``I still get my headaches, but maybe they are a
little better. Ever since I heard Pinochet would be judged for his
crimes, it has been a tremendous relief for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the horrendous torture she experienced _ Ms. Uribe said
that she was raped four times and that, among other things,
electric cables had repeatedly been clamped to her eyelids, lips,
tongue and around her head for bolts of shock during interrogation
sessions _ she appears to be the picture of a well-adjusted woman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Uribe has no ticks or obvious nervous habits as so many
other torture victims do. And although she refused to have her
photograph taken for this article, she spoke with surprising ease
about the disappearances of her husband, Fernando, and her sister
Barbara _ whose pictures, of each smiling broadly, one at a
wedding, the other at the beach _ she keeps posted on the wall next
to her desk.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Ms. Uribe managed to cope by helping around the
office of a local human rights group and marching with other
relatives of the disappeared for an accounting of her husband's and
sister's fates. She took it upon herself to find her torturers,
looking up their addresses in the telephone book, and even to
confront the wives of men she believes raped her.
</P>
<P>
   She says the repeated torture sessions _ some combined with
interrogations _ still made no sense to her. She had belonged to a
radical group that supported the Allende government, but she said
she never did anything more extreme than to plaster walls with
posters. Her interrogators' claims that she had been a threat to
the state were absurd, she said. But through her years of exile in
Mexico and her eventual return to Chile, she mainly kept silent
about her terrible experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own torture always took second place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed a few weeks after Pinochet's arrest, when her
daughter Barbara sat down with her on her living room couch to
discuss the disappearance of her aunt and namesake.
</P>
<P>
   The two had discussed the terror of the Pinochet years many
times in the past, but this time was different. Like many other
family members of the disappeared, Barbara was gathering testimony
for the human rights lawyers in London and Madrid. Under her
daughter's pressing, for the first time Ms. Uribe told her of the
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like vomiting, all the horrible things flowing out
uncontrollably,'' she recalled. ``The torturers are always inside
of me.'' The very next day, Ms. Uribe entered therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Torture had always taken a distant second place to the
disappearances as a political crime and public issue in Chile, but
the Pinochet case has finally pushed the subject front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he took power in 1990, President Patricio Aylwin
established a commission that documented more than 3,000
disappearances during the Pinochet years. But the panel left
torture out of its report, except for cases that ended in death,
leaving many torture victims feeling abandoned and cheated.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for their exclusion goes to the heart of Chile's slow
democratic transition. Pinochet remained a potent political force
as commander in chief of the army until he stepped down from that
post in early 1998, and human rights investigations would have
threatened the uneasy civilian-military balance. Torture was a
particularly sensitive subject because it ina far greater
number of military officers and units than the disappearances,
which were largely the work of two quasi-independent military
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pinochet's arrest, President Eduardo Frei has pressed to
block the general's extradition to Spain, contending that any trial
should be in Chile. His position has been supported by Ricardo
Lagos, a Socialist Party member who is the presidential candidate
of the Socialist-Christian Democratic coalition that has governed
the country for the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   That position has caused anger and pain among many torture
victims, including Fernandez, the unemployed metal worker. ``Their
betrayal,'' he said, ``is the cause of my pounding headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts were made to interview senior officials in the
presidential palace and Ministry, but aides said they were
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of democracy spurred only modest efforts to help
torture victims resuscitate their lives. The government established
a small unit in the Ministry of Health called the Program for the
Integral Repair of Health and Human Rights to treat torture
victims, former political prisoners and family members of the
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 through 1998, 31,102 people received at least some
attention, but over time the program has withered and several
administrators have resigned in frustration. Today many of the
program's original 13 teams _ which were to include a doctor, a
nurse, a social worker and a psychologist _ are now down to a nurse
and social worker. Foreign financing for private and public
agencies that help torture victims has dried up, in part because
the government has refused to pitch in matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Patricia Narvaez, a senior administrator at the health
ministry program, said first-time visits of torture victims last
year for treatment at her agency were up 20 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are great,'' Ms. Narvaez said. ``Some, especially on
the right, wanted to shove this subject into the past, but we have
all been full of silence. It's macabre. It's a phenomenon of
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a conspiracy of silence, the victims are a part of
it. Psychologists say many of the victims are still embarrassed
that they survived while others were executed. Some feel shame for
having given up names of comrades to their torturers, while others
feel paranoia at the thought that people may think they did even
when they did not.
</P>
<P>
   But now their grievances have taken on international legitimacy,
and as the Pinochet case has propelled torture to the top of the
agenda of international human rights law, many torture survivors
say they are happy their testimony can have legal value for the
cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the House of Lords in Britain ruled that Pinochet
could be extradited to Spain on charges of torture and conspiracy
to commit torture only after his government signed the
international Convention against Torture in 1988. A judicial panel
of seven members of the House of Lords, known as the Law Lords,
further ruled that torture was an international crime for which any
court in a country that has signed the convention has jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish judge who issued the warrant for
Pinochet's arrest and who wants to try him in Spain, has
prominently included charges of torture in his case against the
former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of former political prisoners here is
preparing to file the first criminal complaint in a Chilean court
accusing Pinochet, as well as an undetermined number of former
officers, of torture. The hope, leaders of the group say, is to
imprison the leaders of the former military government's vast
torture apparatus and to collect millions of dollars in reparations
from the government. They are beginning with 50 cases and hope to
expand their complaint to 500 in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinochet's arrest catalyzed us,'' said Raul Reyes, a
60-year-old bookseller who is one of the organizers of the
complaint. ``During the dictatorship, we were stigmatized as
criminals and terrorists, and even rebuffed by our families. That's
changing now, albeit slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the change, a lot of torture victims say they feel no
better. As a group, experts say, they still experience high rates
of alcoholism, family violence and chronic unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mortal sin to be 52 years old and a returned political
exile or torture victim,'' said Antonio Ozimica, who is all three.
``People isolate you, and you can't find work.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that has changed for Ozimica since Pinochet's arrest. In
fact, he said he has only felt worse watching the government
working hard to defend the former dictator against extradition. He
has begun therapy at a public hospital under a new government
program to help people who lost their jobs for political reasons,
but relief appears distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lavin wins,'' he said, referring to Joaquin Lavin, the
former official in Pinochet's planning ministry who stands a good
chance of winning the presidency Jan. 16, ``I am going to put a
pistol to my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozimica appears to be a particularly frail man, even among
torture victims. He goes from giddy highs to the deepest lows of
depression from one moment to the next. After what he has gone
through, his gloom is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   As Ozimica tells it, his only crime was to serve as a low-level
accountant in Allende's agrarian reform in the town of Temuco.
Shortly after the coup, he was dismissed and then pulled out of bed
by troops in the middle of the night and dragged through the
streets naked.
</P>
<P>
   For six days he went through torturous interrogation at a local
police station, and he said he had nothing of value to tell them.
For two days he was kept in total darkness, he recalled, the next
two under intense fluorescent lights burning into his eyes. Then
for two more days, he said, he was hung by his wrists, causing the
dislocation of his right shoulder, which is still maimed. He also
lost the ability to feel in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   In another torture session, police dunked him repeatedly in a
tub of water. As he gasped for air, his torturers pulled him up by
his hair and smashed metal plates against his ears until blooded
flooded out of one of them. He remains hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   After months of imprisonment, Ozimica said, he was allowed to
leave the country, and he settled in an Indian village deep in the
Venezuelan Amazon, where he lived for 18 years in a hut under a
zinc roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``The torture made me hate life,'' he said. ``I was so
dehumanized, I figured only the Indians were human beings because
they were nonviolent and they didn't lie. And I didn't need hearing
because it was so quiet in the wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozimica said that he had made a living making cement bricks, but
that his wife left him and took their two children back to Chile.
He finally came back too, after democracy returned, but he still
does not live in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinochet's arrest didn't give me happiness or sadness because
his falling prisoner doesn't solve anything,'' he said. ``So many
of the people who were behind him are still around.''

ADVERTISING: NEW CAMPAIGNS GEARED TO PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commercial opens on a car blasting the 1970s rock 'n' roll
hit ``Rebel, Rebel.'' The car spins out of a parking garage past a
startled guard and into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the pressure to conform,'' a voice-over says, ``and
then there's the Mazda 626.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the car stops short on a suburban street and out steps a
trim woman in her 30s in a skirt and heels, with covered cake in
hand. Continues the voice-over, ``Do not go gently into that PTA
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The point: Sally Suburban requires a four-door sedan for her 1.7
children, but Mazda understands that inside she is still a rebel.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, advertising has sold products by reinforcing
the idea of the traditional family with the ever-attentive parents.
Mothers especially fell victim to this stereotype, having been
depicted through time as selfless martyrs only too happy to cater
to the children.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly the message in advertising to today's parents _
especially to mothers _ says that it's OK to be attractive, hip,
maybe even a bit exciting, and still be a parent.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the Ward and June Cleaver school of
casting, and that is exactly the idea behind it. The suggestion
reinforces a feeling among at least some baby boomers that they
have not become their parents _ that indeed they are still cool.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising for things like automobiles, greeting cards, even
Campbell's Soup and Parents magazine, depict parents as individuals
who sometimes do think of themselves, not just of their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making an emotional connection,'' said Tim Blett,
president of the Doner Automotive unit of Doner, the ad agency
based in Southfield, Mich., that creates Mazda's advertising.
``Buying a sedan can be a disappointing experience _ it suggests
you now have kids and responsibilities and you have to give up many
of the things that were important to you. Our message is that you
don't have to give up youthful spirit as you grow older. You don't
have to give in and give up and conform to parenthood and make a
complete sacrifice about life.''
</P>
<P>
   Doner's research for Mazda found this particular psychology
especially prevalent among a segment of the 34-to-42-year-old
population, which is Mazda's primary customer, said Blett. Doner
defines this group as ``the trailing edge'' of the baby boomers,
who grew up in the shadow of their more famous siblings of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two strong mind-sets in this age group, Doner called one
the ``do the right thing'' traditionalists who accept sacrifice as
a given in marriage and parenting, he said. The other, dubbed the
``life keeps getting better'' group, married later and established
certain lifestyles that they want to maintain despite life's
various stages of aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who developed a way of looking at the world
that was different than any other generation before it,'' Blett
said. ``So when it came time to have kids, they want the marriage
and family, but they were also used to certain experiences,
conveniences and adventures and they don't want to give it all
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisers tapping into this feeling came to it for
different reasons. Campbell Soup Co. _ known for homey spots that
often feature soup, Mom and a snowy day _ wanted to advertise a new
product for women. Its spot is part of a much broader campaign to
depict Campbell's in a contemporary way that fits with how people
``live and eat today,'' said Lisa Zakrajsek, vice president of
Campbell's U.S. Soup.
</P>
<P>
   Set to the song ``Just the Two of Us,'' the spot from BBDO New
York, a unit of Omnicom Group, shows a woman amusingly relishing an
evening alone without her husband and children.
</P>
<P>
   Not that selling the idea of pampering oneself is new. Consider
the ``Take Me Away'' Calgon ads of the 1970s that depicted women
transported from the stresses of life. But Ms. Zakrajsek said this
ad has a different psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a subtle but important change,'' said Ms. Zakrajsek.
``She's not complaining about her life. Our research shows the
contemporary woman is not stressed out and haggard and guilty about
working  pretty happy with life on the whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents magazine is selling the idea that parents are still hip,
as a way to expand its market of advertisers beyond the traditional
categories of baby bottles, diapers and toys.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Look at the Facts,'' its trade advertising campaign
from Anton &AMP; Partners uses headlines like ``Believe it or not,
since becoming parents, 96 percent of our readers report no
significant loss of style.'' Another states, ``Incredibly, 97
percent of our readers didn't feel any less hip after installing a
baby seat.'' Like many of the ads trying to appeal to parents'
nonfamilial side, the ads do not use children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this misperception that once a couple becomes a
parent, no matter how hip or intelligent or affluent, they fall out
of the mainstream for these products,'' said the magazine's
publisher, Sharon Summer. ``That's just not true.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the magazine is attracting nontraditional advertisers that
sell things like beauty, shelter and fashion products, Ms. Summer
said it is still battling to convince young media buyers that
parents have not lost their edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stereotypes die hard,'' Ms. Summer said.
</P>
<P>
   For Volvo North America Corp., talking to parents in a newer and
broader voice solves a marketing problem, said Bob Austin, the
director of marketing communications.
</P>
<P>
   He said company research showed that the Volvo brand stands for
safety and for family. The problem is that most consumers associate
family with the traditional family, which is not representative of
the American landscape, he said. To show that Volvo is an
all-inclusive brand, the company last year ran a poignant but
sophisticated spot showing a divorced family.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional family consisting of a married couple with
children under 12 represents just 25 percent of all family units in
the United States today, Austin said. ``Because we'd like to grow
the company, we want to make more people feel it would be OK for
them to have a Volvo.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this month Mazda will begin a new spot for its 626. This
one has a retro feel and shows a couple on an almost surreal road
trip along the famed Route 66, renamed Route 626 for the
commercial, and set to Chuck Berry's rendition of ``Route 66.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new spot for the Mazda MPV minivan is set to the
recording of ``Everybody Is Free to Wear Sunscreen,'' performed by
the Australian disc jockey Baz Luhrmann and based on a column
written by The Chicago Tribune columnist Mary Schmich.
</P>
<P>
   The column _ which offered playful truisms to graduates _ took
on a cultlike status among young people a few years ago when it was
mistakenly circulated on the Internet as a Kurt Vonnegut
commencement address.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the advertising that makes parents feel hip does beg
the question of whether it really is cool.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to Blett: `It's hip as we defined it when
we were young.`
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's all a state of mind.

   If all the hype surrounding Oprah Winfrey is to be believed,
everything she touches turns to gold: She not only transforms
humble Midwestern housewives into best-selling blockbuster
novelists but when she appears on the cover of a magazine _ as she
did on Vogue in 1998 _ the magazine is sure to be a brisk seller.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines has taken that logic to the next step, and will
introduce a lifestyle magazine licensed by Ms. Winfrey this spring.
The magazine's editor in chief, Ellen Kunes, describes the
still-unnamed project as ``a personal-growth guide for the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about personal growth and positive energy,'' Ms. Kunes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all the growth and good feeling, the magazine will also
cover beauty, fashion, food and design. ``We'll have articles about
real people, books and human drama,'' she said. ``It is going to
help women concentrate on themselves and celebrate or perhaps even
change their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Garfinkle, the director of print media at the
advertising agency McCann-Erickson, said the magazine, from an
advertisers' perspective, is sure to be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is that you could put out a magazine, call it Oprah,
put her picture on the cover, and have blank pages inside and it
would still sell,'' Ms. Garfinkle said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lifestyle market for magazines is increasingly crowded.
In 1999, American Express Publishing put out the first issue of B.
Smith Style, a lifestyle magazine based on the black restaurateur
that should also hold some appeal for black women (and a project
that Hearst turned down three times).
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Hearst will test the waters by publishing just four
or six issues of the Oprah magazine this year. And in the meantime,
Ms. Winfrey has stipulated in her contract with Hearst that she can
still appear on the covers of competing magazines.

   Primedia Ready to Polish `A Diamond in the Rough'
</P>
<P>
   How do you take a company known in part for its sleepy trade
magazines like Soybean Digest and Lapidary Journal and transform it
into a smoking hot new-media company?
</P>
<P>
   Before Tom Rogers became the chief executive of Primedia last
fall, the company was primarily known as a large publisher of
special-interest and trade magazines. Apart from the most
recognizable titles _ New York, Seventeen and Modern Bride _ the
company publishes more than 100 niche magazines from American Baby
to World War II, and also produces and distributes video products
like Channel One and the Law Enforcement Television Network.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers _ the former president of NBC Cable, who expanded the NBC
network into cable and the Internet _ said he intends to nose
Primedia in the direction of new media, partly by generating
e-commerce off the magazine's Web sites and putting the company's
video properties to use on the Internet. He has already implemented
a plan to exchange advertising in the magazines for equity in
new-media ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest challenge is that we need to create an awareness
of what a diamond in the rough this company really is,'' Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., said
Primedia was well set with Rogers, as long as the economy remained
strong. ``Tom has believed in the potential of niche media for more
than a decade, and Primedia gives him a vehicle to prove that it
works in video and Web content as well as in print,'' Wolzien said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Rogers has not been able to accomplish much since
being named to the post in September, in part because of the
company's large staff of 7,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``More employees create more levels of management,'' Rogers
said. ``And the speed at which we can move is certainly an issue.''

   New Channel for Women Is Moving Ahead
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Laybourne acknowledges that she could use more time to
develop the new cable channel for women that her company, Oxygen
Media Inc., will start in February.
</P>
<P>
   But she says ``there are a lot of things that have mitigated the
feeling of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them: substantial financial support. With backers
like Paul Allen and America Online, and partners like Oprah Winfrey
and the television production company Carsey-Werner-Mandabach, Ms.
Laybourne has been able to raise several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Her confidence comes from her conviction that the female
audience is so big and underserved that the opportunities far
outweigh any concern about fulfilling what she admits are ``very
high expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations arise mainly from Ms. Laybourne's resume: She
became the most accomplished women executive in television history
as chairwoman of Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laybourne says Oxygen Media ascribes to be nothing less than
``the HBO of convergence.'' Much of the programming has a direct
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as she notes, there has not been a successful new analog
cable channel for several years, and Oxygen is headed into areas of
the Internet where there are already established Web businesses.
</P>
<P>
   There also remains the problem of getting the new channel onto
cable systems. It will be seen in about 10 million homes beginning
on Feb. 2, a promising but by no means booming start.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``I've never been more sure that this is the
right market and the right time and the right technology.''

   A Film's Startling Budget Is Defended by Disney
</P>
<P>
   The initial working title was ``Tennessee,'' for the state from
which the story's three main characters emerge, but now it is being
referred to as ``Pearl Harbor,'' for the battle that forms the
film's centerpiece. But it was not the titles that raised eyebrows
when Walt Disney Studios recently announced its latest project with
the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. It was the film's startling budget.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of increased cost-cutting, when the common wisdom is
that big-budget movies are having a harder time clicking, Disney's
chairman, Joe Roth, approved Bruckheimer's budget of $145 million.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, the average studio film is made for
$50 million to $60 million, and even films that end up costing $200
million (like ``Titanic'' ) received the green light at less than
half that figure. To give the go-ahead on a movie with a budget
that high is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney executives and Bruckheimer defend the figure as
necessary to tell an epic story that goes from Tennessee to Britain
and from Pearl Harbor to the famous 30-second air raid over Tokyo.
It is not the size of the budget, they say, but whether it is
appropriate to the story and to the movie's potential box-office
power. Bruckheimer points out that the huge budget contains nothing
for actors. The producer and the director, Michael Bay of
``Armageddon,'' plan to use younger (and less expensive) actors in
the leading roles. All the money will go into painstaking
re-creations of the battles.
</P>
<P>
   Second-unit photography has begun as has the casting search,
with principal photography to begin this spring and continue for
months. To show how confident they are, Bruckheimer and Disney have
already announced the release date: the Memorial Day weekend of
2001.

   Sea of Media Scrutiny Grows Even More Crowded
</P>
<P>
   It is said the unexamined life is not worth living. But what
about the examined life?
</P>
<P>
   Once, you could have argued that there was a dearth of media
coverage of the media. But that was before Brill's Content, before
Matt Drudge, before the online ``magazines'' Slate and Salon began
hammering away at the media on a daily and even hourly basis,
before trade publications like The Hollywood Reporter started
online editions and before the appearance of Mediagossip.com, a
daily compilation of media stories from around the country. Even
Editor &AMP; Publisher, the once-sleepy chronicle of the newspaper
industry, is breathing with new life.
</P>
<P>
   Some say this is necessary accompaniment to the Information Age.
Others say it reflects the narcissism of the age; the storyteller
and the story behind the story are deemed as interesting as the
story itself.
</P>
<P>
   Landing in this crowded sea this year will be Powerful Media, a
Web-based media information service with a big name editor, Kurt
Andersen, some seasoned media reporters and big-money investors
like James Cramer, a founder of TheStreet.com, and the venture
capital firm Flatiron Partners.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com will be used as an economic model. Parts of the
site will be free; others will require a subscription. There will
be databases. News coverage will be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a tone of certainty. Many stories, Andersen told Salon in
an interview, ``don't get reported with a kind of cut to the chase
authority _ `Here's the real story.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very rarely do you find that in the trades,'' he said. ``In
newspapers, partly because of the accreted protocols of the form,
you can't just say what's what.''
</P>
<P>
   Some competitors say the venture will fail for lack of
resources, that Powerful Media is overestimating the obsession with
media.
</P>
<P>
   Is Andersen obsessed?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, he says. It's just that ``the way in which our lives
_ for better and for worse _ are being transmogrified into a
wall-to-wall entertainment media dome is interesting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Ad Giants Plan to Join Forces
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most powerful names in advertising are betting that
three heads will be better than one _ or even two.
</P>
<P>
   Three giant agency companies are planning to join forces to
create the world's No. 4 advertising behemoth in revenue, at $1.8
billion, and No. 5 in billings, at more than $13 billion. The deal
would unite the two largest privately held agency companies, Leo
Group in Chicago and MacManus Group in New York, while Dentsu, the
biggest agency in Japan, invests an undisclosed amount of cash to
acquire about a 20 percent stake in the merged operation.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is for the combined agency company _ so new that it has
only a tentative name, BDM, for Burnett, Dentsu and MacManus _ to
sell stock at some point this year. That is in itself a
considerable gamble, assuming that the bull market on Wall Street
for communications stocks roars on long enough for a lucrative
initial public offering to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no assurance that merging Leo and MacManus, even
with a cash infusion from Dentsu, will be sufficient to start
closing the gaps in revenue and billings with the Big Three agency
companies: Interpublic Group of Cos., Omnicom Group and WPP Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dentsu is huge in Japan, but minuscule in the U.S.,'' said
Alan J. Gottesman, who follows Madison Avenue for West End
Communications/Consulting in New York. ``And Burnett is huge in
Chicago, kind of OK in other places in the U.S. and not really
there in places outside the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is no guarantee that the cultures of the myriad
agencies being brought under the BDM umbrella will mesh rather than
clash. They include N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners, Leo Burnett, D'Arcy
Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications, the Kaplan Thaler Group,
Mediavest and Starcom.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The booming economy is worsening a severe
shortage of the low-wage workers who care for the nation's growing
numbers of frail elderly people, health care experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of home health care nurses and aides and nursing
home assistants has deepened in the last two years as better paying
jobs with better conditions have opened up for the women who have
traditionally filled those positions, which have low wages and few
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   To a lesser extent, many in the industry say, cuts in Medicare
have made the strenuous jobs even more demanding as agencies have
made up for reduced income by requiring workers to deliver more
care in less time.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every state is grappling with the shortage in some way,
according to a national survey conducted this year by North
Carolina. New Jersey recently put the recruitment of home health
care workers at the top of its list of priorities for elderly care,
and states including Florida, Pennsylvania and Maryland have
established task forces to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A task force has also been formed in Connecticut by the
Association for Home Care, a trade organization, with the state
participating. In New York City, with its large pool of immigrant
workers, the shortage is less severe. But the rest of the state
mirrors the country, and the state's home care association is
looking for ways to find more workers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the experts cannot find help when they need it. Mary
Mongan, a registered nurse who is vice chairman of the New
Hampshire State Council on Aging and a former state health
commissioner, knows how to negotiate the health services world as
well as anyone. But when cancer was diagnosed in her 83-year-old
sister-in-law three years ago and the sister-in-law wanted to stay
at home, in Manchester, N.H., Ms. Mongan could not find home health
care aides who could provide 24-hour help.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister-in-law was forced to move to Maryland to live with
her daughter, Ms. Mongan said. ``We couldn't put together enough
dependable help,'' she said. ``They didn't have the manpower.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage involves the people, most of them women from their
mid-20s to mid-40s, who do the basic, unpleasant and often
dangerous work _ bathing, changing diapers, cleaning bedsores,
feeding, lifting and transferring people in and out of bed _ for
the fastest growing population in the country, the very old. And
these days, more and more of those workers find they can earn about
the same wages at McDonald's, or Target.
</P>
<P>
   With somhealth care aides financed by Medicare, the
federal health insurance for the elderly, others by Medicaid, the
federal insurance for the poor, and even more through private
payments, it is difficult to accurately estimate the numbers of
home health care aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the figure of aides financed
by Medicare and Medicaid at 697,000 in 1996, a number that includes
paid homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of additional home health care workers will be
needed in the coming years, experts say, with the number of jobs to
be filled expected to increase by 76 percent between 1996 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina alone will need about 21,000 more nursing aides
and other aides _ in nursing homes as well as in the community _
over the next five to six years, according to the state's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a bad economy, when you can't get any other job, and you
have a sixth-grade education, being a home health aide is an
attractive job,'' said Carol Keintz, executive director of the Home
Health Assembly of New Jersey, a nonprofit trade association. ``In
a good economy, when Dunkin' Donuts doesn't care if you've got a
sixth-grade education, it's tough to find people.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Keintz said, fast food restaurants and retail
stores like Target offer steady, full-time work, often with
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Home care, with clients whose needs constantly change and with
Medicare limiting the number of visits, tends to be part time and
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agencies can't say, `We can promise you a job every day,'''
Ms. Keintz said. ``Suddenly, five of their patients die, or go to
the hospital, and they say to the worker, `Don't come in today.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finding workers is particularly difficult in states like
Florida, where the tourism industry offers an abundance of
relatively unskilled jobs. ``We're having a terrific problem
finding home health care aides,'' said Gene Tischer, executive
director of the Associated Home Health Industries of Florida, a
nonprofit trade association.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That same level of worker is attracted to restaurants and
hotels. It's highly competitive,'' Tischer said. ``It's easier work
to go to Arby's than to go into your house and give your dad a
bath.''

<P>
   Here in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Charmane Ellis, 33, had just
finished giving Antonietta Mannino, 81, a gentle sponge bath in her
small rowhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she was kneeling before the older woman, pulling on her
support stockings, orthopedic shoes and the brace she wears on her
right leg. In addition to severe arthritis, Mrs. Mannino has
suffered a series of small strokes. Because she is recovering from
a recent hospitalization after a fall down her front steps,
Medicare pays for Ms. Ellis' time.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mannino's husband, Thomas, a retired milkman, died five
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about him with Ms. Ellis, Mrs. Mannino began to weep.
Ms. Ellis stroked her arm. ``It's OK to cry, Mrs. Mannino,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellis, a certified home health aide, earns $7.65 an hour, a
little more than the average for home health care aides in
Philadelphia. On such wages, plus health insurance, she is raising
four children alone in a public housing project here. She pulled
herself off welfare nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry where most home health agencies report a 40
percent to 60 percent turnover in aides every year, Charmane Ellis
is an anomaly. She has been doing this work for 14 years. For her,
like so many other dedicated aides, taking care of the elderly is a
calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is my thing to do in life,'' Ms. Ellis said.
``It makes me feel appreciated. I figure I'm going to be there one
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like our founding fathers,'' she added, talking about
her clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot to tell. When bread was five cents, when their
mothers used to sit them outside, their pretty dresses,
crinolines.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellis began her morning on Tuesday with a 45-minute ride on
the trolley, and then a 10-minute walk in the cold, to spend an
hour bathing and dressing Connie Prendergast, 77, in her rowhouse.
Mrs. Prendergast has cancer and is tethered to an oxygen tank 24
hours a day. Medicare pays for Ms. Ellis' visits to her as hospice
care.
</P>
<P>
   When someone dies on her watch, Ms. Ellis said, there is no time
to grieve. ``They pay you to go on to the next person like they're
just a number,'' she said. ``I'm a sensitive person. The aide needs
an hour to pull themselves together.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of her clients are appreciative. Home health care is
intimate, hands-on work, and one or two clients, who were white,
made it clear they did not want a black woman touching them, Ms.
Ellis said. Other clients are severely cognitively impaired, and
one man threw feces at her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She cleaned herself off, Ms. Ellis said, and went about her job.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Prendergast, Ms. Ellis spent a hurried hour with Mrs.
Mannino.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, before the Medicare cuts, she would have
had twice as much time. With the new constraints, she said, she was
unable to make Mrs. Mannino's bed, fix her lunch, or do the light
housecleaning that her job description includes. Mrs. Mannino, who
cannot walk unassisted, is too weak to do any of those things. She
is fortunate to have family members who can fill in.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Mrs. Mannino, Ms. Ellis made a 45-minute trolley trip to
the home of Emanuel Saunders. Saunders, a 75-year-old retired truck
driver, is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. He cannot
talk or walk or feed himself. His wife, Lillian, 58, who works in a
car assembly factory, and his daughter Kia, 28, greeted Ms. Ellis
warmly. With Kia's help, Ms. Ellis carefully lifted Saunders from
his wheelchair into bed, and changed the dressing on his bedsore.
His diaper did not need changing this time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellis works for an unusual agency. HomeCare Associates is
owned by the workers. In addition to offering wages that are about
20 per cent higher than the industry average, HomeCare offers its
aides health benefits and pays for the time they spend traveling to
clients. HomeCare was started six years ago by the Paraprofessional
Healthcare Institutnprofit health advocacy group in the
South Bronx that has opened two similar worker-owned home health
care agencies, one in the South Bronx, the other in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The three agencies offer their aides four weeks of training _
the industry norm is 75 hours _ and they try to give them full-time
work, as well as opportunities for advancement. Ms. Ellis hopes to
become a scheduler, working out of the office, and, eventually, a
nurse. The idea is to treat home health care aides like respected
professionals. The three agencies all report turnovers of less than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a nation, if we truly are concerned about our elders, we
need to become more concerned about those people who are caring for
them on a daily basis,'' said Andy Van Kleunen, director of work
force policy for Paraprofessional Healthcare. ``In the past, we
could always assume there were going to be a lot of low-income men
and women out there to do the work. We didn't have to worry about
creating good jobs they'd be interested in staying in. If we want
to have enough caregivers for the elderly, we're going to have to
invest in those caregivers.''

   AVTURY, Russia _ The soldiers in Russia's 74th Brigade call the
pile of bricks and concrete on the outskirts of this Chechen town
``the white wall.'' The bulwark lies in the shadow of the Caucasus
Mountains and marks one of the deepest lines of the Russian advance
into southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a primary target for hundreds of rebels hiding in
Chechnya's high country. Russian troops here are anticipating a
major attack in the next few days. So are the Chechen residents of
Avtury. Many of them are packing up and getting out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shelled by mortar fire every day,'' said Anton Kuzin, a
private in the Russian army whose bandaged right hand was laced by
shell fragments Sunday afternoon. ``It's pretty scary, but I think
we will win in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's attention is focused on Grozny, the Chechen
capital. But there are two fronts in the war in Chechnya: that
besieged city in the Chechen lowland, and the mountains in
Chechnya's south.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy fire, the rebels have retreated into both regions,
but they have hardly given up the fight. Instead of fleeing deeper
into the mountains, the rebels have been trying to counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Their apparent aim is to reunite their forces by blasting a path
from their mountain hideouts to Grozny and other Chechen towns in
the lowland to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task of our unit is to prevent the militants from breaking
through from the mountains to the plains,'' said Yevgeny, a deputy
brigade commander who holds the rank of colonel and who declined to
give his last name. ``There are more and more attempts these days,
and the fighting is quite fierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Avtury is a town about 18 miles southeast of Grozny. It sits in
the shadow of the Caucasus Mountains and on a major north-south
road junction. It was a quiet and well-to-do settlement before the
war, nestled among rich farmland that today is scarred with wrecked
cars, trenches and collapsed fences.
</P>
<P>
   The 74th Brigade, a motorized infantry unit, fought its way here
in early December. It has been tough going ever since. The rebel
trenches are just several hundred yards away and can be seen
through binoculars. The fields and hillsides echo with artillery
and the rat-a-tat-tat of automatic weapons. The two sides are so
close that they sometimes yell profanities at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine-gun fire and snipers are so active that it's hard
for us to dig trenches,'' said Dmitry, a 23-year-old lieutenant at
an observation post, an earthen mound near a pile of trees, leveled
in an earlier round of fighting. ``They are trying to sneak through
and get to the villages in the north. It's nerve-racking to be
here, and we practically don't sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100,000 Russian troops in Chechnya and some
8,000 rebels, according to Russian estimates. The Russians also
have the superior firepower. They have the tanks, self-propelled
artillery and armored personnel carriers. Sunday, the Russian
artillery was barraging the rebel camps, sending thunderous booms
through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such an overwhelming advantage, Russian soldiers say
they are up against a determined foe.
</P>
<P>
   Their edge in numbers and armor has allowed the Russians to
sweep across the northern plains with relative ease and capture the
lowland. But the Russians' large numbers and heavy weapons are less
effective in the close urban streets of Grozny or in the rugged
highland of southern Chechnya, and these are the areas where the
rebels are hiding and where Russia now risks getting bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   The terrain here is far more familiar to the militants, who are
proving surprisingly mobile as they range around the hills in Kamaz
trucks and jeeps, the Russians say.
</P>
<P>
   They respond to the Russian bombardment by firing mortars, which
on Sunday destroyed one Russian tank, and with snipers, who wounded
Kuzin. Russian soldiers assert that Arab and other Islamic
mercenaries are fighting alongside the Chechens. Yevgeny, the
deputy brigade commander, said his troops have recovered notes in
Arabic from some of the rebel casualties and a round-trip airline
ticket from Istanbul, Turkey, to Tblisi, the capital of neighboring
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rebel attacks generally begin in the morning when the
militants crawl through the dense fog toward the Russian lines, in
groups that range from several dozen to as many as 150, sometimes
getting close enough to lob a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the Russians, the militants sometimes leave
their trenches and charge across open terrain. One rebel ran up to
the Russian positions five days ago shouting ``Allah akbar'' (``God
is great'') and tossed a grenade into a Russian armored personnel
carrier before he was gunned down.
</P>
<P>
   The militants are sometimes so bold that Russian troops say they
must be taking drugs, an allegation for which there is no evidence
but which reflects the Russians' astonishment at the aggressiveness
of their foe.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians think they are causing heavy casualties, but it is
difficult to know for sure since the militants rarely leave their
dead behind.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting near the Caucasus Mountains also has special
complications for the Russian troops. Unlike those who live in the
northern plains of Chechnya, much of the population here is
sympathetic to the rebels. Even in the southern areas the Russians
say they have liberated, they are not always welcome and have
difficulty maintaining control, especially after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny, the colonel, said that Avtury's residents give the
rebels information on the location of Russian troops and that a
senior Russian Interior Ministry official who was kidnapped before
the war was sometimes held here.
</P>
<P>
   Russian armored vehicles have recently run into mines, laid by
Avtury residents who sneak out at night. The Russian soldiers
believe that villagers who are packing up and leaving have been
tipped off by the militants that an attack is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Russian campaign to win the support of the local
population here, the brigade has also been ordered not to fire at
the village of Serzhen-Yurt, less than two miles north of here.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of the militants are believed to have taken refuge
among the villagers. The village elders from Serzhen-Yurt have
talked to the Russian soldiers here and told them that the
militants have made themselves at home in their town and refuse to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the main action was at the so-called white wall, a mound
of rubble with small openings through which the Russian troops
exchange fire at the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were doing most of the shooting, but they did not
silence the militants. This is where Kuzin, a young draftee from
the town of Angarsk in Siberia, was wounded Sunday at about 4 p.m.
by a sniper.
</P>
<P>
   He was wearing a bullet-proof vest, so the sniper aimed at the
lower part of his body. The bullet blasted his right hand, which he
was holding by his side. He did not seem surprised to have been
wounded. An officer in his platoon was wounded just Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really scary to be here,'' Kuzin said. ``But the fighting
has also drawn all of the soldiers together. Nobody cares what
nationality you are. We feel like we are all in this together.
We're ready to stay at the front.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kuzin was blunt when he was asked whether any of the
soldiers had ever re-enlisted so that they could stay with their
comrades after their term of service expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' he said.

NEW YEAR BRINGS AN END FOR REPAIR CORPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Paul Maszczak was tapped more than three years ago to head
his company's year 2000 computer repairs, he recalled, ``I
considered it the kiss of death.'' Instead of developing new
software using the latest technology, he would be relegated to
fixing programs written years or decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Maszczak now says that becoming year 2000 manager at C.R.
Bard Inc., a medical-device manufacturer in Murray Hill, N.J., was
one of the best moves in his 30-year career in data processing. The
job lifted him out of the narrow confines of the information
technology department, exposing him to all aspects of his company's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with those efforts winding down, Maszczak thinks his
broader business knowledge has prepared him for a bigger management
job. As for day-to-day systems work, ``I could never go back,'' he
said. Now, he said, ``we're free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 has finally arrived, and the vast Y2K repair corps
is being scattered to the winds, having apparently saved the world
from the widespread disasters once feared.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is great relief that few year 2000 problems
emerged over the weekend, some Y2K workers, having completed a task
that has consumed them for months or years, must now struggle with
what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Like Maszczak, some workers expect to go on to bigger and better
things. Most others are simply going back to previous jobs, as
corporate information-processing departments return to work they
had put aside in their race to repair year 2000 flaws. Yet for many
others, the end of the readiness efforts means the end of their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For Randall Bart, for instance, year 2000 work proved to be a
short-lived bonanza. After being laid off from Unisys, the computer
maker, in 1988, Bart did not find work as a programmer until 10
years later, when Y2K made what he calls his ``obsolete
experience'' worth $45 an hour. But his last job ended in August
and Bart, 43, who lives in Los Angeles, has been unable to find
work since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping for some big disaster somewhere to hit,'' he said,
only half joking.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, year 2000 work is not ending abruptly. It has been
ratcheting down for months, and thousands of people have already
been dismissed, but work will continue, because computer problems
might still arise over the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubin, a consultant and head of the computer science
department at Hunter College in New York, who surveyed big
corporations about their preparedness activities, estimates that as
many as a fourth of the 2 million information technology workers in
big companies in the United States did Y2K repairs at one time or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, computer people are not the only ones who got
involved. Many others were swept up in the effort _ contacting
suppliers and customers to assess their readiness, surveying
factory machinery, planning for contingencies and so on. All told,
many millions of people throughout the world were involved in year
2000 preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Many people profited handsomely, taking their share of the more
than $250 billion the world is estimated to have spent to enable
computers and other electronic machinery to recognize that a year
can begin with 20 instead of 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It absolutely made our company,'' said Peter A. Allen,
president of Data Dimensions Inc., a computer consulting concern
that grew from about $1 million in annual revenues in the early
1990s to $115 million in 1998, 80 percent of it from year 2000
work.
</P>
<P>
   But that work has already slowed significantly, and the
Bellevue, Wash., company has laid off about 300 of its 850 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the customer contacts and skills the company has
developed doing year 2000 work will help it move into other areas,
like electronic commerce. But investors are not so sure. Data
Dimension's stock price has fallen from a peak of almost $40 in
late 1997 to under $3 today.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago there were predictions that the world would
not have enough programmers to scan billions of lines of code and
fix any date problems. Some programmers were lured out of
retirement to fix programs they had written decades earlier, and
there was even talk of enlisting prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, salaries for programmers and systems analysts did jump,
and many companies offered retention bonuses to keep programmers
from jumping ship until well into 2000. Union Bank of California,
for instance, gave year 2000 workers bonuses equal to 10 percent of
their salaries in 1998 and 1999. Those who stay until March will be
eligible for an additional bonus equal to 20 percent of their
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But the great shortage never materialized. Many companies that
were started to do year 2000 work for others got far less business
than they had anticipated. While early predictions were that
repairs would cost $1 or $2 for each line of code, prices dropped
to 25 cents a line or even lower. And many retirees did not find
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the repairs turned out to be less complex
than had been imagined, in part because software was developed to
help automate the process. Indeed, the year 2000 was quickly
transformed from a problem involving older computer programs to a
generalized business, political and legal issue, as companies
wrestled with contingency planning, supplier and customer
relationships and questions of legal liability and public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The code really has been the smallest issue in all of this,''
said Lou Marcoccio, research director at Gartner Group, another
consulting company. In many companies, he said, the nonprogrammers
working on the problem outnumbered the programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, companies were able to handle it, even if they
occasionally had to strain to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the consultant, said that on average, big companies spent
about 10 percent of their information technology budgets over three
years of year 2000 repairs, although for peak periods the issue
consumed as much as half the computer budgets of some companies.
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., for instance, spent $520 million over several
years on its year 2000 effort, but the brokerage spends $3.2
billion a year on information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies did the job in-house, even if it meant pushing
other work aside. It was cheaper that way and the company's own
programmers were most familiar with the software that had to be
fixed. Edison International, which owns Southern California Edison,
did its year 2000 work for $70 million after rejecting a
contractor's offer to do it for $171 million, said Eric Trapp, who
managed the job for the utility.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies contracted work to firms in India, where wages
are lower. But some industry officials say there was also less of
that than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   For repair companies and individual programmers wondering what
to do next, the good news is that there is an overall shortage of
computer people, especially as software development that was
postponed to deal with year 2000 work moves back up companies'
priority lists.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that the greatest demand is for people who can
design Internet software, especially for electronic retailing; the
expertise of most year 2000 companies and workers lies in older
computers and programs, known as legacy systems.

 UNDATED: legacy systems.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These people built up the Latin of technology,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still if the episode taught the world anything, it is that these
legacy systems are vital and are not going away any time soon.
There is still a lot of work to be done on them, including enabling
them to connect to Internet software. And many companies have put
off these other jobs while they focused on the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been building up a really nice backlog of things to
do,'' said Lee Kirkpatrick, senior vice president and year 2000
manager for Union Bank, who said the priority would shift to
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch rushed to finish most year 2000 work by June 30 so
it could devote more resources to designing its online
stock-trading system, said John McKinley, the brokerage's chief
technology officer. Now, he said, former year 2000 programmers are
being put on jobs like getting the company ready for 24-hour stock
exchanges and decimalization of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   With Y2K, computer professionals, often stereotyped as geeks and
loners, found themselves the life of the party, sought out by
laymen friends for counsel on whether the world was really going to
end on Jan. 1. More people within corporations and in society came
to appreciate the importance of their work.
</P>
<P>
   But the limelight was not always comfortable. After all, it was
programmers who created the year 2000 problem by representing years
using two digits instead of four, a tactic that seemed rational in
the early days of computing as a way to conserve scarce computer
memory and data storage. If Jan. 1 had brought a rash of mishaps,
the computer profession would have faced even more criticism for
shoddy work, and perhaps pressure for government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, now that the date rollover appears to be going
smoothly, some critics are saying that the threat was exaggerated
by computer professionals out to make a buck.
</P>
<P>
   While there were clearly some charlatans, many programmers still
recovering from an exhausting, nerve-racking race against an
immutable deadline are now feeling like victims of their own
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already hearing that from my own family _ that it's all
been overblown,'' said Celia Murray, a systems analyst with the
Office of Real Property Services, a New York state agency. ``I
think it could have been really bad, no question about it. A lot of
people worked really hard. That's the reason people can sit here
and say it's all overblown.''

SHANKAR DAYAL SHARMA, 81, FORMER PRESIDENT OF INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, the emotional but decisive president
of India in the turbulent years from 1992 to 1997, died Dec. 26 in
a hospital in New Delhi. He was 81 and lived in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma, a longtime member of the Congress Party, was its
president for a time. Sharma, whose doctorate was in law from
Cambridge, was elected, with support from Congress and leftist
groups, ninth president of India. That role is is largely
ceremonial, though its powers include discretion in choosing a
prime minister if no party has a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when that situation arose, Sharma was at the center of
a maelstrom over forming a government. He was faced with what
constitutional experts said then was one of the most challenging
moments in the history of independent India.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to win praise for giving the prime ministership to
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, president of the main Hindu nationalist
party, who had not been prime minister but who portrayed himself as
a conciliator. Vajpayee failed to win a vote of confidence and
stepped down after 13 days in office. But he rebounded and is the
current prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sharma voiced a hopeful view of the future of
Indian-Chinese relations. In a speech at a banquet attended by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, he spoke of the countries as ``the
two great nations of broad-mindedness and wisdom'' that had
pioneered human civilization, adding, ``We will surely bring a
cooperative and constructive partnership into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first year as president, Sharma took control of Uttar
Pradesh in northeastern India and dismissed the state legislature.
He acted after Hindu militants from around India had gone to the
state and destroyed a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya, which they
said had been built on the site where the Hindu god Ram was born.
More than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, died in the ensuing
nationwide violence between Hindus and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma was sometimes highly emotional. In 1990, while he was
vice president and was presiding over the upper house of
Parliament, turmoil caused him to break into tears and leave the
hall, saying that he could not be a party to ``the murder of
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in the state of Bhopal in central India. After
receiving master's degrees from Lucknow University, he joined the
movement for independence from British rule and was imprisoned for
a time before India became independent in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to 1977, Sharma was communications minister, and later
he became governor of Andra Pradesh and Punjab. He was elected vice
president and held the post from 1987 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Vimla, two sons and a daughter.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With tuberculosis rampant in much of the developing
world and immigration from those countries at a record high, public
health officials are calling for large-scale TB screening programs
in cities with large immigrant communities and at the nation's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   In southeast Texas, where thousands of illegal immigrants are
placed in crowded detention centers after trying to cross the
border, doctors have installed X-ray machines to help isolate
quickly anyone who might be infected with tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City and other metropolitan areas, doctors have set
up outreach programs and TB testing at places where immigrants
congregate, like English-language schools and churches. The goal,
officials said, is to reach and treat those most at risk because
they come from countries with high rates of TB.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
American Medical Association said recently that the key to
eliminating TB in the United States is eliminating it in the
country's foreign-born population.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, immigrants accounted for nearly 42 percent of the
18,361 tuberculosis cases reported nationwide, although they
represented just over 10 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said the TB rates in specific groups of
immigrants reflect the occurrence of tuberculosis in their home
countries. The disease is particularly endemic in Latin America,
Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As legal and illegal immigration from those parts of the world
has grown _ and as immigrants increasingly travel back and forth on
visits to their homelands _ the prevalence of the disease among the
foreign-born has become more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuberculosis is a problem for the rest of the world,'' said
Dr. Abraham G. Miranda, an infectious disease expert with the
Public Health Service, which screens immigrants in the custody of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``And if it's a problem
for the rest of the world, it's a problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend was largely hidden behind generally positive news on
the TB battlefront, where the overall number of tuberculosis cases
nationwide has declined steadily since 1992. That was the peak year
in a flare-up of the disease that was associated with human
immunodeficiency virus infections.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, 1,067 of the 2,000 cases reported in New York
state, or 53 percent, were in people born outside the country. In
California, the foreign-born accounted for 70 percent, and in
Hawaii for 71 percent, of TB cases. The foreign-born also showed a
disproportionately high number of cases of a more dangerous strain
of TB that is resistant to many drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of TB in immigrants have said that most patients are
infected in their home countries, but develop the active form of
the disease once they are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The airborne bacteria that spread tuberculosis can lie dormant
in a person's lungs for years. Most people who have been exposed
never develop the active form of the disease. But about 5 percent
do; for various reasons, including an underlying medical problem,
stress or malnutrition, the bacteria may become active and highly
contagious years later.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a TB threat that originates outside the
country's borders has raised complicated policy and financial
issues. If the public health system goes out and tests people for
TB, health officials said, it is also obligated to treat them if
the disease is present.
</P>
<P>
   But in a footloose age when foreigners flow in and out of the
country for short-term study and business, immigrants regularly
return home and Americans travel to countries where the disease is
prevalent, who among them should be tested?
</P>
<P>
   ``These are questions that we will need to grapple with,'' said
Dr. Kenneth G. Castro, director of the centers' division of TB
elimination. ``At the moment, we don't know how much TB is
contributed by people like temporary tourists and students, for
example. If we test, we want to make sure it is scientifically
based and not capricious.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most public health officials said the TB risk among immigrants
was a cause for worry, but not yet for alarm. But, as demonstrated
by measures taken recently against Tibetan refugees trying to enter
Canada, fear of the disease can produce a draconian response.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly five months, anyone of Tibetan origin who has come to
the Peace Bridge just north of Buffalo, N.Y., has been immediately
segregated from others trying to cross into Canada, forced to don a
bright yellow surgical mask and wait outside the Canadian
immigration office, no matter what the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibetans are eventually taken, usually by taxi with a driver
who also wears a mask, to a doctor in Niagara Falls, who gives them
a chest X-ray. Only when the doctor pronounces them TB-free can the
Tibetans proceed. Even then, Canadian agents at the border have
sometimes greeted the bewildered immigrants in biohazard jumpsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The border agents instituted the procedure, which is viewed as
humiliating by refugee advocates and extreme by public health
officials, after eight Tibetan asylum-seekers, out of 400 processed
at the bridge last year, were found to have tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem unfair to single out Tibetans,'' said Dawa
Tsering, a 54-year-old Tibetan who recently went to the bridge to
apply for entry to Canada and was forced to stand outside, in his
mask, in blustery, 40-degree weather. ``But of course, we are
willing to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   People like Tsering, who was desperate to start a new life in
Canada, may accept such treatment as the cost of crossing a border.
But it will not work, health experts said, for foreigners who are
already living in a country and resist TB screening because of the
stigma attached to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may make absolute sense to screen certain subpopulations
because you have evidence of rates of TB way out of proportion to
what we see elsewhere,'' said Castro. ``But how you do that without
contributing to additional stigma is a challenge we're all
confronted with.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants already get tested. People already living in the
United States who apply to become legal permanent residents must
show they do not have active TB. So must people who apply for
immigrant visas while in another country.
</P>
<P>
   At the nation's borders and in its detention centers, where up
to 20,000 immigrants are incarcerated at any one time, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has taken a more aggressive
approach lately to tuberculosis screening.
</P>
<P>
   Since the installation seven months ago of a radiology machine
at its remote Port Isabel processing center in southeast Texas, for
example, every person caught trying to enter illegally from Mexico
has been given a chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Until the results are known _ usually within four hours _ they
wait outside. Those with symptoms of TB infection can then be
isolated and tested further in nearby hospitals _ at a cost of
$1,000 a day _ before they are housed with other detainees in
indoor dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   The agency plans to install similar units over the coming year
at four additional detention centers, in Texas, Florida and two in
in California, at a cost of $750,000 per machine. If all centers
had the X-ray machines, officials said, they could help avoid
incidents like one last summer at a New York City detention center,
where an African immigrant was found to have contagious
tuberculosis only after he had been placed in a dormitory with
dozens of other men. Doctors at the center said he may have
infected several people who came into contact with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Isabel center is a hot spot of tuberculosis because it
receives thousands of people from Mexico and Central America, where
the disease is endemic.
</P>
<P>
   The TB rate at the INS center in 1997, the latest year for which
statistics are available, was equivalent to 190 per 100,000 people.
To put that into perspective, the country as a whole that year had
7.2 cases per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the foreign-born TB is reactivation, and one factor
that reactivates TB is a drop in body weight,'' said Miranda, the
Texas center's clinical director. ``And a lot of people coming from
Central America are literally walking through Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The arduous journey takes its toll, he said. Recently,
immigration officials stopped a truck at the border and found 30
illegal immigrants who had spent three days crammed into a closed
space 8 feet square with a coughing man with contagious
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the people in detention centers like Port
Isabel end up deported, those with active TB are held and treated.
A more difficult issue arises when doctors find people with dormant
tuberculosis, which is routinely treated in the United States with
drugs that must be taken for a full six months. Patients who stop
too soon risk developing the more dangerous, drug-resistant form of
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   For immigrants already living in the United States, most public
health experts favor an approach focusing on people who are most at
risk for tuberculosis infection from their home countries and least
likely to seek medical care.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, which has one of the most aggressive
TB-control programs in the country, nearly 55 percent of the
tuberculosis cases in 1998 were in the foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of cases, officials said, were seen in people
who had emmigrated from China, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and
Ecuador, but the disease was also found in immigrants from 87 other
countries and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the immigrant groups with the highest number of TB
cases are Mexicans, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Indians, Chinese,
Haitians and Koreans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starting about three years ago, the city has been running radio
advertisements in different languages encouraging immigrants to be
tested and it has hired health care workers to offer TB skin tests
at churches, English-language schools and other places where
immigrants congregate.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 people have been tested as part of this outreach
program, with 30 percent overall showing a positive result,
indicating possible TB infection. The test, a follow-up chest X-ray
and the course of treatment are provided free.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, TB control is easier with this population
because we know where the cases are now, in this group vs. that
group,'' said Dr. Paula Fujiwara, the assistant commissioner for
tuberculosis control at the state Department of Health. ``But it's
also gotten harder because you have to run several TB control
programs that are linguistically and culturally sensitive.''

ISRAEL AND SYRIA WILL ATTEMPT TO SURMOUNT OLD OBSTACLES TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Having done little more than break the ice in their
first encounter last month, Israeli and Syrian leaders enter
knottier terrain Monday as they resume U.S.-brokered negotiations
ambitiously aimed at reaching a peace accord by the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact of their meeting was achievement enough when the
Israelis and the Syrians revived their peace effort in December
after a four-year stalemate. This time the two sides will be forced
to tackle directly the tangle of issues that have bedeviled their
previous efforts at peacemaking: borders, security, and the
establishment of normal relations.
</P>
<P>
   But with an apparently strong will to overcome their
differences, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria, both of whom left for the
United States Sunday, have agreed to lock themselves and their
delegations away with U.S. mediators in a West Virginia hotel for
the next week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   U.S., Syrian and Israeli officials have been careful to damp
expectations that the talks would produce anything concrete, and
Israeli officials distanced themselves from earlier assessments
that a general declaration of principles or some kind of written
document would emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barak's departing words as he left Ben Gurion Airport
near Tel Aviv made it clear that he saw his trip as significant
enough to be placed in the context of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on this runway, Menahem Begin took off to Camp David, and
this is where he returned from Camp David,'' Barak said, invoking
the legacy of the late prime minister who made peace with Egypt 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here from this runway, Yitzhak Rabin took off to bring
peace with Jordan, and thereafter with the Palestinians,'' Barak
said, referring to the assassinated prime minister who was his
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Sunday described ``a huge
historic opportunity'' in the renewed negotiations, but she
declined to predict how many rounds of talks it might take to reach
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's official newspaper, reflecting the dour public posture
that Syria has taken since talks resumed last month, expressed
pointed doubts about the possibility of accomplishment. ``The
outcome of the first round does not give us reason to be
optimistic,'' the daily Al-Thawra said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's ultimate goal for the negotiations is clear. And in
the last few weeks, he has started to build a case for why Israelis
should coalesce to support a withdrawal from the Golan Heights _
the sine qua non of a Syrian-Israeli accord.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mixed message, combining scare tactics with appeals to a
battle-scarred nation's fantasies of peace. But it presumes that
the negotiations, to be held at a hotel in Shepherdstown, W.Va.,
will bear fruit in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Barak dreams aloud of a near utopia if the
peace effort succeeds: not only an end to battle but harmony in the
Middle East, ``unprecedented economic growth'' in Israel and a
``sky high'' international image for his country. On the other, he
warns of violent cataclysm if it fails.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also tried to lure Israelis with the prospect of
bringing Israeli soldiers home from southern Lebanon by summer,
even of shortening the compulsory three-year military service.
Israeli officials leaked last week that the prime minister had
approved a plan to withdraw from Lebanon, which is controlled by
Syria, as soon as April, if the atmosphere in the negotiations is
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to revive an old-fashioned Zionist self-righteousness,
Barak has also appealed to ``this generation'' to be unselfish
enough to make sacrifices that will benefit the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of even the most successful war is immeasurably more
expensive than the price of peace, no matter how heavy,'' he wrote
during the weekend in a rare published message to the nation. ``So
we must not be deterred from this decision. At the moment of truth,
Israel will discover its courage for the sake of peace and
security. This will be the complete triumph of Zionism, its
pinnacle and realization.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Barak has scrupulously avoided public discussion of the issues
that will be on the table in this week's talks. Instead, already
strategizing for a national referendum on peace _ in which he is
expected to enlist U.S. consultants as he did during his election
campaign _ he aims to focus Israelis on the grand picture.
</P>
<P>
   But the details are what will sit between Barak and al-Sharaa
when they meet behind very closed doors at the Shepherdstown
Clarion Hotel, some 68 miles from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials were describing ``Sing-Sing'' or ``siege
conditions'' for the negotiators, who will be prevented from
entering or exiting at will to create an air-tight _ and leak-proof
_ diplomatic environment.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, although depriving Israelis of their cellular
telephones is tantamount to cutting off a critical life support
mechanism, the rules of the game will require them to turn off
their phones.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if Barak will stay put or come and go. Several
world political leaders, including Russia's recently resigned
president, Boris Yeltsin, are expected to pass through Israel when
they travel later this week to Bethlehem for an Orthodox Christmas
celebration organized by the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will be accompanied by a delegation of about 25
negotiators, including Foreign Minister David Levy and Tourism
Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who held negotiations with the Syrian
army leader when he was Israel's army chief of staff in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As in December, al-Sharaa will represent Syrian President Hafez
Assad, 69, who is considered too weak to travel and reluctant to do
so at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After a welcoming speech by President Clinton, the Israelis and
the Syrians are expected to break into working groups. Barak's
office said that security and water will be discussed before the
thorny issue of borders, but the Syrians have maintained that the
issue of borders is paramount and must come first.
</P>
<P>
   Syria demands the full return of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured during the 1967 War, down to the June 4, 1967, border.
They see this border as reaching the shoreline of the Sea of
Galilee. While Israel appears ready to concede territory, it is
unwilling to withdraw beyond the international border established
in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   The distance is a few square miles, what Barak has called ``a
stone's throw,'' but it is a crucially located few miles, and the
dispute has stymied the negotiations for years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To avoid getting bogged down and to better assess Syria's
flexibility on another issue, Barak prefers to start with a
discussion of security issues. The Israelis would demand an
internationally run monitoring station on Mount Hermon, between the
new Israeli and Syrian borders. Israelis have long insisted that
there should be an Israeli force in that station, which the Syrians
reject entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians reportedly prefer a satellite and aerial inspection
system, according to accounts in several Arab newspapers. They hope
to convince Barak, a former general, that warning stations on the
ground would provide inferior intelligence to aerial systems.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Syria will also negotiate the deployment of Syrian
troops and their proximity to the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next week or 10 days, we will learn a lot about their
readiness to accept our security demands,'' said Cabinet Minister
Haim Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign to win public support for the talks, Barak has
received a direct assist from President Ezer Weizman, who is
expected to remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, Weizman has
called this a critical juncture in which ``peace has to come before
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   If a peace agreement with Syria were reached, and a peace
referendum failed an Israeli national vote, he would ``go home,''
Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
   When right-wing groups protested that he should be the president
of everyone and not take sides, Weizman shrugged and said it was
``too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesting Barak's ``campaign of propaganda,'' Uzi Landau, a
Likud Party legislator, called on the opposition to reveal ``the
throwing of sand in the eyes.'' Some, indeed, have criticized the
way that former generals, colleagues of Barak, are now re-assessing
the strategic value of the Golan Heights that was long considered
an invaluable geographic defense against Syrian aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it all a fraud? Was it 30 years of brainswashing?''
Emmanuel Halperin, who anchors a television news show, asked a
former general, Ori Orr, recently. ``Were the opinions of all those
American generals who said the Golan was indispensable to Israel's
survival completely invalid?''
</P>
<P>
   And even some ardent members of the peace camp have questioned
the eagerness of many Israelis to accept a new reality overnight.
Eitan Haber, a former senior aide to Rabin, responded to Barak's
constant praise of Assad and to a glowing account in an Israeli
newspaper from a reporter who sneaked into Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it turns out that the Syrian dictator, Hafez Assad,
is a brave, visionary, intelligent leader, a pursuer of peace, a
great man and a real sweetheart,'' Haber wrote in a newspaper
column. ``And the Syrian people? Darlings. Damascus is wonderful.
Generations of Syrians have been praying for nothing but peace.
Every morning they wake up to the sound of ``Hatikva,'' the Israeli
anthem, ``and kiss the picture of Theodore Herzl.''

FEDERAL JUDGE TO RULE SOON ON EXPULSION OF 6 STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. _ A federal judge has announced that he will rule
in early January on whether the expulsions of six students involved
in a melee at a high school football game here will be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In hearings last week before Judge Michael McCuskey of U.S.
District Court in Urbana, Ill., lawyers for the students, all of
them black, contended that the school district acted improperly by
expelling them as a group and not judging the cases one by one.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the civil
rights organization headed by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who led a
series of demonstrations in November to protest the board's action.
The case has sparked a debate over the fairness of so-called
zero-tolerance behavior policies, which have become common in
schools around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony at the hearing, it was disclosed that black
students accounted for more than 80 percent of the expulsions in
Decatur in the last four years, even though they made up less than
half of the enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   School officials testified that they followed the usual
procedures in meting out two-year expulsions for the disturbance on
Sept. 27. They said race played no role in their consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Boehm, the principal of MacArthur High School, witnessed the
brawl that swept through the grandstand and told the judge that the
parents and students at the game, between MacArthur and Eisenhower,
had been terrified by the violence. Three of the students in the
case also face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 27 years, I have never experienced anything like this,''
Boehm said. ``I think you had to be there to appreciate the
turmoil, the stress and the fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The board cut the penalties to one-year expulsions and offered
to let the students attend an alternative school immediately after
Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, came here to try to broker a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson rejected the offer, saying the district should allow
the students to return to school in January. He urged the school
board to order the students to undergo counseling, noting that no
weapons were involved in the brawl and that no one was seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson initially said race did not play a major role in
the case, he said last week that it was ``very apparent'' the
students were given harsher penalties because they were black. But
he added that strict discipline codes were also being unwisely used
to punish white students around the country. ``Students, whether
black or white, are in some cases being treated as expendable and
thrown away,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, the school board said it would allow the two seniors
to graduate in June with classmates if they earn enough credits at
the alternative school. The board also offered to let the other
students return to school as early as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the hearing, McCuskey bristled when lawyers for the school
district tried to call witnesses to discuss the academic records of
the expelled students. The judge noted that school board officials
had earlier testified that they had not examined the students'
academic records before deciding to expel them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in what they looked at, not in what they could
have looked at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also blocked testimony from school officials about gang
activity in Decatur, an industrial city of about 80,000 people in
central Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Delphine Kendrix, a mother of one of the expelled students,
testified that a school official had discouraged her from appealing
the expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials strongly denied that they had told any
parents not to fight the expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Perkins, one of two blacks on the seven-member Decatur
school board, said the board's discussion of the expulsions had
become heated.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, who cast the lone vote against expulsion, testified
that one board member had characterized the students involved in
the fight as ``running about like a pack of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If it was seven white students, we wouldn't be having
this discussion,''' Perkins testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the students said the only previous two-year
expulsion in Decatur involved a student who brought a loaded gun to
school.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Dan Rostenkowski bounds out of his office and barks:
``Grab your coat, let me show you the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the house, he says, his house, the one his Polish
grandfather built from the ground up. There, across the street, is
the famous church, St. Stanislaus Kostka, the one he moved a
highway to save. His eyes are gleaming, twinkling, as he lurches
from tale to tale. He looks trim, stylish even, in his soft gray
turtleneck. He's swapped steak and potatoes for fish and linguine.
And make that one martini, not four. ``I sleep better at night,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Back inside his office, there's a photograph on the credenza of
the one-time, all-powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee snuggling with his brand-new grandchild, a big smile
across his face.
</P>
<P>
   Cuddly, debonair, sparkly eyed _ Dan Rostenkowski, the man who
made colleagues quake and lobbyists cower? Has Rosty, the
quintessential deal-maker, turned into a bit of a softy? ``I'm
riding the crest of the wave,'' Rostenkowski admits.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two years since he finished his ``sabbatical'' at
the Oxford, Wis., prison compound and the halfway house that came
next. He paid his 17-month penance for using taxpayer money to buy
chairs and crystal domes for his friends and to hire people to mow
his lawn. Suddenly, he's popping up all over Washington, a place he
feared might throw a permanent sneer his way.
</P>
<P>
   Catch him at Morton's for dinner. In his office in Arlington,
Va., for business. On ``Hardball'' on MSNBC for some political
analysis. On Fox News to gab about the Gore-Bradley debate. (He
actually debuted on Fox in Chicago soon after his release.) This
week, it is the American Enterprise Institute panel to talk about
Bill Bradley and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   His probation is up, too. ``I'm a free man,'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that for the first two years out of Oxford, I was kind
of looking at my shoes and my belly button,'' said Rostenkowski,
72, during a chat in his office, which is attached to his house on
the northwest side of the city. ``I kept my eyes down. I was
embarrassed. I was ashamed. I didn't know how people would accept
me. I didn't think then that I would be a commentator on
television, that I would be a senior fellow at a university, that
I'd be lecturing to corporate boards and be paid for consulting. I
didn't think those things would be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychic turning point came just two months ago, when he set
foot for the first time on Capitol Hill, the scene of his 35-year
rise and fall. He was there to attend a book party for Richard E.
Cohen, the author of ``Rostenkowski: The Pursuit of Power and the
End of the Old Politics,'' an account that summed him up as a
powerhouse who got important things done. But the event felt more
like a coming home party for the man who ruled and protected his
committee with an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   All his old pals were there _ Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,
now the ranking Democrat on the committee; Commerce Secretary Bill
Daley of Chicago; former Rep. Tom Downey, who served on the
committee at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Rangel held a Ways and Means reunion for
the Democrats at a Georgetown restaurant. ``He called everybody up
and said the chairman's going to be there, the chairman's going to
be there. And people felt an obligation to go out. As a matter of
fact, although everybody says this after the second cocktail, there
was a possibility of us forming an alumni association of the Ways
and Means Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite his recent rebound, there is one place he hasn't had
the heart to visit: the Ways and Means Committee room, now occupied
by Rep. Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who Rosty froze out of
committee negotiations. ``Can you imagine how my heart would have
broken if I was defeated but I was still in charge? The salve in my
defeat is I can't picture myself sitting to the right of Bill
Archer and listening to him vacillate.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot that depresses him about Washington politics
nowadays, he says. ``It's amazing to me how McCain can talk about
Washington as if he's from Arizona,'' said the former chairman, the
ultimate insider, about Sen. John McCain, the candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination. Dumping on Washington,
Rostenkowski said, is ``a cop out.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's no teamwork anymore, he said. With such a narrow
majority in the House, nobody wants to make the rough decision,
take the tough vote. ``I feel sorry for the country because we're
standing in place,'' he said. The Republicans still haven't figured
out how to govern, he said. ``It's one thing to make the snowballs
and throw them. It's another thing when the ice melts and you've
got to start constructing something that's going to lead the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that explains his own re-emergence: ``People remember that
there was a certainty and stability in Rostenkowski that there
isn't today.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He still raves about former President Bush, who deserves more
credit for today's robust economy, he says, and he thinks highly of
former Speaker Newt Gingrich even though he is easy to poke fun at:
For example, there was the trip to the Persian Gulf during Desert
Storm, when Gingrich sat ``talking about Gen. Foch and Petain. What
the hell. We're going over there for photo ops with all the kids,
where you can fry an egg on the damn helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I admire Gingrich in that he had a goal and he beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gingrich's recent marital troubles, he smirked, and said,
``Thank God, all my girls are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman has always had a soft spot for President Clinton.
``He was kind of like a kid brother to me,'' he said. ``Geez, he
was bright, and a convincing brightness, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned Clinton about ``biting off more than he could chew on
health care. You're not in Hot Springs, Ark., anymore. You're in
the major leagues.'' Today, he regrets not being more insistent.
``He was a novice,'' Rostenkowski said, looking back.
</P>
<P>
   And if you ask him what was the most physically tiring moment of
his life, he wouldn't say the indictment and going to prison. ``It
was the '86 tax act,'' he said, referring to the landmark bill he
helped fashion and land on President Reagan's desk. ``I was that
close to a nervous breakdown,'' he said, making the universal
gesture for teeny with his thumb and index finger.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He takes a decidedly rosy view of his conviction, except for the
toll it exacted on his family and staff (``I paid all their legal
bills,'' he said). His Capitol Hill secretary still works for him,
and his former press secretary said they all refer to themselves as
``staff for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rostenkowski continues to insist that he did nothing wrong. The
old rules for getting things done changed and changed again, and he
didn't take notice. ``I mean, giving gifts away,'' he said. ``I
don't want to read in your article that we were all doing it,
because I don't know that we were all doing it. But I would be
surprised if we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was more extravagant than anybody else,'' he added.
``But then again I was a bigger man than everybody else.''

<P>
   When Paul Maszczak was tapped more than three years ago to head
his company's year 2000 computer repairs, he recalled, ``I
considered it the kiss of death.'' Instead of developing new
software using the latest technology, he would be relegated to
fixing programs written years or decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Maszczak now says that becoming year 2000 manager at C.R.
Bard Inc., a medical-device manufacturer in Murray Hill, N.J., was
one of the best moves in his 30-year career in data processing. The
job lifted him out of the narrow confines of the information
technology department, exposing him to all aspects of his company's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with those efforts winding down, Maszczak thinks his
broader business knowledge has prepared him for a bigger management
job. As for day-to-day systems work, ``I could never go back,'' he
said. Now, he said, ``we're free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 has finally arrived, and the vast Y2K repair corps
is being scattered to the winds, having apparently saved the world
from the widespread disasters once feared.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is great relief that few year 2000 problems
emerged over the weekend, some Y2K workers, having completed a task
that has consumed them for months or years, must now struggle with
what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Like Maszczak, some workers expect to go on to bigger and better
things. Most others are simply going back to previous jobs, as
corporate information-processing departments return to work they
had put aside in their race to repair year 2000 flaws. Yet for many
others, the end of the readiness efforts means the end of their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For Randall Bart, for instance, year 2000 work proved to be a
short-lived bonanza. After being laid off from Unisys, the computer
maker, in 1988, Bart did not find work as a programmer until 10
years later, when Y2K made what he calls his ``obsolete
experience'' worth $45 an hour. But his last job ended in August
and Bart, 43, who lives in Los Angeles, has been unable to find
work since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping for some big disaster somewhere to hit,'' he said,
only half joking.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, year 2000 work is not ending abruptly. It has been
ratcheting down for months, and thousands of people have already
been dismissed, but work will continue, because computer problems
might still arise over the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubin, a consultant and head of the computer science
department at Hunter College in New York, who surveyed big
corporations about their preparedness activities, estimates that as
many as a fourth of the 2 million information technology workers in
big companies in the United States did Y2K repairs at one time or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, computer people are not the only ones who got
involved. Many others were swept up in the effort _ contacting
suppliers and customers to assess their readiness, surveying
factory machinery, planning for contingencies and so on. All told,
many millions of people throughout the world were involved in year
2000 preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Many people profited handsomely, taking their share of the more
than $250 billion the world is estimated to have spent to enable
computers and other electronic machinery to recognize that a year
can begin with 20 instead of 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It absolutely made our company,'' said Peter A. Allen,
president of Data Dimensions Inc., a computer consulting concern
that grew from about $1 million in annual revenues in the early
1990s to $115 million in 1998, 80 percent of it from year 2000
work.
</P>
<P>
   But that work has already slowed significantly, and the
Bellevue, Wash., company has laid off about 300 of its 850 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the customer contacts and skills the company has
developed doing year 2000 work will help it move into other areas,
like electronic commerce. But investors are not so sure. Data
Dimension's stock price has fallen from a peak of almost $40 in
late 1997 to under $3 today.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago there were predictions that the world would
not have enough programmers to scan billions of lines of code and
fix any date problems. Some programmers were lured out of
retirement to fix programs they had written decades earlier, and
there was even talk of enlisting prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, salaries for programmers and systems analysts did jump,
and many companies offered retention bonuses to keep programmers
from jumping ship until well into 2000. Union Bank of California,
for instance, gave year 2000 workers bonuses equal to 10 percent of
their salaries in 1998 and 1999. Those who stay until March will be
eligible for an additional bonus equal to 20 percent of their
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But the great shortage never materialized. Many companies that
were started to do year 2000 work for others got far less business
than they had anticipated. While early predictions were that
repairs would cost $1 or $2 for each line of code, prices dropped
to 25 cents a line or even lower. And many retirees did not find
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the repairs turned out to be less complex
than had been imagined, in part because software was developed to
help automate the process. Indeed, the year 2000 was quickly
transformed from a problem involving older computer programs to a
generalized business, political and legal issue, as companies
wrestled with contingency planning, supplier and customer
relationships and questions of legal liability and public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The code really has been the smallest issue in all of this,''
said Lou Marcoccio, research director at Gartner Group, another
consulting company. In many companies, he said, the nonprogrammers
working on the problem outnumbered the programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, companies were able to handle it, even if they
occasionally had to strain to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the consultant, said that on average, big companies spent
about 10 percent of their information technology budgets over three
years of year 2000 repairs, although for peak periods the issue
consumed as much as half the computer budgets of some companies.
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., for instance, spent $520 million over several
years on its year 2000 effort, but the brokerage spends $3.2
billion a year on information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies did the job in-house, even if it meant pushing
other work aside. It was cheaper that way and the company's own
programmers were most familiar with the software that had to be
fixed. Edison International, which owns Southern California Edison,
did its year 2000 work for $70 million after rejecting a
contractor's offer to do it for $171 million, said Eric Trapp, who
managed the job for the utility.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies contracted work to firms in India, where wages
are lower. But some industry officials say there was also less of
that than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   For repair companies and individual programmers wondering what
to do next, the good news is that there is an overall shortage of
computer people, especially as software development that was
postponed to deal with year 2000 work moves back up companies'
priority lists.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that the greatest demand is for people who can
design Internet software, especially for electronic retailing; the
expertise of most year 2000 companies and workers lies in older
computers and programs, known as legacy systems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``These people built up the Latin of technology,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still if the episode taught the world anything, it is that these
legacy systems are vital and are not going away any time soon.
There is still a lot of work to be done on them, including enabling
them to connect to Internet software. And many companies have put
off these other jobs while they focused on the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been building up a really nice backlog of things to
do,'' said Lee Kirkpatrick, senior vice president and year 2000
manager for Union Bank, who said the priority would shift to
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch rushed to finish most year 2000 work by June 30 so
it could devote more resources to designing its online
stock-trading system, said John McKinley, the brokerage's chief
technology officer. Now, he said, former year 2000 programmers are
being put on jobs like getting the company ready for 24-hour stock
exchanges and decimalization of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   With Y2K, computer professionals, often stereotyped as geeks and
loners, found themselves the life of the party, sought out by
laymen friends for counsel on whether the world was really going to
end on Jan. 1. More people within corporations and in society came
to appreciate the importance of their work.
</P>
<P>
   But the limelight was not always comfortable. After all, it was
programmers who created the year 2000 problem by representing years
using two digits instead of four, a tactic that seemed rational in
the early days of computing as a way to conserve scarce computer
memory and data storage. If Jan. 1 had brought a rash of mishaps,
the computer profession would have faced even more criticism for
shoddy work, and perhaps pressure for government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, now that the date rollover appears to be going
smoothly, some critics are saying that the threat was exaggerated
by computer professionals out to make a buck.
</P>
<P>
   While there were clearly some charlatans, many programmers still
recovering from an exhausting, nerve-racking race against an
immutable deadline are now feeling like victims of their own
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already hearing that from my own family _ that it's all
been overblown,'' said Celia Murray, a systems analyst with the
Office of Real Property Services, a New York state agency. ``I
think it could have been really bad, no question about it. A lot of
people worked really hard. That's the reason people can sit here
and say it's all overblown.''

COMPETITIVE RACES DWINDLE AS MORE CANDIDATES OPT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas, Maine, Colo., Neb., Ky., Nev.)  (nk) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER HAVEN, Fla. _ Rick and Julie Dantzler thought they had
made their decision back in April: Despite the pleas of party
leaders, despite the lure of an open seat, Rick would not run for
Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   They were still burned out and bruised from his unsuccessful
campaigns for both the Democratic nomination for governor and
lieutenant governor in Florida in 1998. Their daughters, Liz, 13,
and Margaret, 10, were thriving, and as Julie put it: ``We get one
shot at 10 and 13. We only get one shot at that.''
</P>
<P>
   But as 1999 wound to a close, and there was no Democratic
candidate in the race, the Dantzlers found themselves wrestling
with the decision one more time, while Democrats in Florida and
Washington watched in suspense. One question kept coming up. ``Can
you make enough of a difference there to really justify what you're
going to be missing here?'' Dantzler asked, surrounded by his
family on a quiet December afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In a year like 2000, when the two parties are locked in an
furious battle for control of the House, the civics books would
suggest that candidates like Dantzler would be lining up to join
the fray. In fact, while both parties hail their success in getting
experienced, high-quality candidates to run, many potential
candidates will agonize over the decision and quite a few will
ultimately say no.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of these candidates is part of the explanation
for a striking reality in American politics this year. For all the
talk about the battle for the House, perhaps as few as a tenth of
the congressional districts will have truly competitive races, with
a fair contest of ideas and agendas. And the more that strong
candidates bow out, the fewer real battles there will be.
</P>
<P>
   In most districts, held by well-financed incumbents, there will
probably not be much of a battle at all, many political
professionals say. ``I think the dirty little secret is out, that
94 percent of all incumbents win,'' said Charles Cook, a longtime
analyst of congressional campaigns who publishes a political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a paradox for what was intended by the framers as ``the
people's house,'' so responsive and closely attuned to the voters
that it needed the Senate to keep it in check.
</P>
<P>
   And this lack of competition has consequences for how Congress
operates, some scholars and analysts say _ like the creation of an
ever more polarized House, with incumbents increasingly insulated
from challenges from the other party that would push them to the
center. It may also help explain such political puzzles as the
impeachment of a president in defiance of the public opinion polls,
some say.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell exactly how many districts will have
hotly contested races this year, but some analysts predict no more
than 35 to 45. In 1998, 94 districts were completely uncontested by
a major political party, the highest number since 1958. And many
more are contested in name only; in a third of the contested races
in 1996, for example, one candidate outspent the other by more than
9-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   The deterrents to running for Congress these days are huge _ the
extraordinary demands of fund-raising, the all-consuming nature of
modern campaigns, the cost in time and stability to young families
and dual career marriages, the slender prospects of defeating an
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   And many campaign strategists say that at the end of the decade,
there are special reasons for an ambitious politician to sit it
out: Even if that candidate wins, he or she faces the possibility
of having to begin all over again in a reconfigured district, with
a lot of different voters, after the congressional districts are
redrawn following the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in an election like 2000, at the very end of a
redistricting cycle, congressional elections tend to become far
more stable; the obvious mismatches and political opportunities _ a
liberal congressman representing a conservative district, or vice
versa _ have been corrected by the voters by now.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the current political climate, a time of relative
peace and prosperity, with much less anger toward Washington than
was bubbling before the great upheaval of 1994, when the
Republicans took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give me a recession, a gridlocked Congress and a war, and
I'll show you candidates coming out the woodwork to run,'' said
Stuart Rothenberg, another congressional analyst who publishes a
political newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say it is to the parties' advantage to contain
their field of battle and thus focus their resources on a small
number of targets; a net shift of just five seats would change
control of the House, meaning that neither party needs to move a
lot of seats.
</P>
<P>
   But political scientists say it is hardly healthy for much of
the country to be excluded from the battle for the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a terrible aspect of our politics, if voters are
not even offered an opportunity to vote for the party of their
choice,'' said James E. Campbell, professor of political science at
the State University of New York at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Mann, an expert on Congress at the Brookings
Institution, sees it as an odd tradeoff: After four decades in
which the Democrats seemed a permanent majority in the House, the
two parties are now nearly evenly matched; the Republican majority
of 222 was among the smallest of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   So there is intense competition between the two parties, he
says; it is simply being brought to bear on a small percentage of
the seats, like Cold War superpowers vying for a tiny piece of
strategic terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional politics has a way of bucking longterm predictions
and transforming itself very quickly, and nobody knows how enduring
this pattern will be. What is clear is that running a serious race
for Congress these days is a series of high hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   And Sandy Maisel, a professor of government at Colby College in
Maine, said, ``I think the cumulative effect of those deterrents is
that high-quality candidates for one reason or another opt out.''

<P>
   Money: The Chilling Effect Of Raising Funds
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, in a study financed by the National Science Foundation,
Maisel and Walter J. Stone of the University of Colorado began to
survey potential candidates in 200 congressional districts, trying
to determine who runs for office, who does not, and why. Among all
the deterrents, from a loss of privacy to a fear of negative
advertising, one factor was cited twice as often as any other:
having to raise the vast amounts of money necessary to run.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true for potential candidates considering a
run against incumbents, who nearly always have an easier time
raising money. Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign
finance, said that the average incumbent had $315,000 in the bank
at the end of June, 18 months before the next election. ``You've
got to be nuts to jump in as a challenger in a situation like
that,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The money factor also has a chilling effect on potential
candidates for open seats, which ordinarily invite competition.
Even those who decide to take the plunge swallow hard over the
money and what it portends.
</P>
<P>
   Florida state Rep. Adam Putnam, 25, a Republican whiz kid who is
already in his second term, has estimated that it will take
$750,000 to $850,000 to wage his campaign for Congress this year in
the 12th District, a seat now held by Rep. Charles T. Canady, a
Republican who is retiring. And then there's the money that will
pour into the district from outside groups, said Putnam, considered
the leading Republican in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really just gives you heartburn to think about,'' he said
at a restaurant in Bartow not long ago. ``Not as much the financial
implications as what that message is going to be that these
out-of-towners are going to be saying about you or on your behalf,
which you have no control over. That's spooky to me.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Lori Edwards, a 42-year-old Democrat who has won four
terms in this region, also saw a campaign for Florida's 12th as a
``natural progression'' _ at least initially.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th District is a slice of ``Old Florida'' in the central
part of the state, east of Tampa, dotted by lakes and citrus groves
and still largely oriented toward agriculture. When she first
looked at the race, the money needed to run there seemed ``real
doable'' to Ms. Edwards, who describes herself as solidly middle
class: Canady had never had to spend more than $350,000 on a
campaign. But the popular incumbent had managed to avoid a huge
television campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Edwards began to prepare for the race, she learned this
was no longer possible. ``All of a sudden the price tag for this
race was going up to $1 million,'' Ms. Edwards said, an assessment
not that far off Putnam's.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that was the prospect of immediate redistricting, at
the hands of a state Legislature led by Republicans. ``So even if I
was elected, not only would I have to turn around and raise $1
million again, but the Republican-controlled state Legislature is
not going to be too happy about losing this seat,'' Ms. Edwards
said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, five months after she entered the race, Ms. Edwards
withdrew, with money a major factor. ``It wasn't even that I didn't
think it could be done,'' she said. ``It was because I didn't want
to do it. My deepest worry was that after you do all that begging,
and after all those people give you all that money, how can you
keep your independence? My experience in the state Legislature
showed it can be done, but I never had to beg for a million
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, who for several years was chairman
of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said of the
money demands: ``I'd prefer that it be different, but you play the
hand you're dealt. But it does discourage some people from
running.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Family: Weighing the Cost Of Time and Travel
</P>
<P>
   It was not the money that deterred Joe Hogsett, who considered
running for an open seat in Indiana this year. It was the sheer
amount of time and energy that it takes to run in a competitive
district these days, balanced against the demands of family.
</P>
<P>
   Hogsett, a 43-year-old Democrat, was no political novice, after
six years as Indiana's secretary of state, an unsuccessful Senate
race in 1992 and an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 1994. He said
he knew what it would take, and he knew it was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very young family,'' he said. ``My spouse and I have
a young son and we hope to add to our family in the future. So
ultimately the decision this year weighed what I knew on the one
hand were the enormous responsibilities of running for Congress _
the time, the energy, the resources _ with maintaining my
obligations as a spouse, as a father, with work, practicing law
here in Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political professionals say that running a competitive
campaign essentially means giving up your job for a year. Then
there's the privacy factor, at a time when personal lives are just
one more line of inquiry in a political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who for several years was chairman
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said people would
tell him: ``I don't want the scrutiny. I don't want the divorce I
had 20 years ago to be examined. I don't want my kids to go through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if candidates make it through these pitfalls, they face the
complicated task of working in Washington, keeping a strong
presence in the district on the weekends, and somehow fitting a
family life in between. Rep. Anne M. Northup, R-Ky., who heads her
party's effort to recruit candidates for the House, said
``everybody asks the same questions'' and the logistics of family
life are at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're looking at candidates who have a lot to offer, one
of the reasons they have a lot to offer is because they've carried
big responsibilities,'' Ms. Northup said. ``They have a whole
demanding life _ jobs, responsibilities _ and there are going to be
a lot of people who have to make adjustments if they run.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark James, a Republican state senator in Nevada, was another
top-tier candidate who was urged to run this year _ against a
Democratic freshman who won with less than 50 percent of the vote
in 1998 _ but decided he could not because of his family. James,
40, has a 10-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter; he could not
see how he could maintain a bicoastal household and get enough time
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that I don't want to serve, or don't want to make
sacrifices,'' he said, adding that he would not rule out a race in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dantzlers were torn over whether the difference Dantzler
could make in Washington would be worth the cost in family life.
They were a seasoned political family, having lived through a
statewide campaign and several high-profile races for the state
House and Senate, where Dantzler had served for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But they have a rooted life in Florida, they said. Mrs. Dantzler
works as a mental health counselor, the daughters are involved in
soccer and theater, their families go back several generations in
the state. If he ran and won, the Dantzlers think the family would
stay in Florida, at least in the beginning, which would mean a
bifurcated life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that my kids will be fine,'' Rick Dantzler said as he
envisioned that life. ``And I'm sure that Julie and I will stay
together. But I'm not sure that I want to miss it. The idea of
getting on a plane on Monday and coming back on Friday and asking
Julie how it was with the girls for the last three days ...''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``I'm only 43, I enjoy public
service and I like to think there's another race in me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Julie said they planned to make their decision after the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Consequences: An Electoral Process With Fewer Battles
</P>
<P>
   The sum total of all these personal decisions is less
competitive politics, some analysts say. They disagree on how much
of that is due to short-term causes _ the peace-and-prosperity
political climate, the stable congressional politics that is often
a hallmark of the end of a decade _ and how much is due to
deterrents less likely to change, like huge fund-raising
requirements and virtually nonstop campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But some scholars say that whatever the causes, the lack of
competition has consequences, particularly when incumbents grow
accustomed to it. As Maisel and Stone wrote in their study,
``Representative democracy depends fundamentally on a competitive
electoral process.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some potential candidates are looking
elsewhere. Ms. Edwards has decided to run for supervisor of
elections in Polk County, Fla. She says it is a good and
interesting job where she believes she can make a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   And, she added, ``The cost of the race is a manageable one, and
the outcome of the race will depend much more on my grass-roots
effort, talking to people, shaking hands.''
</P>
<P>
   She was clearly looking forward to the coming campaign.

CLINTON SEEKING TO MAKE FOREIGN POLICY HIS FOCUS IN NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For much of his presidency, Bill Clinton's own
aides have frequently complained that his attention to foreign
policy was sporadic. The trait got him in trouble in Bosnia, and
often resulted in some nasty surprises _from the defeat of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty last fall to a tear-gas-filled week
in Seattle that badly damaged his global economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his biggest victories in 1999 were also scored
abroad, from the air campaign over Serbia that largely halted
ethnic bloodshed to the agreement in Northern Ireland that offers
the first prospect of peace there.
</P>
<P>
   And now Clinton's aides describe a president who has determined
_ for reasons as practical as political reality and as personal as
the emptiness of his residence _ to make foreign policy the focus
of his last 12 months in office.
</P>
<P>
   It is the one arena where he believes he can stand out and
continue to wield power as two major political campaigns _ one
starring his wife, the other his vice president _ take more and
more of the spotlight, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   And it is an escape from a White House that one of his close
advisers calls ``a very lonely place these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's schedule calls for a constant stream of foreign trips,
each casting him in a different role: peacemaker, international
financial architect and missionary seeking converts to
American-style democratic capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   He starts this week by shuttling in and out of Shepherdstown,
W.Va., by helicopter to coax along Israel and Syria in what, if
successful, could prove to be a peace accord as important as Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   But that will be only the opening move in a blur of diplomatic
motion _ driven by the president's desire to avoid looking like a
lame duck, and fueled by his determination to make up for time lost
during the impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never uses the word `legacy' but he talks about it all the
time,'' one of his longtime friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Clinton is driven to look abroad in part because
there is little reason to stay in Washington. While there is still
a chance of a deal with Republicans on Medicare or other major
elements of Clinton's domestic agenda, the president himself has
told aides in recent meetings that the likelihood fades as the
summer draws near.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton is making one of the most
public early departures from the White House by a first lady in
presidential history in anticipation of a possible run for the
Senate. She is moving the family's scant collection of furnishings
to a new house in Chappaqua, N.Y., a place where few expect the
president to spend much time next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happier on the road,'' said one Cabinet member who has
accompanied the president on several recent trips, ticking off the
possible stops in 2000: India, Nigeria, Okinawa, several
destinations in Europe, a possible trip to Russia after the June
election of a new president there, and perhaps even a visit to a
place about which he spent much of his youth debating: Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't campaign for Gore,'' the Cabinet member said during a
holiday party, referring to the vice president's effort to distance
himself from Clinton. ``Fund-raising is a chore. But he's come to
love the puzzle of the geopolitics.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was a love that took time to kindle. But since this
past August, when he interrupted his vacation with regular morning
calls to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and other Middle East
leaders, Clinton has acted like a man in a race against time to
bring about a final settlement with the Palestinians and, now, with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Monday in Shepherdstown, he will once again insert
himself into the negotiations. Dipping in and out of the talks at
strategic moments, aides say, Clinton is expected to play a
critical role, both coaxing along the two sides and offering
American financial and technological assistance, to both Israel and
Syria, as the two countries negotiate over mutual security
arrangements that would be part of the return of the Golan Heights
to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides say Clinton has blocked out most of the next
two weeks for the negotiations, and he is prepared for another
round in February if Shepherdstown proves inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   But any deal that calls for an increase in American aid to
Israel or the beginning of financial assistance to Syria _ probably
a total in the billions of dollars over the next few years _ would
require congressional approval. In an election year, that could
prove tricky, and Clinton's recent track record, as evidenced by
the defeat of the Test Ban Treaty, is hardly reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a vote on the Middle East aid package, if an accord is
reached, could come at roughly the same time as a vote on granting
China permanent trade status, part of the deal under which it is to
enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are completely different, and so are the
constituencies pressing for passage. But both will be difficult
votes, and some in the White House are quietly questioning if
Clinton has the clout to prevail in two major foreign policy votes,
both in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The China vote may become the most visible symbol of two other
aspects of Clinton's foreign policy legacy. It will determine
whether he has any claim to have changed the nature of America's
influence on the world's most populous nation. And it will be a
major test of whether his signature effort to redefine America's
role in the world _ through a strategy of economic integration and
globalization _ can recover from the damage done in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that if China is inside the World Trade
Organization, which sets global trading rules, the world will have
a far better chance of influencing its behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the same groups that took to the streets of Seattle, arguing
that the WTO places the priorities of trade above those of workers'
rights and human rights, have vowed to block permanent trade status
for China. Clinton's biggest argument will be with his own party,
not with Republicans, especially as Democratic candidates in
November try to maintain the party's traditional constituencies
that support these two causes.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican leadership, relishing the opportunity to
embarrass Gore, has already hinted that it will seek to delay the
vote several months so that a fractious split among the Democrats
will occur in the midst of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president's advisers vow to press on. ``I don't think there
was lasting damage from Seattle,'' Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S.
trade representative and chief architect of both the successful
China negotiations and the Seattle fiasco, said in an interview
before Washington emptied out for the holidays. ``The reality is
that the WTO will continue to function and global trade will
continue to grow. So well go full bore at putting it back
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, himself a
former trade lawyer, expressed similar optimism that the setback is
temporary. In retrospect, he said, the divisions between developing
countries and wealthy countries, and between Europe, Japan and the
United States, make it ``hard for this to congeal _ in hindsight,
even without the people outside'' breaking windows and blocking
Seattle's streets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself made the problem far worse at Seattle. By
announcing that he ultimately wanted to make labor and
environmental standards a part of all trade agreements, he cemented
the opposition from developing nations, especially India, that are
convinced that the United States is trying to rig the system to its
advantage. That issue, along with peace with Pakistan, would
probably dominate Clinton's tentative trip to India, which he would
like to take in March.
</P>
<P>
   Those, of course, are the predictable problems Clinton will face
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's two biggest nuclear challenges _ defusing the
India-Pakistan confrontation and taming North Korea _ are both
situations that could veer into crisis at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   So could Russia, where the administration is seeing how Boris
Yeltsin's resignation and designation of an heir apparent plays out
while pulling back on its early enthusiasm for spending large sums
to convert Russia to capitalism. In the next three months, each
decision to extend or withhold aid will inevitably be seen in
Russia as an indicator of Washington's attitude about the acting
president, Vladimir Putin, whether it is really intended to be or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's plenty,'' one of Clinton's aides said this week, ``to
keep him going all year.''

U.S. OPPOSES APPEAL OF RULING ON INMATES WITH HIV
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Miss., S.C.)  (rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has urged the Supreme
Court not to hear an appeal in a discrimination case brought on
behalf of hundreds of HIV-positive prisoners in the Alabama prison
system, where all inmates with the virus that causes AIDS are
barred from educational and recreational programs and even from
religious services where they might mix with the general prison
population.
</P>
<P>
   If the court takes the administration's advise, it will leave
intact a sweeping ruling that bars these inmates from more than 70
programs available to other prisoners, including work-release
programs that can shorten their incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will decide this month whether to hear the appeal
in the closely watched, nearly 15-year-old case, which presents the
question of how to assess whether a disability is a ``significant
risk'' to others that cannot be eliminated by the ``reasonable
accommodation'' ordinarily required under federal laws that
prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled last year that the categorical
exclusion of the HIV-infected inmates from prison programs did not
violate the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, given the fatal nature of
AIDS and the prospect that prisoners could transmit the virus to
one another.
</P>
<P>
   The administration told the court that, although the appeals
court might have ruled too broadly, its approach was generally
correct and its decision should not be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in its 8-3 ruling last
April, said, ``When the adverse event is the contraction of a fatal
disease, the risk of transmission can be significant even if the
probability of transmission is low,'' adding, ``death itself makes
the risk significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, enacted after the
Alabama lawsuit was filed, incorporated the same ``significant
risk'' defense against a discrimination charge.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition made up of public health organizations and AIDS
specialists is supporting the appeal by the Alabama prisoners,
arguing that the circuit court relied on ``subjective fear and
stigma'' rather than the objective, scientific risk assessment that
the Supreme Court insisted on in a 1998 ruling that was its first
look at AIDS in the context of federal disability law.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, a suit by an HIV-positive woman against a dentist
who refused to treat her in his office, the court said the
assessment of ``significant risk'' should be made in light of the
views of public health authorities, based on ``objective,
scientific information.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief for the coalition, filed by the Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund, a gay advocacy group in New York, said the
appeals courts had ignored the 1998 ruling by relying on a
theoretical risk of transmission without regard to the particular
circumstances. That approach, the brief said, ``threatens to
justify virtually any discrimination against persons with HIV in
employment, health care, education, and every other aspect of
community life.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is one of three states, along with Mississippi and South
Carolina, that automatically segregates HIV-positive inmates. The
federal prison system, like those of most states, evaluates inmates
individually and decides, on the basis of their history and
psychological profile, whether to exclude them from particular
activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration filed its brief in response to a request from
the court for the federal government's views. The appeals court's
ruling ``may well be overbroad,'' Seth P. Waxman, the solicitor
general, told the justices, adding that ``the court should have
carefully examined the circumstances and effect'' of participation
of inmates in the programs.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said such an examination might have shown that there
was no danger in permitting HIV-positive inmates to participate in
such activities as religious services, data processing classes, and
testing for high school equivalency diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the brief said, there was no need for the court to
take the case because the appeals court's opinion, even if
questionable in the particulars, was generally correct in deferring
to Alabama prison officials the assessment of the risk presented by
``the violence that is an inescapable part of prison life.''
</P>
<P>
   The solicitor general said the case presented the question of
``whether behavior that is concededly high-risk is likely to occur
if HIV-positive and non-HIV-positive prisoners are integrated in a
number of prison programs.'' The brief continued: ``The answer to
that question turns not on medical judgments about the risk
inherent in certain behaviors, but on prison management judgments
about the ability of prison authorities to control prisoners in
various settings and programs.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending its policy, Alabama points to a much lower rate of
HIV transmission in its prison population than in states that do
not segregate infected inmates. The state told the court that over
eight years, out of 30,000 inmates who did not have HIV when they
entered prison, only two became HIV-positive while in prison.
</P>
<P>
   While the justices are often guided by the solicitor general's
appraisal of a case that concerns the application of federal law,
as this one does, they are free to disregard the advice, and do so
with some regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision on whether to take this case may depend on
whether the justices see implications beyond the prison context and
on the extent of their concern about whether their ruling in the
1998 dental patient case, Bragdon vs. Abbott, had provided
sufficient guidance to the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   The current case is called Davis vs. Hopper, No. 98-9663. For
many years, it was known as the Onishea case, but the lead
plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit, Lydia Onishea, is no longer
in custody, and another inmate, Arion Davis, was substituted.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates, represented by the National Prison Project of the
American Civil Liberties Union, have argued that decisions about
exclusion or inclusion should be based on individualized
assessments of the inmate and the program.
</P>
<P>
   HIV-positive prisoners are excluded even from a program in which
one inmate, under guard, is transported to a school for a
discussion about the dangers of using drugs. They also are barred
from work-release programs, meaning that they effectively serve
longer sentences than other inmates convicted of the same crimes.

JETS GO OUT AS WINNERS, AND NOW WAIT FOR PARCELLS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Jets went out in style
Sunday, all dressed up but with no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   Their season ended in bittersweet fashion with a 19-9 victory
over the Seattle Seahawks. The Jets' performance was good enough to
bring them to .500 after a 1-6 start, good enough for a fourth
straight victory behind quarterback Ray Lucas, good enough to be
the seventh victory in their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   It just wasn't good enough to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock struck 12 for me and it's time to go home,'' said
Lucas, the self-styled Cinderella quarterback who began NFL life as
a special teams player, but was buoyed by coach Bill Parcells'
belief he could play a more glamorous role.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously touched by the victory, Parcells said: ``We finally
got out of the hole that we dug for ourselves. I'm really proud of
those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But will all these recent positives be good enough to bring
Parcells back next year? Will all those Meadowlands fans chanting
``One more year!'' in the final minutes do it?
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he would soon announce whether he will return next
season, a decision that might be revealed as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to think this over real quick,'' he said. Referring
to the impending sale of the team, he added: ``We've got imminent
changes here in the organization. I have a responsibility to the
organization and I will adhere to that responsibility. I'll do the
best I can to get things squared away very quickly. Don't try to
interpret what might happen. I have a few things to think over. I
have to talk to some people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in view of the impending announcement of a new
owner for the team, which could come this month, he felt it was
imperative to announce his own plans quickly. There is also the
issue of his successor if he does step down. The assistant head
coach Bill Belichick is being sought as a head coach by other
clubs, although his contract calls for him to take over when
Parcells retires.
</P>
<P>
   One person on the team Parcells is close to said he believed the
coach would return for a fourth season. But one of his assistants
said, ``I don't think he knows yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What is known is this: The Jets wound up feeling very good about
themselves with still another victory over a playoff team. The
Seahawks (9-7) made the playoffs in defeat, thanks to the Kansas
City Chiefs' loss. The Jets' victory meant a playoff berth for the
Miami Dolphins, who lost twice to the Jets last month.
</P>
<P>
   As Lucas contemplated the playoffs starting without the Jets, he
said: ``We're one of the hottest teams in football right now. It's
a shame we're not in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite throwing two interceptions, Lucas played an efficient
game in which Curtis Martin was the key player. He rushed for a
gaudy 158 yards on 34 carries, set a Jets single-season rushing
record with 1,464 yards and scored the team's only touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   John Hall produced the other points with 4-for-4 field-goal
kicking, giving him a season-ending stretch of 11 field goals in
his final 12 boots.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had such a powerful opening half, when he produced 124
yards on only 19 carries, that the Seahawks could never generate
momentum after their opening drives.
</P>
<P>
   They took a quick lead on Todd Peterson's field goal. That was
immediately matched by one from Hall, and then Peterson countered
with another field goal. But on the following drive, Martin, behind
stupendous blocking, produced a 50-yard run and capped the drive
with a 1-yard scoring burst for a 10-6 lead. Hall went on to kick
three more field goals, and all Seattle could produce for the rest
of the game was a third Peterson field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kitna was picked off twice by the aggressive Jets defense,
including Marcus Coleman's team-leading sixth interception of the
season. In the second half the Jets' defense held Kitna to only
seven completions in 23 attempts. The Seahawks rushed for a mere 33
yards overall on 12 carries, with Ricky Watters having no run
longer than 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel good about themselves,'' Parcells said of his
players. ``I really think they played like champs the second half
of the season. Not that that makes any difference because 8-8 is
8-8.'' Still, he said that the mark would impress itself on their
memories, that ``this kind of evidence will carry over, that
there's a way to come back from a big hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a building block for the team's future,'' wide receiver
Keyshawn Johnson said. ``Not to be 7-9 is a positive.'' Johnson had
his least productive game of the season, catching only three passes
for 20 yards. Wayne Chrebet, who came on late in the season after
being injured, was the game leader with 88 yards on five catches.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas wound up with a 6-3 won-lost record, including 6-2 the
second half of the season, after Parcells picked him to be the
starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   This theatrical wind-up has infused him with a confidence he did
not exhibit in his early games as a starter. Emboldened by weekly
victories over winning teams _ the Jets finished the season with
the league's toughest schedule _ Lucas said: ``Now the thought in
my mind is that there's no situation that can hurt our team. We're
8-8 and I was the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   It was this big to Martin: ``If you'd been back in the locker
room, you would have thought we'd won the Super Bowl.''

REPUBLICANS WRANGLE OVER INTERNET TAXATION  
 MUSIC INDUSTRY FACES A DIGITAL RECKONING 
TRUE BELIEVERS PUSH SATELLITE TELEPHONES 
ONE STEP FORWARD, ONE BACK FOR INTERNET NAMES PANEL  
 `E-CONVERSION' PAYING EARLY DIVIDENDS AT ORACLE 
A MERGER SETS OFF AN INFORMATION RUSH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Much of the e-commerce industry wants a new tax loophole: an
exemption from taxes on goods and services sold over the Internet
and on fees paid for access to the Internet. At stake in this
debate is not just money, but political power.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses that sell only in cyberspace, a tax-free Internet
would be a bonanza, offsetting the costs of shipping goods. But
under existing rules, companies that sell both in stores and on the
Web _ so-called clicks-and-mortar enterprises _ must collect sales
taxes on their Internet sales, putting them at a significant
competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes are the single largest source of revenue for state
and local governments, raising $189 billion in 1998. For states
like Texas and Tennessee, which have no personal income tax, sales
taxes are critical to paying for police, fire, schools and other
government services. E-commerce grew fourfold this past holiday
season, compared with a year earlier, and as it expands the loss of
sales tax receipts could create serious budget problems for many
states.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a tax-free Internet has opened a debate that has
been confined so far to warring factions of conservative
Republicans. One faction includes Gov. James S. Gilmore III of
Virginia, chairman of the Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce, created by Congress to study Internet taxation. Gilmore
wants to make up for potential lost sales tax revenues by having
Washington redistribute some of its revenues to the states in the
form of grants.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, another
conservative Republican with a long history as a tax cutter, says
that such a move would simply increase power in Washington while
undermining the state-and-local principles that helped his party
gain control of Congress in the 1994 elections.

   Music Industry Faces A Digital Reckoning
</P>
<P>
   For the players in the digital music industry, this year may
feel like a marathon poker game. The growing consumer interest in
downloading and listening to music online is good news for the
various types of companies that already have seats at the table.
But all will face decisions on which hands to play and which to
fold.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like MP3.com and Garageband.com, are betting
that they can give music away for free, in the MP3 technical
format, and survive on Web-based advertising. Others, like Virgin
Jamcast and Yahoo Digital, intend to charge consumers who want to
download and store songs; but the success of that model will depend
on how consumer friendly and copyright secure each of a handful of
competing downloading technologies turns out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, record companies like Seagram's Universal Music Group
and EMI Records are gambling that their deliberate pace of putting
music online _ a tentative approach meant to protect their
intellectual property _ will not erode their influence over the
music business. They must also decide how much promotional material
to give away without raising expectations that music will be free.
</P>
<P>
   Offline, consumer electronics makers, including Sony Electronics
and Creative Labs, are betting on a new generation of digital
portable devices similar to the Diamond Multimedia Rio 500. But
questions persist: at what price and in what form will most
consumers find digital music players an attractive alternative to
the Sony Walkman or Discman? And will lingering copyright questions
and the high cost of flash-memory cards for storing portable music
inhibit the market's growth?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, traditional bricks-and-mortar music retailers,
including Wherehouse Records, are hoping they can compete
effectively against online music sellers by adding their own
Internet offerings.
</P>
<P>
   With a generation of college-age listeners flocking online _ and
their younger siblings certain to follow _ this game entails high
risks, but potentially high rewards. For the rest of us, the
competitive cacophony should make for lively listening.

   True Believers Push Satellite Telephones
</P>
<P>
   The satellite telephone business has two strikes against it, but
that has not stopped some entrepreneurs and investors from betting
that the next multibillion-dollar swing for the fences will indeed
produce a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Now at bat: Globalstar Telecommunications, which is controlled
by Loral Space and Communications. Globalstar is just starting to
introduce its service _ a $3.3 billion system of 48 satellites
designed to provide telephone calls nearly anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Iridium LLC, which has been offering a similar
service, failed to attract nearly as many customers as it needed
and was plunged into bankruptcy, forcing its main backer, Motorola
, to write off $2.3 billion. Two weeks later, ICO Global
Communications, another contender, which had not yet launched its
satellites, filed for bankruptcy protection after failing to raise
additional money from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such setbacks, Globalstar's stock surged to a 52-week
high last month. Many investors appear to be betting that Iridium
failed because of its own design and marketing mistakes rather than
a fundamental lack of demand for satellite telephones. Globalstar's
chance of success should be evident in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest personal bet on satellite telephones is being
made by Craig O. McCaw, the billionaire cellular telephone pioneer.
In November, McCaw agreed to raise $1.2 billion to bring ICO out of
bankruptcy. He is also reported to be looking at investing in or
buying Iridium. And if those are not enough billion-dollar bets to
sate his gambling appetite, he still has Teledesic, a proposed $10
billion system to provide Internet service using 288 satellites,
starting around 2004.

<P>
   One Step Forward, One Back For Internet Names Panel
</P>
<P>
   In a world of jealous nation-states and cutthroat geopolitics,
the odds of transforming the Internet into a self-governing
institution might seem long. But that is the bet the Clinton
administration placed in creating the Internet Corp. for Assigned
Names and Numbers, and 2000 will likely determine the future of
Internet self-governance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of 1999 was rocky for Icann, the nonprofit group picked by
the Commerce Department at the end of 1998 to assume administration
of the Internet's addressing system. It cleared a major hurdle in
November, when Network Solutions, the company that had been granted
a government-blessed monopoly in the lucrative business of
registering dot-com names, finally agreed to open the market to
competition and to recognize Icann's authority.
</P>
<P>
   But within days, it suffered a major setback when Congress
usurped Icann's first attempt at policy making _ the creation of
international rules for settling disputes involving
``cybersquatters.'' These are speculators who register domain names
using established trademarks, then attempt to force the trademark
owners to pay large sums for rights to the domain names.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporate trademark holders persuaded Congress to give them
stronger protections, and while the White House said the bill would
interfere with Icann's international authority, it was enacted as a
last-minute attachment to the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   So as 2000 unfolds, Icann and its interim president, Mike
Roberts, find themselves struggling to win recognition of Icann's
authority not just from governments around the world but from the
government that created it.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Icann must form a membership that gives more than
big business a voice in its policy making and find an efficient way
to finance itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking,'' Roberts said. &QL;

   `E-Conversion' Paying Early Dividends at Oracle
</P>
<P>
   In June, Lawrence J. Ellison, the chairman of Oracle Corp.,
announced that the company would reinvent itself as an e-business _
a company that uses the power of the Internet in every aspect of
its operations. He set a goal of reducing annual costs by $1
billion in 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many analysts brushed off the announcement as more
hyperbole from a chief executive known for the same. But as the
months passed, it became clear that Ellison was putting his money
where his mouth is _ and reaping some early returns on the
investment. In the quarter ended Nov. 30, Oracle exceeded Wall
Street's earnings estimates, in large part because of a 5.5 percent
gain in profit margin that the company attributed to cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we think we can continue as we convert to an
e-business,'' Jeff Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the savings are obvious. Oracle will convert 60
nation-specific corporate data systems scattered around the globe
to one system, to be housed at the company headquarters and
accessible via the World Wide Web. The company estimates $200
million a year in savings from that move alone. Executives say they
can trim the $500 million annual travel bill by 10 percent just by
using a Web-based application from eTravel, a company Oracle
acquired last year for $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger shifts will take longer and represent greater gambles _
but they could also pay even bigger returns. For example, Oracle
recently announced plans to sell its software over the Web at
standardized prices. That will, for the first time, make its
products accessible to small businesses, a market the company has
long overlooked. &QL;

   A Merger Sets Off An Information Rush
</P>
<P>
   The merger last year of Doubleclick and Abacus Direct was the
first official marriage of companies that gathered information
about people's activities online and offline. Doubleclick, which
serves advertisements on thousands of Internet sites and monitors
users' activities on those sites, could suddenly combine that
information with catalog purchases tracked by Abacus.
</P>
<P>
   Previously Doubleclick had ignored the personal identity of Web
surfers, but by using information about users' offline purchases,
it can charge higher ad rates. Since the merger was announced in
June, Internet advertising companies have forged ahead with efforts
to identify people on Web sites, find out more about their offline
lives, and show them ads that match that information.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates denounce the practice, saying that it gives
companies too much information about individuals. They point to the
laundry list of information that offline companies gather _
including data on hobbies, home values and stock portfolios, to
name a few _ and note that Internet companies will be sifting
through that data even as they watch users surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The ad networks insist that such practices benefit Internet
users by giving them more relevant advertisements. Besides, they
say, users can, with a few clicks of a mouse, choose not to have
personal information gathered about them. But privacy advocates
argue that users should not have to lift a finger to protect
themselves against what they regard as intrusive behavior, and 2000
could be the year that the administration and Congress push
legislation to address those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doubleclick had a good profiling model, which they used to
deliver targeted messages for advertisers and still protect the
user's privacy,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center. ``But once they crossed the
line with Abacus and said, `Here are where the big bucks are,' they
also took a big gamble, because that's where the big privacy battle
is. And when the clock ticks on industry self-regulation, they may
have a very big problem on their hands.''

 Y2K DOOMSAYER: A LITTLE SHEEPISH, BUT NO REGRETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAOS, N.M. _ In the beige adobe house nestled against the
snow-dusted Sangre de Cristo mountains, the lights are on, the
phones have dial tones, the computer is online, and Edward Yourdon
is reaching into a stack of cardboard boxes to hand a visitor a
free copy of ``Time Bomb 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Best wishes, Ed Yourdon 1/1/2000,'' he inscribes in the
flyleaf of a 630-page tome that sold 250,000 copies over the last
two years. But the back cover conjures up a darkly different New
Year's Day: ``Saturday, January 1, 2000: Suddenly, nothing works.
Not your phones, not the cash machine, not even your fancy new
VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   Yourdon, one of the nation's leading Y2K Cassandras, looks a bit
sheepish, and admits: ``I guess the book's sales prospects are
about zero now.''
</P>
<P>
   For over a decade, Yourdon, a computer programmer and consultant
with a gift for communicating, has warned the world of widespread
chaos when computer odometers rolled over to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, he staggered out of bed just before 5 a.m.,
expecting to watch a wave of televised failures roll around the
planet. His younger son, David, a family prankster, was up before
him. ``My son said, `New Zealand has disappeared _ they have gone
dark,''' he recalled. ``I said, `Oh no, really?'''
</P>
<P>
   But the breakdowns that were forecast never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to Indonesia, to China, all across Asia without
any reports of problems _ that was surprising,'' said the MIT
graduate, who has lectured around the globe about the need to
reprogram computers before the rollover date. Referring to the
unbroken supply of electric power worldwide, he added: ``By God,
they did do a good job fixing things up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yourdon, a bulky man in blue jeans and wire rim glasses,
warned that it is far too early to say that the world's
computer-dependent societies are out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The smoothness following the arrival of the New Year, he said,
is due partly to intensive work in vital areas like power
generation, air traffic control and missile stewardship. In
addition, he said, many systems, like ports, pipelines and
refineries, were simply turned off, or run manually over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be another opportunity for bugs Monday
morning _ everyone is going to come in to their office, and turn on
their PCs,'' the 55-year-old computer programmer said. ``It is
possible that bugs will manifest themselves in coming days and
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   While many large companies may have invested in clearing up
their Year 2000 defects, he warned that less work has been done by
smaller companies, which often use older software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys show that 30 to 50 percent of small businesses have
done nothing,'' he said. Problems might not appear until later in
the week, or later in the month, when companies try to print
invoices or print payroll checks.
</P>
<P>
   Even among larger companies, the impact of the problems may
never be known, he said, because ``the normal instinct of any
company is to fix it, not to broadcast it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last year, Y2K has become like a sexually transmitted
disease _ no one wants to admit they have it,'' he continued from
his office overlooking a horse pasture here. ``Programmers have
come under heavy legal pressure: `Don't you dare talk about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the string of companies' ``Y2K compliance'' reports
of recent months as ``letting high school seniors grade all their
exams,'' adding, ``It was very difficult to get independent
verification of what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the date rollover, Yourdon was so fearful of
computer viruses that he logged onto the Internet through a backup
computer. Now, back online with his MacIntosh G3 Powerbook, he said
that his e-mail has been running ``roughly 50-50, between `thanks'
and `I hate you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Yourdon, who was the star of a 50-minute video,
``Ed Yourdon's Year 2000 Home Preparation Guide,'' said he has few
regrets about raising the Y2K alarm, prodding companies,
individuals and government agencies to make repairs to avoid future
breakdowns, or about urging people to prepare for shortages that
have not occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has diabetes,'' he said, as a wood fire cracked in a
corner fireplace. ``If he doesn't get insulin he dies in three
days. Now, the government says, `Don't stockpile medicines.' Well,
that's fine for them to say, but for me the stakes are pretty
high.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought his house here two years ago, partly out of Y2K
concerns, and has been dividing his time between Taos and a New
York apartment. With stocks of tuna fish and rice stored in his
sunny kitchen here, he said he saw his home preparedness as an
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, rather than getting a generator, and then feeling
foolish when nothing happened, I put in solar and wind power,'' he
said on a house tour of a system that has cut his power bills in
half. ``Rather than getting thousands of gallons of water at the
grocery store, I got a well.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admits _ and a visit to his Web site (www.yourdon.com)
confirms _ that some resentment zings around the Internet this
weekend. Showing the yards of entries in the Time Bomb 2000
discussion group on Saturday, he said, ``There is a lot of that
today: `Boy do I feel stupid, I wish I never listened to you guys,
does anyone want to buy tuna fish?'''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell, he counseled, about the value of his prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either there will be a lot of Y2K problems, and I will make a
tremendous living as an expert witness in the next year or two,''
Yourdon said. ``Or, if it turns out, a month from now, that there
never were any serious problems, I may have to eat my words,
publicly and with great embarrassment.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MARTIN THOUGHT JETS PUT SEAHAWKS AWAY

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Curtis Martin had spent the afternoon
slashing through boxcar-size holes or gliding acrobatically around
tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   This time he met the subject head-on.
</P>
<P>
   He was standing at the podium for his news conference, fresh
from rushing for 158 yards to set a team record for most yards in
one season. He was visible only from the waist up in a
tank-top-style shirt that displayed his weight-lifter biceps and
his ballet dancer waist.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was describing the elation of the New York Jets'
finishing strong, punishing the Seattle Seahawks worse than
Sunday's 19-9 score would suggest, righting their record at eight
victories and eight losses.
</P>
<P>
   Then a team official interrupted to announce that Oakland had
just beaten Kansas City in overtime, 41-38, which meant that those
very same Seahawks had qualified for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still get to go?'' Martin asked, apparently incredulous
at the injustice of that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had obviously not spent the previous days poring over the
multiple playoff scenarios for the NFL, in which mediocrity goes
unpunished and momentum means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This was the closest any Jet would come to admitting that there
had been a malicious glee in humbling the Seahawks on a warm
January afternoon. Martin conceded that while his five linemen were
pushing the Seahawks all over the Meadowlands, he was carrying the
football with mischief in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'll knock them out,'' Martin admitted he had
thought.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a dishonorable calling. The Jets had plenty of
personal incentives on this final day. They bounced back from a
horrendous 1-6 start, predicated by the injured Achilles' tendon
suffered by Vinny Testaverde on Bill Parcells' chosen surface of
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   They won their last four games. They beat Miami. Big deal. Miami
gets in the playoffs. They beat Dallas in Texas. So what? Dallas
would beat the Giants Sunday and slip in. They beat Miami down
there. Never mind. And Sunday they beat Seattle. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the Jets clean out their lockers and Bill Parcells almost
surely reveals his intention for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The fans chanted ``One more year!'' and Parcells seemed vaguely
on the verge of appearing to have one fleeting emotional quiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great place for me,'' he said afterward. ``I'm not
trying to be nostalgic, but this is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Logic suggests that Parcells will not be leaving the Jets while
they await somebody to buy the team from the estate of Leon Hess.
But it is also clear that the Jets' resolute whacking of the
Seahawks, as satisfying as it was, would not influence Parcells one
way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Bill,'' Martin said. ``My own opinion is, I'd say,
`Bill, you've got to stay here till my contract's up.'''
</P>
<P>
   For all his bullying, Parcells inspires a weird kind of football
loyalty in a significant cadre of players.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, no more than half an hour after Ray Lucas played yet
another fine game at quarterback, Parcells referred to Lucas'
``wormy'' physique. Yet Lucas was pleased that at least the coach
had not referred to him as Fats, as he has been known to do.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Lucas go back a ways with Parcells, to his previous
job in New England. In 1995, Martin, just drafted from the
University of Pittsburgh, gained 103 yards in his professional
debut. The subsequent week, Parcells vociferously referred to
Martin as a ``one-day wonder,'' and the taunting goes on to this
day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Parcells disciples even stay around to become
mini-Parcells of their own. Maurice Carthon, the exemplary blocking
back on Parcells' two Super Bowl championship teams with the
Giants, is now an assistant with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice knows how to push my buttons,'' Martin said. ``He's
been telling me that if I didn't break the record today I might as
well retire. He told me not to run out of bounds so much, that I
should cut back inside, so that's what I tried to do today.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin came into the game with 1,306 yards, only 25 behind the
team record of Freeman McNeil in 1985. He took care of that early,
with some elegant steps and brute power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't look because I'm too busy blocking the so-and-so on
the other side of the line,'' said Randy Thomas, the left guard.
``But I know he did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Jenkins, the right guard, said: ``Curtis makes it easy for
us because of the way he fakes out the defense. We make our blocks,
and we know where he's going.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin finished with 1,464 yards, more yards than Matt Snell or
Emerson Boozer or John Riggins or McNeil ever gained. He didn't
talk much about the record because, he said, ``There's a saying
that he who exalts himself will be humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   The only people humbled Sunday were the Seahawks, and they get
to play Miami next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough to go home and watch,'' Martin
admitted. ``We beat this team. We can beat that team. It's going to
hurt.''

 &HT;    `So many times we had a chance to win'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves has been in the NFL all but
one year since 1965 as a player, player-coach, assistant, offensive
coordinator or head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other time, when his 1990 Denver Broncos went from a
Super Bowl team to 5-11, has Reeves seen this much go haywire in a
season for one of his teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were 14-2 last season and went to the Super Bowl
with a ball-control offense that also had quick-strike
capabilities, plus an opportunistic defense that was outstanding
against the run and key to a league-best plus-20 turnover ratio.
</P>
<P>
   They also has minimal injuries and uncanny chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the 4-11 Falcons will play the 4-11 49ers for third
place in the NFC West, both teams long ago eliminated from playoff
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had absolutely none of the aforementioned ingredients
this season, despite minimal personnel turnover in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Reeves' agent, Robert Fraley, and good friend and pro
golfer Payne Stewart died in a plane crash, just two of several
people Reeves knows who passed away this year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution beat writer Matt Winkeljohn talked
with Reeves not so much to dissect the problems, but to gauge their
effect on Reeves, who is 13 months removed from quadruple heart
bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has this been the worst year of your professional life, and
your personal life?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our expectations were high because we'd been to the Super
Bowl the year before, and to have a season where you don't even
challenge for the playoffs is really disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   And personally, I'm just at a point in my life, at 55 years of
age, where that's the way it's going to be.
</P>
<P>
   The last four or five years, my daily prayer list gets longer
because I have more friends and relatives that are sick, have
cancer, heart problems, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the tragic one was when someone dies unexpectedly
like Robert did, and Payne did ... that was tragic, but also
happens in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   (Assistant to head coach/pro personnel) Marvin Bass' (only son
died), one of our secretaries is having some problems, a good
friend in Denver passed away. But I don't think anybody is
interested in all that.
</P>
<P>
   It was just difficult on top of everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you reached a point where the peaks are not as high, and
the valleys seem even lower than ever?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's always been true, but it seems to magnify itself. You
expect the wins, but the losses take a lot more out of you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the low point of the season?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's been so many. The first St. Louis loss (35-7) was bad
because we got embarrassed. Losing at San Francisco (26-7). There
were so many times we had a chance to win and didn't get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Every loss hurts. None of them are easy to deal with. You keep
trying to get it turned around. We never did get turned around to
where we felt we had things under control, and ... thought
everything was going to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Excluding injuries, what of all the elements of failure has
been most disappointing _ the lack of a running game, the poor run
defense, or the change in turnover ratio?
</P>
<P>
   A: What's been most disappointing is I thought we had a chance
to win.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of reasons. Defensively, we didn't have that many
changes (in personnel) or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   That goes to show you how important your offense is at helping
your defense out, because we haven't controlled the time on the
clock and kept them off the field.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't given them outstanding field position. Even when we
got takeaways, we always seemed to be in our end of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You said after your heart surgery you were going to delegate
more responsibility. Have you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I did put a lot more on the coaches in the offseason as far
as getting things done because we've been together a while, and I
think they understand what we're doing. I did delegate more
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did that contribute to the way the season has gone?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. There's definitely things we've got to do better as a
coaching staff, don't get me wrong. It's not just the players. We
didn't do a good job, either. But I don't think it's because I
delegated more authority.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has been the greatest failure of the coaching staff, and
front office?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think we got our reserves to play as well as they're
capable of playing, for whatever reason, whether it was motivation,
or getting them to play up to their ability, or misevaluating (the
talent) of our backups in the offseason. We just didn't get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was more difficult, the time after your surgery, or
coping with this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Those three or four weeks after heart surgery. You have
trouble shampooing your hair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Rumors that you're going to step down as head coach and
continue as executive vice president of football operations have
persisted for weeks. Do you plan to honor the two final years of
your contract, as both head coach and executive vice president?
</P>
<P>
   A: I plan to. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think these rumors have surfaced?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been around long enough to know that's part of it. Part
of it's the fact I've been around 19 years as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What needs to happen for this team to get back to winning?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's what we'll do next week is find out what our
priorities are. But without even talking to the staff, we've got to
get a cornerback, got to get a running back because we got four
people coming off knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to have to resolve our deal at defensive line
because we've got (three) free agents there, and we need to shore
up our offensive line, and get a wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   And we got to make sure we've got a backup quarterback that we
can win with.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, everything is fine.

COMMENTARY: WHEN TREATMENT IS DENIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Legal Aid Society has sued the state to try to force it to
provide residential treatment for severely mentally ill children
who now are on waiting lists and languish in inappropriate settings
for months, sometimes more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the shortage of residential treatment facilities is just
part of a much larger crisis in the delivery of services to
thousands upon thousands of mentally ill children who are suffering
grievously, and who often are a threat to themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and the state Legislature have taken some
recent steps to address this problem. But far more attention is
paid to the needs of mentally ill adults, and services for them get
the bulk of the state's money. The children get what's left, which
isn't much.
</P>
<P>
   So you get situations like that of a boy, now 11, who was
profiled in a report put out a few weeks ago by the Citizens
Committee for Children of New York. The boy was diagnosed as
psychotic at a very young age and behaves, to put it mildly,
bizarrely. When he became angry with a teacher named Mrs. Siegal he
went to the beach, killed a sea gull and brought it to her.
</P>
<P>
   The report said his speech is disorganized and he suffers from
delusions. He received day treatment for a while, but once his
condition stabilized he was sent back to his public school
classroom. There, according to the report, ``he fell apart.'' He
was ostracized by classmates. He placed a Molotov cocktail in the
tailpipe of a car belonging to a teacher he disliked.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was hospitalized several times and received residential
treatment for a while. But eventually he was sent home. The report
said he no longer attends school, is not receiving clinical support
and no longer gets medication. And there is no plan for ongoing
mental health treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a surprise: The youngster has been in trouble with the
police.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Pataki announced plans to spend an additional $36.2
million on mental health residential and support services for
children. Advocates like Gail B. Nayowith, executive director of
the Citizens Committee for Children, have generally been pleased by
the initiative. But they said it is not nearly enough to offset the
many years of neglect and chronic underfunding of children's mental
health services.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, in addition to the long waits for admittance to
residential treatment facilities, there are drastic shortages of
other mental health services for children because of arbitrary
Medicaid spending caps and other harmful cost-cutting measures
imposed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means there are many, many kids who don't get things like
outpatient therapy, medication, crisis services, day treatment or
partial hospitalization,'' Ms. Nayowith said. ``We like what the
governor did in November. But we want the state to build on that
$36.2 million foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   The suffering of mentally ill children who do not get treatment
can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got voices telling them what to do,'' said Ms.
Nayowith. ``They've got hallucinations. They have anxiety
disorders, which means they can never sit and relax, or
obsessive-compulsive disorders _ hand-washing, pacing. They have
phobias and horrible eating disorders. Some are cutters _ you know,
they mutilate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens with these kids is that they suffer from an
illness that has a treatment but, basically, they're denied
treatment. So they're not getting relief from their pain. It would
be as if your kid had asthma or diabetes and you just never
provided an inhaler or insulin.''
</P>
<P>
   The price paid by others for not treating these kids can be
extreme. Ms. Nayowith mentioned the youngsters who are very
aggressive sexually, who are subject to uncontrollable anger or
mania, who physically attack others, set fires, mutilate animals.
The violence, at times, is homicidal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nayowith also noted that mentally ill youngsters frequently
are the victims of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   A close look at the tragic plight of the many thousands of
mentally ill children in New York should convince anyone that bold
new steps need to be taken to alleviate the gruesome psychic pain
that these youngsters experience, and to lessen the threat that
their illness can pose to the rest of us.

 &HT;    Schulz challenged us to hurdle life's obstacles
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A self-portrait of Charles Schulz hangs
above a doorway at the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca
Raton. It's strange to see an adult drawn by Schulz _ shock of
white hair, soft smile, bright eyes, clearly a grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   We have known his diminutive creations for almost a
half-century, but we have not known the artist. He has been the
invisible man who touched millions of lives with his gang of kids,
a dog and a bird.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait looks down upon a 50-years-of-``Peanuts'' exhibit,
Oct. 2, 1950, to Oct. 2, 2000. Below it is a computation of how
many ``Peanuts'' strips Schulz will have drawn by Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   18,236.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to settle for around 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the ``Peanuts'' gang retires after almost _ but not quite
_ 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Linus, Lucy, Charlie Brown. They were just kids 50 years ago,
maybe age 8 or 10 or thereabouts. Now they're retiring. At age 8 or
10 or thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   And that dog. He's about 350 in dog years, and still waiting for
a bowl of something other than dog food. Still waiting for a clean
shot at the Red Baron. Today Snoopy, the Walter Mitty of dogdom,
puts his Sopwith Camel into mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   And his fine feathered friend. Today, Woodstock flies off to
wherever 30-year-old birds fly off to.
</P>
<P>
   WE WISH HIM WELL
</P>
<P>
   Game's over. Charlie Brown's hapless baseball team leaves the
field. Lucy kicks the football into a closet. The kite is treed for
good.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Great Pumpkin looks for another magic patch.
</P>
<P>
   And so do we.
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. Schulz, 78, has capped his ink bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, we hope, will beat the colon cancer that forced his
retirement, will get to Oct. 2 and many years beyond. We wish him
well because we feel we know him. We know we like him. And we love
his creations.
</P>
<P>
   But we're greedy, aren't we? We want him back, and he hasn't
even left. We're like Linus on the morning after Halloween when,
once again, there's been no visit by the Great Pumpkin: a little
bit alone, a little bit sad, but ever faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that security blanket Linus tugged around all these
decades was Schulz's inside joke on us. His comic strip became our
blanket, always there when we wanted it. Small, plain, homespun,
but full of redemptive power.
</P>
<P>
   That was ``Peanuts.'' Big gift in a small package. Irony without
cynicism. Wisdom without preaching. Humor as expressive and
graceful as those bars of Beethoven that Schroeder pounded out on
his miniature grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   STORYTELLING WITH A LESSON
</P>
<P>
   No adult ever appeared in the strip, yet this was anything but a
strip just for kids. Schulz wound a double helix of humor around
the ``Peanuts'' gang: Slapstick stunts kids loved entwined with
nuanced jabs at adult pretensions that adults loved. A single
strip, a single quizzical look on Charlie Brown's face, could carry
two distinct jokes, two lessons, two stories. That's the genius of
Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Give a kid and an adult a ``Pogo'' strip and the adult might
laugh. The kid will be totally confused. Walt Kelly, Pogo's
creator, was the Faulkner of the cartoon genre. Give a kid and an
adult a ``Daffy Duck'' strip and the kid might laugh. The adult
will furrow a brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doonesbury''? baby boomer laughs; grandparent does not.
``Beetle Bailey''? Old G.I. laughs; Baby Boomer looks for
``Doonesbury.'' Al Capp? A genius, but you won't find your 8-year
old rolling on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But give anyone a ``Peanuts'' strip, and they'll find something
to smile about. Nobody grabbed everybody like Schulz. Maybe that's
why so many millions of readers turned to ``Peanuts'' before they
read the day's dose of bad news. And why so many millions more
turned to ``Peanuts'' as a balm after reading the day's bad news.
There's nothing like Snoopy beholding a sunset to remind you, if
only for a moment, of life's bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Sally, the girl who cannot fathom school, who
reincarnates our childhood fears of teachers. Or Woodstock, named
in 1970 for the rock concert, who became Schulz's metaphor for an
entire generation: awe-inspired, curious, tentative in spite of its
rhetoric. Pig Pen was the iconoclast, the rebel in Schulz. Linus is
trust personified, but with a security blanket. Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   THE GANG'S ALL SCHULZ
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget that this gang is the emotional expression
of a single artist. The ``Peanuts'' gang is Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   He said once that Lucy's cynicism was his way of dealing with
his own.
</P>
<P>
   And Snoopy harbors Schulz's desire for adventure _ Schulz grew
up reading ``Steve Canyon'' _ and Snoopy takes flight where Canyon
left off.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown a loser? Too easy. Charlie Brown is the common
man, the everyman. He is Schulz's vehicle for coming to terms with
the three years he spent in the Army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``World War II taught me all I needed to know about
loneliness,'' Schulz said in a memoir. ``And my sympathy for the
loneliness all of us experience has dropped heavily upon poor
Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz gave us a window on his soul, as great artists do. And he
gave us a window on our world, on ourselves, as the greatest
artists do.
</P>
<P>
   He once said that he hoped only to add something to the cartoon
profession he loved. Boy, did he ever.
</P>
<P>
   His gang of shorties taught us how to lose with grace. They
taught us how to dream, share, discern. Snoopy challenged the Red
Baron and the cat next door. Lucy challenged everybody. Sally
challenged the establishment. Linus challenged faith.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown challenged life.
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Schulz challenged us.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the strip is going into syndication. Reruns. It won't be
the same, will it? There's something very un-``Peanuts'' about
syndication. We'll be seeing ghosts, looking back. No matter how
often his kite crashed, no matter how often his team lost, Charlie
Brown never looked back, only up and onward.
</P>
<P>
   No more.

 (ATTN: N.H., S.C., Mich.)  
 COMMENTARY: McCAIN COULD WIN  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sea change has taken place in the American
election system without our noticing it. The ``independentation''
of the primaries will determine our next president.
</P>
<P>
   In olden times _ a decade or so ago _ state primary elections
were often battlegrounds for partisans within each party. Liberal
Democrats would wrestle with ``new'' or ``blue dog'' Democrats to
choose candidates, just as economic conservatives would joust with
social conservatives to pick GOP nominees. Nor was it only
ideological: Young Turks would go up against entrenched leadership.
</P>
<P>
   There was a tidiness to this. Voters were given an incentive to
join a party: By signing up, you could vote twice _ first to choose
your party's nominee, and then for whomever you preferred in the
general election. Independents didn't get to vote in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been changing. In the crucial early primaries of the
next seven weeks, unaligned voters _ not hard-core party regulars
nor activists in organized pressure groups of left and right _ will
decide the nominees of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   This was unplanned. It has given an unremarked kick in the head
to the two-party system. The generation-old rise of the primary was
supposed to devolve power from party bosses to party members. But
this year the opening of both parties' gates is transforming
presidential politics. No party registration is required in the
three launch-pad states. Independent voters will be decisive in
choosing party standard-bearers.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, independents may vote in either party's
primary, which is why both Bill Bradley and John McCain are polling
so well against the party establishments' Al Gore and George W.
Bush. The bigger the independent turnout, the likelier a pair of
insurgent victories.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina _ Bush's ``firewall state'' in case McCain
beats him in New Hampshire _ there also is no party registration.
Jennifer Martin Donohue of WNDS-TV in New Hampshire, a distant
cousin who awakened me to this phenomenon, reports that the South
Carolina GOP expects a turnout of 300,000 this year, 5 percent more
than in 1996. Polls of Republicans have been showing Bush with a
four-to-one lead.
</P>
<P>
   That's largely because pollsters fail to take into account the
new political paradigm. One-third of S.C.'s 2 million voters are
habitual switchers, and the only primary action this year is
Republican on Feb. 19 (the Democratic ``firehouse caucuses'' come
weeks later).
</P>
<P>
   Bush is counting on the previous governor's ``machine'' and on
Pat Robertson's marshaling of the religious right's support of soft
money. But McCain has Rep. Lindsey Graham, the most popular figure
in the state, saying that campaign finance reform bolsters sound
conservative government.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 400,000 veterans _ highest percentage anywhere _ are
largely independents. All they have to do to become eligible on
primary day is to declare a GOP preference.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes Michigan, also with no party registration, which has
its GOP primary three days later on Feb. 22. Again, Bush is heavily
favored because Bushie Gov. John Engler has the party machinery.
But any of Michigan's 2 million independents charged up by coverage
of a South Carolina upset can walk in and become a Republican for a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Democratic caucuses should be duck soup for Gore,
with his union backing. But Bradley's secret weapon is the mail-in
ballot: Any independent (who may have voted for McCain two weeks
before) can send in a ballot declaring Democratic preference and
choosing Bradley. Those ``absentee'' votes probably will count.
(This recalls Jack Valenti's ``When I die, bury me in Texas because
I want to remain politically active.'')
</P>
<P>
   What will the addition of the new ``party temporaries'' to the
old-fashioned party regulars mean to 2000's primaries? Gore and
Bush strategists will deplore ``the invasion of the party
snatchers'' because they know it will strengthen Bradley and McCain
_ by how much, nobody knows. But certainly on the GOP side, the
coming three-state unregistered ramble requires a rethinking of
Philadelphia Conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by virtue of the wide-openness of the three launch-pad
primaries, is no longer a long shot. And if independents in party
clothing do help make the happy hero the GOP nominee, McCain could
claim to be more likely than Bush to beat the Democrat. (Unless
it's the maverick Bradley. Then everything's up for grabs.)

SUGAR BOWL MAY SWING ON SPECIAL TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ They aren't on the field that much, maybe a
combined total of two minutes. When they trot on, it usually means
television is coming out of or going into a commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully, however, when the special teams of Virginia
Tech and Florida State get their turns in the Sugar Bowl. Their
coaches say that how each team punts, place kicks and covers kicks
might decide the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have two teams playing with two of the best
special teams in the country _ I'm talking kickers, blockers and
returners and it'll play a role in this game,'' Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer, who is his own special teams
coach, is even more emphatic. In his 13 seasons at Virginia Tech,
his Hokies have blocked 75 kicks _ including a nation's-best 63 in
the 1990s _ and combined with the defense for 57 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quickest way to win games is with special teams,'' Beamer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the two 11-0 teams meet Tuesday night, members of
the special teams have made news, though not exactly the kind
Bowden and Beamer welcome. Florida State's two-time all-American
kicker Sebastian Janikowski announced this weekend he would skip
his senior year to enter the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden conceded, meanwhile, two or three players have missed
curfew this week and will be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer has had his hands full replacing punt returner Ricky
Hall, who broke a bone in his left foot during practice Friday, as
well as trying to calm his unusually manic all-American, Corey
Moore. The senior defensive end, who has four career blocks, has
alternately guaranteed a Hokies victory over the top-ranked
Seminoles and ridiculed reporters' questions before storming out of
media-day interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches blame too much pregame hype and hotel confinement
for the incidents and have indicated the special teams will be at
full strength. Break down this decidedly nonglamorous aspect of the
game and it is yet another example of how closely the two teams are
matched.
</P>
<P>
   In Janikowski, Florida State has a left-footer who booms
kickoffs out of the end zone, has converted 23 of 30 field goals
and all 47 extra points, and will probably be an NFL first-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish-born 6-foot-2-inch, 255-pounder also has a penchant
for long nights of cold beer and shooting pool.
</P>
<P>
   Deep snapper Clay Ingram said: ``A lot of stuff about him going
out and staying out all night and still coming in and kicking
50-yard field goals, that's all true. That's the way he is. The
legend is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of us, our idea of relaxing is going home and
watching TV. He'll stay in a bar until 3 o'clock in the morning
shooting pool and drinking, and that's relaxing to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year before Florida State's national title game with
Tennessee, Janikowski confessed that he dreaded the idea of having
to boot the game-winning kick. He never got that chance against the
Vols. Now, he says he is looking forward to the opportunity and
predicted he would have a range of up to 68 yards inside the
Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hokies' reputation as kick blockers doesn't intimidate
him. ``I really don't think much about it, and I don't watch much
film on it, either,'' he said. ``I just try to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech counters with Shayne Graham, who is the only
player in Big East history, except for the former Syracuse
quarterback Donovan McNabb, to be named first team all-conference
four consecutive years. He has 371 career points, including 107
this season. He has hit from 53 yards and was 17 of 22 in
field-goal attempts this year.
</P>
<P>
   None was bigger, however, than a 44-yard kick in the closing
seconds to beat West Virginia, 22-20, and keep the Hokies'
championship aspirations alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my chances with Shayne Graham,'' the Hokies' star
quarterback Michael Vick said. ``I'll put money on Shayne Graham
any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State appears to have the advantage now that Virginia
Tech's punt returner, Hall, is out. The senior, who is also the
team's second-leading receiver, averaged 12.8 yards a return with a
touchdown. He will be replaced by the junior Ike Charlton, the
starting cornerback, who has not fielded any punts this season.
Still, the Hokies' block-kick rush gives Charlton confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go after the punter anyway, so we're going to
mix it up between setting up the returns and trying to block the
punt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Seminoles, a punt is another opportunity for the
dangerous Peter Warrick to break open the game. He returned 18
punts an average of 12.6 yards with a touchdown this season. In
Jimmy Kibble, however, the Hokies may have an accurate enough leg
to keep the ball away from Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   Kibble was named first-team Big East for the third consecutive
year and had only nine of his 46 punts this season returned, for a
total of 36 yards. He also is one of most effective practitioners
of the lost art of the coffin-corner kick, having dropped the ball
inside the 20-yard line 16 times.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and Beamer are impressed with each other's preparation in
one of the most detailed facets of football. The difference may be
the will of individual players in those handful of plays, Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all work as hard as we can to prepare on special teams,''
Bowden said. ``But it still comes down to some individual going
above and beyond the call of duty and making a play that could win
a game.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE WISDOM OF Y2K PLANNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   In a welcome anticlimax to two years of dire warnings, the new
millennium arrived over the weekend without a computer-driven
meltdown of the globe's electronic infrastructure. So far even the
countries that did not spend vast sums to prepare for a Y2K-bug
disaster have been spared major problems, raising questions about
whether all the planning and expense were necessary. The
speculation about what might have happened had there been no
preparation is intriguing and inevitable. But common sense suggests
that inaction was not an option for government and business leaders
once the experts determined the existence of a threat to power
grids, defense systems, air transport, financial communications and
other vital linkages.
</P>
<P>
   Among most computer specialists, the fear of a serious crisis
was real. As just about everyone came to learn, their anxiety was
that computers would break down because of an inability to
recognize the year 2000. A year or so ago, Wired magazine reported
that many leading software engineers were themselves planning to
spend the New Year's weekend in remote places with stocks of water,
cash and food on hand. That fear now seems exaggerated, but it was
not entirely fanciful. It reflected the essential fact that even
the experts do not fully comprehend the complexity of the systems
that now undergird the world's computers. John Koskinen, chairman
of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, has warned that
it may take weeks or months to be sure that the millennium bug is
completely behind us.
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from averting a disaster, efforts to fix the Y2K
problem in advance brought different sorts of benefits. American
businesses and governments that spent an estimated $100 billion to
upgrade their systems enhanced their ability to function and serve
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists from the United States and other advanced countries
traveled around the world to interact with their counterparts in
other countries. Some countries began the exercise a year or two
ago with deep distrust of these emissaries. For example, there was
a feeling in places like Russia and even France that since American
computer experts had created the problem, it was their job to fix
it. But in the end, the international cooperation that resulted
brought improvements everywhere and a new understanding of each
country's systems. Indeed, a reminder that problems of our own
making can be addressed and prevented through sustained
coordination is not a bad way to start a new millennium.

AN EXHAUSTED BRADY DELIVERED FOR MICHIGAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was approaching 1:30 a.m. Sunday when Tom Brady stood
outside the Michigan locker room explaining his career day against
Alabama in the FedEx Orange Bowl. After several minutes, the senior
quarterback had to plead off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, but I've got to sit down,'' Brady said, picking up his
travel bags to head toward the team bus. ``I'm beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan quarterbacks coach, Stan Parrish, described Brady
as on the ``borderline of exhaustion'' late in regulation in the
Wolverines' 35-34 overtime victory over Alabama at Pro Player
Stadium. But Brady was still there to contribute a 25-yard
touchdown pass to tight end Shawn Thompson in the overtime period.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended when Alabama's Ryan Pflugner missed the extra
point after Andrew Zow's 21-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said he was prepared to go on, even with his body telling
him differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, these guys are counting on you,'' he said, motioning
to teammates walking past him. ``When you know that, it doesn't
matter what it takes. But that's the way everybody would be; that's
not just me. Those linemen were dog tired. Everyone was dog tired.
It was just a matter of playing to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   This turned out to be a game of extremes for Michigan, which
finished 10-2 with five straight victories. It managed one first
down in the game's first 28 minutes, but then became almost
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines decided at halftime to largely abandon a running
game that wasn't working and instead put wide receiver David
Terrell in as many one-on-one passing situations as possible.
Terrell, named the game's most valuable player, finished with three
touchdown catches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was Brady, completing 34 of 46 passes for 369 yards
and four touchdowns, who kept Michigan focused. The Wolverines
twice came back from 14-point deficits fueled in large part by
Shaun Alexander's 161 yards rushing and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Brady drew praise from his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's everything you want in a quarterback,'' Michigan's Lloyd
Carr said. ``First of all, he's tough-minded and tough physically.
He's very, very smart and makes good decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's lot like Brian Griese. He'll play in the NFL. There's a
lot of guys out there who doubted Griese, and they've lived to see
how wrong they could be. And anybody who doubts that Brady can play
in the NFL, they'll find themselves in the same situation. The kid
just can see things. And the guys around him, they love him. If you
knew him, you'd love him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady, a Californian, lost his battle with Griese for the No. 1
quarterback job as a sophomore. With Griese going to the Denver
Broncos, Brady seemed the heir for a two-season run. It didn't turn
out to be that simple, with the touted sophomore Drew Henson's
emergence this fall. Henson, a minor league third baseman for the
Yankees, saw some playing time until the season's eighth game,
against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it has been Brady's team again.
</P>
<P>
   Carr says now that Brady could have disrupted Michigan's unity
had he complained too much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled it in a way where he gained in the eyes of his
teammates,'' the coach said early Sunday. ``He gained in stature
because he put his team first.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a Michigan quarterbacking tradition is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian passed along a legacy for me to uphold,'' Brady said.
``Now Drew has some great experiences here this season that he can
draw from next season. That's what it's all about. You play to the
expectations of the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations, blossoming into reality as the season wore
on, helped bear this distinctive fruit: Michigan's third straight
10-victory season.  &QL;

ELIZABETH DOLE, WITH EYE ON VP SLOT, TO ENDORSE BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole, who placed second to Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas in many national polls before she dropped out of the
race for the Republican presidential nomination, will announce on
Tuesday that she is endorsing Bush, Republican officials close to
both politicians said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   These officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
Dole would probably make her decision known at a joint appearance
with Bush in New Hampshire, where Bush is locked in a tight contest
with Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement represents an important, albeit predictable,
development for the Bush campaign, in that Dole is one of the most
prominent women in the Republican Party and a respected leader
whose approval ratings remained lofty even though her candidacy
failed to catch fire. Dole dropped out of the race in late October
because, she said, she could not raise enough money to compete with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement also reflects Dole's interest in the vice
presidency, people close to her said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win for both of them,'' said Nelson Warfield, the press
secretary for the 1996 presidential campaign of Bob Dole, Elizabeth
Dole's husband. ``It's another indication that the Republican
establishment is solidly behind George W. Bush, and that if all
else goes wrong, the thing that will get him across the finish line
is their support.''
</P>
<P>
   Warfield added, ``Elizabeth Dole would like to be considered for
the V.P. spot, and it's hard to see a scenario where she remains
silent or endorses somebody else and still gets considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bush said that it was much too early to think or
talk about vice presidential prospects, and that Dole has several
marks against her, including the early failure of her campaign and
the fact that she has never been elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   Although there had been some speculation in Republican circles
over the last few weeks that Bob Dole was leaning toward endorsing
McCain, a close friend and longtime colleague in the Senate, people
close to the Doles said Sunday that the former Kansas senator would
probably not endorse anyone until the Republican contest was
essentially over.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole created a stir last May when he said in an interview
that he had thought about donating money to the campaign of McCain,
one of his wife's opponents. But associates of the Doles said he
was intent now on presenting a united front with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole's political game right now is to get his wife on the
ticket,'' said a Republican operative close to the Doles. ``I'd be
surprised if he endorses anyone now, but he'll embrace the
presumptive nominee this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to McCain said they were not surprised by Mrs. Dole's
decision and said McCain had done little to woo her. They seized
the development as another opportunity to cast Bush as the charmed
insider and McCain as the scrappy outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good endorsement for a campaign that's been
built on endorsements,'' said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist
working for McCain. ``We're not running an endorsement campaign.
We're running a message campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to Bush said that Elizabeth Dole would probably fly
with the governor on Tuesday from New Hampshire to Iowa and make
several additional appearances in Iowa, which holds its caucus on
Jan. 24. The New Hampshire primary is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said that it was unclear how much campaigning Dole
would do, but that Bush would like her continued help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can draw a crowd, and it's a different kind of crowd,''
the adviser said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Referring to Elizabeth Dole's third-place finish behind Bush and
the wealthy publisher Steve Forbes in the Iowa straw poll in
August, the adviser added, ``She really did turn out different
voters than traditionally participated; she showed a strong appeal
to women and young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a Cabinet member under two Republican administrations and
a former president of the American Red Cross, was the first woman
to be taken seriously as a presidential candidate, and Bush's
advisers clearly hope that her endorsement will solidify his
already strong standing among women who vote.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not at all clear that her base overlaps Bush's. And
after she left the race, some of her supporters went to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said that Dole had decided to endorse Bush
several weeks ago but that the announcement was deliberately
delayed until the beginning of the final, monthlong sprint toward
the first statewide contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers even considered saving the announcement of the
endorsement as a last-minute boost going into the New Hampshire
primary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign,
said the endorsement was important largely as a way to control news
coverage for a few hours or days and lessen the odds that something
unplanned derails Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal right now, for a front-runner, is to play beat the
clock,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole will follow two other former Republican presidential
candidates, Rep. John R. Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee, in endorsing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who also dropped out of the
race, has not endorsed anyone.

PENALTY KILLING PROVES FAULTY FOR ISLANDERS AS FLYERS ROLL
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In an effort to squeeze the last drop of
optimism out of their previous homestand, the New York Islanders
harped on the positives of their 4-1 loss Sunday to the
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders said they were competitive in 5-on-5 situations.
They said they played hard.
</P>
<P>
   But the words carried an echo as distant as the stretch in which
the Islanders posted a 3-2-1 record while playing their best hockey
of the season. That was three losses ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, playing before 14,228 at Nassau Coliseum, showed
that their penalty-killing unit is ranked No. 25 in the NHL for
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering five power-play goals in a 9-3 loss to
Pittsburgh on Thursday night, the Islanders gave up two power-play
goals _ by Rod Brind'Amour and John LeClair, in the first period to
fall behind, 2-1. Then the Flyers exploited a tentative Islanders
defense for even-strength goals by LeClair in the second period and
Eric Lindros in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't kill penalties, and it sometimes gets you to step
back and you don't play as hard as you should because you're scared
to take a penalty,'' Islanders coach Butch Goring said. ``We just
have struggled in the special teams area, and that's probably the
reason we are where we are today in the standings.''
</P>
<P>
   That is last in the Atlantic Division with a 9-22-5 record and
23 points, which ties them with the expansion Atlanta Thrashers for
last in the Eastern Conference standings. Philadelphia, stretching
its unbeaten string to four games, improved to 22-11-6-1 (51
points), just one point behind Eastern Conference-leading Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   With the Islanders trailing by 2-1, Mariusz Czerkawski and
Jorgen Jonsson whizzed shots past Flyers goalie Brian Boucher, but
the puck hit the crossbar both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to hit the crossbar I probably couldn't do it,''
Czerkawski said, ``but unfortunately I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros said: ``If that goes in, anything can happen. It wasn't
your typical 4-1 game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' 6-0-2 record in their last eight games at home
against the Flyers had kept the embers of a rivalry alive. But the
difference in the teams' ability and the departure of Lindros'
nemesis, Rich Pilon, to the Rangers last month has threatened to
smother the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Flyers nearly zapped the emotion from the game
before fans had settled in their seats. Seconds after Islanders
defenseman Eric Brewer was penalized for hooking, Brind'Amour
worked his way behind the 6-foot-9-inch defenseman Zdeno Chara and
flicked in a pass from Eric Desjardins.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders tied the score at 1-1 six minutes later when Mats
Lindgren fired a shot from the left circle past Boucher's right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia capitalized on another man advantage late in the
first period. Five seconds after an interference call against the
Islanders' Niklas Andersson, Desjardins tapped the puck to LeClair,
stationed in front of goalie Kevin Weekes. LeClair tilted his stick
to redirect the puck into the net.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S CLOSED PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, political parties had a heavy hand in picking their
presidential nominees. Now, in most big states except New York,
voters do the picking in primaries or political caucuses. Through
an arcane system that requires even candidates who have qualified
nationally for federal election funds to amass signatures and jump
through qualifying hoops, New York's political parties have, by
mutual legislative agreement, limited the candidates on their
ballots to two Democrats, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley, and as few as one Republican in some areas, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have made it easier for candidates' names to
appear on their ballot, requiring a campaign to get only 5,000
valid signatures statewide, as opposed to about 20,000 for the
Republicans. But even the lesser requirement is onerous,
undemocratic and outdated. New York's entire ballot-qualification
exercise ranks as a political throwback to the old party-boss days
before voters could see and assess the various candidates on
television. For that reason, states like California automatically
add names of those considered ``viable'' by the media. Some states
include any candidate qualified for federal funds or ask for a
modest filing fee. Unlike New York, these states want to offer
voters a basic political right: the ability to choose among all
available candidates for a given office.
</P>
<P>
   California's vote, which comes the same day as New York's, is
expected to have more than 20 names on the ballot, including three
Democrats _ the third being Lyndon LaRouche _ and six Republicans.
But the principle here is simple. It is better to have an unwieldy
ballot than an election fixed by Albany power brokers, party
kingpins and clubhouse patronage hacks.
</P>
<P>
   For the supporters of Bush, of course, New York state's
presidential primary is just the ticket. Bush, like Bob Dole four
years ago, is the state Republican Party's establishment candidate.
That means Bush has a ready-made Republican apparatus to gather
signatures correctly in each congressional district in order to
stamp his name on the state's ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican candidates cannot ``just add water,'' as they
refer to the Bush-Dole method of gaining access to the ballot.
Instead, they face a maze of rules and a mountain of signatures
clearly designed to scare off the anointed Republican's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republican candidates have given up the battle, but Sen.
John McCain and Steve Forbes are still at it. Forbes is expected to
hire petitioners at a cost of $750,000 to collect signatures in
each of the state's 31 districts, and McCain, who is also trying to
present petitions by this week's deadline, has filed suit to open
his party's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican leaders argue that their system filters out the
frivolous candidates. This is a fancy excuse for the hijacking of
New Yorkers' ability to vote in an open election. Besides, as
filtration systems go, this one is more like a brick wall.
Nitpicking disqualification rules mean, for example, that a
Republican candidate who needs 20,000 valid signatures would
probably have to collect 40,000. These names must be secured in
about a month, over the holiday season. Moreover, Republicans can
sign only one petition, so as the party regulars call their
established lists of voters for Bush, they automatically shrink the
pool of possibilities for McCain or Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   There is still time for New York to have a primary on March 7
that has not been fixed by a blockaded ballot. Three men have the
power to make that happen through special legislation. It is time
for citizens to call Pataki, (518) 474-8390; Joseph Bruno, the
Senate majority leader, (518) 455-3191; and Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, (518) 455-3791, and tell them to meet their
obligation to guarantee free and fair elections. By inaction, they
become guardians of a corrupt system that is a national
embarrassment.

HAGUE TRIBUNAL MAY CREATE PRECEDENT FOR REVIEWING U.S. MILITARY
ACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE: 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eighteen months ago, the Pentagon strongly opposed
a plan to create a permanent international criminal tribunal,
fearing that a strong and independent court would expose American
troops sent overseas to prosecution outside the American judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a result of NATO's air war against the Serbs last
spring, members of the American military have already undergone the
scrutiny of just such a court: the International Criminal Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia. Experts on international law say that
may create political and legal precedents for requiring Americans
to submit to international judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future the United States government feared is here sooner
than it expected,'' said Diane F. Orentlicher, the director of the
War Crimes Research Office at American University's Washington
College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has been almost obsessively afraid of how an
international criminal court will act with regard to American
soldiers,'' she added, ``and now it turns out by this unforeseen
turn of history that the international tribunal for Yugoslavia has
that jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the tribunal, in The Hague, completed an internal
report in late December that was a legal analysis of the
possibility that the NATO allies had committed war crimes during
their 78-day campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal and administration officials said there was virtually
no possibility that charges would be brought against American or
NATO personnel. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte,
went to lengths to emphasize in a statement on Thursday that there
was ``no formal inquiry into the actions of NATO during the
conflict in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither White House nor Pentagon officials disputed the
tribunal's legal authority to review American and allied
involvement in the fighting. A State Department official said there
was no question that the tribunal had such authority.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal was created by the U.N. Security Council in 1993 to
prosecute those accused of war crimes during the conflicts spawned
by the breakup of Yugoslavia, during which four of its six
republics seceded.
</P>
<P>
   When Slobodan Milosevic, the president of what remains of
Yugoslavia, ordered police and military forces to crush rebels
operating in the largely Albanian-inhabited province of Kosovo in
southern Serbia in 1998, that conflict fell under the court's
jurisdiction, too. It led to Milosevic's indictment on war crimes
charges last May.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has strongly supported the tribunal and its
work, but the idea of subordinating American sovereignty to any
international legal body remains one that some Americans find
objectionable. That has been an issue especially, though not
exclusively, among conservatives in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When delegates from more than 160 countries gathered in Rome in
July 1998 to negotiate the creation of a permanent international
criminal court, the Clinton administration strongly advocated
limiting the court's authority and independence to protect American
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pentagon leading the way, the administration contended
that American soldiers could be subject to frivolous or politically
motivated prosecutions in such a court. American negotiators
demanded provisions in the court's charter that would, in essence,
give the United States veto power over any prosecution through its
seat on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries, including strong allies like Germany, countered
that the American provisions would undermine the court, and
delegates rejected them.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 92 countries have signed the treaty creating the
court and six have ratified it. When 60 countries have ratified the
treaty, the court will come into being, possibly within two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, NATO's short-lived air strikes in the waning months
of the war in Bosnia in 1995 also fell under the Hague tribunal's
purview, but those strikes were much more limited and the issue
never came up. But NATO's air war last year included strikes across
Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics that make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, an
advocacy group in New York that has worked extensively on war
crimes issues, said NATO's more recent campaign merited legal
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the use of cluster bombs, the decision to strike
electrical grids and other targets with civilian uses and the
decision to have planes fly at high altitudes, which reduced the
risk to pilots but increased the chances of accidental bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the rest of the world, the Pentagon cannot accept the
idea that its conduct would be scrutinized by an international
tribunal,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The tribunal's review began in August after members of the
Russian parliament and legal experts met with Ms. Del Ponte's
predecessor, Louise Arbour, and urged an investigation of NATO's
role. The review summarized their charges and the legal issues
surrounding them, but stopped far short of endorsing an
investigation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the White House responded sharply. ``NATO undertook
extraordinary efforts to restrict collateral damage,'' said a
spokesman, James R. Fallin. ``Any inquiry into the conduct of its
pilots would be completely unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orentlicher of American University and other experts said
the tacit American acceptance of the Hague tribunal's jurisdiction
over American actions in the struggle over Kosovo would make it
harder for the United States to dispute the new court's authority
in future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department official said only ``a limited precedent''
would be set, since the new court would be a different legal
entity, created by treaty rather than a Security Council resolution
supported by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The political precedent could be greater. William L. Nash, a
retired Army major general who oversaw the American peacekeepers in
Bosnia in 1995 and 1996, said the tribunal was showing that it was
fair-minded enough not to rule out investigations of NATO but also
that it would not rush to prosecute NATO to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics of the court may see this is not all bad,'' said
Nash, now the director of civilian-military programs at the
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon would not discuss questions of whether any
precedent was being set, but a Defense Department official said the
Pentagon remained adamantly opposed to any external jurisdiction
over the American military, regardless of the tribunal's
jurisdiction in this case.

PATAKI PROPOSING A HUDSON RIVER RESEARCH INSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki announced Sunday that he would propose
establishing a 500-employee research institute to study the Hudson
River, an initiative that several environmental leaders said could
represent a significant milestone in the decades-long struggle to
restore the river.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that the center, to be called the Henry Hudson
Institute for Riverine and Estuarine Research and Education, would
be modeled after the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of oceans, you think of Woods Hole,'' Pataki
said in an interview. ``We think we have the potential to do the
same when you think about the Hudson River and estuaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Previewing part of his state of the state address on Wednesday,
Pataki said he would propose spending up to $1 million this year
for a task force that would address such questions as where the
institute would be located, how it would be financed and who would
control its operations and research. The financing would have to be
authorized by the state Legislature. But Pataki said that he hoped
the institute would be up and running in five to 10 years, with an
annual operating budget of about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Woods Hole has 850 employees and an annual budget
of $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``An idea like this has been discussed for 30 years and never
gotten anywhere,'' said John Cronin, chief advocate of Riverkeeper
Inc., a nonprofit conservation group that closely monitors the
Hudson River. ``This is the first time a governor has proposed
this, which is why I think it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin said that debates over the pace of industrial and
residential development along the Hudson are perpetually bogged
down by the absence of credible, independent research on the river.
``What we don't know about the Hudson is a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a major research institute unbeholden to either industry or
public interest groups, Cronin suggested, this void could be
filled, helping to shape development along the river. Pataki's
initiative, he added, comes at a time when there is an
``unprecedented push'' to reindustrialize the Hudson basin,
particularly by utility companies hoping to build power plants
along the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a substantial, bold proposal,'' Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, said he was proposing the institute as a
way to build on the advances already made in cleaning up the
Hudson, once a struggling ecosystem with a river bottom despoiled
by industrial wastes along much of its 275 nautical miles. While
the Hudson is cleaner than it has been in decades, parts of it are
still contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs,
cancer-causing industrial chemicals that were dumped for many years
by factories in the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made tremendous progress with our environmental
initiatives,'' Pataki said. ``We were thinking, `What's the next
step?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The governor said he rejected an idea to start with a small
teaching center, or perhaps an aquarium, and instead urged his
environmental aides to ``take it to the largest possible vision of
what we could have.'' While the state would most likely pay a major
part of the cost, private foundations, colleges and the federal
government might also be asked to contribute, aides to the governor
said. Pataki has designated John P. Cahill, commissioner of the
state's Department of Environmental Conservation, to flesh out the
details.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the revival of the Hudson ``an incredible opportunity
economically,'' the governor said that the proposed institute could
expand and coordinate existing research efforts and provide a firm
foundation of science for tapping the Hudson's economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be looking to the future and that requires academic
research,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he added, a ``world-class and world-renowned''
science center focusing solely on rivers and estuaries could yield
important research results with broader benefits for environmental
policy makers across the country. While there are several
well-respected oceanographic research centers like Woods Hole and
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, which lies
on the Hudson, Pataki said that rivers and estuaries had gotten
less attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think it is an unbelievable opportunity and the time
is right,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Sullivan, executive director of Scenic Hudson, an
environmental and land trust organization, said Pataki's plan had
the potential ``to significantly and dramatically expand the amount
of scientific research'' into the Hudson, which, he added, remains
at risk both from contaminated sediments and a new generation of
power plants. Such plants kill fish by drawing them into their
intakes, along with cooling water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is particularly long-sighted of the governor to propose
establishing an institute that could build a baseline of data about
the condition of the river,'' he said, ``so that citizens and
policy makers can work together to set long-term goals for
improving the quality of the river, cleaning up the toxic threats
and restoring the fisheries that have been suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project holds real promise for realizing the full
potential of the Hudson River.''
</P>
<P>
   One crucial area for the institute, he said, will be setting
priorities for research _ and doing so without undue influence from
corporations and developement companies that might be affected by
the results. ``I can't imagine that happening on Governor Pataki's
watch,'' he said. ``He's really been the greatest champion of the
Hudson we've ever had.''

AFTER A LAUGHABLE SEASON, A FEW COACHES CAN SMILE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Mike Holmgren walked toward the middle
of Giants Stadium on Sunday after his team had been tripped, 19-9,
by the Jets, mumbled something to the Jets coaches, and walked
away, unsure where his final steps would lead. He made his way to
the locker room, to his players, and told them they were lousy in
execution but great in effort.
</P>
<P>
   Then Holmgren did what plenty of football fans did Sunday
afternoon _ he plopped in front of a TV and sorted through the menu
of games that would decide which teams were in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's particular fare was Oakland at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, with a chance to clinch a playoff berth, had just
bombed. But now Kansas City was slipping, too. For Seattle, there
was hope.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren finally emerged and conducted his postgame press
conference. He talked about his team ``maybe wanting the game too
much,'' and ``this was a big game Sunday and only a few guys in
that locker room have ever played in a game like this,'' and how
against the Jets his Seahawks ``couldn't make the big play,'' and
``we're young in some places,'' and ``we're going to evaluate
everything, the whole program, because we were too inconsistent,''
and that he ``was proud of his team,'' and that it had ``taken a
good step.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure sounded like a season-ending, see-you-later, swan song.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he bolted back to watch the Kansas City game. It was
tense, and Holmgren, who said he could only watch so much, went and
took a shower.
</P>
<P>
   Later he was told that the Raiders were gaining momentum. And
soon they won, 41-38, in overtime against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A hearty roar erupted from the Seattle closed-door coaches'
room, matching anything the more than 60,000 fans in Giants Stadium
had offered all day.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the door swung open and Holmgren, his face flushed red as
a stop light, appeared. Time for a post-postgame news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was in.
</P>
<P>
   Any sense of embarrassment, remarkably, was out.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-Kansas City tango for first place in the American
Football Conference West illustrated the frustration and
high-strung play that was often featured this season. A bushel of
sometimes laughable teams absolutely folded under the enormous
weight and pressure of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the final weeks of the regular season, several
teams that controlled their playoff destiny collapsed. Pressure?
Choke? Holes exposed? Parity?
</P>
<P>
   All are factors, but regardless, the playoff field is set, with
the Jacksonville Jaguars earning home-field advantage throughout
the AFC playoffs and the St. Louis Rams owning that treat in the
NFC.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of stressed-out teams in the playoff field.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Lions enter the postseason having lost their last
four games, including Sunday, by 24-17 to the Minnesota Vikings.
Detroit takes that extra burden with it to play in Washington. The
Miami Dolphins have limped in. Dallas could not beat horrible New
Orleans a week earlier, but finally reached the postseason by
taming the Giants on Sunday. Only two NFC teams _ St. Louis and
Tampa Bay _ have 11 or more victories.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle began the season with an 8-2 record; it could win only
one of its last six games, yet it is playoff bound. It lost to the
Jets on Sunday and, simultaneously, stunningly, won a division
title, a playoff berth and a home wild-card playoff game in one
swoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out and play these games and you forget sometimes that
nobody is guaranteed to win,'' Seattle linebacker Darrin Smith
said. ``You might even be the better team, but it doesn't matter
how good you are if you don't play your best ball. This is what
happened to us. You look at teams like the Jets and Denver, they
were Super Bowl favorites but fell on hard times early. But in the
last few weeks, those teams have ironed out their problems and are
playing good ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very fine line between all of these teams, and that
makes it a fine line between getting in and being out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of what determines the playoff field is heart and will.
Some of it is luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck no,'' Holmgren responded when someone asked him, before
Seattle was in, if he would feel embarrassed entering the field
through the back door. ``That would be wonderful. We'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, once his his team had qualified, he added: ``At first I
felt really sad for our guys. But now we have a second chance to
show that we are a better football team than we've been lately. And
I am really proud of that. I believe we will show it.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 12 playoff teams, a second and third and even
fourth chance was required to get in. But what a difference between
being in and being out.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs provide a new game, a new season. Each entrant
might as well be 0-0 after this far-flung, circuitous chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's beauty in that, isn't there?'' Seattle linebacker Chad
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, comedy, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Many Miami Dolphins players and coaches spent
early Sunday afternoon staring at the television while sprawled
about a stadium lounge in the bowels of FedEx Field, and they were
not watching cartoons. Miami needed help from other teams in other
games to get into the playoffs, and their coming contest against
Washington was basically irrelevant to those postseason dreams. So
it was understandable that coach Jimmy Johnson was snuggled up to
the set as if he was watching home videos.
</P>
<P>
   Miami needed for either Seattle to lose to the Jets or for
Kansas City to lose to Oakland in early games to get in. Both
things happened, and the Dolphins knew they were in the playoffs
before taking the field against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (9-7) will play at Seattle, giving Johnson his third
straight trip to the playoffs as coach of the Dolphins. The
Redskins (10-6) have a home game against Detroit on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But as Miami's 21-10 loss to the Redskins before 78,106 showed,
the Dolphins are a team with numerous problems. They make mental
errors, like the two first-quarter turnovers in Washington
territory. Quarterback Dan Marino's arm isn't what it used to be.
Footballs leave his hand with all the velocity of a Wiffleball
leaving a plastic bat. And questions about the futures of Marino
and Johnson are discussed daily by the news media, causing both
men, as well as players, giant ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have long been a stable organization and have
rarely faced such possible upheaval. Johnson, its football guru,
may permanently depart, go sailing and disappear, and Marino, the
franchise thrower who has a reservation in the Hall of Fame, may
retire after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dolphins have crawled into the playoffs. After
starting the year 7-1, Miami lost six of its last eight games. Now
the team must travel to Seattle, where its playoff fortunes seem
equally dim. Miami's last road playoff victory was 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course everybody talks about us backing into the
playoffs,'' Johnson said. ``It's a simple deal. If you win enough
games, you get in. We won enough games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins played this game perfectly, giving plenty of
effort, toning the offense and then pulling key starters early in
the third quarter, including Brad Johnson, who went 7 of 11 passing
for 75 yards. With running back Stephen Davis nursing an injured
knee, the backup Skip Hicks got the call and often plowed through
the Dolphins. His 8-yard touchdown run gave Washington a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miami played horribly on offense. The Dolphins managed only a
39-yard field goal by Olindo Mare in the first half. Twice they
were able to get drives going, only to stop themselves. The first
turnover came when wide receiver Kevin McKenzie was stripped of the
football inside the Washington 30-yard line by safety Darryl
Pounds, who also recovered the ball. The second happened when a
Marino pass was tipped in the secondary by cornerback Tim Denton,
and the 5-foot-7-inch cornerback Mark McMillian outjumped everyone
and plucked the wobbly ball out of the sky. Marino finished 11 for
24 passing for 118 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins added a 30-yard touchdown pass from the backup
Rodney Peete to wide receiver Irving Fryar and led by 14-3 at the
beginning of the fourth quarter. By then, Johnson had pulled Marino
for Damon Huard, who finished 18 for 29 passing for 162 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself was not the most intriguing part of the day. The
Dolphins have more story lines than a busy night in the theater
district. The most compelling is what may happen to Johnson, Marino
or both.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, flew Marino's family to
the game, which is unusual. The speculation was that the family
wanted to be present just in case this was Marino's final game.
Marino, however, said that the trip was ``planned a while back''
and that there was no special significance.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought that this might be his last
regular-season game, Marino replied: ``I've been asked that
question and I'm tired of answering it. You never know when your
last game is going to be. Who knows what your future is going to
hold?''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the Redskins. Unless the team
advances far into the playoffs, the owner, Daniel Snyder, will most
likely ask coach Norv Turner to dismiss some members from his
defensive staff. Washington has spent much of the season ranked
near the bottom in almost every defensive category.
</P>
<P>
   But right now the Redskins are not thinking about that. They're
in. That's all that matters, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Jon Jansen was asked if the Redskins could
reach the Super Bowl. ``Sure, why not?'' he said. ``It's going to
be somebody, why not us?''

NEW TRIAL TO BEGIN IN LOUIMA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Justin Volpe told a federal judge last month
that a fellow police officer had been wrongly convicted of helping
him brutalize Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house, he cast
renewed doubt on whether the legal system had identified the right
man as his accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   The second trial stemming from the attack opens Monday, and it
may help shed light on the issue: Was it Charles Schwarz who held
Louima down as he was attacked in a station-house bathroom with a
broken broomstick _ as the government claims and the jury found, by
convicting him? Or was the accomplice another officer, Thomas
Wiese, as Volpe now maintains? Or did Volpe act alone on Aug. 9,
1997, as lawyers for the defendants in the second trial have said?
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the new federal trial is about an alleged conspiracy
to cover up the crime that formed the basis of the first trial,
which ended in June. The second trial is to determine whether
Schwarz, Wiese and another officer, Thomas Bruder, obstructed
justice shortly after the assault by concocting a story for
investigators to get Schwarz off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   In the first trial, Wiese and Bruder were both acquitted of
charges that they had beaten Louima in a patrol car en route to the
station house and had conspired to assault him in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who, if anyone, helped brutalize Louima is
crucial because the single charge in the case accuses Wiese, Bruder
and Schwarz of obstructing justice by conspiring to cover up
Charles Schwarz's role _ an allegation that would seem to require
first proving that Schwarz was, indeed, involved.
</P>
<P>
   If Schwarz was not in the bathroom that night, the government
would apparently have little ammunition against the three
defendants. If Wiese was there, there is a chance, albeit slim,
that federal prosecutors would charge him in the assault. And if
Volpe was there alone, then the notorious attack, which blackened
the eye of the New York Police Department for months, could be
written off as the work of one aberrant, troubled officer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, where the trial will be
held, has repeatedly refused to comment on its planned strategy.
But the evidence presented against Schwarz in the first trial was,
in part, circumstantial and was based on the testimony of two
officers from the 70th Precinct who said they had seen Schwarz
leading Louima toward the bathroom, but not into it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officers, Detective Eric Turetzky, testified that he
had seen Schwarz take Louima, still handcuffed and with his pants
and underwear around his knees, from the front desk of the station
house down a dead-end hallway that leads to the bathroom. The
second officer, Mark Schofield, recounted seeing Schwarz leading
the prisoner toward the hallway but not down it.
</P>
<P>
   But the most direct evidence placing Schwarz in the bathroom
that night was far from clear. Louima testified that the officer
who had beaten and held him down _ whom prosecutors identified as
Schwarz _ was the same officer who had driven the patrol car that
had brought Louima to the station house.
</P>
<P>
   Although police records show that Schwarz was behind the wheel,
Louima gave confusing accounts of the identity of the driver during
his cross-examination and was never able to identify Schwarz as the
second attacker, even though he unflinchingly picked out Volpe as
the first.
</P>
<P>
   An additional piece of evidence was used successfully against
Schwarz, but it, too, has been contested. In the first trial,
records were introduced showing that Schwarz had made a six-minute
call to Volpe from a pay phone hours after Internal Affairs
investigators first descended on the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution argued that this phone call was a smoking gun,
suggesting that a panicked Schwarz ran to a phone to tell Volpe
that Internal Affairs was already onto them.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiese, a precinct union delegate at the time, claims that he
had borrowed Schwarz's phone card and had placed the call himself
to warn Volpe that a police investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most damaging to Schwarz was the fact that two people
who could have testified that he was not in the bathroom at all
that night were never heard from at the first trial.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Volpe, who pleaded guilty in midtrial. He was
never called as a witness, because Schwarz's lawyer in the first
trial, Stephen Worth, assumed that the jury would not believe
Volpe, who had damaged his credibility by confessing his guilt
after denying it for 21 months. Volpe, who was sentenced to 30
years in prison, is expected to testify on Schwarz's behalf at the
second trial.
</P>
<P>
   The other witness who could have exculpated Schwarz was Wiese.
Early in the investigation, Wiese told the Brooklyn district
attorney's office that he walked in on Volpe moments after the
assault and saw him _ alone, with a stick in his hand _ standing
over an inert and sobbing Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements, however, were ruled irrelevant to the assault
charges at the first trial and were kept from the jury. But now the
prosecution is using the same statements as the basis for its
contention that Wiese lied about what he had seen to exonerate
Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three defendants has much to lose in this round of
prosecution, though none more than Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   If he is found guilty, he faces a five-year prison term. But
more important, a guilty verdict would probably weaken his chances
of successfully appealing his conviction in the first trial, for
which he faces life in prison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ronald Fischetti, Schwarz's current lawyer, has said he plans to
use the second trial to lay the groundwork for an appeal of the
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese and Bruder seem to have less at stake, because they were
acquitted at the first trial. Still, both men face five years in
prison if convicted of the obstruction charges.
</P>
<P>
   The second trial is Wiese's first opportunity to rebut in court
_ if he chooses to testify _ Volpe's claims that Wiese witnessed
the attack on Louima but did nothing about it. He did not testify
at the first trial.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Wiese has maintained, through his lawyers, that
he walked into the bathroom at the end of the incident, and that
Volpe acted alone. Moreover, the government itself has openly
scoffed at the accusations against him by Volpe and his lawyer,
Marvyn Kornberg, saying neither man is trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder seems to have the most straightforward role in the second
trial. He has repeatedly claimed, through his lawyers, that he saw
Volpe escorting Louima into the bathroom on the night of the
assault and that he saw Wiese standing outside the bathroom door.
</P>
<P>
   By maintaining that Schwarz was never in the bathroom, he has
placed himself in opposition to the government's version of events.

<P>
   Much of the e-commerce industry wants a new tax loophole: an
exemption from taxes on goods and services sold over the Internet
and on fees paid for access to the Internet. At stake in this
debate is not just money, but political power.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses that sell only in cyberspace, a tax-free Internet
would be a bonanza, offsetting the costs of shipping goods. But
under existing rules, companies that sell both in stores and on the
Web _ so-called clicks-and-mortar enterprises _ must collect sales
taxes on their Internet sales, putting them at a significant
competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes are the single largest source of revenue for state
and local governments, raising $189 billion in 1998. For states
like Texas and Tennessee, which have no personal income tax, sales
taxes are critical to paying for police, fire, schools and other
government services. E-commerce grew fourfold this past holiday
season, compared with a year earlier, and as it expands the loss of
sales tax receipts could create serious budget problems for many
states.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a tax-free Internet has opened a debate that has
been confined so far to warring factions of conservative
Republicans. One faction includes Gov. James S. Gilmore III of
Virginia, chairman of the Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce, created by Congress to study Internet taxation. Gilmore
wants to make up for potential lost sales tax revenues by having
Washington redistribute some of its revenues to the states in the
form of grants.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, another
conservative Republican with a long history as a tax cutter, says
that such a move would simply increase power in Washington while
undermining the state-and-local principles that helped his party
gain control of Congress in the 1994 elections.

   Co.'s Secrecy Inspires Guessing
</P>
<P>
   Several times in each of the last few decades, Silicon Valley
has been home to a truly big gamble. In 1984, the Apple Macintosh
transformed the computer industry, but other high-stakes wagers
like the Amiga or Go Corp. have fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the valley's big gambles have failed for
setting goals that proved far too ambitious. In the early 1980s
there was Trilogy, a premature effort to build an ultrafast
mainframe computer. In the early 1990s, Microunity caught the
valley's imagination with a microprocessor intended to be the
standard for interactive cable systems, which failed to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In today's valley, bored with me-too Internet start-ups, much of
the buzz is about Transmeta, a microprocessor design company in
Sunnyvale, Calif. Transmeta has so far managed to keep its product,
scheduled to be introduced on Jan. 19, a secret.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has touched off wide-ranging speculation. The
company is said to have close ties to IBM, and Microsoft's
co-founder, Paul Allen, is apparently an investor. Linus Torvalds,
designer of the Linux operating system, is working at Transmeta,
and though he says Linux has little to do with his Transmeta job,
his presence has caused a great deal of beard-scratching.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent patents suggest the company has found a way both
to simplify processor circuitry and to accelerate the running of
instructions on other chips, like Intel's.
</P>
<P>
   But Transmeta's founder, David Ditzel, recently warned reporters
not to place too much stock in the patents. Instead, he has hinted
at development of a low-power microprocessor _ the computer
industry's new Holy Grail. Portable wireless computers are widely
believed to be the wave of the future and a chip that consumes less
power will obviously have a significant advantage. &QL;

   Music Industry Faces A Digital Reckoning
</P>
<P>
   For the players in the digital music industry, this year may
feel like a marathon poker game. The growing consumer interest in
downloading and listening to music online is good news for the
various types of companies that already have seats at the table.
But all will face decisions on which hands to play and which to
fold.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like MP3.com and Garageband.com, are betting
that they can give music away for free, in the MP3 technical
format, and survive on Web-based advertising. Others, like Virgin
Jamcast and Yahoo Digital, intend to charge consumers who want to
download and store songs; but the success of that model will depend
on how consumer friendly and copyright secure each of a handful of
competing downloading technologies turns out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, record companies like Seagram's Universal Music Group
and EMI Records are gambling that their deliberate pace of putting
music online _ a tentative approach meant to protect their
intellectual property _ will not erode their influence over the
music business. They must also decide how much promotional material
to give away without raising expectations that music will be free.
</P>
<P>
   Offline, consumer electronics makers, including Sony Electronics
and Creative Labs, are betting on a new generation of digital
portable devices similar to the Diamond Multimedia Rio 500. But
questions persist: at what price and in what form will most
consumers find digital music players an attractive alternative to
the Sony Walkman or Discman? And will lingering copyright questions
and the high cost of flash-memory cards for storing portable music
inhibit the market's growth?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, traditional bricks-and-mortar music retailers,
including Wherehouse Records, are hoping they can compete
effectively against online music sellers by adding their own
Internet offerings.
</P>
<P>
   With a generation of college-age listeners flocking online _ and
their younger siblings certain to follow _ this game entails high
risks, but potentially high rewards. For the rest of us, the
competitive cacophony should make for lively listening.

   True Believers Push Satellite Telephones
</P>
<P>
   The satellite telephone business has two strikes against it, but
that has not stopped some entrepreneurs and investors from betting
that the next multibillion-dollar swing for the fences will indeed
produce a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Now at bat: Globalstar Telecommunications, which is controlled
by Loral Space and Communications. Globalstar is just starting to
introduce its service _ a $3.3 billion system of 48 satellites
designed to provide telephone calls nearly anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Iridium LLC, which has been offering a similar
service, failed to attract nearly as many customers as it needed
and was plunged into bankruptcy, forcing its main backer, Motorola
, to write off $2.3 billion. Two weeks later, ICO Global
Communications, another contender, which had not yet launched its
satellites, filed for bankruptcy protection after failing to raise
additional money from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such setbacks, Globalstar's stock surged to a 52-week
high last month. Many investors appear to be betting that Iridium
failed because of its own design and marketing mistakes rather than
a fundamental lack of demand for satellite telephones. Globalstar's
chance of success should be evident in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest personal bet on satellite telephones is being
made by Craig O. McCaw, the billionaire cellular telephone pioneer.
In November, McCaw agreed to raise $1.2 billion to bring ICO out of
bankruptcy. He is also reported to be looking at investing in or
buying Iridium. And if those are not enough billion-dollar bets to
sate his gambling appetite, he still has Teledesic, a proposed $10
billion system to provide Internet service using 288 satellites,
starting around 2004.

   One Step Forward, One Back For Internet Names Panel
</P>
<P>
   In a world of jealous nation-states and cutthroat geopolitics,
the odds of transforming the Internet into a self-governing
institution might seem long. But that is the bet the Clinton
administration placed in creating the Internet Corp. for Assigned
Names and Numbers, and 2000 will likely determine the future of
Internet self-governance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of 1999 was rocky for Icann, the nonprofit group picked by
the Commerce Department at the end of 1998 to assume administration
of the Internet's addressing system. It cleared a major hurdle in
November, when Network Solutions, the company that had been granted
a government-blessed monopoly in the lucrative business of
registering dot-com names, finally agreed to open the market to
competition and to recognize Icann's authority.
</P>
<P>
   But within days, it suffered a major setback when Congress
usurped Icann's first attempt at policy making _ the creation of
international rules for settling disputes involving
``cybersquatters.'' These are speculators who register domain names
using established trademarks, then attempt to force the trademark
owners to pay large sums for rights to the domain names.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporate trademark holders persuaded Congress to give them
stronger protections, and while the White House said the bill would
interfere with Icann's international authority, it was enacted as a
last-minute attachment to the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   So as 2000 unfolds, Icann and its interim president, Mike
Roberts, find themselves struggling to win recognition of Icann's
authority not just from governments around the world but from the
government that created it.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Icann must form a membership that gives more than
big business a voice in its policy making and find an efficient way
to finance itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking,'' Roberts said. &QL;

   `E-Conversion' Paying Early Dividends at Oracle
</P>
<P>
   In June, Lawrence J. Ellison, the chairman of Oracle Corp.,
announced that the company would reinvent itself as an e-business _
a company that uses the power of the Internet in every aspect of
its operations. He set a goal of reducing annual costs by $1
billion in 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many analysts brushed off the announcement as more
hyperbole from a chief executive known for the same. But as the
months passed, it became clear that Ellison was putting his money
where his mouth is _ and reaping some early returns on the
investment. In the quarter ended Nov. 30, Oracle exceeded Wall
Street's earnings estimates, in large part because of a 5.5 percent
gain in profit margin that the company attributed to cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we think we can continue as we convert to an
e-business,'' Jeff Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the savings are obvious. Oracle will convert 60
nation-specific corporate data systems scattered around the globe
to one system, to be housed at the company headquarters and
accessible via the World Wide Web. The company estimates $200
million a year in savings from that move alone. Executives say they
can trim the $500 million annual travel bill by 10 percent just by
using a Web-based application from eTravel, a company Oracle
acquired last year for $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger shifts will take longer and represent greater gambles _
but they could also pay even bigger returns. For example, Oracle
recently announced plans to sell its software over the Web at
standardized prices. That will, for the first time, make its
products accessible to small businesses, a market the company has
long overlooked. &QL;

   A Merger Sets Off An Information Rush
</P>
<P>
   The merger last year of Doubleclick and Abacus Direct was the
first official marriage of companies that gathered information
about people's activities online and offline. Doubleclick, which
serves advertisements on thousands of Internet sites and monitors
users' activities on those sites, could suddenly combine that
information with catalog purchases tracked by Abacus.
</P>
<P>
   Previously Doubleclick had ignored the personal identity of Web
surfers, but by using information about users' offline purchases,
it can charge higher ad rates. Since the merger was announced in
June, Internet advertising companies have forged ahead with efforts
to identify people on Web sites, find out more about their offline
lives, and show them ads that match that information.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates denounce the practice, saying that it gives
companies too much information about individuals. They point to the
laundry list of information that offline companies gather _
including data on hobbies, home values and stock portfolios, to
name a few _ and note that Internet companies will be sifting
through that data even as they watch users surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The ad networks insist that such practices benefit Internet
users by giving them more relevant advertisements. Besides, they
say, users can, with a few clicks of a mouse, choose not to have
personal information gathered about them. But privacy advocates
argue that users should not have to lift a finger to protect
themselves against what they regard as intrusive behavior, and 2000
could be the year that the administration and Congress push
legislation to address those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doubleclick had a good profiling model, which they used to
deliver targeted messages for advertisers and still protect the
user's privacy,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center. ``But once they crossed the
line with Abacus and said, `Here are where the big bucks are,' they
also took a big gamble, because that's where the big privacy battle
is. And when the clock ticks on industry self-regulation, they may
have a very big problem on their hands.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ By midafternoon Sunday, only an essential core of
employees remained inside New York's emergency management center,
the lookout post for Year 2000 computer catastrophes. Some were
watching the Jets game.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the transition to the year 2000 was going so smoothly
that at 6 p.m., Jerome M. Hauer, the director of the mayor's Office
of Emergency Management, shut down the command center for the
night. ``From our perspective, things have gone well,'' Hauer said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the bunker, as the command center on the
23rd floor of the World Trade Center is known, would reopen with a
full staff at 6 a.m. Monday, ready to react to a belated New Year's
crisis if employees returning from the holiday weekend encounter
problems when they boot up their computers. But they also said that
the reactivation was intended more as a precaution and that they
did not expect any significant trouble. ``We have to be cautious
until we get through a normal work day,'' Hauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also stressed that the signs were encouraging.
After reviewing the results of a weekend of exhaustive computer
testing, Brian T. Cohen, director of the city's Year 2000 project
office, predicted a normal workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agencies have been testing their systems all weekend long,''
Cohen said. ``Everything has gone through the testing with flying
colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports from utility and transportation officials were also
upbeat. For example, the only New Year's-related power failure in
New York City occurred when a foil party balloon in Queens rose and
struck some wires, blacking out 151 customers for 58 minutes on
Friday night, said Joseph Petta, a spokesman for Con Edison, the
utility company.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, emergency workers said they would be ready Monday
morning for almost any surprises. Hauer said nearly all of the 114
work stations in the center would be occupied by representatives
from the city, the state and the federal governments, as well as by
officials from banks and the securities and utility industries.
</P>
<P>
   Should any large-scale computer problems occur, officials said,
the city will be ready to apply quick fixes. For example, a
stockpile of $750,000 worth of spare parts set aside for Year 2000
computer repairs remained in a store room in the city's computer
center in Brooklyn on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While city officials said it was too early to say that no
computer repairs would be needed in the days ahead, they emphasized
that it was increasingly evident that something remarkable had been
accomplished: After years of dire predictions and costly work, the
city's systems had held up.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two-thirds of the employees had left the command
center Sunday, and some of those who remained were watching the
fourth quarter of the Jets-Seahawks game, Cohen summed up the
situation as he saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly,'' he said, ``I think that Y2K is over.''

PLAYING TO FORM, GIANTS STUMBLE TO THE FINISH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ There was a certain air of hopelessness about
the Giants from beginning to end Sunday, despondency coupled with a
dazed bewilderment, an aura of despair that pursues the team into
the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys' 26-18 victory at Texas Stadium was just the
final act in a spiritless, daylong dissolution for the Giants. It
began with the Green Bay Packers' defeat of the Arizona Cardinals
in an early-afternoon game, a result that all but mathematically
eliminated the Giants from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Giants knew as they took the field that they could
still make the playoffs with an 81-point victory. Then they kicked
off to start the game.
</P>
<P>
   And Dallas returned the kick 79 yards to set up the game's first
score. The Cowboys (8-8) scored often and early, sprinting to a
16-0 halftime lead and then cruising to a victory that earned them
the final National Football Conference wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that could have been a metaphor for their season, the
Giants (7-9) started slowly, peaked at the midpoint, then stumbled
badly to the finish. They also did not play with aggression,
confidence or any of the mettle requested of them by the team
co-owner Wellington Mara, who uncharacteristically addressed the
club last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who had once been a first-place team with a 5-3
record, closed their season with a 2-6 second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lots of high hopes,'' safety Sam Garnes said. ``And
then we went straight down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first losing season under Coach Jim Fassel, who did
not scold or admonish his players in the locker room after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they gave it everything they had,'' he said. ``We
weren't good enough. It hurts because we're used to winning at the
end around here. But it characterizes the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a shell of a team right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara was in the locker room after the game as he normally is but
declined to make any comment.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and the Giants were aware of the Packers score as they
began the game, though few admitted it affected their play.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Percy Ellsworth, however, conceded the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only human nature,'' he said. ``You're going to be a
little down when you know you're out of it. Everybody tried, but
yeah, there was disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players acknowledged another obvious and likely outcome
of Sunday's game and a failed season _ that changes will be made in
the team's makeup. The specifics of those changes weren't discussed
and several players said they thought the team had been forced to
overcome a particularly onerous succession of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be some changes, but honestly, we've been
a patchwork team for a long time,'' said defensive end Michael
Strahan, who had another quiet game. ``We stood in there and
fought. It's very frustrating because no one goes to training camp
and does all that work to finish one game worse than last year's
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one goes to training camp and says, `This guy is only
going to play five games,' and `This guy from the practice squad is
going to play 10 games.' You don't expect those things either.''
</P>
<P>
   From the opening kickoff Sunday, it took no more than a few
seconds to figure out which team had something to play for and
which team did not. Dallas' Jason Tucker slipped the tackle attempt
of Garnes just after taking the opening kickoff and then raced 79
yards to the Giants 11-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Three rushing attempts by the Cowboys failed to get the ball in
the end zone, but when Dallas' Eddie Murray kicked a 20-yard field
goal, the rout was on even if it was just 3-0 and just 2 minutes
and 18 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the Giants first possession, the flat, disjointed attack that
would typify their offensive effort for most of the game was
obvious, and it was equally obvious that Giants Coach Jim Fassel
was not going to approach the game with a nothing-to-lose attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In eight plays, the Giants moved to the Cowboys 36-yard line,
where they faced a fourth-and-five. Fassel did not elect to go for
it, instead punting _ a maneuver that gained 16 yards when the punt
became a touchback.
</P>
<P>
   On their next possession, the Cowboys had little trouble moving
through the Giants defense again, though they again stalled at the
Giants goal line and settled for another Murray field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the Giants defense, they were playing without
nearly half their starting lineup. Linebacker Jessie Armstead was
on the sideline for long stretches of the first half resting his
sore right knee and so was defensive tackle Christian Peter, who
missed much of the first half with dizziness and a rapid heart
beat, and defensive end Cedric Jones, who has a tender knee.
</P>
<P>
   Two other starters from the beginning of the season were also
out of the game: cornerbacks Jason Sehorn and Phillippi Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   And the Giants defense certainly wasn't getting a lift from the
team's offense, which was moving the ball but barely threatening to
score. Collins would throw for 314 yards, completing 31 of 48
passes but did not have a touchdown pass until the game's final
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Joe Montgomery had just 36 rushing yards on 12
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, meanwhile, was picking apart the
Giants pass defense, which seemed not only a step slow but passive
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Cowboys first touchdown, a 4-yard second-quarter
touchdown pass from Aikman to Raghib Ismail. Ismail, split to the
right, ran a crossing route underneath the heart of the Giants
defense, passing a Giants safety and two linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   No one touched, nudged or tried to impede Ismail, who caught the
pass from Aikman as he stood at the goal line. Aikman completed 23
of 32 passes for 288 yards and two touchdowns. Dallas' Emmitt Smith
ran for 122 yards on 22 rushing attempts.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the Cowboys had padded their lead to 16-0 with
another Murray field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants hardly seemed intent on mounting a serious
second-half threat. With the first possession following
intermission, the Giants gained 2 yards in three plays and gave the
ball back to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   After a Giants field goal midway through the third quarter,
Dallas put the game away for good when Aikman connected with Tucker
on a quick slant pattern in front of Giants cornerback Jeremy
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker caught the ball at the Cowboys' 17-yard line, spinning
away from Lincoln, who made a poor, one-armed effort at a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker then raced 90 yards up the left sideline for the
touchdown that sealed Dallas' victory.
</P>
<P>
   A 71-yard pass from Giants quarterback Kerry Collins to wide
receiver Joe Jurevicius set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Joe
Montgomery early in the fourth quarter, but the fans inside Texas
Stadium were already celebrating their unforeseen good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't very mature today,'' Collins later said. ``I don't
know, maybe that's what we have to learn from all this.''

ASIAN EXCHANGES USHER IN SMOOTH START TO CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The first worldwide trading day of 2000 opened without
difficulty Monday morning at stock exchanges in Hong Kong,
Singapore and Malaysia, reassuring market officials that the global
market is coping with the computer-related hurdles that arrived
with the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic trading systems at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
and the Chicago Board of Trade, which handle trades in futures and
options, also opened for business Sunday night without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The computer and communication systems that handle financial
transactions _ stock trades, interbank payments, credit-card
transactions _ had all been tested successfully throughout the
weekend in preparation for Monday's opening bells. Indeed, some
small stock exchanges in the Middle East conducted weekend trading
without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Financial executives caution that problems could emerge in weeks
or even months, with attention now focusing on how well computers
handle Feb. 29, a leap-year anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   But even with two major markets, in Tokyo and London, closed
until Tuesday because of scheduled holidays, Monday is nevertheless
the first major stress test of how well the world's financial
software is handling years that begin with 2.
</P>
<P>
   And as of Sunday night, key international banking systems seemed
to be functioning normally, said Joseph Pawelczyk, vice president
of systems development at the New York Clearing House, which
handles transactions for 78 international banks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were there any reports of problems in foreign currency
trading. Peter Trager, the chief foreign-exchange trader at Fleet
Boston Financial, said that while Far Eastern trading was off to a
slow start, ``everything seems to be working fine.'' He and other
traders emphasized, however, that they would be more than usually
cautious about dealing with small banks or unknown customers until
confidence grew.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals trading online through U.S. brokerage firms seemed
calm but cautious Sunday night, and online trading volume Sunday
was low but largely trouble-free.
</P>
<P>
   The non-Internet economy seemed to be taking the date change in
stride. The manufacturing plants in the United States that are
clients of EDS Corp. started up Sunday night without serious
problems with computer-controlled systems, according to Reed Byrum,
a spokesman for EDS, which had been monitoring client operations in
55 countries through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card transactions also moved smoothly _ although there
were alarmed calls after the manager of a steak house in St. Louis
told diners he could not accept credit cards because the restaurant
was unable to process the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the restaurant's credit-card processing
terminal had been unplugged, said Linda Locke, a spokeswoman for
MasterCard.

POLITICAL FUROR OVER MOVING OF HUNGARY'S CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS spelling of ``Esterhayzs'' in 20th graf; CLARIFIES that
Carter had crown returned in 24th graf; CORRECTS spelling of Attila

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ And now, said Hungary one day late: Let the
millennial celebrations begin.
</P>
<P>
   Not the worldwide ones, but rather those marking 1,000 years
since Hungary became a nation. And what a nation: a windswept
battlefield settled by Siberian horsemen on the doorstep of Europe,
a vast plain whose borders have always been up for grabs, a history
of angry subjugation at the hands of Ottomans, Austrians and
Soviets, a disenfranchised nobility scattered across the globe, and
all of it linked by a language whose only living relative _ and not
a close one at that _ is Finnish.
</P>
<P>
   And the only nation on earth whose nationhood historically
resided in a crown. Not in a crowned head nor an imperial line, and
not remotely in the consent of the governed nor in any sceptered
isle, but in the physical lump of bejeweled gold itself: the sacred
crown of St. Stephen, presented to him by Pope Sylvester II exactly
1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy lies the pillow that wears the crown _ because the
simple act of moving it has split the Hungarian nation.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of this new millennium, in a glorious
procession fraught with pomp and armored cars, that venerable crown
with the pearl tassels, the rainbow of icons and the bent cross was
transferred from a small room in the national museum to the ornate
rotunda of the spectacular houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1945, we protected this crown from both the fascists and
the eastern dangers,'' intoned Jozsef Vitez, the last surviving
member of the old Crown Guards, looking resplendent in his historic
hussar's uniform but a bit bowed beneath its heavy shako. ``I am
handing it over to you _ guard it as we did,'' he concluded to one
of the newly reconstituted Crown Guards, who stood before him
looking boyishly nervous behind his drawn saber.
</P>
<P>
   But what right, demanded the opposition parliamentarians who
boycotted the ceremony, does a king's crown have to a place of
honor in a republican democracy?
</P>
<P>
   What right, retorted the government that not only moved the
crown but tried to write a reference to it into the constitution,
do our liberal opponents have to deny Hungarians the symbol of
their traditions?
</P>
<P>
   What, ask many average Hungarians, is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   A full answer is tricky. The government says honoring the crown
is simply part of the 1,000th birthday festivities, on which it
will spend $140 million this year, commissioning new statues,
films, symphonies and conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The government's critics say the crown is part of the mantle of
righteousness it has drawn around itself as it intimidates those
who oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   They say corruption, xenophobia and a dangerous pan-Hungarian
nationalism are on the rise and the government abets them because
its allies include small right-wing parties and opportunistic
tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   Elemer Hankiss, a sociologist and political commentator who is
optimistic about Hungary's future, calls it all an
``inside-the-Budapest-Beltway battle.'' Right-wingers still
dreaming of Greater Hungary are only 2 percent of the populace, he
said, and ``Crown-gate is a stupid issue'' dividing former allies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For an Eastern European country, Hungary is doing relatively
well. It has the fastest-growing economy in the first wave of
candidates to join the European Union. Elections have been held
since 1989 without problems. But some observers say they spot
anti-democratic trends.
</P>
<P>
   In February, for example, about 300 skinheads met at Budapest's
mountaintop castle to mourn the Waffen-SS troops and their
Hungarian Arrow allies who died there.
</P>
<P>
   When the police appeared at their nightclub to check passports,
they rioted.
</P>
<P>
   Quieter anti-Semitic and anti-gypsy incidents, like threatening
letters, have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crown ceremony Saturday drew groups of men waving the flags
of the Arpad family, who led the first Hungarians over the
Carpathians in the 890s. Others carried the flags of Greater
Hungary, showing the borders before chunks were lost to Romania,
Slovakia and the Ukraine in the treaties ending World War I. To
some, their yearnings have disconcerting echoes of Greater
Deutschland of the 1930s and Slobodan Milosevic's Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, some of the flag-bearers waiting in the snow to
see the crown Saturday said they were detained on sight by the
police for two hours. Their Hungarian Truth and Life Party is a
small member of the ruling coalition, which suggests that the
police aren't politically influenced, even if they haven't yet
grasped freedom of assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hungarians even worry about the revival of the old nobles
association, while others consider it harmless nostalgia. Counts
and princes from the Hungarian diaspora pop up everywhere, from
Laszlo Almasy of ``The English Patient'' to the Esterhazys who
figure in the South African wine industry. But there is little fear
they will demand ancient lands back; they couldn't even get
Parliament to restore the florid titles they lost under communist
rule.
</P>
<P>
   To historians, the new fight over St. Stephen's legacy is
frustrating, because the crown has been kicked around plenty over
the centuries, and this looks like a whole new political football
league.
</P>
<P>
   The crown was given to Stephen, known here as Istvan, when he
was merely king, but he had embraced Christianity and agreed to
spread it in the way then fashionable _ by the battle ax.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being bent by some clumsy retainer, the crown was lost
on a roadside by Otto of Bavaria circa 1310, stolen by the pregnant
widow of Albert von Hapsburg for her unborn son in 1439, ransomed
back in 1463, shuttled back and forth between Buda, Bratislava and
Vienna on Hapsburgian whims, and buried for four years in a futile
attempt to save it from Austrian troops crushing the Hungarian
rebellion of 1848.
</P>
<P>
   It even spent 33 years in Fort Knox, Ky. As the Third Reich fell
in 1945, the Crown Guards fled west with it to evade pro-Nazi
putschists and invading Soviet troops, and surrendered to Americans
instead. President Carter had it returned during a brief 1978 thaw
in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   (Stephen's right hand, by the way, has separately toured Europe
as a holy relic and was also Allied war booty very briefly. It now
rests in St. Stephen's Basilica in downtown Budapest. The rest of
his body is in the royal tombs in Szekesfehervom, but where exactly
is unclear because they were vandalized under Ottoman rule.)
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, historians say, this latest move to another
nitrogen-filled glass box has left behind the delicate cloak of St.
Stephen, the only element of the royal paraphernalia that everyone
agrees really is 1,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pains me personally that this group is broken up,'' said
Attila Zsoldos, a medieval historian. ``You can't just haul a
1,000-year-old piece of textile from place to place.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Even if Stephen actually wore the cloak, the other items that
followed the crown in Saturday night's procession _ a sword,
scepter and orb _ probably were acquired later and officially
declared his former property by later kings, who in the old days
could legally pull such shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   The sacred crown itself is suspect because it is riveted of gold
bands of different chemical make-up, one with Greek writing and one
with Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Among its icons are King Geza I and Emperor Michael VII of
Byzantium _ both of whom ruled after Stephen's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this act,'' said Balint Magyar, president of the Alliance
of Free Democrats, who were in the government but are now in
opposition, ``they have transformed the crown from an honored piece
of our history into a tool of their daily political goals. If they
think it doesn't belong in a museum, they don't understand 20th
century Hungarian history.''
</P>
<P>
   Magyar feels a certain family expertise; his great-great
grandfather was the prime minister who buried the crown to save it
in 1849.
</P>
<P>
   The government's allies scoff. ``We want to honor the crown
without over-emphasizing it,'' said Bela Pokol, a leader of the
conservative Smallholders Party. His party formed the new ruling
coalition with the Fidesz-Hungarian Civic party, which began as an
anti-Communist youth movement in the 1980s, but has shifted _ some
say opportunistically after election losses _ into a mixed
traditionalist, Christian, pro-big-business stance.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance, which embodies urbanized intellectualism, ``always
opposes traditional values,'' Pokol said. He also criticized the
media as ``unbalanced in favor of liberal/leftist/Socialist
circles.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk is how the government gets portrayed as
anti-intellectual _ which in eastern Europe is sometimes read as
anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Pokol's liberal targets accuse the government of
throttling them. Last year it cut 90 percent of its grant to the
Institute for the History of 1956, a think tank of academics once
jailed for opposing the Stalinist crushing of Hungary's 1956
rebellion. The money went to a rival think tank favored by Prime
Minister Viktor Orban, who wasn't even born until 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The government also closed the country's second-biggest paper,
the liberal Kurir, letting the Post Office Bank that owned it
shutter it as a money loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is freedom of the press here, but there's pressure
too,'' said Gabor Szucs, Kurir's last editor. ``It's like the
Chinese proverb: To scare the monkeys, kill a chicken in front of
them. They sent a message _ behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a grenade was thrown at the offices of a weekly
paper that accused relatives of party officials, including Orban's
father, of enriching themselves and evading taxes. The party sued.
A few weeks earlier, the car of a satiric journalist was
anonymously firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been arrested. Hankiss said he thought even such
events were overblown in a country still learning how to respond to
free speech with more speech instead of with the 1956 bullet holes
that still dot downtown walls.
</P>
<P>
   But the joke among some of those watching the parade Saturday
was that Orban wants the crown nearer his office so he can try it
on at night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., who as chief of naval operations in
the early 1970s ordered the Navy to end racial discrimination and
demeaning restrictions on sailors, then faced a haunting personal
tragedy that he related to ordering the deployment of the defoliant
Agent Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday at the Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C. He was 79 and lived in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from surgery for a chest tumor.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1970, when Zumwalt, at 49, became the youngest man to
serve as the Navy's top-ranking uniformed officer, re-enlistments
were plunging in the face of an unpopular war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to make naval service an appealing career again, Zumwalt
issued 121 directives over the next four years, highly publicized
Z-Grams (Z for Zumwalt) that sought to change the way the Navy had
done things for almost two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including many retired admirals, asserted that Zumwalt
had created a permissive atmosphere endangering shipboard
discipline, and these accusations were fueled by racial incidents
on the aircraft carriers Kitty Hawk and Constellation in 1972.
Zumwalt believed that the antipathy toward his changes reflected
racial prejudice, and in November 1972 he summoned senior officers
to the Pentagon and accused them of ignoring his directives on race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite resistance, he made progress as chief of naval
operations. Re-enlistments by first-term sailors rose sharply, the
number of black personnel increased, and the first black admiral,
Samuel L. Gravely Jr., was appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt retired in 1974, but a decade later he was back in the
public eye, enmeshed in family anguish arising from the Vietnam
War. While serving as commander of American naval forces in Vietnam
from 1968 to 1970, he had ordered the spraying of the defoliant
Agent Orange in the Mekong Delta, seeking to deny cover to enemy
snipers on the river banks where his patrol boats operated. One
boat commander was Lt. Elmo Zumwalt III, his son.
</P>
<P>
   The two wrote a book, ``My Father, My Son'' (Macmillan, 1986),
telling of the younger Zumwalt's battle against cancer that both
men attributed to dioxin, a toxic byproduct of Agent Orange. The
story was made into a movie of the same title for CBS Television,
which was broadcast in May 1988. Three months later, Elmo Zumwalt
III died of cancer at age 42, leaving a wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in a statement Sunday that Zumwalt
``worked vigorously to improve our sailors' quality of life and
devoted himself to eliminating discrimination in the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Admiral Zumwalt became a great champion of veterans with
war-related health problems,'' Clinton said. ``He established the
first national bone marrow donor program to help cancer patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Elmo Russell Zumwalt Jr. was born in San Francisco on Nov. 29,
1920, the son of doctors, and was reared in Tulare, Calif., where
he was given the nickname Bud. He would carry it throughout his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1942, won a Bronze
Star on a destroyer in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines
in 1944 and served on the battleship Wisconsin in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he came to the attention of Paul H. Nitze,
the veteran Washington foreign-policy adviser, after writing a
paper on Soviet politics at the National War College. During the
Cuban missile crisis he was an aide to Nitze, who was assistant
secretary of defense for international security affairs, and when
Nitze became secretary of the Navy in 1963, he was his executive
assistant. On Nitze's recommendation, he was named a rear admiral
in 1965, at age 44 the youngest officer ever to attain that rank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 he was promoted to the three-star rank of vice admiral,
ahead of 130 flag officers, and was named the commander of American
naval forces in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt, who had opposed American ground involvement in Vietnam
since the early 1960s and would later write how ``I thought it was
the wrong war, in the wrong place, at the wrong time,'' oversaw the
``brown water Navy.'' That was a flotilla of more than 1,000 armed
small boats deployed in the Mekong Delta to deny Vietcong and North
Vietnamese soldiers use of thousands of miles of waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington, Zumwalt took on another formidable task
_ remaking the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I became chief of naval operations, racism and sexism
were still an integral part of the Navy tradition,'' he recalled.
There had never been a black admiral, black officers had few
prospects for advancement, and women were not permitted to serve on
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Zumwalt issued what he would call his most important
directive, ``Equal Opportunity in the Navy.'' It required ship,
base and aircraft squadrons to appoint a minority-group member as a
special assistant for minority affairs, demanded that the Navy
fight housing discrimination against black sailors in cities where
they were based, ordered that suitable cosmetics and food for black
personnel be stocked in Navy exchanges and required that books by
and about black Americans be made available in Navy libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no black Navy, no white Navy _ just one Navy _ the
United States Navy,'' Zumwalt declared.
</P>
<P>
   Another Z-Gram permitted women to serve on ships. Because women
were barred by law from ships that could be engaged in combat, a
hospital ship, the Sanctuary, was designated in 1972 to break
tradition, but not without some protests from wives of career
enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt also drew up a Z-Gram he first called ``Mickey Mouse,
Elimination of,'' but eventually renamed ``Demeaning and Abrasive
Regulations, Elimination of,'' an effort to remove some of the
restrictions on sailors' personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a go-ahead for beards and mustaches, which were already
permitted but generally frowned upon, and he allowed sailors to
have sideburns, which he himself wore to maximum authorized length,
the middle of the ear lobe. He permitted sailors to wear civilian
clothes on base when not on duty, authorized liquor in officers'
quarters and beer in senior enlisted men's barracks, liberalized
overnight liberty policies and set 15 minutes as the maximum time a
sailor should have to wait in line for anything.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While his changes gained wide public attention, Zumwalt spent
most of his time as chief of naval operations and a member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff dealing with matters related to the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Playboy in June 1974, shortly before his
retirement, he remarked, ``There's a good deal of indecision as to
whether I am a drooling-fang militarist or a bleeding-heart
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters the previous month, Zumwalt said the
Soviet Union had the capacity to control sea lanes in a crisis and
foresaw a reversal of that situation only if Congress adequately
financed a multibillion-dollar naval construction program that he
had instituted.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir ``On Watch'' (Quadrangle, 1976) he contended that
the Russians had gained more from limitations on strategic weapons
than the United States had.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt ran as a Democrat for the Senate in Virginia in 1976 but
was defeated by Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr., an independent. The admiral
later served on many corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   His son Elmo III left the Navy in 1970 and became a lawyer in
North Carolina. In 1983, he was stricken with lymphoma, a cancer of
the lymphatic system, and in 1985 he was found to have Hodgkin's
disease, an unrelated form of lymph-node cancer. Elmo III's son,
Elmo IV, known as Russell, was born in 1977, with a severe learning
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt and his son attributed the cancers and the boy's brain
disorder to the Agent Orange defoliant, deployed by Zumwalt in the
Mekong Delta. Many Vietnam veterans had told of suffering from
nervous disorders, cancers and skin problems and of having had
children with serious birth defects, attributing these to the
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Father, My Son,'' Elmo Zumwalt III wrote: ``I do not
second-guess the decisions Dad made in Vietnam, nor do I doubt for
a minute that the saving of human life was always his first
priority in his conduct of the war. I have the greatest love and
admiration for him as a man, and the deepest respect for him as a
military leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt wrote: ``Knowing what I know now, I still would have
ordered the defoliation to achieve the objectives it did. But that
does not ease the sorrow I feel for Elmo, or the anguish his
illness, and Russell's disability, give me. It is the first thing I
think of when I awake in the morning, and the last thing I remember
when I go to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mouza Coutelais-du-Roche Zumwalt; a
son, James, of Reston, Va.; two daughters, Anne Zumwalt of
Longmeadow, Mass., and Mouzetta Zumwalt-Weathers of Cary, N.C.; a
sister, Saralee Zumwalt Crow of Fresno, Calif.; a brother, James,
of El Cajon, Calif.; and six grandchildren,
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January 1998, President Clinton presented Zumwalt the Medal
of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. He was cited for
fighting discrimination against minorities and women in the Navy
and for his work on behalf of a foundation seeking bone-marrow
donors for cancer patients.

FINANCIAL WORLD GETS ITS BIG TEST MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The company's Pillow Room, an old elevator shaft
converted into a napping nest, was empty. The Stress Relief Room,
with a pinball machine and Mortal Kombat video game, had few
visitors. And red hotline telephones perched on wooden stools were
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a dearth of signs of millennial anxiety, employees of
Thomson Financial's electronic settlements group in downtown Boston
spent Sunday night in the glow of computer screens, watching Asian
stock markets open as the world's financial system gradually
awakened for business for the first time in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all very optimistic that things will work beautifully,''
said Howard Edelstein, chief executive of the group, which is an
electronic housekeeper to the securities industry, processing
around one-third of the 4 billion or so shares traded globally each
day. ``But one never knows until the major markets kick in.''
</P>
<P>
   Having crossed into 2000 with few technological glitches,
financial services institutions from Beijing to Bonn to Boston face
their true test Monday, when much of the world resumes work and
millions of financial and retail transactions pass through computer
systems for the first time in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Some markets, like those in Singapore, will have closed by the
time New York bankers and Boston fund managers wake up. European
stock exchanges will be winding down just as Wall Street kicks into
high gear. London and Tokyo markets, closed Monday for traditional
New Year's holidays, reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Markets were closed on New Year's Eve, so remedies against the
year 2000 computer bug have yet to be tested in actual working
conditions. The bug causes unprepared computers to read 2000 as
1900 and possibly to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite few, if any, reports of computer glitches during the New
Year's Eve rollover, most brokerages, banks, fund firms,
back-office processors, and exchanges kept their Y2K war rooms
staffed through the weekend to prepare for their real-life test.
</P>
<P>
   With power plants, telephones, and other utilities functioning
normally, the companies are waiting to see if the resumption of
business will cause any internal glitches. Having spent tens of
billions of dollars and several years remedying countless lines of
computer code against the Y2K bug, as well as held elaborate tests,
financial services firms will find out in coming days if everything
from mutual fund share prices and wire transfers to employee
paychecks and internal accounting systems function under regular
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth sailing expected
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday  &UR; evening &LR; , few observers were predicting problems with
the computers that drive the world's financial labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence suggests there probably will be very little
disruption'' when US financial markets _ the biggest in the world _
reopen Monday, said former Treasury secretary-turned-investment
banker Robert Rubin on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese brokerages experienced minor glitches Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But John Koskinen, who oversees year 2000 efforts at the White
House, told a Washington briefing that ``we do not expect any
significant problems in banking, finance, and retail operations
here'' or in other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get through Monday or Tuesday as well as we have gotten
through this weekend, then I think we will feel very comfortable
that there aren't any major problems,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, amid growing debate over whether the uneventful calendar
rollover represented a technological beast successfully tamed or a
paper tiger hyped by consultants and programmers, financial
services firms were taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in red fleece ``Y2K Response Team'' jackets, Thomson
employees Sunday monitored computer screens and watched market news
from space-age chairs with fold-out trays.
</P>
<P>
   At Visa, the credit-card giant, spokeswoman Susan Forman said:
``Everyone is eager to see how Monday goes, but early indications
are that our payment systems are working.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, New England's largest bank, opened 11 branches Sunday in
Connecticut and Long Island for regular business, just to test the
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us haven't had a hot meal in three days,'' said Jim
Schepker, who heads Fleet's Y2K team, which has worked around the
clock since Friday. Though Fleet's chief executive, Terrence
Murray, never set foot in the bank's Y2K war room over the weekend,
the company plans to keep its command center staffed through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, which Fleet owns, kept 100 supermarket branches open
for a second day Sunday. The bank reported ``minor'' computer
viruses on its internal corporate e-mail system but said it had
taken care of the problem and customers would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of the woods yet _ Monday is our next
significant milestone,'' said Bruce Spitzer, a BankBoston
spokesman. ``But our preliminary assessment looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, part of the nation's
central bank, staffers spent the weekend completing a checkup of
New England's banking system. A spokesman, Thomas Lavelle, said
that ``the key thing is that on Monday, people are back to real
life, which makes it a key day and a telling day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the world's largest mutual fund firm, did
not have to use a special room at downtown Boston's World Trade
Center that it had booked for an emergency media conference in case
things went haywire. But the Boston company kept 1,000 customer
service representatives at the phones Sunday night (and offered
staffers a catered Mexican feast).
</P>
<P>
   Processing a securities transaction takes three days, and
professional investors who traded securities on Wednesday had
received electronic confirmation of their deals by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But some big tests remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that has not yet happened is to have a trade
entered and cleared, all in the new year,'' said Margaret Draper, a
spokeswoman for the Securities Industry Association, a trade group
for investment banks, broker-dealers, and fund firms.
</P>
<P>
   The longer term will be a testing ground, too: Industry
specialists say any effects from the millennium computer bug could
take weeks and months to manifest themselves in services or
documents, such as a quarterly statement.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services companies seemed reluctant to join a chorus
of questions from reporters and observers over the merits of the
vast and costly efforts launched to protect systems against the
year 2000 bug. Worldwide spending on Y2K is estimated at $250
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But James Chisholm, a senior systems engineer at Thomson ESG,
the electronic settlements group that is part of the Thomson
Financial empire, said the millennial computer glitch had been good
for the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm said that increased trading volumes, after-hours
business, and growth in cross-border trading had put pressures on
the global financial system that needed to be tested in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't had a Y2K problem,'' Chisholm said, ``it would
have been good to have invented one.''

BRADLEY TO STAY THE COURSE OF CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As he enters the final, one-month stretch to the New
Hampshire primary, Bill Bradley has no tricks, no gimmicks, no
last-ditch, pull-out-all-the-stop surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator from New Jersey says he's going to keep
hammering on the same issues he has been for the last year:
overhauling campaign finance laws, eliminating child poverty,
providing health insurance to the uninsured, and bringing about
racial healing.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in a minivan while being driven to New
Hampshire Sunday, Bradley acknowledged that the constant criticism
he has weathered from Vice President Al Gore has rankled him. But
he maintained that he would not shift gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's working,'' Bradley said of Gore's tactics.
``I think people really don't want negative campaigning and
attacks. They want a fresh start and they want to know what people
are going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gore were to launch television commercials that explicitly
attacked him, Bradley said he would respond. Then he said he might
not. ``Sure, absolutely,'' he said. ``Unless we felt it's best not
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore's approach to their rivalry has been to engage
in ``old politics,'' and to mimick Bradley's ideas and campaign
events, even his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he going to do tomorrow?'' Bradley said, referring to a
speech Gore plans to give Monday in Iowa that closely resembles the
theme of Bradley's talk in Manchester, N.H. about the possibilities
of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we schedule something, he schedules something,'' Bradley
said. ``It's been that way, which is a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   As New Hampshire voters consider Bradley and Gore in the
Democratic primary Feb. 1, Bradley said they will not just be
choosing between two politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in Boston Sunday to attend an event at City Year in
the South End, where a group of students and community supporters
gave him a red City Year windbreaker that he wore for most of the
day. City Year has invited all of the presidential candidates to
speak, but so far only Bradley has accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question really is, what's the direction of the Democratic
Party?'' he said, still wearing the red City Year windbreaker he
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to settle for symbolic actions, or are we going
to be bold like Democrats have always been in periods of real
change where people are looking for leadership?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if voters would be settling for the status quo if they
chose Gore, Bradley said they would be settling for less, given the
proposals Gore has been making, such as on health care and gun
control. Bradley noted that he and Gore have spent no time debating
Gore's health plan, which would start by insuring all children and
their parents, ``because it's so meager.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan would eliminate Medicaid, the federal-state
health insurance program for the poor and disabled, and replace it
with private insurance subsidies. Gore has repeatedly criticized
that approach as leaving the most vulnerable population with an
inadequate replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said voters sense chasm between a time when the Clinton
administration aimed for universal health insurance and now.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he said, when the United States had a $290 billion
deficit and was six years away from bankruptcy in Medicare and
borrowing from the Social Security trust fund, the vice president
advocated national health insurance. But now, Bradley said, the
nation has a budget surplus, Medicare is solid until 2015, and
Social Security is overflowing, and the voters are wondering why
not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm saying, `Now,' '' Bradley said. ``And he's saying,
`No, not now.' I think that's gotten through to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that he wants to provide universal health
insurance, but that it should be instituted using a practical,
methodical approach. He has aggressively questioned almost every
aspect of Bradley's health care plan and contends that it would
cost too much and hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he believes Gore's approach to the campaign has
been counterproductive for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into `My coat is warmer than your coat,' then
you're where politics has always been,'' Bradley said. ``The public
says, `Click, typical politician.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley has repeatedly dismissed the notion that he
must leave Iowa and New Hampshire with at least one success, he
described the Granite State ``as a very good place to begin this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one message he would like to send to New Hampshire
voters, he said, it's on the subject of campaign finance reform. A
vote for Bradley, he suggested, is a vote in favor of eliminating
special interest money from the political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel New Hampshire voters are on the cutting edge and they
can send a message that this counts,'' he said. ``There's an
independent spirit that people do not want to be compromised by
forces beyond their control.''

OLOWOKANDI BATTLING INJURY AND JABS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON _ Michael Olowokandi was trying to lead with a limp. He
was sacrificing his aching knees for the good of the team, or so he
thought.
</P>
<P>
   If Olowokandi were a receiver or defensive tackle on the
Stanford football team, this would have been been a very good
thing. His teammates, drawing on his inspiration as if it were pure
oxygen, would have gone out and put quite a scare in a much better
team.
</P>
<P>
   But Olowokandi's team is the Clippers so you know what that
means.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of kudos, there were incriminations.
</P>
<P>
   The shots were fired Thursday, after the Clippers suffered a
22-point loss at Houston (on the heels of a 23-point defeat at
Denver). Maurice Taylor, the team captain, blasted Olowokandi, the
team's second-year center, for ``not doing much on offense.... He
has to step up because right now he's nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments revealed more about Taylor than Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   To zoom in on Olowokandi's stats _ six blocked shots, four
points and four rebounds in 25 minutes against the Rockets _ is to
frame the picture all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to have the eye of Clippers general manager Elgin
Baylor to recognize the hitch in Olowokandi's gait the past couple
of weeks. He has been running the floor as if it were a court of
sand near his home in Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, concerned by Olowokandi's noticeable limp, took the
conscientious 7-foot center aside recently and asked if his knees
were bothering him. Olowokandi shrugged off the questions, because,
after all, aren't former No. 1 picks supposed to be bulletproof?
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Derek Anderson already had gone down with an
injury. So had Eric Murdock and Brian Skinner. Olowokandi didn't
want to join them and risk having the players in dress clothes
outnumber the players in jerseys on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're all dropping, one by one,'' Olowokandi
explained Sunday. ``I felt a responsibility to be out there with
the team. If I wasn't at 100 percent, at 75 percent or 50 percent I
thought I still would have helped. If I can give something, I'll be
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds pretty selfless to us.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a thought: Maybe what the Clippers need to get out of
their funk is fewer Taylors and more Olowokandis. We dare them to
bounce that opinion off the locker room walls (with the doors
closed, of course).
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi might have told Taylor he was hurting but Taylor
didn't give him the opening. He took a gripe that should have
stayed in the locker room and broadcast it in such a way that
Olowokandi was the last to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   With people like that watching your back, who needs
back-stabbers?
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi was a no-show at practice on Friday, the morning
Taylor's comments appeared in print. The surprise is it wasn't
because he was canvassing the city, buying up all the day's
newspapers so he could set the sports sections on fire in the South
Bay's biggest New Year's Eve bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I did not hear about (what Taylor had said about
him) until Saturday night when I talked to my agent,'' Olowokandi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, we'd like to believe half of what we heard at the
Clippers' practice, their first to include both Taylor and
Olowokandi since Taylor took his teammate to task. But so many
contradictory remarks were made, after a while we started to feel
like we had taken a wrong turn and wandered onto the set of a new
game show called, ``Truth or Lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said any hard feelings between Taylor and Olowokandi had
been smoothed over. ``It's all been resolved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Baylor was talking, Olowokandi was shooting baskets with two
assigned teammates at one end of the court while Taylor did
likewise at the opposite end, their paths looking for all the world
like they were designed not to cross.
</P>
<P>
   If we had been in coach Chris Ford's Nikes, we would have run at
least one two-man drill and made sure Taylor and Olowokandi were
paired. Just to facilitate peace, love and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Ford didn't see the need to, having presided over an
air-clearing meeting before practice. ``We did it within the team
atmosphere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's message wasn't the problem, Ford said, it was his
choice of messengers. ``Peer pressure is fine,'' Ford said. ``It's
important... for guys to get on one another. You say what you
think, you say what you feel. (But) it doesn't go outside the
locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 22 and a third-year pro, has been in team sports long
enough to know dressing room decorum. He blamed his behavioral
lapse on a stretch that has seen the Clippers lose two straight
games in sloppy fashion after winning five of their previous seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose, a lot of frustration sets in,'' Taylor said.
``You tend to try to be a critic of everyone's game. I was
disappointed in the way the team played. I tried to put some
pressure on Michael to step up. I was trying to light a fire under
Michael and I did it the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Taylor decides to tie a teammate to the stake for
the offense of not playing hard enough, let's hope he talks to him
before turning up the flame. In the meantime, Olowokandi wouldn't
mind an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Taylor) hasn't said anything to me, personally,'' Olowokandi
said upon emerging from a post-practice weight-lifting session.
``It would be kind of nice if (an apology) happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. This issue is supposedly forgotten and Taylor
hasn't even asked yet for forgiveness?
</P>
<P>
   Pardon our confusion, but we assumed an apology by Taylor would
form the foundation of the resolution Baylor alluded to and of the
air-clearing meeting Ford spoke of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Maurice must have forgotten (to apologize),''
Baylor said, backpedaling. ``He said he wanted to talk to Michael.
He wanted to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? It wouldn't have cut into Taylor's afternoon too much
to walk with Olowokandi to the weight room and spot him during a
couple bench press sets. What better way to strengthen muscles and
bonds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whatever he said he knows it was out of line,''
Olowokandi said. Told that Taylor said he was merely trying to help
motivate him, Olowokandi dryly replied: ``When I'm in need of a
personal psychologist I'll hire one. That's what I say to that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most dignified response of the day. &QL;

FINANCIAL WORLD GETS ITS BIG TEST MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Also moved in financial designation)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ The company's Pillow Room, an old elevator shaft
converted into a napping nest, was empty. The Stress Relief Room,
with a pinball machine and Mortal Kombat video game, had few
visitors. And red hotline telephones perched on wooden stools were
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a dearth of signs of millennial anxiety, employees of
Thomson Financial's electronic settlements group in downtown Boston
spent Sunday night in the glow of computer screens, watching Asian
stock markets open as the world's financial system gradually
awakened for business for the first time in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all very optimistic that things will work beautifully,''
said Howard Edelstein, chief executive of the group, which is an
electronic housekeeper to the securities industry, processing
around one-third of the 4 billion or so shares traded globally each
day. ``But one never knows until the major markets kick in.''
</P>
<P>
   Having crossed into 2000 with few technological glitches,
financial services institutions from Beijing to Bonn to Boston face
their true test Monday, when much of the world resumes work and
millions of financial and retail transactions pass through computer
systems for the first time in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Some markets, like those in Singapore, will have closed by the
time New York bankers and Boston fund managers wake up. European
stock exchanges will be winding down just as Wall Street kicks into
high gear. London and Tokyo markets, closed Monday for traditional
New Year's holidays, reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Markets were closed on New Year's Eve, so remedies against the
year 2000 computer bug have yet to be tested in actual working
conditions. The bug causes unprepared computers to read 2000 as
1900 and possibly to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite few, if any, reports of computer glitches during the New
Year's Eve rollover, most brokerages, banks, fund firms,
back-office processors, and exchanges kept their Y2K war rooms
staffed through the weekend to prepare for their real-life test.
</P>
<P>
   With power plants, telephones, and other utilities functioning
normally, the companies are waiting to see if the resumption of
business will cause any internal glitches. Having spent tens of
billions of dollars and several years remedying countless lines of
computer code against the Y2K bug, as well as held elaborate tests,
financial services firms will find out in coming days if everything
from mutual fund share prices and wire transfers to employee
paychecks and internal accounting systems function under regular
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth sailing expected
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday evening, few observers were predicting problems with
the computers that drive the world's financial labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence suggests there probably will be very little
disruption'' when US financial markets _ the biggest in the world _
reopen Monday, said former Treasury secretary-turned-investment
banker Robert Rubin on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese brokerages experienced minor glitches Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But John Koskinen, who oversees year 2000 efforts at the White
House, told a Washington briefing that ``we do not expect any
significant problems in banking, finance, and retail operations
here'' or in other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get through Monday or Tuesday as well as we have gotten
through this weekend, then I think we will feel very comfortable
that there aren't any major problems,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, amid growing debate over whether the uneventful calendar
rollover represented a technological beast successfully tamed or a
paper tiger hyped by consultants and programmers, financial
services firms were taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in red fleece ``Y2K Response Team'' jackets, Thomson
employees Sunday monitored computer screens and watched market news
from space-age chairs with fold-out trays.
</P>
<P>
   At Visa, the credit-card giant, spokeswoman Susan Forman said:
``Everyone is eager to see how Monday goes, but early indications
are that our payment systems are working.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, New England's largest bank, opened 11 branches Sunday in
Connecticut and Long Island for regular business, just to test the
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us haven't had a hot meal in three days,'' said Jim
Schepker, who heads Fleet's Y2K team, which has worked around the
clock since Friday. Though Fleet's chief executive, Terrence
Murray, never set foot in the bank's Y2K war room over the weekend,
the company plans to keep its command center staffed through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, which Fleet owns, kept 100 supermarket branches open
for a second day Sunday. The bank reported ``minor'' computer
viruses on its internal corporate e-mail system but said it had
taken care of the problem and customers would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of the woods yet _ Monday is our next
significant milestone,'' said Bruce Spitzer, a BankBoston
spokesman. ``But our preliminary assessment looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, part of the nation's
central bank, staffers spent the weekend completing a checkup of
New England's banking system. A spokesman, Thomas Lavelle, said
that ``the key thing is that on Monday, people are back to real
life, which makes it a key day and a telling day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the world's largest mutual fund firm, did
not have to use a special room at downtown Boston's World Trade
Center that it had booked for an emergency media conference in case
things went haywire. But the Boston company kept 1,000 customer
service representatives at the phones Sunday night (and offered
staffers a catered Mexican feast).
</P>
<P>
   Processing a securities transaction takes three days, and
professional investors who traded securities on Wednesday had
received electronic confirmation of their deals by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But some big tests remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that has not yet happened is to have a trade
entered and cleared, all in the new year,'' said Margaret Draper, a
spokeswoman for the Securities Industry Association, a trade group
for investment banks, broker-dealers, and fund firms.
</P>
<P>
   The longer term will be a testing ground, too: Industry
specialists say any effects from the millennium computer bug could
take weeks and months to manifest themselves in services or
documents, such as a quarterly statement.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services companies seemed reluctant to join a chorus
of questions from reporters and observers over the merits of the
vast and costly efforts launched to protect systems against the
year 2000 bug. Worldwide spending on Y2K is estimated at $250
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But James Chisholm, a senior systems engineer at Thomson ESG,
the electronic settlements group that is part of the Thomson
Financial empire, said the millennial computer glitch had been good
for the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm said that increased trading volumes, after-hours
business, and growth in cross-border trading had put pressures on
the global financial system that needed to be tested in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't had a Y2K problem,'' Chisholm said, ``it would
have been good to have invented one.''

IN FEAR, DOCTOR KEPT JOB A SECRET FROM HIJACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARION LLOYD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURGAON, India _ For the first three days of his nightmarish
captivity, Lalit Verma kept silent, fearfully guarding the secret
that he knew would prolong his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to declare that I'm a doctor,'' Verma said
Sunday, two days after he walked free with 154 other hostages who
had been held for more than a week aboard Indian Airlines Flight
814. ``I thought, if they release some people, they will never
release any doctor, because they will need him till the last
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Verma, a 39-year-old anesthesiologist, was returning home from a
vacation in Nepal with his family on Dec. 24 when their plane was
hijacked by five Islamic militants shortly after it left Katmandu.
</P>
<P>
   Verma's wife, Indu, and their two small children were freed on
the second day of the hijacking, along with 24 other passengers,
during a stop in Dubai, leaving him to survive the ordeal alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begged them: `Let me go with my children,' '' he said in an
interview at his house in Gurgaon, a satellite town on the
outskirts of New Delhi. ``But they said, `No, get back to your seat
and be quiet.' I didn't speak to anyone for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on the third day, something happened to jolt Verma out of
his cocoon. The passengers had endured four excruciating hours with
heads in laps, while their captors waited for Indian negotiators to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, wearing face masks and wielding pistols and
grenades, were shouting at a passenger sitting three rows ahead who
had ignored their orders to sit up. Verma saw the passenger slump
over into the aisle and watched with alarm when the man's face
begun to turn blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped up and said: `Stay back. I am a doctor. Let me help,'
'' Verma said. He told how he revived the man with CPR and oxygen,
and then began attending to the other passengers. One of those was
another doctor who had suffered a nervous breakdown after trying to
treat the planeful of terrorized hostages alone.
</P>
<P>
   His new role turned out to be a blessing in disguise. While most
of the passengers were ordered to stay in their seats with their
blindfolds on, Verma was allowed to move about the cabin and even
catch glimpses of the desert airstrip where their ordeal was to be
played out. ``What would happen to me, I didn't think about
anymore,'' he said. ``I was too busy.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, it was a horrifying ordeal of frequent death
threats and endless monotony. A dozen men who were segregated in
the first-class cabin watched as the hijackers inflicted the only
casualty, stabbing to death a 25-year-old honeymooner named Rippan
Katyal after he disobeyed their orders not to look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hostages were eight pairs of newlyweds, including a
Spanish couple. Verma said that the 25 foreigners on board had been
treated slightly better than their Indian counterparts, but that
they had also been isolated because of the language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers alternated speaking in Hindi and Urdu, leaving one
of the Indian passengers to translate into French and English.
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers gave up eating solid food _ what little was
provided by Afghanistan's Taliban leaders _ to avoid having to use
the increasingly foul bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Their moods rose and fell with the moods of their captors,
particularly the one nicknamed Burger, whom they described as
alternately nasty and jovial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to tell us, `I have a big heart, but I can be cruel
also,' '' Verma said. Other passengers later described feeling
affectionate toward him, calling him ``Burger bhai,'' or brother
Burger. But the relief created by the rare light moments, when
Burger led the passengers in singing Hindi film songs, would vanish
abruptly when their captors felt threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Verma related how the hijackers would stand in the aisles
clutching their grenades and call one another by their assumed
names. ``Shankar, pull the pin,'' or `` `Bhola, now's the time.
Let's end it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The worst moment came late Tuesday night, four days into the
hijacking, when the optimism created by the arrival of an Indian
negotiating team a day earlier was shattered by Burger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us, `We have stopped negotiations, and now you all be
prepared to get killed. . . . We'll start killing you one by one.
And if we kill anyone, don't think anybody will be spared,''' he
said. ``That was the lowest point.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers were believed to be members of the
Harkat-ul-Ansar, one of roughly a dozen Islamic militant groups
fighting a 10-year secessionist battle in Indian-controlled
Kashmir. They were demanding the release of 35 fellow militants
held in Indian jails. But they finally accepted the Indian
government's offer to release three _ a Pakistani cleric and two
Kashmiri militants who two of the hijackers said were their
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, they were angry at our Indian Army. They said the army
is being cruel to the people of Kashmir,'' Verma said. ``They kept
telling us, `We are not bad people. But what would you do if your
brother was in jail?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Those insistences only made the passengers feel more helpless.
``I thought, Why were we hijacked? If the government has captured
their brothers, why should we suffer?''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Burger announced that a deal had been struck for
their release, and that a plane from India was on its way to take
them home.
</P>
<P>
   But freedom was still 24 hours away. At 3 a.m. on Friday, New
Year's Eve, the engines gave out, leaving the passengers to battle
subfreezing temperatures and mounting despair. Finally, at noon on
Friday, the plane's pilot was allowed to meet with the Indian
negotiating team and returned with the news that they were free.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest episode, however, was still to come.
</P>
<P>
   Before fleeing the plane, Verma said, several of the hijackers
demanded the hostages' forgiveness. ``They told us, `We are very
sorry. But you must pardon us,' demanding that all those passengers
who accepted raise their hands. Who would not raise their hand in
that situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Now safely reunited with his family and thronged by an endless
stream of friends and well-wishers, Verma is haunted by Burger's
final words. ``He waved and told us, `See you again.'''

CITY AND STATE REACH PLAN TO DEVELOP GOVERNORS ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani have reached agreement on a plan to develop Governors
Island with a hotel and conference center, stores, apartments,
public parkland and a branch of at least one major American museum,
state officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement represents a major step forward in a campaign by
the city and state to persuade the federal government to give New
York exclusive rights to own and develop the island, a former Coast
Guard base off Manhattan's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to develop the 173-acre island has been a
source of disagreement between the mayor and the governor since
1997, when President Clinton promised to sell it to New York for a
dollar, provided that the city and the state could agree on a use
for it that benefited the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration had sought to include a casino in
its plan for redeveloping the island, a proposal the governor
strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Pataki and Giuliani would require the federal
government to turn the island over to a newly created state agency
overseen by appointees of both the governor and the mayor. That
agency would be responsible for inviting private companies to
submit commercial, educational, recreational or entertainment
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which was first reported Sunday in The New York Post,
still requires the approval of Congress, where there has been
increasing talk of having the federal government sell the island to
the highest bidder if the city and state fail to come up with an
acceptable plan for developing it by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Both the governor's office and the mayor's office declined to
comment officially on the matter Sunday. But state officials
involved in the negotiations said that Pataki and Giuliani have
scheduled a news conference for Thursday in New York City to
announce the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are to be joined by several other officials involved
in the negotiations, including Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from
Manhattan whose district includes the island.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for the state and the city to spend $30 million
to make the island suitable for new development, officials familiar
with the plan said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the money will be used to demolish aging
buildings that cannot be fully renovated, create a 50-acre public
park in the southwest section of the island, connect new sewer and
water lines to existing buildings and build a two-mile esplanade
around the island.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest commercial component of the plan calls for the
construction of a hotel, spa and conference center. The project
would be undertaken by private developers, who would be required to
renovate and use a large building at the center of the island that
was once a military garrison. The building, the largest ever
constructed by the military to house its troops, is protected as a
historic landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for other commercial development, as well,
including apartments, stores, restaurants and other small retail
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   These, too, are to be opened within existing buildings that have
historic landmark status and are on the northern section of the
island with broad views of lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also designates at least two sites to be used as
branches of major American museums, both of them on the southern
side of the island near where the new public park is to be built,
officials familiar with the plan said.
</P>
<P>
   No museum has been chosen to open a branch on the island. But
the Guggenheim Museum has expressed interest in installing a
sculpture garden, and state and city planners have approached the
Smithsonian Institution to gauge their interest in opening a branch
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Planners for the city and state have also agreed to create an
educational center on the island that is to feature, among other
things, an aquarium showcasing marine life found in the Hudson
River. The plan also includes a vast sports complex featuring
football fields, baseball diamonds and soccer fields that will be
leased to private universities.
</P>
<P>
   The city and state intend to use any money raised from the
hotel, conference center, stores and the island's other retail
establishments to pay for maintenance of the new park, as well as
the island's historic 18th-century buildings. Any additional money
raised by the city and state will be placed in their treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   The city and state intend to provide access to the island, which
is less than a half-mile from the southern tip of Manhattan,
through ferry companies hired under a concession arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal puts an end to difficult negotiations that began in
early 1997, when Moynihan announced that Clinton had offered to use
his influence to help turn over the island to New York for $1 if
the city and state could agree on a plan to maintain it as a public
amenity.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement became difficult to reach. At one point, for
example, city officials insisted that only a casino could generate
enough revenue to cover the costs of maintaining the island. But
the city eventually dropped the idea after the governor and Silver
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to Congress to decide what to do about the island,
which was used for more than 200 years as a military base before it
was abandoned in 1998 by the Coast Guard. Congress must decide
whether to adopt the city and state's plan as federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is not adopted, the island could be designated as
surplus military property and sold to the highest bidder. Federal
budget forecasters have estimated that the island could bring the
government $500 million.

JUST WIN 3 MORE, JONES TELLS COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ For a while Sunday afternoon against the New
York Giants, the Dallas Cowboys looked like the team that won three
Super Bowls in four years during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith rushed for 122 yards. Quarterback Troy
Aikman threw for 288 yards and two touchdowns. And a rookie
receiver named Jason Tucker made like Michael Irvin and caught four
passes for 122 yards, including a slant pass that he took 90 yards
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to give the Cowboys (8-8) a commanding 23-3 lead
in the third quarter, paving the way for an eventual 26-18 victory
over the hapless Giants (7-9).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get to foaming at the mouth too much over
winning this game,'' Dallas' owner, Jerry Jones, said. ``We should
beat the Giants. We should beat the Giants here at home with as
much at stake as we got and the players we've got. We should beat
them. We're going to play some games now that ought to be a flip of
the coin as to whether we win those games as we go _ a legitimate
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it's on to the playoffs for the Cowboys, who will play the
Vikings in Minnesota next Sunday at 12:30 p.m. Jones now has
visions of Super Bowls (present and future) dancing in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I genuinely feel we could do something special here and go to
a Super Bowl,'' Jones said, following his team's victory. ``Anybody
can take a look at our team and say that we can't win three
football games. The odds are against us. But I think we have an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had been playing the last three weeks to get into
the playoffs. First the Jets beat them, 22-21, and then last week
they lost to New Orleans, 31-24. The Giants were their last and, if
one follows Jones' way of thinking, best opportunity to get into
the postseason tournament. Before Sunday's game started, the Giants
had a Herculean task before them if they were to make the playoffs.
They needed to beat Dallas by an 81-point margin. All Dallas had to
do was win and they were in.
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants' owner Wellington Mara did on Wednesday, Jones had
spoken to some of his players and expressed to them the importance
of winning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants fell flat on their faces. The Cowboys, on the
strength of some superior play from their standout offensive skill
players, rose to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said the speech had no impact on his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're paid professionals,'' he said. ``If it takes somebody
standing up and saying that everybody is accountable for
themselves, then we've got the wrong guys on our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' speech, though, did get the attention of Dallas tackle
Erik Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I needed any extra incentive, but it was coming
from the head man,'' Williams said. ``It's like E.F. Hutton. When
he speaks, you listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman attached no great significance to the way his team played
Sunday. But it was obvious that he has grown comfortable with his
young receivers like Tucker, who had dropped a touchdown pass in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something about Troy to believe that a guy is going to
be where he's supposed to be,'' Dallas coach Chan Gailey said.
``Troy threw some passes to him today before he came out of the
break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys exploded out of the blocks. Tucker returned the
opening kickoff 79 yards, and a personal foul against Giants
receiver David Patten for yanking Tucker's face mask on the tackle
gave the Cowboys a first-and-goal at the New York 5. The Cowboys
could not punch the ball in and had to settle for a field goal. It
was the beginning of their woes inside the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't matter much Sunday afternoon, because the Giants
were not inclined to score any points in the first half and Dallas
took a 16-0 lead to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   When Tucker caught that slant pass in the third quarter and
broke free from Giants cornerback Jeremy Lincoln and went 90 yards
for a touchdown, the Cowboys were in control.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, thinking back to days in the past, said it would be nice
to roll up over 400 yards of offense each game. But he will take a
performance like Sunday, because they have been rare in this
up-and-down season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team has been through a lot this year,'' he said. ``The
team has regrouped when it has absolutely had to. Right now we have
as good a shot in the playoffs as we had a year ago. All that
matters right now is how you play once you get in the playoffs.''

   NEW YORK _ Doctors and scientists are thrilled with New York's
new tax on cigarettes, and with good reason. Once the higher tax
kicks in, cigarettes in New York will be more expensive than
anywhere else in the country, which will inevitably turn some
smokers into nonsmokers and deter many young people from ever
picking up one of those noxious weeds.
</P>
<P>
   But the medical community and lawmakers who approved the new tax
aren't the only ones cheering.
</P>
<P>
   So is Larry Ballagh, proprietor of a smoke shop on an Indian
reservation in Irving, near Buffalo. Customers at his shop do not
pay taxes, so the state Legislature has made him one happy fellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless them,'' said Ballagh, a member of the Seneca nation.
``Every time they do it, more people come,'' he said, referring to
the Legislature's decision to raise the tax. ``I guess there is
some indication that an increase in prices does encourage a certain
number of people to quit, which may be a good thing. But New York
state taxes make our product more attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem so. The folks at the Shinnecock Smoke Shop in
Southampton bought a full-page ad in The New York Post recently
illustrated with an Indian in feathered headdress. And the Web is
crowded with cigarette come-ons. Just one site _
webmaster(AT)discount-cigarettes.org/ _ lists screen after screen
of vendors, from BigIndian.com to SmokemCheap.com.
</P>
<P>
   All, from the small mom-and-pop operation to the established
business enterprise, undersell traditional stores by at least $10 a
carton, selling top brands for $22.35 to $24.99 (plus $1.50 for
shipping).
</P>
<P>
   One regular customer of an Indian smoke store in Shirley, Long
Island, where several smoke shops dot suburban streets, stocks up
every month. ``It's a big saving,'' he said. ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Non-Indians are supposed to pay state and local taxes in
reservation shops, but they do not, and now the Internet brings the
tax-free benefits of reservation shopping to smokers without cars.
</P>
<P>
   With the tax soon almost doubling to $1.11 a pack, cigarettes in
New York will cost about $4 a pack and $42 a carton in New York
City. The incentive to find bargains will be greater than ever _ as
will the incentive to provide those bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Hence a few troubling predictions along with the happy ones
about declines in smoking: that the higher price will energize
sales on the Internet, by mail order and on the reservations, as
well as the already healthy black market in cigarettes smuggled in
from other states. People with conventional stores in Binghamton
and other towns near Pennsylvania, where the taxes are lower, worry
about losing customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody keeps reliable statistics, but estimates are that
tax-free sales online and in reservation shops now account for a
very small percentage of cigarette sales. The same for the black
market. But there are signs of growth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, states with the highest cigarette taxes in 1998 were
losing $100 million a year in potential tax revenues to smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   After Maryland raised its tax last year to 66 cents a pack from
36 cents, state authorities said that in three months they made
more arrests for cigarette smuggling (nine) than in the entire
previous year (five). In previous years, when New York raised taxes
much higher than neighboring states, truckloads of cigarettes were
smuggled in from states with lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The new tax is supposed to help finance health-care coverage for
up to 1 million uninsured New Yorkers. If too many sales go
untaxed, then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things are going to happen for the uninsured, but we are
concerned about uncollected taxes,'' said John McCardle, a
spokesman for the Republican majority in the state Senate. ``It's a
mixed bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Conway, spokesman for Gov. George Pataki's budget
division, said that the budget office considered uncollected taxes
and potential declines in smoking in its calculations. He said
details would have to wait until the governor's budget presentation
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Cummings, with the state Department of Health's
Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, said what matters is that
cigarette smoking will decline. ``Yes, there are people who will
buy on the Internet and on Indian reservations, but a big
proportion? No. Will the tax have a deterrent effect on cigarette
smoking? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette sales declined elsewhere when taxes went up. Nobody
can say with certainty, though, whether those figures represented
fewer smokers, or more enterprising shoppers.

 JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ For the first time since Jan. 3, 1993, when
they made the greatest comeback in NFL history, the Buffalo Bills
will play the Tennessee Titans in the playoffs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the last day of the regular season, the Bills improved their
record to 11-5 with a 31-6 tuneup victory over AFC East champion
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills already had secured a wild-card berth. On Sunday, they
learned who their first-round opponent would be, and it didn't take
long for the veterans to start giving history lessons to the
younger players.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than playing the Houston Oilers _ the team they beat
41-38 in overtime after rallying from a 35-3 third-quarter deficit
_ the Bills travel to Nashville, Tenn., to tangle with the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've changed their nickname and their domicile, but the
game will be just as emotional and mean just as much as if they
were still the Oilers playing in Houston,'' said Buffalo's Ralph
Wilson, who, like the Titans' Bud Adams, is an original American
Football League owner. ``At that playoff game, I remember thinking
_ in all sincerity _ there was just no way a team could be behind
35-3 and hope to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about that game now, all I can remember is that I
did a lot of screaming and shook a lot of hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Titans, the Bills are on a roll. They finished the
season with a three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of strange to have 11 wins and have to hit the road,
but I think we'll be up to the challenge,'' Bills guard Ruben Brown
said. ``We've been playing well lately, and this is the time of
year you want to be playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to imagine the Bills playing better than Sunday,
when they put on one of their most impressive performances of the
season. After spotting the Colts a 3-0 lead, Buffalo pounded
Indianapolis into submission.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the most excited player on the field was Buffalo
receiver Andre Reed. In what may have been his last regular-season
game for the Bills, Reed caught five passes to give him 941 in his
career. He moved past Art Monk and into second place on the NFL's
all-time list behind Jerry Rice (1,249).
</P>
<P>
   Houston fans will remember that Reed, more than any other
player, was responsible for Buffalo overcoming the 32-point deficit
against the Oilers with three touchdown catches in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   By resting quarterback Doug Flutie against Indianapolis, Bills
coach Wade Phillips created a quarterback controversy. Flutie, who
has been erratic this season and has feuded with the media, watched
Rob Johnson complete 24 of 32 passes for 287 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start since early last season, Johnson wasn't
sacked and didn't throw an interception. He also contributed 36
yards rushing on seven carries.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Phillips insisted there was no quarterback
controversy despite persistent questions from reporters. Flutie
will start at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the mild-mannered Phillips bristled at yet another
Flutie/Johnson question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hey _ I've already answered all those questions,'' he
said. ``Look, I'm happy Rob played well. He did a tremendous job. I
wanted him to be as good as he could be. If we need him, we'll
utilize him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who left Jacksonville after the 1997 season and signed
with Buffalo as a free agent, began the 1998 season as the starter
but didn't play well. When he was injured, he was replaced by
Flutie, who guided the Bills to the playoffs and became one of the
most popular players in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   After picking apart the Colts and outplaying Indianapolis
quarterback Peyton Manning, who was 18-of-29 for 163 yards and
failed to throw a touchdown pass for the second consecutive game,
Johnson wasn't about to get caught up in a controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into that,'' Johnson said when asked if he
thought he should start against the Titans. ``It's not my decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would assume so (that it's Johnson's last game to play this
season), unless something happens to Doug. It was nice to play a
game like this because it gives my teammates confidence in me, but
it's not like my entire career was based on this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips made it clear to his players what the team wanted to
accomplish Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention was to win this game against a good team, and we
played that way,'' Phillips said. ``We wanted to get Andre the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with our vertical passing game, and our defense
played well against an offense that's one of the best in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Colts knew they had a first-round bye and a
second-round game at home, they didn't play with the intensity that
allowed them to win 10 consecutive games and set an NFL record by
making a 10-game improvement from last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' only points came on Mike Vanderjagt's field goals of
27 and 24 yards in the first half. Once coach Jim Mora knew that
Jacksonville was going to beat Cincinnati to secure the home-field
advantage in the AFC, he pulled several of his key starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked our tail just about every way it can be kicked,''
Mora said.

FIVE YOUTHS KILLED AFTER 1 TRUCK FLIPS ONTO ANOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MELODY McDONALD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Five youths were killed in a wreck Sunday
after the pickup they were riding in somersaulted over the grassy
highway median and landed upside down on another pickup,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the second pickup was transported by air to Harris
Methodist Fort Worth and was listed in serious condition Sunday
night, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the wreck melded the cabs of both trucks together
and it took more than two hours for officials to separate the
vehicles. Authorities identified the dead as Edward Jennings, 18;
Hank Gorman, 20; James McDonald, 15; John McDonald, 16; and Martin
McDonald, age unknown. Their hometowns were not released but
several carried driver's licenses from out-of-state, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1 p.m. accident occurred on Interstate 30 in far west Fort
Worth. The eastbound lanes were closed for about four hours while
workers cleared the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter ambulance sat idle in the eastbound lanes while
firefighters, using the jaws of life, freed the sole survivor from
the wreckage. His name was not released.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believe the youths' red Ford extended-cab
pickup was traveling south on Loop 820 when it exited onto I-30
westbound. The truck, which police say was driven by Jennings, was
going at a high speed and went out of control, authorities said. It
hit the grassy median, flipped through the air and landed upside
down on a green Chevy pickup going east, police spokesman Lt. Ric
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings was ejected and his body landed in a ditch near a
service road, 70 to 80 feet from the highway, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' relation to each other was unclear Sunday night,
but police Sgt. Anne Cummings said she believed they were related,
possibly cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my understanding that the parents live out of state,''
she said. ``The boys were in town working for an uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said there were no signs of alcohol at the scene. It was
not clear whether the victims were wearing seatbelts.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the accident, Larry Wheeler, 56, stood next to the
destruction and said he was lucky. He said he was driving west on
I-30 with his four grandchildren when he noticed the red truck
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The red truck almost hit us in the side,'' Wheeler said. ``He
just kept on coming. I blew my horn and he came across into the
ditch and then back across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing everything I could,'' Wheeler said. ``I had my
four grandkids in the vehicle and I was doing everything I could to
keep us safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The pickups were so mangled that it took more than two hours for
emergency workers to determine how many were involved in the crash.
They used a tow truck to lift the red truck so they could see
inside.
</P>
<P>
   They found four bodies, said Cummings, who was visibly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Clark described the impact as ``tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked Delta 191 (plane crash), but these four kids are
broken up,'' Clark said. ``It is bad. It is very bad.''

ARREST OF PINOCHET PROMPTS TORTURE VICTIMS TO CONFRONT THEIR
PASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 10th graf to CORRECT name of university to University of
Santiago DE CHILE) 
 (js) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ It was only when Mario Fernandez saw the
headline, ``Pinochet Under Arrest,'' that the dam broke and he
finally found it possible to talk about the beatings, the electric
shocks, the cigarette burns, the terrible sense of humiliation and
alienation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body froze; I had an intense allergic reaction, and I
didn't know whether to laugh or cry,'' said Fernandez, breaking
into a tremor at the memory. He ran to his wife and wept on her
shoulder, and, at long last, took her advice to seek therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to talk about the terror inside that hood they put on
me, of not knowing whether they would kill me from one minute to
the next,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is not alone in the anguished release that has come
with the arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in London on human rights
charges in October 1998. Psychologists report that hundreds, if not
thousands, of people like him have begun to see therapists, to
organize group therapy, to share their long-hidden horrors with
spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
   Although no accurate count exists, at least 40,000 Chileans were
tortured under the Pinochet dictatorship from 1973 until 1990,
people who had been members of leftist parties, unions, student
groups or even merely bureaucrats in the Socialist government of
President Salvador Allende Gossens.
</P>
<P>
   Some were tortured for information, some to drive them into
exile, some purely to intimidate them. In a systematic campaign run
by the armed forces and the police at special sites across the
country, they were raped, beaten, shocked, hooded, drugged, held
under water and deprived of sleep; they were subjected to mock
executions and months of solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   And when it ended in 1990, they were forgotten, overshadowed by
the 4,000 Chileans who disappeared altogether, resented by a
majority still suspicious of the political left, hounded by guilt
and anger, silently enduring the terrible mental scars of their
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Now 44 and unemployed, Fernandez _ who was a factory metal
worker in the Allende era _ still suffers from insomnia, chronic
head and joint aches and unsightly red blotches he calls an allergy
that run up and down his hands and arms. He said he seriously
contemplated suicide four times, once very nearly jumping off a
bridge until some passers-by stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   To this day no torturer has been investigated, no torturer has
been tried, no compensation has been paid. Too many military
officers were involved for the new civilian government to pursue
the issue without threatening the stability of a still-incomplete
transition to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Torture is the great dark secret in Chile's closet that is
just beginning to open a crack,'' said Alfredo Joselyn-Holt
Letelier, a historian at the University of Santiago de Chile. ``If
we can't deal with 4,000 disappeared easily, how are we going to
deal with 40,000, 70,000, or maybe even 100,000 torture victims?
The fact that we don't even have good statistics is a sign of how
we treat this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the arrest of Pinochet on a warrant issued by a
Spanish judge, reports about the torture charges against him have
begun to appear regularly in the press. Newly reinvigorated human
rights groups have come to victims, first seeking testimony they
could use in the courts in London and Madrid, then urging them to
seek help.
</P>
<P>
   One group of torture victims said 500 people sought its help
last year, three times as many as in 1998. A mental health program
sponsored by several Christian churches reported that monthly
demand had climbed from 60 patients a month before Pinochet's
arrest to 90, and was rising.
</P>
<P>
   Of 300 torture victims interviewed for testimony by the Group of
the Families of the Disappeared, for instance, at least 100 have
sought or plan to seek therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the small agricultural center of Rancagua, 50 miles south of
Santiago, newly organized torture victims recently held meetings
with 3,000 people who were fired from their jobs for political
reasons after the 1973 coup. They have identified 200 who suffer
various physical and psychological problems from torture and who
now have said they are willing to give testimony and seek help for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a snowball gathering momentum,'' said Jorge Pantoja,
a psychologist and director of the Christian program. Paz Rojas,
chief of neurological services at the University of Chile, said a
growing number of torture victims were appealing for help from
private doctors and psychologists. ``Pinochet's arrest was a great
catharsis that has begun to break the silence,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Uribe, a 48-year-old human rights activist with a warm
smile and confident countenance, dug through her pocketbook for
some pills as she prepared to leave her Santiago apartment to do
some errands the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better, I really do,'' she said in a strong,
steady voice. ``I still get my headaches, but maybe they are a
little better. Ever since I heard Pinochet would be judged for his
crimes, it has been a tremendous relief for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the horrendous torture she experienced _ Ms. Uribe said
that she was raped four times and that, among other things,
electric cables had repeatedly been clamped to her eyelids, lips,
tongue and around her head for bolts of shock during interrogation
sessions _ she appears to be the picture of a well-adjusted woman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Uribe has no ticks or obvious nervous habits as so many
other torture victims do. And although she refused to have her
photograph taken for this article, she spoke with surprising ease
about the disappearances of her husband, Fernando, and her sister
Barbara _ whose pictures, of each smiling broadly, one at a
wedding, the other at the beach _ she keeps posted on the wall next
to her desk.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Ms. Uribe managed to cope by helping around the
office of a local human rights group and marching with other
relatives of the disappeared for an accounting of her husband's and
sister's fates. She took it upon herself to find her torturers,
looking up their addresses in the telephone book, and even to
confront the wives of men she believes raped her.
</P>
<P>
   She says the repeated torture sessions _ some combined with
interrogations _ still made no sense to her. She had belonged to a
radical group that supported the Allende government, but she said
she never did anything more extreme than to plaster walls with
posters. Her interrogators' claims that she had been a threat to
the state were absurd, she said. But through her years of exile in
Mexico and her eventual return to Chile, she mainly kept silent
about her terrible experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own torture always took second place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed a few weeks after Pinochet's arrest, when her
daughter Barbara sat down with her on her living room couch to
discuss the disappearance of her aunt and namesake.
</P>
<P>
   The two had discussed the terror of the Pinochet years many
times in the past, but this time was different. Like many other
family members of the disappeared, Barbara was gathering testimony
for the human rights lawyers in London and Madrid. Under her
daughter's pressing, for the first time Ms. Uribe told her of the
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like vomiting, all the horrible things flowing out
uncontrollably,'' she recalled. ``The torturers are always inside
of me.'' The very next day, Ms. Uribe entered therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Torture had always taken a distant second place to the
disappearances as a political crime and public issue in Chile, but
the Pinochet case has finally pushed the subject front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he took power in 1990, President Patricio Aylwin
established a commission that documented more than 3,000
disappearances during the Pinochet years. But the panel left
torture out of its report, except for cases that ended in death,
leaving many torture victims feeling abandoned and cheated.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for their exclusion goes to the heart of Chile's slow
democratic transition. Pinochet remained a potent political force
as commander in chief of the army until he stepped down from that
post in early 1998, and human rights investigations would have
threatened the uneasy civilian-military balance. Torture was a
particularly sensitive subject because it involved a far greater
number of military officers and units than the disappearances,
which were largely the work of two quasi-independent military
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pinochet's arrest, President Eduardo Frei has pressed to
block the general's extradition to Spain, contending that any trial
should be in Chile. His position has been supported by Ricardo
Lagos, a Socialist Party member who is the presidential candidate
of the Socialist-Christian Democratic coalition that has governed
the country for the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   That position has caused anger and pain among many torture
victims, including Fernandez, the unemployed metal worker. ``Their
betrayal,'' he said, ``is the cause of my pounding headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts were made to interview senior officials in the
presidential palace and Health Ministry, but aides said they were
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of democracy spurred only modest efforts to help
torture victims resuscitate their lives. The government established
a small unit in the Ministry of Health called the Program for the
Integral Repair of Health and Human Rights to treat torture
victims, former political prisoners and family members of the
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 through 1998, 31,102 people received at least some
attention, but over time the program has withered and several
administrators have resigned in frustration. Today many of the
program's original 13 teams _ which were to include a doctor, a
nurse, a social worker and a psychologist _ are now down to a nurse
and social worker. Foreign financing for private and public
agencies that help torture victims has dried up, in part because
the government has refused to pitch in matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Patricia Narvaez, a senior administrator at the health
ministry program, said first-time visits of torture victims last
year for treatment at her agency were up 20 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are great,'' Ms. Narvaez said. ``Some, especially on
the right, wanted to shove this subject into the past, but we have
all been full of silence. It's macabre. It's a phenomenon of
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a conspiracy of silence, the victims are a part of
it. Psychologists say many of the victims are still embarrassed
that they survived while others were executed. Some feel shame for
having given up names of comrades to their torturers, while others
feel paranoia at the thought that people may think they did even
when they did not.
</P>
<P>
   But now their grievances have taken on international legitimacy,
and as the Pinochet case has propelled torture to the top of the
agenda of international human rights law, many torture survivors
say they are happy their testimony can have legal value for the
cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the House of Lords in Britain ruled that Pinochet
could be extradited to Spain on charges of torture and conspiracy
to commit torture only after his government signed the
international Convention against Torture in 1988. A judicial panel
of seven members of the House of Lords, known as the Law Lords,
further ruled that torture was an international crime for which any
court in a country that has signed the convention has jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish judge who issued the warrant for
Pinochet's arrest and who wants to try him in Spain, has
prominently included charges of torture in his case against the
former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of former political prisoners here is
preparing to file the first criminal complaint in a Chilean court
accusing Pinochet, as well as an undetermined number of former
officers, of torture. The hope, leaders of the group say, is to
imprison the leaders of the former military government's vast
torture apparatus and to collect millions of dollars in reparations
from the government. They are beginning with 50 cases and hope to
expand their complaint to 500 in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinochet's arrest catalyzed us,'' said Raul Reyes, a
60-year-old bookseller who is one of the organizers of the
complaint. ``During the dictatorship, we were stigmatized as
criminals and terrorists, and even rebuffed by our families. That's
changing now, albeit slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the change, a lot of torture victims say they feel no
better. As a group, experts say, they still experience high rates
of alcoholism, family violence and chronic unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mortal sin to be 52 years old and a returned political
exile or torture victim,'' said Antonio Ozimica, who is all three.
``People isolate you, and you can't find work.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that has changed for Ozimica since Pinochet's arrest. In
fact, he said he has only felt worse watching the government
working hard to defend the former dictator against extradition. He
has begun therapy at a public hospital under a new government
program to help people who lost their jobs for political reasons,
but relief appears distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lavin wins,'' he said, referring to Joaquin Lavin, the
former official in Pinochet's planning ministry who stands a good
chance of winning the presidency Jan. 16, ``I am going to put a
pistol to my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozimica appears to be a particularly frail man, even among
torture victims. He goes from giddy highs to the deepest lows of
depression from one moment to the next. After what he has gone
through, his gloom is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   As Ozimica tells it, his only crime was to serve as a low-level
accountant in Allende's agrarian reform in the town of Temuco.
Shortly after the coup, he was dismissed and then pulled out of bed
by troops in the middle of the night and dragged through the
streets naked.
</P>
<P>
   For six days he went through torturous interrogation at a local
police station, and he said he had nothing of value to tell them.
For two days he was kept in total darkness, he recalled, the next
two under intense fluorescent lights burning into his eyes. Then
for two more days, he said, he was hung by his wrists, causing the
dislocation of his right shoulder, which is still maimed. He also
lost the ability to feel in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   In another torture session, police dunked him repeatedly in a
tub of water. As he gasped for air, his torturers pulled him up by
his hair and smashed metal plates against his ears until blooded
flooded out of one of them. He remains hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   After months of imprisonment, Ozimica said, he was allowed to
leave the country, and he settled in an Indian village deep in the
Venezuelan Amazon, where he lived for 18 years in a hut under a
zinc roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``The torture made me hate life,'' he said. ``I was so
dehumanized, I figured only the Indians were human beings because
they were nonviolent and they didn't lie. And I didn't need hearing
because it was so quiet in the wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozimica said that he had made a living making cement bricks, but
that his wife left him and took their two children back to Chile.
He finally came back too, after democracy returned, but he still
does not live in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinochet's arrest didn't give me happiness or sadness because
his falling prisoner doesn't solve anything,'' he said. ``So many
of the people who were behind him are still around.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GIANTS NEED MORE TALENT AND MORE LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-GIANTS-COWBOYS, FBN-COWBOYS) 
(rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys' owner, put his
team's 26-18 victory Sunday in perspective and inadvertently put
the New York Giants in perspective as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get too foaming at the mouth over winning this
game,'' he said. ``We should beat the Giants here at home with as
much at stake as we got with the players that we got. We should
beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   And beat them the Cowboys did.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not a stunning loss by the Giants. In fact, these
last three weeks have not been disappointing or surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jessie Armstead was asked to think back to Dec. 12,
when the Giants stunned Buffalo on a last-second field goal. Did he
think then, when the team was 7-6, that its season would be over
three weeks later? Certainly not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't grab the moment,'' he said. ``This has been a
down year in the conference. Now it's a down year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That miraculous moment in Buffalo was the high-water point for
these Giants. After that they were in over their head, in
competition and expectations. The Giants lost to St. Louis, 31-10,
and Minnesota, 34-17, and Sunday they were down 26-10 before
finishing with a heroic rush.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled: the Giants aren't that good.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones said, a team like the Cowboys, with an infrastructure
of leadership in Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders, is
supposed to beat a team like the Giants with islands of talent and
muzzled leadership.
</P>
<P>
   This week Giants coach Jim Fassel is going to talk to his
players and issue evaluations. When he gets to Armstead and
defensive end Michael Strahan, the coach may want to ask them to
take an active role in determining the type of players the Giants
need. The NFL is becoming more explosive, filled with exciting,
big-play players. Even Smith, the Cowboys' 30-year-old running
back, has bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Since being criticized by Fassel for outspoken criticisms of his
team's play, Armstead has pulled back and the team has lost some of
its fire. That leadership is the difference between the Giants and
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have leaders,'' Armstead said. ``They know what it takes
to win. They might have a bad play, they might even have a bad
game, but they keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants, who finished 7-9, need more leadership and more
talent, and Armstead knows it. Dallas made plays Sunday, Minnesota
made big plays, St. Louis made big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disappointing way to finish the season,'' Fassel
said. ``The guys gave a good effort. I thought they tried. We just
weren't good. In the past weeks we've played playoff teams and we
weren't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   You knew this was going to happen; knew it. The Giants were
reeling, clinging to the dream of a playoff berth for about 15
minutes. Somewhere between the national anthem and the opening
kickoff, their playoff hopes were squashed as Green Bay finished
routing Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't have anything to do with losing,'' Fassel said.
``They didn't go through the motions today. We just weren't good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstead dressed quickly Sunday and then sat in front of his
dressing stall and tried to put five months of disappointment into
neat sound bites. He couldn't. That's not Armstead's nature. The
closing loss, in a game that wasn't quite as close as the
eight-point margin of defeat indicated, ``leaves a bad taste in
your mouth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was a last day of contingencies in a season of
contingencies, when everyone in the league seemed to need someone
else to secure a playoff berth. The Giants' playoff hopes included
the slim chance that anemic Arizona would march into Lambeau Field
and defeat the Packers. The Giants needed Arizona to negate the
effect of the Giants' two shocking losses to the Cardinals: by 14-3
on Oct. 10 and by 34-24 on Nov. 28. There was the Giants' infamous
game in Washington on Nov. 21 when key players, Armstead in
particular, complained about the offense's lack of production.
</P>
<P>
   Once Green Bay won Sunday, the Giants had to defeat Dallas by 56
points more than the Packers' margin of victory, so that required
an 81-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams were in a similar position. There was a burlesque
quality to the NFL's final day, a points orgy as teams were forced
into gratuitous scoring against punching-dummy teams to secure
home-field advantage or a playoff berth. Some teams were playing
not just the opponent on the field but also a multidimensional
competition in which they faced the opponent at hand and one
hundreds of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, the team at hand for the Giants, was too much. Now the
Giants join the other also-rans on the sideline. They will reflect
and reassess. Hopefully the team's hierarchy will take the muzzle
off a player like Armstead and ask for his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they ask me, I'll answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had better ask. Big Blue needs a fresh view of
itself.

Green in 1963. Ms. Green was 101 years old when she died of kidney
failure at a hospital in Manhattan on Saturday afternoon, a few
hours after the new century began with the year 2000. By the
ordinary measures of a life in a city of power and riches such as
New York, which had been her lifelong home, she was an unknown
woman. She had never married, and for 60 years had worked for a
Wall Street law firm as a secretary, librarian and chief clerk,
retiring 22 years ago. And if it had not been for the timing of her
death, which gave her a foothold in three centuries, perhaps no one
would have cared enough to write about her. (The New York Times)

   (NYT11) NEW YORK -- Jan. 2, 2000 -- 3CENTURY-LIFE -- Charlotte
Green in 1963. Ms. Green was 101 years old when she died of kidney
failure at a hospital in Manhattan on Saturday afternoon, a few
hours after the new century began with the year 2000. By the
ordinary measures of a life in a city of power and riches such as
New York, which had been her lifelong home, she was an unknown
woman. She had never married, and for 60 years had worked for a
Wall Street law firm as a secretary, librarian and chief clerk,
retiring 22 years ago. And if it had not been for the timing of her
death, which gave her a foothold in three centuries, perhaps no one
would have cared enough to write about her. (The New York Times)

Linus Torlvalds, left, and David Ditzel are both involved in
Transmeta, a microprocessor design company in Sunnyvale, Calif.
Transmeta has so far managed to keep its product, scheduled to be
introduced on Jan. 19, a secret. In today's valley, bored with
me-too Internet start-ups, much of the buzz about Transmeta
suggests the company has found a way both to simplify processor
circuitry and to accelerate the running of instructions on other
chips, like Intel's. (Peter DaSilva/The New York Times)

   (NYT9) ATHENS, Greece -- Jan. 2, 2000 -- OBIT-ZUMWALT -- Chief
of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., right, talks with
a naval officer upon his arrival for naval activities in the area
in 1972. Zumwalt, who as chief of naval operations in the early
1970s ordered the Navy to end racial discrimination and demeaning
restrictions on sailors, then faced a haunting personal tragedy
that he related to ordering the deployment of the defoliate Agent
Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday at the Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C. He was 79 and lived in McLean, Va. (The New

Gertrude Warren, 52, a health aide, cares for Goldye Saturn, 91,
who suffered a stroke, and her husband, Al, 92, in their home in
the Bronx. A shortage of home health-care nurses and aides and
nursing-home assistants has deepened in the last two years
throughout the country as better-paying jobs with better conditions
have opened up for the women who have traditionally filled those
positions, which have low wages and few benefits. (Joyce

nurses and aides and nursing-home assistants has deepened in the
last two years as better-paying jobs with better conditions have

   (NYT6) LOS ANGELES -- Jan. 2, 2000 -- Y2K-WORKERS-DISPERSE-2 --
For Randall Bart year 2000 work proved to be a short-lived bonanza.
After being laid off from Unisys, the computer maker, in 1988, Bart
did not find work as a programmer until 10 years later, when Y2K
made what he calls his ``obsolete experience'' worth $45 an hour.
But his last job ended in August and Bart, 43, who lives in Los
Angeles, has been unable to find work since. ``I'm hoping for some
big disaster somewhere to hit,'' he says, only half joking.

   (NYT5) BRIDGEWATER, N.J. -- Jan. 2, 2000 --
Y2K-WORKERS-DISPERSE-1 -- For Paul J. Maszczak, becoming Year 2000
manager for C.R. Bard Inc., a medical-device manufacturer in Murray
Hill, N.J., was a career-transforming experience. The job lifted
him out of the narrow confines of the information technology
department, exposing him to all aspects of his company's business.
Now, with those efforts winding down, Maszczak thinks his broader
business knowledge has prepared him for a bigger management job. As
for day-to-day systems work, ``I could never go back,'' he says.
``We're free agents.'' (Frank C. Dougherty/The New York Times)

   (NYT4) WASHINGTON -- Jan. 2, 2000 -- ROSTENKOWSKI-PROFILE -- Dan
Rostenkowski, 72, the one-time, all-powerful chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, has been well-received in Washington. It
has been two years since he finished his ``sabbatical'' at the
Oxford, Wis., prison compound and the halfway house that came next.
Rostenkowski paid his 17-month penance for using taxpayer money to
buy chairs and crystal domes for his friends and to hire people to
mow his lawn. Suddenly, he's popping up all over Washington, a
place he feared might throw a permanent sneer his way. (Todd
Buchanan/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT3) PHILADELPHIA -- Jan. 2, 2000 -- FCC-BARBER -- David J.
Farber, 65, a University of Pennsylvania professor and a pioneering
computer scientist and telecommunications expert, is expected to be
appointed the chief technologist at the Federal Communications
Commission. As a government witness at the Microsoft trial last
year, Farber argued against one of Microsoft's main contentions:
that the way the company had chosen to integrate its browser
software into its Windows operating system was the only possible
technical alternative. (Marty Katz/The New York Times)

   (NYT2) MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Jan. 2, 2000 -- KHOSLA-PROFILE --
Vinod Khosla, partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers,
discusses strategy at a meeting. Khosla started his first company
at age 25. Two years later, he co-founded Sun Microsystems. At age
44, his vision has turned metaphysical, to a time when human
thought melds with computer intelligence, blurring the lines
between people and machines. ``In the next 100 years, traditional
religion will be as relevant as witch doctors are today,'' he says.

ARGENTINA'S FORMER PRESIDENT STILL AT CENTER STAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ As president, Carlos Saul Menem
dominated Argentine news coverage for more than a decade by selling
off much of the government and pegging the peso to the dollar _ not
to mention racing sports cars, throwing his wife out of the
presidential palace and dating women half his age.
</P>
<P>
   Now out of power for barely three weeks, Menem has managed to
remain at the center of attention. He has sometimes even managed to
overshadow the always demure President Fernando de la Rua, who
campaigned promising a new style of government.
</P>
<P>
   Menem holds ``shadow Cabinet'' meetings with his former aides,
as early as 8:30 a.m., as if he were still president and they still
had ministries to run. He is serving as broker for his Justicialist
Party ticket for municipal elections in Buenos Aires in 2000,
apparently shoving aside his own former justice minister, who won a
mayoral primary just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And with great fanfare, Menem has started an effort to form an
international extension of his party to spread the hard-to-describe
populist ideology and legacy of Gen. Juan D. Peron worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Menem is still the talk of Buenos Aires. His presidential
memoirs are being sold at kiosks and bookstores on every street
corner, and a salacious tell-all biography titled ``Menem: The
Private Life,'' is a runaway best seller. The otherwise serious
political magazine 3 Puntos ran a long article last week on how the
gliterati of Punta del Este, the Uruguayan beach resort that caters
to Argentina's jet set, were waiting for Menem and his entourage to
arrive this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's lingering larger-than-life presence has raised eyebrows
among fellow politicians, some of whom are beginning publicly to
question his sanity. ``He sometimes seems to lose touch with
reality,'' Eduardo Duhalde, Menem's former vice president, said in
a radio interview last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Wornat, the author of the Menem personal biography, said:
``Since leaving power, Menem has been depressed. He loves power
more than anything, including his family. He'll do anything he can
to be in the middle of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Never shy about throwing his weight around, Menem challenged the
de la Rua administration last week, threatening to tell untold
secrets about the new powers-that-be should his former senior aides
come under too much scrutiny for possible past corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The response has been ferocious. Menem has become the target of
what looks like a carefully choreographed campaign by de la Rua
cabinet members and several leaders of his own party to cut him
down to size once and for all. And the local news media are piling
on.
</P>
<P>
   The brouhaha began over the indictment a week ago of one of the
least illustrious officials of the Menem era _ Victor Alderete, who
ran the national pensioners welfare institute. Alderete is accused
of skimming money that was to be used for hearing aids, taking
kickbacks from companies involved in physical therapy, and keeping
an enemies list and files of critics, including journalists.
</P>
<P>
   So far, de la Rua has been cautious about investigating
corruption, apparently preferring to wheel and deal with the
opposition to get his budget and tax package through Congress. But
several of his aides hope the Alderete case is just the beginning
of a hard look into what the news media here describe as deep
pockets of corruption throughout the Menem government.
</P>
<P>
   Not taking any chances, Menem embraced Alderete as a man ``who
did his best'' and lashed out at his opponents for engaging in a
``witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they keep pursuing this,'' Menem said, ``we are going to
have to talk about things we don't necessarily care to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   What Menem was suggesting was far from clear, but his comment
sent reporters around town scurrying for a response.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua would not take the bait, refusing to comment with a
wave of his hand and an equally unclear, ``Oh no, not about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vice President Carlos Alvarez, who has emerged as the most
outspoken member of the administration, said that Menem's
suggestive remarks ``appear to come straight from the script of the
movie `The Godfather.''' He added, ``Nothing will stop the process
under way to shed light on what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Health Minister Hector Lombardo said of Menem: ``By defending
people who acted corruptly he is involving himself in the
corruption. If he has something to say, he should say it now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Social Welfare Minister Graciela Fernandez Meijide, who has
long called for Menem's prosecution, said, ``If he knew about
corruption and did nothing about it, that amounts to malfeasance.''
</P>
<P>
   Menem says he has nothing to hide and that any investigation
into his actions would merely be a political tactic to stop his
already announced run for the presidency for the 2003 election.
</P>
<P>
   But what has perhaps been most revealing about the dispute is
how leading former Menem allies, including his two vice presidents,
are backing the investigation into Alderete and criticizing Menem's
public support of the former pension manager.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Carlos Ruckauf, who is now governor of
Buenos Aires province, has called Menem's comments ``inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde, whom de la Rua defeated in the presidential race, said,
``No way is this a witch hunt.'' He went on to blame the declining
fortunes of his party on Menem's personal ambitions and ego. ``I
will make sure that doesn't happen again,'' he said, adding that he
will challenge the former president for leadership of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   All the tough talk from such a powerful array of people has some
analysts predicting the final downfall of the man who has dominated
Argentine politics ever since he made his appearance on the
national scene in 1989 with his wild sideburns and reckless driving
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menemism is going to disappear,'' predicted Domingo Cavallo,
Menem's former economy minister and now a critic.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the last embers will surely be bright.

NEW STRICT RULES THWART MENTALLY ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Fewer and fewer people in the Phoenix area are
entering the state's mental health system under the category of
``seriously mentally ill.''
</P>
<P>
   A crackdown in eligibility by state officials is swamping mental
health advocates - paid by the state to police the system - and
forcing advocates to turn people away, a possible violation of
state law.
</P>
<P>
   Under an increasingly rigid process, even people ordered by
Superior Court judges to be hospitalized or treated are not being
considered seriously mentally ill, or SMI.
</P>
<P>
   People previously considered SMI by Arizona have been turned
down, as have people who have qualified for Social Security
disability and those diagnosed as SMI by psychiatrists of Value
Options, a state-funded, bu private, mental-health provider.
</P>
<P>
   SMI status means patients can receive medications for free or at
a greatly reduced rate. They may be able to get onto a list for
subsidized housing. They also can get added help through the court
monitor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of H.alth Services says it realizes rules
have been rigorously applied, but their intent is to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   However, a monitor appointed by Maricopa County Superior Court
to oversee mental-health issues says the new process has been
overzealous to the point of violating state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The department disagrees with that assessment, but it
nevertheless is making some fixes, said Michael Franczak, the state
agency's head of SMI services.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Improvements can't come soon enough for Mary Ann Black,
director of advocacy services for Advocates of the Seriously
Mentally Ill, a non-profit agency paid by the state to be a
patients' rights watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Because advocates are getting flooded with calls from people
trying to get into the system, it's difficult for them to work on
other issues, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the office got 58 calls from people recently denied
SMI status. In the past, they have received as few as a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Black and other mental health advocates started hearing more
complaints when Value Options, a Tennessee-based corporation, began
in February as the managed-care company for mental-health services
in Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in May 1997, 514 people applied for SMI services at
Value Options' predecessor ComCare. Of those, 180 were approved. In
contrast, during May 1999, 368 applied and 62 were approved.
</P>
<P>
   On average, about 450 people apply every month to be considered
SMI. Those seeking help may come by themselves or be referred by
physicians, the jails or homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   A Value Options employee interviews them and sends their
information to a Value Options psychiatrist, who determines whether
they meet the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Franczak believes that many of the Phoenix area's
12,000 seriously mentally ill don't belong on the rolls. Many were
lured into the system because of the benefits, especially as funds
for less-serious mental illness and substance-abuse programs dried
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``SMI is a special club and a lot of people want to belong to
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way in hell that some of these guys are SMI.''
</P>
<P>
   The state spends about $11,000 per year on each seriously
mentally ill person in the system. That's not enough to meet their
needs, and the money shouldn't be wasted on people who don't need
it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One of the most contentious issues between the state and the
advocates has been ``dual-diagnosis'' patients, those who have
substance-abuse problems as well as mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Franczak agrees that the state has been ``pretty rigid'' and
Value Options has been ``very rigid'' in those cases, in some cases
saying that if a person has both problems, then it's probably
alcohol or drug abuse - not mental illness - that is the overriding
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The state now is looking at a plan in which people with both
symptoms will be allowed 30 to 60 days of counseling before Value
Options tries to determine their status.
</P>
<P>
   The state also wants to give patients more time to get their
medical records. Current policy requires a decision to be made in
seven days after the application is turned in. Frequently, people
can't meet the deadline because their records are out of state.
Without those, people can't prove they have a long-standing illness
and they are denied.
</P>
<P>
   Value Options also plans to improve how people collect data from
prospective patients.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Ronan, an attorney with the Arizona Center for Disability
Law, said she was glad that the state recognized the problem, but
it should change its overall policy rather than make minor fixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be looking at ways to bring people into the system
rather than reasons for excluding (them) from services,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; People who have been turned down can always reapply, Franczak
said.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, they have been going to people like Black and
her advocates to fight their case through three levels of
administrative and court hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Black said her office doesn't have the staff to prepare for the
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, with two full-time employees and five part-timers,
Black says she doesn't have the staff mandated by state law. She
has two part-timers to handle 11,000 Maricopa County clients, while
the state requires one advocate for every 2,500 patients.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the short staffings is that the
advocates' agency gets $87,000 a year. When the state ran the
advocates' office, instead of contracting out the services, it had
a $500,000 budget, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Black is trying to negotiate for additional staff. But because
of the crunch, her staff will only take the first five new
eligibility cases each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that we certainly don't want to do, but there
comes a point when you can't do anymore,'' she said. ``The numbers
have just skyrocketed, and (there is) no way were we prepared for
it.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX _ This year, Arizonans will be able to vote for
president about as often as they get an oil change _ and it will
all be legal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current presidential primary arrangement, voters could
legally cast ballots in the primary elections of the two major
political parties, election and party officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   Voters could then go on to vote for a candidate in the Reform
Party in the summer and cap off all of this multipartisan mischief
with a vote in November for one of the three people they helped
nominate.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could vote for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to world-class political chaos, Arizona-style.
</P>
<P>
   County and state election officials acknowledge that two-fisted
voting could be the result of the scheduling of Republican and
Democratic primaries on separate days 18 days apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it would be possible,'' conceded Maricopa County
Recorder Helen Purcell.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Purcell doubts that voters, many of whom have
proven themselves to be less than excited about voting at all in
recent years, will be inspired to take advantage of the loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get 'em to go to the polls once, much less twice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The snarl begins on Feb. 22, the day Arizona Republicans will
vote in a taxpayer-supported presidential preference primary.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the thread leads to March 11, when Arizona
Democrats, constrained by their national rules, hold a separate and
privately financed election.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for mischief arises because the Democrats allow
their members to register to vote up to and including the day of
the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   That means there is nothing to prevent Arizona residents who
register as Republicans by that party's deadline of Monday, Jan.
24, to re-register as Democrats on or before March 11 to cast a
second ballot.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage this type of double-dipping at the polls,
Democratic officials say they plan to require voters to sign a form
swearing that they did not vote in any other primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   But the form isn't worth a jot legally, officials admit, because
there are no consequences for signing it with your fingers crossed
behind your back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's probably not something we could enforce
legally,'' conceded Mark Fleisher, chairman of the Arizona
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will have a third crack at the ballot box next summer,
when the Reform Party intends to hold a national primary election
by mail. The party will allow any registered voter, including
Democrats and Republicans, to participate in an effort to encourage
more interest in the party.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party will then hold a national convention at which
only Reform Party members will be permitted to ratify the party's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Reform Party Chairman Eugene Kerkman said he does not
believe Democrats and Republicans will face ``wholesale'' voter
shenanigans, but he is aware of some people who intend to vote, as
the saying goes, early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are people who do exactly that,'' Kerkman said,
adding that such unauthorized attempts to interfere with another
party's election are ``kind of malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, we've completely lost our sense of
ethics,'' Kerkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the Natural Law Party, with only 70 registered voters,
has already qualified for the ballot, while Kerkman's Reform Party,
which can boast at least one candidate (Pat Buchanan) who got
93,000 votes for president in Arizona in 1996, has not. But the
Reformers, who have 800 registered voters, are working on that.
They have until May.
</P>
<P>
   In another wrinkle that could have important implications for
the Democratic presidential candidates, members of the state
Democratic Party will vote Jan. 22 on whether to allow Independent
voters to participate in their primary.
</P>
<P>
   If the party approves the participation of Independent voters,
it is widely believed that Bill Bradley, who has spent a lot of
time appealing to Independents, will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   State election officials have been aware of the opportunities
for mischief for some time. Last year they tried to get the
Democrats to change their plans and participate in the presidential
preference primary on the same day as Republicans. They even
offered to try to get a joint primary date moved back to March and
proposed an all-mail ballot election to accommodate the Democrats'
national rules, which prevent them from holding their election in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, rebuffed by the Democratic National Committee, state
officials gave up their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursued different ways to have more uniformity in how this
was going to happen, but we just couldn't get any traction,'' said
Jessica Funkhouser, state elections director.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Democrats are running their own show, state
officials are powerless to monitor their election, meaning that the
only safeguard in place is the Democratic Party's sign-up sheet
requiring that voters affirm that they haven't already voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep trying to emphasize that the Democrats are not
participating in a state election,'' Funkhouser said. ``We don't
have any jurisdiction over who they allow to participate in their
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a scenario in which Democrats register as Republicans and
then re-register as Democrats, it would be the Republicans who
could end up hurt, as conceivably Democrats would wish to vote for
the presidential candidate with the least chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said state GOP Chairman Mike Minnaugh, who laughingly
dismissed any concerns about a Democratic raid on his party's
primary. The Democrats, he suggested, have a hard enough time
getting their own members to the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are so concerned about a particular (Republican)
candidate that they are going to get their two people together and
go and re-register,'' Minnaugh joked.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said Democrats are not encouraging such a scheme.
</P>
<P>
   And, pointing out that Democrats went through much the same
routine in 1996, asking voters to promise they weren't voting
twice, Fleisher said he is confident there will be no organized
attempt to subvert the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would interpret it as voter fraud,'' Fleisher
said, adding that ``most people will act responsibly if they think
they're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Fleisher said he worries about the potential for such
contretemps to backfire. For instance, Democrats could
inadvertently help elect a candidate who is anathema to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems to backfire when you try to do something like
that,'' Fleisher said. ``I think the Republicans should put forth
their best candidate, and the Democrats should put forth their best
candidate.'' &QL;

MENTAL (Phoenix) _ Fewer and fewer people in the Phoenix area
entering the state's mental health system under the category of
``seriously mentally ill.'' A crackdown in eligibility by state
officials is swamping mental health advocates _ paid by the state

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Her name was Charlotte Green, and she was 101 years
old when she died of kidney failure at a hospital in Manhattan on
Saturday, a few hours after the year 2000 began. By the ordinary
measures of a life in this city of power and riches that had been
her lifelong home, she was an unknown woman.
</P>
<P>
   She had never married, and for 60 years had worked for a Wall
Street law firm as a secretary, librarian and chief clerk, retiring
22 years ago. And if it had not been for the span of her life,
which gave her a foothold in three centuries, perhaps no one would
have cared enough to write about her.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a history in every life, as Shakespeare noted, and
a few people who loved Miss Green _ relatives, friends and
colleagues _ took a few hours on the telephone Sunday to remember a
tall, intelligent, graceful woman who was a perceptive witness to
the 20th century of her city, from horse-and-buggy days to the
building of its skyline and the rise of its great institutions.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to do everything in her beloved city, they said, and
came close. She saw Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium and Enrico Caruso
at the old Metropolitan Opera and had subscriptions to the New York
City Ballet, New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall. She rode on
trolley cars, worked for $6 a week, wore ribbed stockings and
recalled winters before there was snow removal.
</P>
<P>
   At Lord, Day &AMP; Lord, the now-defunct, once-prestigious law firm
where she worked from 1918 to 1978, she became the most
indispensable non-lawyer in the house, supervising the nonlegal
staff and library and keeping track of court dates and case
obligations for 125 lawyers, who represented such clients as the
Cunard ship line, The New York Times and the Metropolitan Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Green, as everyone at the firm called her, was an original
tenant of Stuyvesant Town on the Lower East Side, moving into a
$65-a-month, one-bedroom apartment in 1947 and staying on until the
end of her life. On her vacations, she traveled the world _ to
Europe, India, South America, Africa and Asia, to China for six
weeks at the age of 85 _ savoring restaurants, theaters, museums,
galleries and exotic street life, just as she did in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed to be good at everything _ playing the piano,
photography, golf, foreign languages, cooking. But Sunday, as those
closest to her recalled, it was her quiet kindnesses, her
generosity and her way with people that seemed to place her in the
obituary pantheon of corporate giants and political sachems.
</P>
<P>
   ``She touched everybody's life,'' Miss Green's niece, Joan M.
Appleby, of Wayside, N.J., said. ``It was how she made you feel
when you spoke to her. She was very interested in you, the other
person. She was probably the most remarkable woman I ever knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Lea Layng, 90, who worked with Miss Green at Lord, Day &AMP; Lord
for 30 years, said it was her friend who persuaded her to marry at
the age of 50. ``I met him on a blind date, and she met him,'' Ms.
Layng recalled. ``Later, he asked me to marry him and she said, `Do
it.' I always attributed my marriage to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Leaman, 84, who worked for Lord, Day &AMP; Lord for 50 years
and, because of a boyhood encounter, knew Miss Green for 76 years,
remembered her as a clerical keystone at the firm, keeping track of
business and appointments for everyone. ``She was the grand dame
all right,'' he said. ``Everyone liked her. She had a hell of a
good mind. She didn't equivocate, but had a subdued manner. Not the
bossy type. This is before the girls got emancipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Davis, a relative who published a family genealogy in
1997, put it this way: ``Be all you can be and see all you can see
aptly describes Charlotte's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Green was born in Manhattan on Aug. 25, 1898, the year
that 40 local governments were consolidated into New York City. She
was the oldest of three children of William Green, a printer, and
his wife, Rose, who cleaned houses to add income to the
impoverished family. Charlotte was always close to her siblings,
Jerome, who was born in 1903 and died 15 years ago, and Harriet
Green Masury, who was born in 1900 and died in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The family migrated to the Bronx early in the century. Ms.
Davis, who interviewed Miss Green for her genealogy, said she
described her childhood as happy, though she did not receive her
first doll until she was eight, and her first new dress was a gift
from a cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Green remembered winters adrift in snow, playing jacks on
the sidewalk, trolley cars and annual Fourth of July outings to
Coney Island. Her father took her to see Babe Ruth, talked about
the day's news over the dinner table; her mother did the family
laundry weekly with a hand-wringer and two washtubs.
</P>
<P>
   At 10, the girl began taking piano lessons from a cousin; her
mother cleaned the cousin's house in exchange, but the value was
incalculable: it began a lifelong love of music that made the work
of Beethoven and Mozart and others so indelible that she could hear
it with crystalline clarity in her head in the last years of her
life, though she had lost her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   She was a good student at Morris High School, taking commercial
courses and graduating, after three years, in 1916. Her first
clerical job paid $6 a week, and did not last long. But her second,
as a stenographer for a lawyer, paid more and quickly rose to $15
and then $18 a week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1918, at the age of 20, she got a job with Lord, Day &AMP; Lord,
which had been founded in 1848 and was already one of the most
prestigious in the city, specializing in civil practice, including
maritime law, real estate and estates and trusts. Its offices at 49
Wall St., and later in the Cunard building at 25 Broadway, near the
Customs House on Bowling Green, were thickly carpeted, with oil
paintings on the walls and many offices paneled with lustrous
woods.
</P>
<P>
   A picture from 1918 shows her as a thin young woman with a
longish nose, a prominent chin, carefully waved hair parted on the
left, and a serious, almost solemn face above the prim collar of a
dress with a row of pearl buttons down the front. She is not
wearing glasses, though she seems to need them.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, the cornea of her right eye was scratched, and
despite _ or perhaps because of _ repeated operations, she had
vision problems all her life, compounding the hardship of the heavy
reading she was obliged to do in her work and in her legion of
outside interests.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Green took dictation longhand and transcribed it on a
typewriter. But she later took evening courses at Columbia
University and New York University to improve her English and
writing skills, and she was promoted in the 1930s to librarian and
then to manager of law clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Leaman, whose father had been head of the law firm's real estate
department, recalled meeting Miss Green on a trip to the office as
a boy in the 1920s. She gave him paper clips to play with, and he
remembered her when he became a lawyer at the firm in 1940. Even
then, he said, she was ``the nerve center of the office.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As managing clerk, Miss Green kept track of all litigation and
the calendars for executing it, informed lawyers when they had to
file briefs and appeals and meet other court dates, and read all
briefs, not for legal reasons, but for grammar, punctuation and
what Leaman called ``persuasiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   While her education was limited, she was very intelligent, he
said, and was entrusted with a job that another law firm would
ordinarily have assigned to a lawyer _ the negotiation of workman's
compensation injury claims. Since Lord, Day &AMP; Lord represented
Cunard, which had hundreds of ships and thousands of seamen, there
were hundreds of such claims to be negotiated, and Miss Green
handled them _ in addition to all her other duties _ with dispatch,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was extremely effective in representing Cunard,'' Leaman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Layng, who joined Lord, Day &AMP; Lord in 1942 and worked there
for 30 years, was one of a coterie of lifetime friends Miss Green
made on the job, people who joined her in her expeditions around
the city and sometimes on her travels abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did everything, she knew everything that was going on,''
said Ms. Layng, who for her last 15 years at the firm was the
secretary to one of its top partners, Herbert Brownell, who had
been the U.S. attorney general in the administration of President
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was also the librarian,'' Ms. Layng said of Miss Green.
``She had to keep track of all the books, all the new laws that
came out. She had to know authors, tax laws and so on. She
cataloged everything. We adored her. She was a very kind person. We
had a lot of office boys and girls and she taught them a great deal
_ about the firm and about life. Courtesy. Manners. That's the way
Charlotte was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Layng said that in the 30 years that she knew about, Miss
Green had never missed a day to illness. She was always on the go,
with season tickets or subscriptions to symphonies, operas, the
dance and other performing arts. Besides Caruso, she adored Beverly
Sills, Pavarotti and her favorite, Placido Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   But what she remembered most about Miss Green was her
sensitivity to others, the qualities that do not fit in the
headlines. ``She took an interest in people,'' Ms. Layng said.
``She could bring out the good points in a person. She had a way of
doing that. And she was a very modest person.''
</P>
<P>
   While Miss Green never married, she had an active social life,
Ms. Layng recalled. ``She had a gentleman friend for long time,''
she said, ``but I can't think of his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Layng and Mrs. Appleby remembered that Miss Green took great
care in her appearance, usually wearing conservative suits or
dresses, never slacks. She and her circle of friends celebrated
birthdays and other occasions with dinners that dotted the
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Her vacations became a doorway to the world. Beginning in 1930,
she flew to Europe, a trek that took 16 hours, and subsequently
traveled all over Europe, and to Japan, India, Mexico, Brazil,
Argentina, Iran, Iraq, New Zealand and a number of countries in
Africa. She usually took hundreds of photographs and brought back
artifacts that decorated her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   When she retired in 1978, the law firm held a dinner at a
Midtown hotel and gave her a silver tray and what she really wanted
most _ a trip to Australia. Ten years later, the firm was merged
with another and became Lord, Day &AMP; Lord, Barrett Smith, and in
1994 the firm was dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Green's eyesight and hearing began to fail in recent years.
She could no longer read or watch television, but did listen to
recordings of classical music. ``She couldn't hear it, but she knew
it so well she could hear it in her mind,'' Mrs. Appleby said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled a trip with her aunt to Cape May some years ago.
They checked into a Victorian bed and breakfast, strolled on the
beaches and breathed in the salt air of the ocean, using the last
of her senses to take in the fading world. ``I loved to do things
with her,'' Mrs. Appleby said. ``I always learned things. She loved
everything about New York. She was the most vital person I ever
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 2000s approached, Mrs. Appleby said, her aunt said little
about it, Last Thursday, with two days to go in 1999, Mrs. Appleby
took Miss Green to New York University Hospital. She was suffering
from pneumonia, and the end was near.
</P>
<P>
   On her last day, Miss Green could not see or hear the
celebrations that roared across the city and blared over the
television. ``But she knew she was going to be alive in three
different centuries, and that meant a lot to her,'' Mrs. Appleby
said. At 2:45 p.m., with the year 2000 less than 15 hours old and
her family at her side, Miss Green died peacefully.

RANGERS AND CANADIENS TIE, 2-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ If not for Mike Richter, the New York Rangers' first
game of the new century would have ended like so many others here
have concluded in the last century _ with a Canadiens victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens came into the game with a 188-56-37 record in
Montreal against the Rangers, who were 1-12-3 here during their
last 16 regular-season matchups. But even though these Canadiens
hardly resemble their storied forebears, Richter had to be
absolutely brilliant in goal to preserve a 2-2 tie after Rangers
defenseman Sylvain Lefebrve scored _ a rarity for him _ 10 minutes
10 seconds into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Lefebrve's second goal of the season, a slap shot from the top
of the slot off a Jan Hlavac pass, gave the Rangers the tie. And
the Rangers, who have now played overtime in 9 of their last 12
games, were able to fly home after a three-game road trip with
three of a possible six points in the standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to get a tie, because we weren't as good as we
could have been,'' said Richter, who is nursing a sore groin. ``We
weren't as good as we should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter was not speaking for himself. He stopped 28 shots,
including 8 from point blank range in the last half of the third
period and 4 more in the 4-on-4 overtime, as the Rangers gained a
point in their fourth consecutive game. The tie extended the
Rangers' stretch without a victory to six games (0-3-3 with a
regulation tie). But the Rangers have scored points in four of
those six games thanks to the new rules regarding overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of practice at it,'' Rangers Coach John
Muckler said, referring to the extra session the Rangers seem to be
playing on a nightly basis. ``Maybe we'll get better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Theo Fleury said, ``Somewhere along the line here, we have to
win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Richter played well,'' said Muckler. ``Especially late in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' first lineup of the new year had a new addition,
and therefore, a new look. Mike York's line, with Adam Graves and
Theo Fleury, remained intact. As did Petr Nedved's with Valery
Kamensky and Jan Hlavac.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Taylor, however, skated with John MacLean and Mike Knuble
(who had been a healthy scratch the last four games). And Radek
Dvorak, obtained Wednesday from Florida in a three-way deal that
saw the popular Todd Harvey go to San Jose, made his Rangers debut
centering a line for Eric Lacroix and the slumping Alexandre
Daigle.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers controlled most of the first period. They took a 1-0
lead on the power play 14 minutes 22 seconds in, when York scored
his 11th goal of the season to retake the National Hockey League
lead for rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came on a tap in from off the left post after a Kevin
Hatcher shot from the right circle had been blocked before it could
reach Montreal goaltender Jeff Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   But the game turned at 18:34 of the first, when Mathieu
Schneider was whistled for holding Arron Asham. Before then, the
Rangers held a 9-3 advantage in shots on goal. But Benoit Brunet
was credited for a power play goal at 19:13 _ Eric Weinrich's shot
from the left point appeared to go in off Rich Pilon's skate as he
attempted to bulldoze Brunet from the slot - and the teams were
tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   And then, with 11.3 seconds left in the first, Schneider took
another penalty for high sticking Jason Ward. Thirty-eight seconds
into the second, Rich Pilon was called for hooking Martin Rucinksy.
All of a sudden, the Rangers had taken three consecutive penalties
and were staring at 1:12 of a 5-on-3.
</P>
<P>
   They killed it _ sort of. The second the penalty to Schneider
ended, Sergei Zholtok skated in from the left circle and beat
Richter. And the Canadiens had taken a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lefebrve evened it. Then _ after Richter pretty much forced the
overtime all by himself _ Lefebrve had a golden chance to win it.
But he could not get a good shot off on a 2-on-1 rush with
Schneider early in the extra session. And the Rangers had to settle
for a single point. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Muckler wasn't going to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a big point at the end of the season,'' he said.
``Somewhere down the line, somebody's probably going to miss the
playoffs because they didn't get the two points. You need all the
points you can get.''

STARS AND STRIPES POSTS A SECOND STRAIGHT UPSET 
</HEADLINE>

   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ It was a day of frustration on the
Hauraki Gulf; a day of broken equipment, torn sails cast into the
rough sea and quick reversals of fortune that transformed favorites
like America One into windswept losers in the America's Cup
challenger semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Only one syndicate remained immune to it all, and it was not one
of those that grabbed most of the headlines and sponsors in the
early rounds of this cutthroat but hardly cut-rate competition.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of racing, the only undefeated syndicate is Stars
and Stripes. That will come as no surprise to those inside and
outside the sport who are familiar with its skipper, Dennis Conner,
but it comes as a big surprise to those who watched Conner's only
boat struggle to a 5-5 record in the third round-robin round before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's victim was the Prada Challenge, the strong Italian
syndicate that has the biggest budget of the six semifinalists and
had looked very sleek and fast and composed on Sunday in a
convincing victory over America True. But on Monday, against a more
experienced group of Americans, the Italians were outclassed.
</P>
<P>
   Conner's crew, again sailing without him on board, was smoother
and more sure-handed: striking the proper balance between
conservatism and aggression. The crew controlled the start,
claiming the left side that has been the preferred side in the
early going here, and it proceeded to control every mark that
followed, losing ground only on the first leeward leg to Luna
Rossa.
</P>
<P>
   But after that turn, the Italians fell back. Their surge had
failed and their equipment was failing, too. They sailed the
remainder of the race with a damaged boomvang, the support pole
which is used to keep the boom low heading downwind. And they were
soon wrapping duct tape around it: a low-tech response to a
high-tech problem.
</P>
<P>
   With the wind gusting up to 26 knots on course readings and as
high as 35 knots on board Stars and Stripes (``Just like the
Carribbean,'' cracked the crew member Peter Holmberg), the
Americans increased their lead to 26 seconds at the the third mark,
where the Italians' spinnaker work paled in comparison with theirs.
They then expanded the lead to 37 seconds at the fourth and to 1
minute 7 seconds by the finish.
</P>
<P>
   It was their second straight victory over a favored challenger.
On Sunday, they had beaten Nippon by nearly a minute in their
opening semifinal race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Nippon race was over in the first 10 minutes, and
we were the ones who got the benefit of those first 10 minutes, but
after that I didn't see much difference in boat speed,'' said Stars
and Stripes tactician Tom Whidden. ``However I must say I liked
what I saw today. Even though it was a little bit shifty and hard
to get a read on how fast the boats were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Nippon managed to shrug off mechanical problems of its own and a
surge from Le Defi Francais on the second leeward leg to win by 38
seconds on Monday. But the most star-crossed race of this mercurial
afternoon, which began with rain and ended in brilliant sunshine,
was between America One and its hometown rival America True. Both
syndicates are based in San Francisco: America One at the St.
Francis Yacht Club and America True at the San Francisco Yacht
Club. And though America One has two boats, better funding and more
celebrated sailors, particularly the skipper Paul Cayard, it has
now lost three of its four races to Dawn Riley's single-boat
syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second leeward leg, it appeared that it would
be Cayard's day when America True's spinnaker ripped in half. It
then got caught under the boat, where the spinnaker sheets wrapped
around the keel. Frantic, the crew managed to cut free the sail
that had become a brake, but when it reached the fourth mark, it
was trailing by 1:05.
</P>
<P>
   But America One would soon have more serious problems of its
own. Shortly after rounding the mark, its jib broke free from the
headsail track in the gusting wind. This time, it was the one
dumping a sail into the water, and the damage to the headsail track
would keep America One from flying a jib for the rest of the leg: a
handicap that one observer likened to boxing with just one hand.
</P>
<P>
   By the final windward mark, its one-minute lead had become a
2:49 deficit, and though America True was hardly at its best on the
last leg because of its spinnaker problems, it was good enough to
beat its more damaged rival by 2:23.
</P>
<P>
   Both San Francisco-based boats are now 1-1, as are Prada and
Nippon. The only syndicate without a victory is Le Defi Francais,
which is considered stronger in lighter winds than the heavy winds
that buffeted Monday's racing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stars and Stripes thrives on heavy weather, and for experienced
Conner crew members like Whidden, it brings back pleasant memories
of another southern hemisphere locale: the windy waters off of
Fremantle, Australia, where Conner won back the America's Cup from
the Australians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our Fremantle experience probably helped us here, and
you realize some of the things you have to do to handle the storm
breeze,'' Whidden said. ``Having started our program a little bit
late, we decided to make our boat a little more bullet proof.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a strong mast and a strong boat,'' he added,
expressing confidence in the modifications Stars &AMP; Stripes made
before this round. ``We may not have the lightest gear out there,
but we're pretty confident we're not going to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was an immeasurable improvement over the last
time that Stars &AMP; Stripes was scheduled to race Prada. On that
occasion, in the third round-robin round, the Americans's deck
separated from the hull shortly before the start. ``Folded up like
a tin can,'' Conner said.
</P>
<P>
   Luna Rossa sailed the course alone, but when the two powerful
boats have raced the course together, the Americans now lead the
Italians 2-1. &QL;
