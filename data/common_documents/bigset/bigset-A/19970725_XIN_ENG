<HEADLINE> Africa's GDP Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Africa's increasing aggregate
gross domestic product is expected to grow further in the medium
terms, African Development Bank (ADB) President Omar Kabbaj said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the African African-American Summit, Kabbaj
said the 4.8 percent growth recorded last year was sustainable.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the growth to economic reforms being implemented
in most of Africa, Kabbaj said the positive trend could be
enhanced by the participation of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 African-Americans are now in Harare for the
four-day summit to end on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The summit seeks to bring together Africans from the two
continents to provide a platform for information exchange and
exploration of trade and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Africa's economic performance is assuming an encouraging turn
as an increasing number of countries pursue reform and adjustment
programs to enhance national economic management and to provide
incentives for enterprise and industry," said the ADB president.
</P>
<P>
African governments embarked on economic structural adjustment
programs in the last few years to spur economic growth and raise
standards of living.
</P>
<P>
According to Kabbaj, Africa's aggregate GDP growth increased
from 1.6 percent between 1990-94 to 2.8 percent in 1995 and the
present 4.8 percent, owing to favourable policies adopted in most
African countries.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Wins Liberia's Election (More Details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's former warlord Charles
Taylor today scored a landslide victory in the country's post-war
elections, winning more than 75 percent of the valid votes.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Elections Commission (IECOM) in Monrovia
officially announced this afternoon that Taylor of the National
Patriotic Party gained 468,443 of the total 621,880 votes.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's score is far more than the required 51 percent of
total polls, making a run-off unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
According to the election guidelines, the president-elect is
to be sworn in on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election is also designed to produce a parliament
of 26 senators and 64 representatives. The seats will be shared
by various parties according to the percentage of the votes they
obtained.
</P>
<P>
At press time, no official with the IECOM can be reached for
more details, but sources expect IECOM Chairman Henry Andrews
will make a comprehensive official announcement later today.
</P>
<P>
More than 710,000 Liberians were registered as voters and
about 90 percent of them cast their votes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 international observers, including former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, monitored the polling process together
with their local counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The election, conducted under tense security provided by the
west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), is seen by observers as
free, fair and transparent, with minor irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Despite complaints from a few of Taylor's rivals, some leaders
of other parties have expressed their readiness to accept the
final results and to cooperate with the incoming government.
</P>
<P>
The successful election is expected to bring a final end to
Liberia's civil war ignited by Taylor seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The war has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people and
displaced more others.

BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
adopted a communication prepared by Jacques Santer, president of
the commission, concerning its Green Housekeeping Action Plan for
the period from 1997 to 2000, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at integrating environmental considerations
into the organization of the EU executive's administration as well
as the arrangements it concludes with its supplies of goods and
services, and the behavior of its staff.
</P>
<P>
The action plan concerns three main areas in the administration
-- office activities, mobility of staff, and the Commission's
housing policy, the EC says in a press release issued here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the plan is supposed to ensure that by
the end of its mandate, the present Commission will be applying
the highest standards of environmental care across the whole range
of its administration and take a lead on this.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Ends Visit to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Housing Minister
Abdul Rahman Hamad left here today after a three-day visit
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
He delivered to UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al
Nahyan a letter from Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. Details
of the letter were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Hamad, who arrived here Monday evening, held
talks with UAE senior officials on the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks between both sides focused on UAE-subsidized plans
of building thousands of houses for Palestinians in Gaza and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hamad urged the UAE to continue to discuss with the
Palestinian National Authority the plans to ensure the
implementation of them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The UAE promised that it would continue to subsidize the
construction of houses for Palestinians to support their national
struggle for establishing a Palestinian state on their lands.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf country also condemned Israel, saying it is putting
obstacles in the implementation of the housing plans.
</P>
<P>
"We condemned the Israeli government because they are
putting obstacles in the implementation of the plans,
particularly in Jerusalem," UAE's Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh
Sultan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan said during his meeting with Hamad
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE will continue its support to the Palestinian
people, especially in the housing field despite Israel's
challenges and policies that are trying to prevent from the
implementation of the plans," he added.

<HEADLINE> Vigorous Drive to Fight Huaihe River Valley Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Song Jian said
here today that the target mapped out by the State Council to
control the discharge of pollution in the Huaihe River Valley at
the state-set standards by the end of 1997 must be met.
</P>
<P>
Song, also head of the Environmental Protection Committee of
the State Council, made this remark at a meeting in this capital
of Henan Province on enforcement of environmental protection in
the Huaihe River area.
</P>
<P>
From July 18 to 23 Song Jian and an inspection group inspected
water pollution in the three provinces of Shandong, Anhui and
Henan.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase treatment of water pollution in the Huaihe
River has achieved initial success. Some 15 kinds of small
industrial enterprises and paper mills with annual output of less
than 5,000 tons each have been shut down, reducing pollution in
the Huaihe River by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Song said, the State Council has decided to launch a
comprehensive prevention and treatment drive in the Huaihe River
Valley, because pollution there affects 150 million people along
the river.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase control drive, to be completed by the turn of the
century, aims to reduce water pollution in the valley by another
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state councilor urged local authorities to take resolute
measures to speed up treatment of water pollution, and to close
down, stop, merge or transfer enterprises which cannot be cleaned
up. At the same time, close attention should be paid to the
construction of more urban sewage treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting were officials from the State
Planning Commission, State Economic and Trade Commission, State
Administration of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Water
Resources, Ministry of Construction, Ministry of
Agriculture, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of
Finance and People's Bank of China, as well as leading personnel
from the provinces of Shandong, Anhui, Henan and Jiangsu, which are
all in the Huaihe River Valley.
</P>
<P>
All of them made commitments to joining a decisive battle
against water pollution in the valley.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch economy grew at the
rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter of 1997, compared with
the same period a year earlier, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
This figure is however distorted by the smaller number of
working days in 1997, which means the underlying growth was
between three and four percent, says Netherlands News Monitor, a
Dutch government press release.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending was 3.6 percent higher in May than a year
earlier. The growth measured over the first five months of this
year was 3.1 percent. This increase is of the same order as the
increase measured by Statistics Netherlands for the whole of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Purchases of durable consumer goods, with a rise of 4.5 percent
in the first five months of this year, showed a particularly sharp
volume increase, reports Statistics Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> China Striving to save Underwater Mausoleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts in Nanjing are working
hard to rescue an imperial mausoleum which has been submerged for
nearly 300 years.
</P>
<P>
Located 100 km away from Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province, the underwater tomb, built in 1386, or in the
18th year under the rein of Emperor Hongwu, was the final resting
place of the ancestors of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of
the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
In 1681, the Hongze Lake, one of China's five biggest lakes,
flooded and submerged the tomb. Part of it reappeared above water
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid close attention and shown its
great interest in the underwater mausoleum, and ordered a flood
bank be built around the exposed section so that people could see
at least part of the tomb.
</P>
<P>
Experts repaired 21 pairs of carved stone figures which have
been seriously damaged by over three centuries of water erosion. A
250-meter-long road at the tomb site was also rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
Local government authorities believe the underwater mausoleum
can be turned into China's another new tourist resort once the
renovations are completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan will map out a new diplomatic
policy toward Russia to make clear its resolve to strengthen
bilateral ties comprehensively despite a long-standing territorial
dispute, Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The policy will be based on three concepts of trust, mutual
benefit, and long-term prospect, Kyodo quoted government sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will be worked out in response to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's move to seek better ties with Japan, the
sources said, adding that it will probably be knocked into shape
when Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto holds unofficial
talks with Yeltsin this fall or later.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, Japan is considering accepting Russian
business executives for training.
</P>
<P>
Japan also intends to reach an agreement with Russia as early
as possible on fishing for pay in waters around disputed islands
off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The four disputed islands, Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the
Habomai isles, were seized by troops of the former Soviet Union at
the end of World War II.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Workers Stage Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 60,000 Israeli state
workers held strike today in solidarity with staff of the
state-owned telecommunications company Bezeq, who are fighting
against the sale of company shares.
</P>
<P>
Major disruptions were caused by the strike which affected
major state companies, including the Civil Aviation Authority,
Israel Electric Corporation, Mekorot Water Company and the
Postal Authority.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of passengers were stranded at the Ben-Gurion
Airport as outgoing flights were canceled and in-coming planes
delayed. Train service was closed and the electric and water
services were working only on an emergency footing.
</P>
<P>
In the Tel Aviv area, thousands of phone lines were disrupted
because of the strike. And in the major seaports of Ashdod and
Haifa, merchant ships were waiting to unload their goods.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike, called by Israel's General Trade Union
Histadrut, was held to support workers of the Bezeq
telecommunications company, who began striking earlier this week
to protest the sale of 12 percent company shares to the United
States investment house Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
In declaring the strike overnight, Histadrut said it was
infuriated by the back-to-work orders issued to 440 vital Bezeq
workers by Communications Minister Limor Livnat and signed by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
A meeting held Wednesday night between Netanyahu and
Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz failed to reach an agreement to
prevent today's strike. Peretz demanded the government transfer
the revenues from the sale of Bezeq shares to implement the wage
deals signed between the government and Histadrut.
</P>
<P>
The Action Committee of the Histadrut declared today that the
public sector strike would continue for the days to come.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Industrialist Association estimated that if the
situation continued, it would inflicted a daily loss of 100
million shekels (30 million dollars) on the country's
economy. The association threatened to sue the organizers of the
strike for compensation.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Parliament Elects New Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Albania's Social
Democratic Party Skender Gjinushi was elected today new speaker of
the People's Assembly (parliament) and Namik Dokle from the
Socialist Party was elected one of the two deputy speakers.
</P>
<P>
Another deputy speaker is expected to be elected from the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected speaker called on the parliament to set an
example of cooperation to the ruling party and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Gjinushi was elected new speaker one day after the resignation
of the country's President Sali Berisha. Berisha announced his
"irrevocable" decision to resign Wednesday in a letter to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
His resignation followed three weeks after his ruling
Democratic Party was defeated by the opposition Socialist in early
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Berisha had called the early election in hope of ending the
nation-wide unrest triggered by the collapse last winter of
fraudulent savings schemes in which Albanians invested an
estimated 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bank of England Faces "Policy Dilemma" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The chances of another early base
rate rise have increased since the latest reports show a return to
1980s-style boom conditions in Britain's high streets.
</P>
<P>
As figures released yesterday showed High Street sales
threatening to reach new heights, a further bank rate rise - up
0.25 percent to seven percent - to cool the economy seemed
certain.
</P>
<P>
Purchases of household goods and other durables soared last
month as falling unemployment, rising real incomes and more than
20 billion pounds (32 billion US dollars) of windfalls produced a
spending spree of the kind last seen a decade or so ago.
</P>
<P>
The windfall effect was in most spectacular evidence in the
household goods sector, where the volume of goods sold leapt 7.5
percent to a level 21 percent up on a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts warned that the Bank of England monetary
policy committee would find it difficult to ignore the latest
evidence of overheating in the domestic economy, despite worries
about the impact of sterling strength on the export sector.
</P>
<P>
Market speculation that rates will rise to seven percent next
month sent the pound soaring on foreign exchanges. It climbed to
DM3.0878, its highest level since September 1989, before slipping
in late trade to close up three pfennigs on the day at DM3.0712
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
New evidence that the high level of the pound is beginning to
seriously hurt exporters emerged in the latest British Chambers of
Commerce quarterly survey that showed export orders slumping to a
five-year low.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the new data coupled with the latest rise in
the pound would heighten the "policy dilemma" faced by the Bank of
England over further interest rate rises.
</P>
<P>
Questioned at the Treasury Committee, Bank of England governor
Eddie George said of the pound's rise: "I can't explain why it's
risen to the extent that it has and therefore I am bound to assume
that some of it is irrational, erratic."
</P>
<P>
The governor insisted that the pound's current strength was as
much connected to political developments surrounding EMU as with
the expectation of further interest rate rises.
</P>
<P>
George said: "The economic cycle explains part of the reason
for the strength, but it is mostly associated with developments in
Europe."
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts believe that a decision on interest
rates will be announced on August 7 after a two-day meeting to
review the latest economic data.
</P>
<P>
Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, warned that there was
much more to come in terms of windfall spending, saying "The Bank
will have few reservations about pushing rates higher."
</P>
<P>
Andrew Cates of UBS said: "With sterling's strength doing much
to dampen both domestic cost pressures and export demand, further
increases in base rates are not warranted and would risk a hard
landing for the economy next year."
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Economic &AMP; Social Research believes
that a sharp slowdown is inevitable. It said the economy had a one
in four chance of going through a recession next year if the
strength of sterling continued to grow.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unveils Basic Policies Toward Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today unveiled three basic diplomatic principles toward
Russia in a bid to improve bilateral ties which have been
marred by a long-standing territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto declared the three principles -- trust, mutual
benefit and long-term viewpoint -- in a speech at a gathering of
the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, a Kyodo News report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to improve Japan-Russia ties as a whole in
accordance with these three principles," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the territorial row as the most difficult problem in
their postwar relations, Hashimoto said, "I believe this issue is
the very thing that can be overcome only through the three
principles I now mentioned."
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands in the north of Japan -- Etorofu,
Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets -- were seized by
Soviet Union troops at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that the Northern territories issue should not
be solved in such a way that one party becomes a winner and the
other a loser," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said the October 1993 Tokyo Declaration is the best
basis for the conclusion of a peace treaty through the resolution
of the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, issued by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, states that the
two countries agree to continue talks toward the resolution of
their territorial dispute on the basis of "principles of law and
justice."

<HEADLINE> Muster out of Generali Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Thomas Muster was defeated
on his favorite clay surface in Kitzbuehel, Austria, by Czech
Slava Dosedel at the Generali Open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian suffered the setback 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the third
round of the event, ending his clay season with a disappointing
nine wins in 18 matches, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Muster recorded his biggest clay success of the year by
reaching the quarter-finals in St.Poelten in mid-May. However, he
won two hard court tournaments in Dubai and Key Biscayne earlier
in the year.
</P>
<P>
Muster, world number five, will be playing only on hard courts
for the remainder of the year, and next competes in Montreal and
Cincinatti to prepare for the U.S. Open.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Conditions for Resuming Talks Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said today that despite the
international efforts to revive the Israeli-Palestinian talks,
conditions for the resumption remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was speaking at a news conference held at the Eretz
Crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip after his two-hour
meeting with Israeli opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting Barak held with Arafat since he
became new leader of the Labor Party in June. They discussed
the current state of the peace process and joint battle to
combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said although the United States and Egypt had made
intensive efforts to break the deadlock in the peace process,
the conditions have not reached to enable a breakthrough to
resume the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed Israel's repeated charges about the Palestinian
police's involvement in anti-Israeli terror attacks. He said
that if Israel had proof that Ghazi Jabali, the commander of PNA
police forces, was involved in terrorism, it should show them to
him.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops announced last Monday that they arrested three
Palestinian policemen who were alleged to be on their way to
carry out a terror attack against a Jewish settlement near the
West Bank city of Nablus. The Israeli government later claimed
that Jabali was behind the planned attack and demanded the PNA
arrest him.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today ordered the
revocation of Jabali's VIP card, which was issued by Israel to
allow senior Palestinian officials to travel freely between West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed that he was working intensively against any
involvement of Palestinian security officials in anti-Israeli
terrorism. Barak said he was pleased with Arafat's assurances.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's statements were consistent with what he made
Wednesday in Brussels after his Tuesday meeting with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy under the auspices of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
While Levy was upbeat about the meeting for breaking the ice
in the peace process, Arafat insisted that "nothing was
achieved." Israeli Foreign Ministry hailed the Levy-Arafat
meeting as a "breakthrough," because the two leaders agreed to
reconvene the nine bilateral committees formed under the Oslo
accords four years ago and whose work has been stymied.
</P>
<P>
But top Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour expressed doubt
Wednesday about the sincerity of the Israeli government in
agreeing to reconvene the committees. He reiterated that as long
as the Israeli government refused to stop the settlement
activities, there would be no room for any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen since
late March when Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in
East Jerusalem. The Palestinian side is insisting on a halt to
the settlement activities as a precondition for resuming the
talks, but Israel demands the PNA promise to resume security
cooperation first and launch a long-term crackdown on
anti-Israeli terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Self-Sufficiency Urged for African People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- African people need to chart their
own cause instead of waiting for aid from other countries,
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said today at the Fourth African
African-American Summit held in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"Africans should be responsible for their own destiny, and not
expect others to improve them," said Nujoma, adding "We want
action, not excuses."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to fail when our continent is on the
threshold of success. We need to create necessary conditions to
reach out set targets," said the president.
</P>
<P>
African governments should give their people a chance to
realise their dreams and avoid disillusionment, urged Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
African countries also needed to tackle violence in the home,
teenage pregnancies and provide opportunities for the advancement
of women.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian President stresses that despite the fact that
Africa, particularly southern Africa, had been praised for its
political stability, there had not been much direct investment
coming its way from the western countries.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear we have a responsibility to ensure a favourable
climate for investment, stability and peace and the enactment of
favourable laws," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Nintendo's New Licensing Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese video games specialist
Nintendo has received the all-clear that its standard licensing
agreements are now compatible with European Union (EU) competition
law.
</P>
<P>
Following consultation with both EU officials and the UK
Department of Trade and Industry, Nintendo has recently redrafted
these licensing agreements and received the official green light
from the European Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
In announcing its decision, the Commission said that Nintendo's
new licensing agreements "will allow much greater competition on
the market for Nintendo compatible games" and that this would be
to the immediate benefit of European consumers.
</P>
<P>
The Nintendo licensing system is designed to allow independent
software companies to develop and publish games which are
compatible with Nintendo console systems, by granting access to
certain of Nintendo's intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, there are no longer limits on the
number of games that a Nintendo licensee may release on the
market, and prior approvals by Nintendo are no longer required,
until and unless a Nintendo licensee elects to use a Nintendo
trade mark for any particular game.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that the original agreements were in
restraint of competition and had an "appreciable" effect on trade
between EU member states and contracting parties.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the EU competition experts objected to the right
granted to Nintendo to approve any game developed by a licensee
before commercial release.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the investigation, the Commission cooperated closely
with the UK authorities, who were looking into the matter
following the publication of a report from the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses S. Leone of Breaching Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today accused Sierra
Leone's military junta of breaching a ceasefire by attacking some
positions held by west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) in the
capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG did not hesitate to launch counter attack reactions,
Defense Spokesman Col. Ugbo said here.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on immediate ceasefire was reached last week in
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, between an Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) committee and a delegation of Sierra
Leone's new military leader which seized power in a coup on May
25.
</P>
<P>
But the junta and its allies breached the truce by attacking
ECOMOG-held positions, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops were sent to Sierra Leone in the wake of the
coup, attempting to restore the toppled civilian government led
by ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Clashes have been reported between Nigerian-dominated ECOMOG
troops and soldiers loyal to coup leader Major Johnny Koroma and
allied ex-rebel organization Revolutionary United Front, with
more than 250 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Four on Sierra Leone, including
foreign ministers of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire,
and Koroma's delegation had a meeting in Abidjan last week.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed hope of resolving the crisis in peaceful
means. Second round talks, originally scheduled for tomorrow, is
expected to be held next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The coup has invited worldwide condemnation and international
isolation has caused the spread of famine and epidemic in the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross, one of the few
humanitarian organizations still in the troubled country, has
expressed concern that food is becoming scarce and unaffordable,
while most hospitals have run out of drugs, and fuel for vehicles
fast running out.
</P>
<P>
For weeks, much of the business has remained closed as the
military junta continues to be isolated by the international
community.

Participating in the August 15-17 tournament here are Olympic
champion Cuba, runners-up China, Italy and Japan.

<P>
1997 World Volleyball Grand Prix will have its preliminaries

China, who won the Sendai and Macao legs of last year's

third place in the Grand Finals in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This year's Hong Kong tournament will be held in the Hong Kong
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of last year's event were criticized by the
participants for arranging the competitions in the comparatively
narrow Queen Elizabeth Stadium. The limited space around the court
made it difficult for players taking effective long serves and
running for retrieves.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Cloned World's First Transgenic Lamb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) - The British scientists who cloned
the world's first animal Dolly the sheep announced today in a
press release the birth of the world's first cloned transgenic
lamb Polly which carries a human gene for a therapeutic protein.
</P>
<P>
"This pioneering work will stimulate new opportunities in both
agricultural and biomedical research,"said Professor Grahame
Bulfield, Director of the Roslin Institute.
</P>
<P>
Polly the lamb and her four near-identical sisters born in the
past month are transgenic, Polly has the human gene and a mark
gene which are easy to be verified in the animal.
</P>
<P>
Two others are expected to carry both genes, whilst the final
two have only the mark genes.
</P>
<P>
The Poll Dorset lambs which were produced by the nuclear
transfer technology similar to that which led to the much-reported
birth of Dolly earlier this year are the result of a continuing
collaboration of scientists of PPL Therapeutics plc with those at
the Roslin Institute.
</P>
<P>
"These lambs are the realization of our vision to produce
instant flocks or herds which express high concentrations of
valuable therapeutic proteins very quickly and represent the next
step in the commercialization of cloning Roslin's pioneering
nuclear transfer work,"said Dr Alan Colman, Research Director of
PPL.
</P>
<P>
PPL's existing transgenic techniques already allow the
economical production of a wide range of proteins and peptides
from the milk of transgenic animals. The company's lead product,
alpha-1-antitrypsin, is currently in Phase II clinical trials for
the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

<HEADLINE> Scotland to Get First Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Scotland will get its first
parliament for almost 300 years under plans unveiled by the
British government today.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar told parliament members that
the new 129-member legislative body would make laws in many areas,
including health care, education, housing and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and defense policy, the economic and monetary system,
employment legislation and social security would continue to be
dealt with by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Under the devolution plans, the new body would rely mainly on a
financial grant from the central government, but would have the
right to raise or lower tax on earned income, giving it a maximum
of 450 million pounds (753 million U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a subsidiary parliament for Scotland was a
key part of the Labor Party's plans to reform Britain's
centralized constitution.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Conservatives described plans for Scottish
devolution as "dangerous, damaging and dishonest".

UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Economic
Community of the Western African countries (ECOWAS) General Sani
Abacha and Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan
today issued a joint certification statement, declaring that the
results of the July 19, 1997 Liberian Special Elections were free,
fair and credible.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, they said the entire electoral process was
conducted in an impartial and transparent manner. There were no
irregularities or incidents of a nature that could have affected
the credibility of the elections which were verified by over 500
international observers. The outcome of the presidential and the
legislative elections therefore reflected the will of the Liberian
people.
</P>
<P>
They congratulated the Liberian people for demonstrating
through this process their commitment to peace and their desire
for the establishment of a democratically elected government, and
called upon all Liberians to give their fullest support to the
newly elected government embarking on the daunting task of
reconstructing the country and reconciling the nation.
</P>
<P>
They said ECOWAS and the United Nations would continue to be
actively engaged in the reconstruction of Liberia and to assist
in mobilizing international support for this purpose.

ANKARA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov
will arrive here July 28 on a three-day official visit, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the visit in Ankara, Stoyanov is expected to meet his
Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
and leaders of political parties.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian leader will discuss with the Turkish side
bilateral relations and regional issues. The situation in the
Balkans and the issue of full EU membership drive of the two
countries will also be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov's Ankara tour is bound to be a push for
Turco-Bulgarian relations and cooperation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which was originally scheduled to start on June
23, had been delayed because Turkey was busy in setting up a
new government at that time.

<HEADLINE> Russia's GDP Almost Equal to First Half of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product of
Russia in the first half of the year amounted to 99.8 percent
compared with the corresponding period of 1996, while the index of
the physical volume of manufactured industrial goods totaled
100.8 percent, the Itar-Tass news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The information was given by the federal government, whose
enlarged meeting is underway.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the improvement in industrial dynamics took
place mostly thanks to boosting production by smaller and joint
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The slide in production at major and medium firms was equal to
0.9 percent in January-June of 1997 as against seven percent for
the corresponding period of the last year.
</P>
<P>
However, some enterprises and sectors of the manufacturing
industry registered growth in the first half of 1997, forming
seats of future economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the document says, the continued industrial
reduction in sectors with a relatively high speed of capital
turnover (above all, the food industry -- by five percent) is a
disquieting symptom, which shows that obstacles to the inflow of
capital to the real sector of the economy have not been removed.
</P>
<P>
The volume of agricultural produce of the first half of the
year amounted to 95 percent of the same period of 1996 in
comparable prices.
</P>
<P>
Volumes and periods of financing agriculture were largely
determined by decreasing possibilities of the budget. The lure of
agriculture for commercial crediting remained at a low level,
which is, above all, the consequence of slow institutional changes
in this economic sphere, the document notes.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural enterprises could not purchase spares and new
machinery in required quantities due to financial difficulties,
while supplies of petro-products to agricultural enterprises
dropped in the first half of 1997 as compared with the
corresponding period of last year, which negatively affected
land tillage.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- To establish the Amani
Nature Reserve (ANR) has been part of the government effort to
conserve the rain forests in Tanzania, an senior official from the
Ministry of Tourism and Natural Resources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Rose Lugembe, Principal Secretary of the minstry made the
remarks at the launching ceremony of the ANR, which will be
established on the east Usambara Mountain in Tanga Region with
the assistance of Finland.
</P>
<P>
She said: "There are several different plants and animals
species which are not found elsewhere in the world, and the
forest is also a vital area for securing water supply to over
200,000 people in Tanga Municipality through Sigi River."
</P>
<P>
The objectives of ARN, the first of its kind to be established
in the country, are to protect the unique biological environment
and maintain biodiversity, genetic resources and natural
precesses, she added.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is also expected to provide opportunities for
scientists and students to study and learn the ecology of the
forests and will also serve as recreation and tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finnish ambassador to Tanzania, Ilari
Rantakari, said his country would continue its support of the
reserve with a view to ensuring the protection of nature.

<HEADLINE> Apartment House Explosion Kills at Least Two in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A suspected natural gas explosion
early this morning totally destroyed a four-story apartment house
in the western Germany city of Duesseldorf, killing at least two
of its residents.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, occurred at about 3:00 a.m., shattered windows
throughout the neighborhood and damaged some cars parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers equipped with special cameras and
specially-trained dogs had found the body of a woman in the debris
and recovered another body from the ruins later. They were still
searching for possible survivors Thursday afternoon, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, there are 15 people registered as
living at the house, but seven of them are believed to be on
vacation at the time of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The building is the only one in the street that is not
connected to the public gas supplies. But a gas pipe powering
street lights runs just in front of the house. Gas explosion is
suspected because of a heavy smell of natural gas immediately
after the accident.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Budget Favors Huge Wage Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government today
announced an 18-month budget of 63.857 billion Zimbabwe Dollars
(5.8 billion U.S. Dollars) which mainly finances a huge wage
bill.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget in parliament, Finance Minister Herbert
Murerwa said the wage bill, at 25 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (2.27
billion U.S. Dollars), was high because of annual increments and
bonuses awarded to civil servants for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The budget, representing 37.7 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), was a marginal increase compared with the last
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
This year's budget covers a period spanning from July 1997 to
December 1998, in line with the government intention to merge the
fiscal year with the calendar year.
</P>
<P>
Enlarged Education, Sport and Culture Ministry gets the
highest allocation followed by the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Education, Sports and Culture Ministry is allocated 11.171
billion Zimbabwe Dollars (1.1 billion U.S. Dollars), with the
huge increase attributed mostly to salaries and allowances.
</P>
<P>
To equip the defense forces, the Defense Ministry is allocated
5.42 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (492.73 million U.S. Dollars), more
than double the vote for 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare has
been given the third largest vote with 4.513 billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (410 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Murerwa told that the 1997/98 budget deficit, estimated to
total 15 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (1.36 billion U.S. Dollars),
represents 8.9 percent of the country's GDP.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Committee Approves Bill to Curb Juvenile Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of the
U.S. Senate Thursday approved a bill that would toughen punishment
on juvenile criminals nationwide.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill many more youngsters 14 and older could
be tried as adults for serious violent crimes under the
legislation in both federal and state courts.
</P>
<P>
Like a counterpart bill the House of Representatives passed in
May, it urges states to tighten up their treatment of juvenile
offenders by offering 500 million dollars annually in incentive
grants. The money is available only to states that do so.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch led eight days of committee
meetings to thrash out some of the 100 amendments submitted by
Democrats or Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Two Democrats joined Republicans in approving the bill, which
was passed 12-6. All the votes against it were cast by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Senator Joseph Biden, a Democrat from Delaware, agreed to delay
many of his amendments on gun proposals and earmarking funds for
crime prevention until the bill reaches the floor.
</P>
<P>
The panel, by a narrow 9-8 vote, defeated an amendment by
Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican of Pennsylvania, that would
have required states to use a half of the incentive grants for
literacy, job training and substance abuse treatment for juvenile
offenders and after-school and other community-based programs to
prevent and reduce crime, truancy and school violence.

CAIRO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Dealings in Kuwait Stock Exchange market
markedly dropped during the week ending Wednesday compared with
that of the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The bourse report available here today showed a fall of volume
by 51 percent, value by 50.8 percent and number of transactions by
46.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market index dropped by 22.9 percent to close at 2319
points in contrast to the closing figure on Wednesday last week.
</P>
<P>
But experts expect the activity on the market would rise next
month, considering the fact that it witnessed high records of
trading in the first half of this year in comparison to the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's capital inflows hit a high record of 300
million U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, semi-official
Jordan Times today quoted Central Bank Governor Ziyad Fariz
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that "on the foreign investment level, the capital
inflows are increasing and are estimated to have reached about 300
million dollars" in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Capital inflows should still rise substantially by the end of
this year as investors, heartened by groundbreaking economic
decisions taken this year, were expected to embark on more joint
ventures and purchases of Jordanian stock, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank's elimination of restrictions on foreign
currency transfers earlier this month removed a major hurdle to
foreign capital inflows, he added.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Minister of Commerce Mohammed Mahdi Saleh
announced that Iraq is now getting prepared to establish a
free-trade zone at Khor el Zubeir harbor in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an interview carried on local newspaper Al-Zaoraa today,
Saleh explained that this move is designed to help boost the
national economy and reactivate Iraq's trade with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The plan to set up the free trade zone was approved last month
at a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The depots at the Khor el Zubeir harbor have a storing capacity
of 24,000 tonnes and the quays have an annual capacity of 10
million tonnes. The harbor also has superiorities of communication

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Inflation Manages Slight Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's rate of inflation
in June managed a slight decline by 1.4 percent to 16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Bureaus of Statistics, indicates that
the decline in the price index for food, which takes up about 71
percent of the consumer market, has helped the making of the
inflation drop.
</P>
<P>
The food price drop was seen after a price decrease in rice,
maize flour, fish, cooking oil, beans and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June
shows that the prices of drinks and tobacco increased slightly
due to increased prices of soft drinks. The CPI covers prices
collected in 20 urban centers in Tanzania mailand.
</P>
<P>
Other significant increases in prices were recorded in rents
(14.2 percent), fuel, power, water (24.9 percent) and clothing
and footwear (19.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
The report shows that on the average, rents increased and the
index for clothing and footwear group declined in June.
</P>
<P>
Due to an increase in electricity tariffs, the price index for
power, fuel and water rose.
</P>
<P>
Transportation group index is reported to have gone up due to
increased prices of car batteries and increased vehicles service
charges.
</P>
<P>
The prices are gathered over about 212 items using the
prevailing market prices.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes Greece for Cyprus Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today rebuffed the remarks
made by Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos concerning the
latest Turkey's move on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing held here, Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Omer Akbel said that Turkey regretted over Pangalos'
negative comment on Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's
recent visit to northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It is Greece that should hold greater responsibility for the
current situation in Cyprus, Akbel said, adding that the Greek
support for the Greek Cypriots caused the tension on the
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos has reportedly expressed his "grave regret" over
Ecevit's visit to northern Cyprus last weekend on the occasion of
the 23rd anniversary of Turkey's military intervention in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled north since the Turkish soldiers landed on the
island to counter a pro-Athens coup in 1974. Turkish Cypriots in
northern Cyprus have established a breakaway republic, which is
only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister said that Ecevit's visit to northern
Cyprus showed the Turkish government's "worst side."

HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister John

total elimination of poverty from the continent.
</P>
<P>
Malecela, who was standing in for Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa at the on-going African African-American summit

be swept under the carpet.
</P>
<P>
He said that the standard of living of the African people is

</P>
<P>
''Sub-Saharan Africa is going through the most difficult
times,'' Malecela said at the plenary session of the four-day

<P>
BONN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 8,300 German soldiers are busy
shoring up the waterlogged dikes along the Oder River on the
German-Polish border today in a desperate battle against the
rising floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
After the first dike burst near the village of
Brieskow-Finkenheerd in the eastern German state of Brandenburg
Wednesday, three villages in the nearby flatland were cut off
today by the floodwaters rushing through a 300-meter-long gap in
the dikes. Local residents had already been evacuated to safety,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
After another dike collapse nearby late this afternoon, rescue
workers have given up their efforts and are focusing their
attention on the northern part of the Oder River where the dikes
have become seriously waterlogged.
</P>
<P>
Even in case of fine weather, the Oder waters would remain at
high levels for about two weeks, a high pressure the dikes were
not designed to withstand, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
A total of about 6,000 people have been requested to leave the
threatened area, but many of them still remain at their homes to
help fight the flooding or protect their properties.
</P>
<P>
Germany has so far escaped the worst the flood which has
ravaged 550,000 hectares of land in Poland and one third of the
Czech Republic, claiming over 100 lives in the two countries.

<HEADLINE> President: Sudan Willing to Improve Relations with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
al-Bashir expressed here today Sudan's willingness to improve
its relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Gare Smith, U.S. deputy assistant secretary
of state for democratic affairs and human rights, Bashir said
Sudan is willing to overcome the difficulties that obstruct the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
On the steps taken by the Sudanese government to establish
peace in the country, Bashir reaffirmed Sudan's desire to
cooperate with the faction that has not yet signed the peace
accord with the government, expressing the hope that the
international community will urge the faction led by John Garang
to sit at the negotiations table in order to stop Sudan's
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government signed in April a peace agreement with
four small southern rebel factions in a bid to put an end to the
13-year civil war, but the Garang faction refused to sign the
accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khedr Haroun, director of American affairs at the
Sudanese Foreign Ministry, told reporters that the U.S. official's
visit was taking place within the framework of the ongoing
dialogue between the two countries to improve and normalize
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Haroun added that this visit is further confirmation of the
desire of the two parties to overcome the present difficulties
through constructive dialogue.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Smith also held meetings with Sudanese
Interim National Assembly Speaker Hassan Turabi, Foreign Minister
Ali Osman Mohammed Tara and officials at the Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said in a press statement that
the visit by Smith is aimed at exchanging views with Sudanese
government officials, non governmental organizations and
individuals on issues of mutual concern.

LUSAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi

fight for democracy is never a fight against Banda, but a fight
against a system of government which denied and deprived the
Malawian people of their fundamental human rights and dignity.

<HEADLINE> Republican Leaders Pledge New Unity After Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Closing ranks behind Speaker
Newt Gingrich of the U.S. House of Representatives, Republicans
pledged to push past a divisive leadership struggle and focus on
cutting taxes and balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
That would put the party "back on track," Gingrich said today,
a day after his top lieutenants apologized for their involvement
in a foiled coup attempt against him.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Republican Whip Tom DeLay and
Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner, who apologized at a
meeting Wednesday, are expected to keep their jobs, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour Republican session Wednesday night, Gingrich
pronounced the incident "over."
</P>
<P>
"Any difference we had yesterday morning is now behind us,"
Representative Todd Tiahrt, a Republican of Kansas, said in a
House floor speech. "We all know that Republicans don't all agree.
But we decided to work together to overcome the obstacles."
</P>
<P>
Participants said there were no calls during Wednesday night's
three-hour session for the resignation of any of the three.
</P>
<P>
A fourth leading member, Representative Bill Paxon of New York,
resigned last week as the Gingrich-appointed leadership chairman.
Paxon, who also apologized, remains the only casualty, for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
Republicans who emerged from the session Wednesday said Armey,
DeLay and Boehner all admitted they hadn't acted quickly enough to
discourage a revolt by dissidents upset with Gingrich's management
style and the party's direction.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders admitted that they sat and listened and some of
them entertained hypotheticals" about a replacement for Gingrich,
said Representative Jim Greenwood, a Republican of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich set the tone for forgiveness in opening the Wednesday
meeting held in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
Armey and Boehner had both denied any complicity in the effort
against Gingrich while DeLay had maintained public silence.

<HEADLINE> FAO Helps Zambia Destroy Obsolete Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) has spent 1.3 million U.S. Dollars on
destroying 370 tons of obsolete pesticides in Zambia and
Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here today by Alemayhu
Wodageneh, the organization's representative in Zambia, FAO
received financial assistance from the Dutch government and the
German Technical Cooperation Agency in its efforts to help
developing countries clean up obsolete pesticides.
</P>
<P>
FAO estimated that there are more than 100,000 tons of
obsolete pesticides in the developing countries, of which 20,000
tons are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the Near East countries, there are 5,000 tons. Several
countries in Asia and Eastern Europe have stocks in excess of
5,000 tons each, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of environmentally sound disposal facilities,
stocks are constantly increasing, some stocks are over 30 years
old, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the total global sales of
pesticides reached 29 billion U.S. Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It said disposal costs vary from 3,000 to 5,000 dollars per
ton and the costs of disposing of obsolete pesticide stocks in
Africa alone are estimated at more than 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"A massive global mobilization of resources is needed to
alleviate the situation. Without financial support from
agro-industry, governments and aid agencies, this enormous threat
cannot be resolved," it said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the environmental threat posed by obsolete
pesticides, FAO said that in many countries, pesticide containers
are kept in the open, with some leaking their contents into the
soil, contaminating soil, water and groundwater, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Many of these pesticides are so toxic that a few grams could
poison thousands of people or contaminate a vast area, it added.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries, aid agencies, agro-chemical companies and
recipient governments are all responsible for the steady
accumulation of the obsolete pesticides in the developing
countries, said FAO.

<HEADLINE> GM Closes Down Two Plants As a Result of Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The General Motors Corp. closed
down two auto plants in Michigan today as the result of a United
Auto Workers (UAW) strike at an important GM parts factory near
Detroit, according to AP reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Buick City plant in Flint and the Orion Township plant
outside Detroit use front-drive transmissions made at the GM
Powertrain Group plant in Warren. The 2,800 UAW workers at the
Warren plant started the strike late Tuesday after negotiators
failed to reach a new plant contract.
</P>
<P>
The Buick City shutdown early today affected 2,700 workers. GM
said it was in the process of idling the Orion Township plant.
</P>
<P>
Additional assembly plants that could close by tonight or
Friday are in Lansing, Michigan state, and one of two in Oshawa,
Ontario in Canada.
</P>
<P>
If the strike lasts beyond two weeks, the U.S. No.1 automaker's
entire North American production could slowly come to a halt due
to the fact that virtually every GM assembly plant in the United
States, Canada and Mexico uses either transmissions, suspension
parts or wheels made in Warren.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the sixth so far this year in the GM factories,
and came less than a week after the UAW and GM settled a
three-month strike at a pickup-truck assembly plant in Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
One of the issues still on the table is GM's plan to outsource
wheel manufacturing from Warren and replace it with work done at
Buick City. GM is expected to announce plans soon to close the big
Buick City complex, which has no new vehicles scheduled after
1999.

LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook is to visit Bosnia next week in an effort to give a fresh
impetus to the Bosnia peace process, according to British
government sources.
</P>
<P>
Cook said in a statement issued today: "I expect some frank
exchanges -- particularly on the need for reintegration within the
Dayton framework, but also on war criminals, corruption and media
freedom."
</P>
<P>
British government officials noted that Cook is expected to
hold separate talks with Bosnian Serb leader Biljana Plavsic and
hardline Bosnian Serbs loyal to former leader Radovan Karadzic to
discuss issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary is prepared for these hardline Bosnian
Serbs to "make a noise" during his visit next Tuesday because
British peacekeeping troops in Bosnia arrested two alleged war
crimes suspects on July 10, one official said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Cook will also meet the three members of
Bosnia's rotating presidency in Sarajevo and urge action on issues
including military liaison, the appointment of ambassadors and the
issuance of passports.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Economists Meet on HK Economic Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 200 distinguished
economists from all over the world attended a symposium here today
to discuss the economic prospects for Hong Kong after its return
to China on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was co-organized by the Better Hong Kong
Foundation, the Department of Economics of the Chinese University
of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Center for Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, officiated at
the opening of the symposium.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Tsang made a brief introduction of the
HKSAR government's attitude toward and its policy for a certain
economic problems of great public concerns.
</P>
<P>
At two following plenary sessions, participants of the
symposium exchanged views on two major topics, namely "Hong Kong
growing as part of China after 1997" and "Continuing growth of
East Asian economies in the 21st century".
</P>
<P>
In a speech titled "Economic prospects for Hong Kong -- after
July 1, 1997", Professor Lawrence Klein, 1980 Nobel Laureate from
the University of Pennsylvania of the United States, predicted
that Hong Kong would maintain a real GDP growth of about 5 percent
in the coming years till 2000.
</P>
<P>
"If Shanghai is to be a main domestic financial center for
China, it makes sense to consider Hong Kong as a main
international financial center. That can be one area of extended
development for increasing the absorptive role of the service
sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that communications, software and medical services are
representative of areas that need cultivation, he suggested Hong
Kong make more infrastructural investment in education for a
build-up in quality of human capital.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yue-Chim Richard Wong from the University of Hong
Kong said that 1997 is a significant year for the future of Hong
Kong, and that Hong Kong's relationship with China's interior
areas is fundamental in defining the shape and scope of economic
and social affairs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The enormous complementarities between the mainland and Hong
Kong have created numerous opportunities for economic cooperation
to the benefit of both Hong Kong and the mainland," he added.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lawrence Lau from the Stanford University, Professor
Ronald Findlay from the Columbia University and Professor Shinichi
 Ichimura from the International Center for the Study of East
Asian Development agreed that the economic outlooks of the East
Asian economies, especially those of the "Four Little Dragons,"
would be fairly bright in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Most participants of today's symposium are here for a three-day
 Far Eastern Meeting of the Econometric Society, one of the most
prestigious societies for economists in the world.
</P>
<P>
The July 24-26 meeting is the first one held by the Econometric
Society in Hong Kong, as well as the largest international
conference in Hong Kong for economists.
</P>

It is organized by the Department of Economics of the Chinese
University of Hong Kong in cooperation with the Chinese Academy of

<P>
PETALING JAYA, MALAYSIA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today voiced
their stands on some important regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
In their joint communique issued here today at the end of their
two-day ASEAN ministerial meeting, the foreign ministers
reaffirmed their commitment toward the goal of general and
complete disarmament, emphasizing their conviction that the end of
the Cold War would enhance the attainment of this objective.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the importance of full and effective
implementation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and called
upon all states to fulfill their obligations and commitments.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Bosnia, the foreign ministers called upon
all parties concerned to fully implement the Dayton Peace
Agreement, which ended years of civil war there.
</P>
<P>
They also appealed to the international community to continue
assisting in the reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
They were of the view that the continued presence of
peacekeeping forces until conditions in Bosnia have stabilized
would be crucial toward the preservation of the country's unity
and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East issue, the foreign ministers viewed with
"deep concern" the current deadlock in the peace process there.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of maintaining the momentum of the
peace process, they reaffirmed their support for the
implementation of all agreements signed and all pledges and
commitments made by various parties.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that Israel take steps to immediately stop all
settlement activities and all illegal measures and actions in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Korean Peninsula, the foreign ministers
welcomed recent developments in the proposed four party talks and
expressed the hope that this could pave the way to the
establishment of a permanent peace mechanism.
</P>
<P>
They called upon the international community to help alleviate
the severe food problem confronting the northern part of the
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Non-Aligned Movement, ASEAN foreign ministers
reaffirmed their conviction that the fundamental principles of the
movement remain valid and relevant under the current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the importance of the movement as a cohesive
force and a major forum for consultations among the developing
countries, thereby strengthening its negotiating power vis-a-vis
the developed nations on crucial political and economic issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A leading American firm of
financial experts has set up a fund of 120 million U.S Dollars to
promote the country's equity-related investments in southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local media today, Dorika Mamboleo, a
partner with New Africa Advisers (NAA), said recently-formed New
Africa Opportunity Fund seeks to achieve a long-term capital
appreciation through privately negotiated equity and
equity-related investments in companies with business activities
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"By virtue of being the largest economy in the region, South
Africa would account for up to 70 percent of the investments with
the rest going to other countries in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC)," said Mamboleo, who was attending
the African African-American Summit which ends in Harare today.
</P>
<P>
The fund, organised with credit support from the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a U.S government agency,
would invest in the construction, consumer products, financial
services, health care, manufacturing, telecommunications and
tourism sectors.
</P>
<P>
While the fund would initially operate in southern Africa,
there were plans to expand to other regions over the next three
years with a view to transform it into a pan-African program,
said Mamboleo.

SHANGHAI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Governor of the People's
Bank of China Chen Yuan said here today that the favorable
economic and financial situation in the first half of the year
will help China reach its goal of macro-economic control for the
whole year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second governors' meeting of the Executives'
Meeting of East Asia and Pacific (EMEAP), Chen noted that China
continued its moderately tight financial policy in the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The country has striven hard to readjust its economic
structure, invigorate the state-owned enterprises, enhance
economic returns and steadily push forward the development of the
social security system.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has tried various policies to regulate
monetary supply and strengthen financial supervision, which have
effectively standardized the operation of the country's financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the national economy has maintained a sound,
steady and rapid growth momentum, and inflation has kept
decreasing.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the favorable performance of the economy in the
first half year will help the country meet its target of achieving
an eight percent GDP increase and confine price hikes to within
five percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that the main problems in the country's economic
and financial operations include the operation of the state-owned
enterprises, the reemployment of laid-off workers and the
further development of the social security system.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the regulation and control of financial
policies through macro-economic development should be
strengthened, and the issue of financial bonds needs to be further
improved in the latter half of this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, efforts must be made to readjust the investment
structure and avoid duplicated construction, the deputy governor
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Afro-Americans Can Help Africa: Jesse Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- African Americans are as capable
as their white counterparts to assist in Africa's development,
U.S black human rights activist Jesse Jackson said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a hard-hitting speech at the Fourth African
African-American Summit held in Harare, Jackson said there was so
much talent among the African-Americans waiting to be tapped by
African people.
</P>
<P>
"We can broker trade, establish telecommunications systems,
transport, housing," he said, adding "There is no building we
cannot design, there is no river we cannot dam for irrigation or
turn into energy. We can run banks, universities..."
</P>
<P>
Now that Africa was politically free from colonialism, he
said, it was time we became reciprocal trading partners.
</P>
<P>
"Don't just assign us to talk to white people, talk to us,"
said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
The human rights activist said the relationship between
Africans and African-Americans should develop beyond ethnicity to
trade and investment with character and human values.
</P>
<P>
"Man cannot live on bread alone... We need values. Our
kinship is not in ethnicity but we need to wipe out malnutrition,
illiteracy, provide decent housing and stop drug abuse," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen relations, Jackson said, there was need
to cement bonds between Africans and African-Americans through
acquiring observer status in the Organisation of African Unity
and the need for the U.S and African governments to allow dual
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"These relationships can be done according to the law. We
must overcome slavery and colonialism which cast doubts about
each other," said Jackson.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged Not to Sacrifice Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A Jamaican envoy today warned
Africa against sacrificing sovereignty in the quest to attract
investment and establish partnership with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Burchell Whiteman, Jamaican Minister of Education, Youth and
Culture, told the Fourth African African-American Summit here
that host countries of investment should decide the legitimacy of
proposed projects.
</P>
<P>
Whiteman said, African countries should be vigilant and ensure
that whatever would be agreed upon would be adhered to by the
investor.
</P>
<P>
"All the plans that we make bilaterally must be rooted in the
cultural reality of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prescribing the approach of trade and investment as the route
to enhanced relations, he also suggested that Africa should work
on improving education and training.
</P>
<P>
The four-day summit has provided an opportunity for Africans
to explore trade and investment opportunities with
African-Americans.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Hopes Cambodia Could Find Peaceful Solution Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, MALAYSIA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today hoped that a peaceful
solution to the Cambodian crisis would enable the country to join
ASEAN and fulfill the vision of a 10-member ASEAN as envisaged by
its founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
In their joint communique issued here today at the end of the
two-day 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), ASEAN foreign
ministers expressed the hope that the situation in Cambodia would
return to normal and that a solution could be found "in the spirit
of the Paris Peace Accords."
</P>
<P>
The admission of Cambodia into ASEAN, which was originally
scheduled for July 23 together with Laos and Myanmar, was deferred
due to factional fighting there on July 5 and 6.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN tried to play a role in finding a peaceful solution to
the crisis in Cambodia by sending a special delegation, comprising
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and his Philippine and Thai
counterparts Domingo Siazon and Prachuab Chaiyasarn, to call on
Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk and the two Co-Prime Ministers
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Its role was rejected by Hun Sen at the initial stage. But
Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot, who is here to attend the AMM
as an observer, expressed the new position "on behalf of Hun Sen,"
that "Cambodia welcomes ASEAN's role in finding a political
solution to the crisis in order to bring about political stability
in the country."
</P>
<P>
Upon reconfirmation of this new position, ASEAN Ministerial
Delegation would continue with its efforts to assist Cambodia to
find a peaceful resolution of the situation in that country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ASEAN foreign ministers stressed the bloc's
commitment to the principle of non-interference in the internal
affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted that ASEAN had offered its good offices to
Cambodia in the light of the recent "unfortunate" developments and
in view of Cambodia's interest in joining ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> New Bihar Chief Minister of India Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Rabri Devi, wife of former chief
minister of India's Bihar state, today was sworn in as new chief
minister of the state hours after his husband resigned from the
post for his alleged involvement in a multi-crore rupee
embezzlement scandal, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Laloo Prasad Yadav, who had been asserting that he would not
quit until convicted by court and that he would continue to rule
from jail if arrested, chose to resign soon after a special court
of the Central Bureau of Investigation issued arrest warrant
against him earlier today.
</P>
<P>
While presenting resignation to Bihar state Governor A. R.
Kidwai, Yadav urged the governor to swear in his wife who has been
elected legislative party leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
The Rashtriya Janata Dal is a new party floated by Yadav on
July 5 after splitting the Janata Dal, which used to be the
largest constituent of the ruling United Front.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Devi, 13 others were also sworn in as members of the
new state government.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Yadav may still hold complete sway
over the administration with Devi, a housewife with no experience
of politics, in his chair.

LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- England striker Les Ferdinand is
poised to go to White Hart Lane on Newcastle's acception of a 10
million U.S. dollars bid from Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old striker, who last season shared 49 goals with

Everton once also showed an interest in the striker, but
Ferdinand prefers to reunite himself with manager Gerry Francis,
who was manager at Queen Park Rangers when Ferdinand first made a

SHENZHEN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The local taxation authority in
Shenzhen, located in south China's Guangdong Province, announced
at a press conference here today that part of the fixed assets
owed by the Honichi Golf Entertainment Co. will be auctioned to
pay off back taxes.
</P>

orders. The public auction of its fixed assets is to be carried
out in accordance with the province's tax laws.
</P>
<P>
If the income from the auction exceeds the sum of the back
taxes, the extra amount will be given back to the company; if not,
other assets will be auctioned till the debts are cleared.
</P>
<P>
Items to go on the auction block include a two million sq
m. golf course and its assets. The land-use right of the course
extends through October 10, 2007.
</P>
<P>
The auction is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m., August 18, at
the International Hotel of the Shenzhen International Exhibition
Center.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Predicts 3.5 Percent Economic Growth in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Planning Bureau has
predicted that the country's economy will grow by around 3.5
percent this year as a result of increased domestic and external
demand.
</P>
<P>
In its report on economic review for 1996, released here
today, the Planning Bureau speaks of a slowdown of the Cyprus
economy in 1996 "due mainly to exogenous factors", such as the
sluggish development in European Union (EU) economies, the rise
in oil prices and the further liberalization of world trade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Central Bank Governor Afxentis Afxentiou
expected a modest recovery of the economy this year, with real
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rising by 2.5-3 percent, compared
with 1.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But for 1997, the report says the external environment is
expected to be more favorable, with Britain's economy projected
to grow by 3 percent this year, compared with 2.3 percent in
1996. Britain is Cyprus' leading trading partner.
</P>
<P>
The situation with regard to other EU countries is even more
encouraging, while a satisfactory growth rate is also expected in
Middle East countries, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The Planning Bureau also took into account some negative
factors, such as the problems of competitiveness facing the
island's manufacturing sector. The loss of competitiveness was
attributed to the new import tariffs, as Cyprus complied with the
provisions of the customs union with the EU, and its obligations
under the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The report says its upbeat forecast for a 3.5 percent growth of
the economy this year is based on the assumption that the negative
psychological climate among investors and consumers will be
reversed.
</P>
<P>
It refers to the package of measures taken by the government to
stimulate investment and consumption -- more incentives to the
export industry, a promotional campaign by the Cyprus Tourism
Organization to attract more foreign tourists, interest rate cuts
and a speeding up of development projects.
</P>
<P>
The report says investments are expected to go up by 3.5
percent this year, while external demand is scheduled to increase
by 6 percent, with a considerable recovery in the export of
services.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and other sectors, such as trade, communications,
banking services, insurance and other professional services are
expected to show stronger growth rates.

<HEADLINE> China's Poorest Province to End History of Bringing in Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou Province in southwest
China, one of the country's poorest provinces, is working to end
its tradition of bringing in grain from elsewhere in the country
by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The province is carrying out a grain self-sufficiency program,
aimed at producing 11 million tons of grain by the end of the
century, a million tons more than last year, in a move to resolve
the grain shortage, said Guizhou Governor Wu Yixia.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has only 1.8 percent of China's 9.6-million-sq-km land
area, but has to feed a population of 35 million, which accounts
for 2.9 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
It now has 1.84 million ha of farmland, more than 70 percent of
which is medium- and low-yield land, and has to bring in 650,000
tons of grain annually from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The state will join Guizhou's effort and plans to spend 1.9
billion yuan on its farmland improvement during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"Guizhou still has potential in grain production. The farmland
improvement project, upon completion in 2010, is expected to
increase 700,000 tons of grain output annually," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
A 10-year (1990-2000) farmland improvement project has been
making progress. By the end of last year, the province turned
200,000 ha of hillside into fertile land, to add 600,000 tons of
grain annually.
</P>
<P>
Another important way for the province to promote grain
production lies in science and technology, which contribute only
30 percent to its agricultural production, nine percentage points
lower than the national average, Wu said. Per-unit grain output in
Guizhou is 20 percent lower than the country's average, he added.
</P>
<P>
The province will continue working to raise its 50 percent of
fine-seed coverage, as well as multiple cropping index, in a bid
to ensure a total growing area of 2.86 million ha each year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhang Lijian, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences, who helped to create Guizhou's grain
self-sufficiency program, said, "The program is part of a
nationwide campaign to increase grain production, but Guizhou,
with the worst farming conditions in China, will attempt to
support itself in grain supplies, as is expected of the whole
nation."

<HEADLINE> Mir Accident Damage Estimated at 20 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The damage caused by an accident at
the Mir orbital station in June is preliminarily estimated at 125
billion roubles (about 20 million U.S. dollars), the Itar-Tass
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
General Director of the Russian Space Agency Yuri Koptev said
that the Russian government would consider how to get the money
for Mir next week.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that additional equipment for
repairing the orbital station and conducting preliminary trials on
Earth will cost up to 25 billion roubles (about 4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, he said the delivery of equipment to the station will
cost another 90,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Koptev said the space agency, which received only 23 percent of
the earmarked budget this year, cannot cover the expenses on its
own.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, additional allocations would come from
either government reserve fund or changes in the amount of
spending cuts planned for the space needs.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Research Institute for medical and
biological problems, Viktor Baranov, said that Mir crew head
Vasily Tsibliev is in normal physical condition, sticking special
physical exercises and taking medicine.
</P>
<P>
He said the other two cosmonauts, Alexander Lazutkin, a
Russian, and Michael Foale, an American, are also feeling
well. All the three cosmonauts are ready for return to the Earth,
which is scheduled for August 14.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Enhance Control on Medical Labs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- New guidelines for the registration
of medical laboratories in Nigeria may soon be released by the
Federal Ministry of Health, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new rules are designed to check the incidence of wrong
results emanating from the country's medical laboratories, many
of which do not have required manpower and facilities, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors are complaining the false results from medical
laboratories may be threatening the lives of many Nigerians as
the results had invariably led to wrong diagnosis of the
patients' ailment.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines are expected to enhance the registration of
medical laboratories.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Prime Minister John
Howard was admitted to hospital today after a bout of flu and
bronchitis developed into pneumonia, his office said.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who turns 58 tomorrow, was admitted to a private
hospital on Sydney's north shore late today.
</P>
<P>
"On doctors' advice and to enable a full recovery from his
current illness, the prime minister has been admitted to hospital
in Sydney," a statement from the prime minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the prime minister was expected to remain in
hospital for most of next week.
</P>
<P>
Howard fell ill last weekend and spent most of the past week
confined to bed at his official Sydney residence.
</P>
<P>
He had been suffering from flu and bronchitis, which forced him
to cancel a range of official functions including an appearance at
a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The illness has also forced him to cancel a planned visit to
Melbourne, where he was due to meet New Zealand Prime Minister Jim
Bolger tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello took over as acting prime minister
until late Sunday, when Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer returns
from leave.

<HEADLINE> 1,750 MNLF Members to Be Trained in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will give
a six-month educational training program for some 1,750 Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) members who would join the
national police, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Alexander Aguirre of the Presidential Management
Staff said the training is part of the government's commitment to
carrying out its peace agreement signed last September with the
MNLF.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, 7,500 MNLF rebels would be absorbed
by the military and the police respectively.
</P>
<P>
The government designed the training program because it
recognized that some MNLF rebels are not qualified to be
integrated into the police force due to the lack of education, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the MNLF members can join the Philippine National
Police after the training, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has ordered the release of some 480,000
U.S. dollars to finance the training program while 1,750 slots
have been ready in the Philippine National Police, Aguirre said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Confident in Its Exchange Rate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's monetary system will
stand up well to the recent upheavals that led to the depreciation
of a string of Asian currencies, said a senior government official
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an economic symposium, Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang said: "We're, nevertheless, confident in the ability of our
exchange rate system to withstand shocks and speculative attacks."
</P>
<P>
He reeled out a list of reasons backing his confidence --
robust monetary regime, effective monetary devices, ample fund of
exchange reserves and a healthy banking system.
</P>
<P>
But that's not all to the financial secretary, who believed
that sound economic fundamentals indeed buttress Hong Kong's
financial strength. He listed such foremost factors as moderate
inflation, balanced external account, low unemployment and
flexible labor market, and minimum artificial constraint on the
business sector.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Tsang contributed Hong Kong's financial strength
to prudent and tight management of public finances. Borrowing
experiences from crisis elsewhere, he said that the loss of
control over the budget, as a clear symptom of structural
weakness, laid the ground for financial vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong, a prudent and conservatory budgetary stand has
long been our habit. Now it is a formal requirement stipulated in
the Basic Law," said the financial secretary.
</P>
<P>
Public spending growth in Hong Kong is consistently kept within
the trend growth rate of the economy. Here the fiscal debt is zero
because the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves from
budgetary surpluses makes fiscal borrowing unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The SAR official concluded: "It's crucial to get the
fundamentals right. It's far more important in devising effective
counteractive measures in times of currency trouble. It's the key
to ensure lasting financial stability."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Host G-15 Business Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A G-15 business and investment
forum will be held in Zimbabwean capital from August 4 to 5, to
discuss closer trade links among member countries, Zimbabwe
Committee Chairman John Mapondera said here today.
</P>
<P>
"About 60 foreign business people from Latin America, Asia and
Africa are expected to attend the conference on the fostering of
closer trade links, investment and joint venture opportunities
and technology transfer in the framework of South-South
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting to be chaired by Zimbabwe, would also resolve
constraints to successful cooperation of the business sector in
the G-15 countries, Mapondera added.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 is an initiative to promote business links among
countries of the south and reduce dependency on the north.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation is also meant to provide access to appropriate
technology developed and adapted by countries of the south.
</P>
<P>
According to Mapondera, "This technology is more adapted to
African conditions and could even be more affordable."
</P>
<P>
"We are looking to opportunities that will help us through
small and medium scale enterprises, particularly to create
employment through joint ventures and expansion of markets
through the export of our products to other countries," the
committee chairman noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The governments of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Britain signed an air
services agreement here today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Economic Services of Hong Kong Stephen Ip and
British Consul-General in Hong Kong Francis Cornish signed the
agreement on behalf of their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ip said the signing of the
agreement today had particular significance as the agreement was
the first of its kind signed by the Hong Kong SAR Government.
</P>
<P>
"In line with the provision of the Basic Law, the HKSAR
Government will continue to negotiate and conclude air services
agreements with our aviation partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Britain is an important partner of Hong Kong, Ip
said the two sides had very close links in aviation, trade,
investment and other activities.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Cathay Pacific, Air Hong Kong, British Airways and
Virgin Atlantic operated over 9,000 flights between the two
places, carrying about one million passengers and 86,000 tons of
cargo.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, effective from today, is the 22nd air services
agreement signed by Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> National Peace Efforts Urged in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Somalian faction leader Ali
Mahdi Mohamed today called on Hussein Mohamed Aidid to join the
country's national peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his residence after returning from recent Sodare
meeting in Ethiopia, Ali Mahdi said a government for Somalia is
now in sight following a long anarchy and civil war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi, accompanied by a large delegation composed of
members from the National Salvation Council (NSC) founded in
Sodare village of Ethiopia, added that the forthcoming Bosasso
Conference will bring about a lasting solution for the Somalis
and a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi was welcomed today by hundreds of cheering
supporters at Issaley airstrip, 15 km north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
People waving green leaves were waiting for him in front of
his house to the main street of Sana where microphones were also
installed to let his supporters hear his first message for more
than three months.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the NSC members coming today with Ali
Mahdi, will meet Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Serri Rino, who
is scheduled to arrive in Mogadishu on July 29.
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Cassini, Italy's special envoy to Somalia, is at the
moment in Mogadishu to persuade the factions of the capital to
open the main airport of Mogadishu for the arrival of the Italian
high level delegation, of which he is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
More than 27 Somali factions who have been holding their
second phase meeting in Ethiopia have agreed to hold a national
reconciliation conference in the northeastern town of Bosasso on
November 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 delegates from the factions and different sectors of
the community are expected to attend the conference aimed at
setting up a government.
</P>
<P>
So far, one of the main faction leaders Hussein Mohamed Aidid
has dismissed the meeting, terming those advocating for it as
foreign manipulated elements who want to put the country under
colony.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Mohamed Hagi Ibrahim Egal of Somaliland has also
declined to accept the call of the Sodare group led by Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The Bosasso meeting by the factions allied with Ali Mahdi
Mohamed had been postponed from June due to the lack of common
objectives from the factions that called for its convening.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said one of the main reasons that hindered
Bosasso meeting was an internal challenge between Ali Mahdi and
Osman Atto, both main figures of the Sodare group.
</P>
<P>
The friction between them still remains strong and might
hamper again the already-postponed conference in Bosasso,the
sources concluded, adding the meeting will have no sense if any
of the two men gives it a miss.

<HEADLINE> New UN Chief Weapons Inspector Arrives in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has gotten
a positive response from Iraq in cooperation on the task of
getting rid of alleged Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
visiting new U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Butler, new chief of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of disarming Iraq, who arrived here today on a two-day
visit during which he would detail his policies on Iraq to Kuwaiti
officials, made the remarks upon his arrival at the airport.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he received positive response during a
meeting in Baghdad with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz,
adding that "the time had come to have a new determination and a
new spirit of cooperation on the task of getting rid of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Butler said that "on the whole, I thought we got a positive
response, and we have worked out some plans for the future which
if they bear fruit will be good."
</P>
<P>
He said "those plans address the weapons systems in three
baskets: missile, chemical and biological, where it is important
that Iraq comes forward and gives more (information) to the
commission on those baskets..."
</P>
<P>
But he declined to answer a question on whether he had any
evidence on Iraq concealing weapons, noting that "this would go
into the substance of private consultations and at this stage it
wouldn't be helpful to our progress to answer that question."
</P>
<P>
Butler, an Australian who succeeded Sweden's Rolf Ekeus on
July 1 as chairman of UNSCOM, arrived here on an invitation from
the Kuwaiti government.
</P>
<P>
This is his first visit to Kuwait since he took over the post.
He is expected to hold talks with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Parliament Speaker Ahmad
Al-Sadoun and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem
Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to reassure Kuwaiti leadership on UNSCOM's
continuous determination to obtain Iraq's compliance with all U.N.
resolutions related to its aggression on Kuwait in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has been continuing to oppose any
relaxation of sanctions on Iraq until it demonstrates its
willingness to fully comply with the resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Health Promotion Ends in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The 4th International Conference
on Health Promotion ended here today by adopting the Jakarta
Declaration on Health Promotion in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day meeting, 400 participants from 78 countries
and regions including China have pleaded to build partnership and
drawn upon the widest range of resources to tackle global health
determinants in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said health is a basic human right and
essential for social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
It held that pre-requisites for health are peace, shelter,
education, social security, social relations, food, income,
empowerment of women, a stable eco-system, sustainable resource
use, social justice, respect for human rights and equity.
</P>
<P>
Above all, it noted, "poverty is the greatest threat to
health."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the participants reiterated the fundamental
importance of the five Ottawa charter strategies, namely: Build
health public policy; Create supportive environments; Strengthen
community action; Develop personal skills and Re-orient health
services.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, comprehensive approaches to
health development are the most effective.
</P>
<P>
To address emerging threats to health, the declaration said,
new forms of action are needed. The challenge for the coming years
will be to unlock the potential for health promotion inherent in
many sectors of society, among local communities and within
families.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that the priorities for health promotion in
the 21st century include promote social responsibility for health,
increase investment for health development, consolidate and expand
partnership for health, increase community capacity and empower
the individual and secure an infrastructure for health promotion.
</P>
<P>
In order to speed progress toward global health promotion, the
participants proposed the formation of a global health promotion
alliance.
</P>
<P>
A first priority of the alliance will be to expand and
facilitate the access of developing countries to global health
promotion initiatives.
</P>
<P>
All global players -- governmental and nongovernmental
organizations and business sector should be involved if the
alliance is to achieve maximum impact, they added.
</P>
<P>
The 4th International Conference on Health Promotion in Jakarta
from July 21 to 25 is the first to be held in a developing
country, and the first to involve the private sector in supporting
health promotion.

HANGZHOU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
now has 965 towns, compared with only 167 in 1978.
</P>
<P>
More than 14 million people are living in the province's small
towns, accounting for one third of its total population. Sixty
percent of the province's rural industrial workforce are working
in rural and township enterprises in the small towns.
</P>
<P>
Rural industrial enterprises here contribute four-fifths and
two-thirds, respectively, of the province's total rural industrial
output value and total revenue created by rural industry.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities have worked out a series of policies
and regulations to ensure the healthy growth of small towns.
</P>
<P>
A provincial-level leading group has been established to take
charge of the experiment of implementing comprehensive reforms in
small towns. The experiment is aimed at building new mechanisms
suitable for the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, 47 towns, including six chosen by
central government departments, have been designated to pilot
comprehensive reforms.
</P>
<P>
These towns have made progress in the reform of the
governmental management system, registration system, planning and
designing of urban towns.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that it is planned to spread the
experiment to more areas, and by the year 2000 the number of towns
designated to experiment with comprehensive reforms will be 100.
</P>
<P>
East China, where rural industry is highly developed, is one of
the country's most economically developed areas, and the living
standards of local residents are higher than in most of the rural
areas in China.

<P>
SHENZHEN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shenzhen in south
China's Guangdong Province will increase cooperation with Hong
Kong in a number of fields.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is the interior city nearest to Hong Kong, which
returned to the embrace of the motherland on July 1 after more
than 150 years of British rule.
</P>
<P>
Local officials of Shenzhen said that they would work in close
cooperation with the industrial and commercial community of Hong
Kong and would supply Hong Kong with plenty of fresh and live
products, as well as quality meat, vegetables, eggs and milk.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they will also work together to expand trade and will
ship more commodities made in Shenzhen and other interior areas to
Hong Kong. And they will join in the effort to explore the
international market and to bring in more exhibitions to each area.
</P>
<P>
Among others, officials said, Shenzhen should be linked to the
information network of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) as soon as possible, using the TDC's information resources
to serve local commercial and trade companies of Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The two areas are also expected to increase cooperation in

BONN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Another 2,800 residents of low-lying
villages along the swollen Oder River in eastern Germany were told
to leave their homes today as the flooding was becoming
increasingly threatening.
</P>
<P>
With two dike bursts in the last two days of the Oder, which
serves as the German-Polish border, flood water rushed into a
nearby flatland of over 60 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Water was five meters deep in some places and might rise up to
12 meters, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic appeal on local radio stations, Interior Minister
of the eastern state of Brandenburg, Arwin Ziel, called on the
residents to leave because their lives could be in danger.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 Germans have been requested to leave their
homes. But many of them preferred to stay behind to help fight the
rising flood water.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of casualties in Germany, but flooding
has claimed over 100 lives in neighboring Poland and the Czech

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Help Laos, Myanmar Integrate Into Grouping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that the admission of
Laos and Myanmar into ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) marked "the promising dawn of a united ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement at the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
(AMM),  Badawi said the just-ended AMM witnessed the inaugural
participation of Laos and Myanmar as full-fledged ASEAN members,
marking "the promising dawn of a united ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
"It reflects the emergence of a new era in regional cooperation
where countries of the Southeast Asian region are integrated in a
regional grouping for the common purpose of achieving regional
peace and prosperity," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference later, Badawi said the
constructive engagement relationship with Myanmar will continue
and will be more comprehensive now that the country is an ASEAN
member.
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon, who has been elected at the AMM to replace Badawi as
chairman of the AMM, noted, "the integration of Laos and Myanmar
into the ASEAN mainstream will be facilitated as we resolutely
combine our energies and our talents for this purpose."
</P>
<P>
He promised that ASEAN will also adhere to the principle of
"non-discrimination" in all its activities as "by virtue of their
admission into the ASEAN, Laos and Myanmar became equal partners
in all our dialogue relationships, are entitled to participate in,
contribute to, and benefit from our collective cooperative
endeavors."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a press conference earlier, ASEAN
Secretary-General Ajit Singh said problems exist for the two new
members to get fully integrated into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
He cited the differences in economic system, foreign exchange
policy and trading and investment regime, which are all different
from those of all other ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Even the fact that ASEAN uses English as the working language
presents problems to Myanmar officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that Myanmar has worked very hard to meet
all the requirements, obligations and commitments of an ASEAN
member and said ASEAN on its part will try to find ways and means
of helping the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Artists Go On Tour in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A 64-year-old Tibetan comedian has
no doubt he can crack up a European audience with his
one-of-a-kind hat tricks, even though they might not understand
anything he says.
</P>
<P>
Thupten, 64, is among the 30-member Tibetan ensemble which will
perform in five European countries, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden,
Greece and Norway, from July 27 to August 29.
</P>
<P>
The largest such touring group from Tibet is made up of the
region's most well-known singers, dancers and folk artists. A
similar group was organized in 1995 for another European trip.
</P>
<P>
Thupten is best known for his one-man-show, "An Ode to Hats,"
which tells the life of legendary Tibetan King Gesar. Thupten has
played the king on stage for 52 years.
</P>
<P>
In the piece, Gesar uses feathers, arrows, spears and silk to
form hats which become clever weapons. After sneaking into the
enemy palace in disguise, Gesar wins over the soldiers with a
dazzling performance, and then decapitates his enemy with a hat.
</P>
<P>
The colorful but deadly headgear is Thupten's most important
prop. "I made it with 16 kinds of bird feathers, and I can change
its form easily," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 12, the now-swarthy Thupten was a lama in Lhasa
lamasery. There, he became obsessed with the good deeds of King
Gesar. After giving up his life in the lamasery, Thupten became a
folk singer and told the story of his hero through his art.
</P>
<P>
"The comic dialogue performance was never accepted by the noble
society in slave-owning Tibet," he said. "Now we can join the
specialized artist group and perform in theaters."
</P>
<P>
He attended an international arts festival in London in
1987. After the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) introduced
his comedic talent, British audiences wanted more.
</P>
<P>
Another famous singer in the ensemble, Choe Den, is eager to
show her enthusiasm for her homeland, southern Tibetan Linzhi
County, which she eulogizes through her songs. "Linzhi is a
beautiful place," she said. "I love the people there and make my
songs represent their feelings."
</P>
<P>
Tibet's top female singer, Tseden Dolma, will also go abroad
with the touring company.
</P>
<P>
Ten Ziu, a leader of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and also the
director of the ensemble, pointed out that this performance tour
is designed to give Europeans a better understanding of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"We will show new aspects of Tibetan people and let the outside
world know us correctly," he said.

<HEADLINE> Violence Erupts Around Bangladesh's National Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's police today fired tear
gas to disperse a group of Muslim fundamentalists who brought out
a procession defying a ban on rallies and processions around
Baitul Mukarram Mosque, the national mosque of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency BSS, at least five
persons were injured in the clash which started when a group of
fundamentalists tried to march towards the ruling Awami (people's)
League (AL) office at Bangabandhu Avenue, close to the south gate
of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
The tension situation around the national mosque has been
simmering following the disruption of a function at the mosque
premises on July 17 when some people threw shoes on the dais where
President Shahabuddin Ahmed was present.
</P>
<P>
The ruling AL has criticized the "unholy forces" of trying to
"create chaos" in the country. The AL leaders also urged all true
Muslims and pro-liberation forces to join today's Jumma prayer at
the national mosque to protest the incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dhaka Metropolitan Police on Thursday imposed a ban
on rallies, processions, meetings and demonstrations around the
mosque, where is usually used as the meeting venue of Islamic
parties and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
The trouble erupted this afternoon as the fundamentalists tried
to stage a demonstration at Bangabandhu Avenue, close to the AL
office, in violation of the ban.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were chased back by the AL supporters and
were later pushed inside the mosque premise after police lobbed
tear gas to disperse them.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Says No to Release Bests in College Entrance Exam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Education authorities in east
China's Zhejiang Province have announced they will not release the
names of the highest-ranking students who took this year's college
entrance exam, explaining that high test scores are not the main
goal of education.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Provincial Education Commission has refused to release
the complete list of all middle school students' college entrance
examination scores, said Wang Xiaowen, director in charge of
Zhejiang College Enrollment Office.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that giving out exam results has a misguided
influence on students. However, Chinese people often judge the
teaching quality of a school by its test scores -- especially by
the number of students who enroll in college.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, China's top education organ,
the State Education Commission, has pushed for the overall
development of each student, which includes ethical behavior, good
study habits, good physical health and having some general work
skills.
</P>
<P>
"The top three examinees for a college entrance test might not
be the most highly-qualified students," Wang said. For example, he
said, more than 600 middle school graduates in Zhejiang have
received recommendation for enrollment and did not take the
entrance test this year at all.
</P>
<P>
The graduates recommended for admission without the test must
be the best students in their schools, both academically and
because of their untarnished personal records, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that if those students do not participate in
the exams, "it would be very hard for us to say who are the best
students."
</P>
<P>
In ancient China, the title "Number One Scholar" was conferred
to the student who ranked first on the highest-level imperial
examination. The system was abolished at the end of the Qing
Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Works to Boost Economic Ties with Other Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The foreign
ministers of the nine member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today reiterated their commitment
to open regionalism in an effort to boost economic ties with other
regions.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of their two-day
meeting here, the ministers from Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam expressed their "continued support" for the efforts made
by the ASEAN to forge cooperation relations with economic
organizations in other regions.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN has conducted consultations with a number of regional
economic groups in other parts of the world, including the North
American Free Trade Agreement, the MERCOSUR, the European Free
Trade Association and the Southern African Development Community
in order to extend economic cooperation beyond the Southeast Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers stressed the need for these linkages to promote
greater inter-regional trade, investment and technology flows and
to bring the private sectors of the ASEAN and these other regional
groupings together," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed their appreciation of the concrete
steps taken to develop the ASEAN-Mekong Basin Development
Cooperation Framework, which they said "would promote the economic
integration of the Mekong riparian states and create a new
dimension in ASEAN economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They were also satisfied with the progress made in economic
cooperation among member countries, particularly in the
implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
They noted that although member countries are only half way to
the deadline of 2003 for realizing the AFTA, nearly 91 percent of
all tariff lines in the ASEAN have already been included in the
Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) Scheme.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, all tariffs for products are to have been cut
to no higher than 5 percent by 2003, thus reaching the standard
for the establishment of the AFTA.
</P>
<P>
At present, average tariff rates for the products enjoying
tariff cuts have fallen to 6.38 percent from 12.76 percent in 1993
and efforts are being made to remove non-tariff barriers such as
customs surcharges.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of the AFTA is to enhance the ASEAN's
position as a competitive production base geared toward servicing
the global market.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also expressed their satisfaction with
the progress achieved in other areas of economic cooperation such
as intellectual property, industry, services, transportation and
communications, minerals and energy and finance and banking.
</P>
<P>
On the current currency crisis in Southeast Asia, the
communique said the ministers expressed "serious concerns over
well-coordinated efforts to destabilize ASEAN currencies for
self-serving purposes, thus threatening the stability of all ASEAN
economies."
</P>
<P>
They called for further intensification of ASEAN cooperation to
safeguard and promote ASEAN interests in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a press conference after the closing of the 30th
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, foreign
minister of Malaysia and AMM chairman, said currency manipulation
has affected the value of the currencies in the region and is
destroying the ASEAN's economic progress.
</P>
<P>
"It is only right that we should express our concern
collectively," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said it is up for the governors of central banks and
finance ministers of ASEAN countries to decide on the measures to
be taken to stop the currency manipulation.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed the conviction that "if we can do it together,
it would be better."

<HEADLINE> Chengdu Wins Anti-Pollution Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- This capital of land-locked
Sichuan Province in southwest China is to pour more investment
into its pollution-control facilities, in a bid to make itself
an "ecological city" with fresh air and clear water.
</P>
<P>
"The environment should not fall victim to economic
development. And we are seeking a way to prevent the city from
being polluted, while maintaining rapid economic growth," Di
Tingguo, deputy mayor of the city, said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chengdu will invest a total of two billion yuan in
pollution control during the 1996-2000 period, accounting for two
percent of the city's GDP.
</P>
<P>
The city has taken tough measures to meet its goal of becoming
a pollution-free city in the next few years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Water pollution is the most serious problem here. So we will
start by tackling water pollution first," Di said.
</P>
<P>
The city's project to harness the Funanhe River, which
encircles the city and is badly polluted by waste water from
numerous township enterprises, will be completed soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 445 paper mills and other small
businesses that used to cause serious pollution have been closed
down, Di said.
</P>
<P>
The city turned down an overseas investor's application to
built a thermal power plant there two years ago, because it was
considered a pollution risk.
</P>
<P>
"Chengdu needs overseas investment to promote its economy. But
it also needs fresh air to breathe. A thermal power plant would
lead to dust pollution in the crowded city," Di said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has made efforts to reshape the local
industrial structure, increase the number of enterprises that
cause little pollution in the urban area, and move out the
heavily-polluting ones.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items
in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Only half the names on a list published by Swiss banks of
dormant World War II-era accounts appear to have been Jewish;
others in the odd group included aristocrats, a Japanese naval
officer and a former foreign minister of fascist Spain.
</P>
<P>
Many of the people on the list were easy to locate, casting
doubts on Swiss claims that they delayed action because the
accounts were too old to trace.
</P>
<P>
-- The scientists in Scotland who produced Dolly, the sheep
that was cloned from another sheep, announced that they had taken
a major step in the genetic engineering of animals. Using a
method much like that used to produce Dolly, they created a lamb
that has a human gene in every cell of its body. Cloning experts
say the work is a milestone.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton has signaled that he is in no
hurry to reach a final budget and tax cut deal, adding to growing
doubts the two sides can finish up before the August recess.
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal government and New York City reached an
agreement Thursday to transfer custody of more than 50 deaf
Mexican victims of an alien smuggling ring to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton held a White House symposium on
global warming to kick off a campaign to promote a national
consensus on supporting international controls on emissions of
carbon dioxide and methane.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Agrees to Respect Paris Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen and U.S. special envoy Stephen Solarz today agreed on
three principles for solving the current crisis in Cambodia,
including respect for the Paris peace accord and the results of
the 1993 election.
</P>
<P>
During their three-hour talks here, they also agreed on
allowing exiled parliament members and politicians to return to
Cambodia safely and on holding free and fair elections as
scheduled next May, said a spokesman for Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he would resume cooperation with Prince Norodom
Ranariddh in the coalition government if Ranariddh is not judged
guilty by the court.
</P>
<P>
He has accused Prince Ranariddh, Cambodia's First Prime
Minister ousted by Hun Sen early this month, of illegally massing
troops around Phnom Penh, and of "treason" by negotiating with
Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
However, Hun Sen pledged to defend the constitutional monarchy,
the Cambodian Constitution, assembly and government. He welcomed
foreign observers to monitor the general elections next May.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Disarmament Conference Ends in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. Conference on Disarmament
Issues ended today in Sapporo, northern Japan, with differences
remaining over whether to continue focus on nuclear arms
reduction or to face the danger posed by conventional arms.
</P>
<P>
Prvoslav Davinic, director of the U.N. Center for Disarmament
Affairs, said at the closing ceremony that the conference was "a
complete success" in meeting the objectives of allowing the
exchange of views on issues affecting international peace,
security and arms control, the Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, attended by 79 diplomats,
academicians, government officials and other experts from 32
countries, has given priority to disarmament and regional security.
</P>
<P>
It also discussed the issues of deadlock in the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), control of small arms, regulating
international arms trade, nuclear weapons-free zones, the
importance of economics, and maritime confidence and security
measures.
</P>
<P>
Davinic said while the danger of a nuclear war by design has
been largely eliminated, the pursuit of nuclear disarmament
remains as important as ever.
</P>
<P>
More attention would be placed on other issues such as
preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear states and
control of conventional arms in the light of the shift from the
nature of war toward internal conflicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Conference on Disarmament Issues has been held
annually in Japan since 1989.

the second largest city of Egypt, before Arafat went to Brussels
for talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Arafat recently also discussed with Israeli Labor Party leader
Ehud Barak the necessity of working to remove obstacles hindering
the Middle East peace process which came to halt after Israel
started the construction of a Jewish settlement in Har Home in
Arab East Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Ready to Back to International Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Toyota team is to return to the
international arena next month after it has pulled out of the
world rally championship for a year and eight months, the Toyota
company announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Toyota team will compete in all the remaining rounds of the
world championship as preparation for the 1998 season, the company
added.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 world champion French driver Didier Auriol will test
the Toyota Carolla at the Rally Finland on August 29, where the
Toyota team Europe crowned first in 1975.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, the International Automobile Federation
suspended Toyota Team Europe for one year because Auriol's Celica
was disqualified for installation of illegal turbo air-intake in
the Catalunya Rally on October 22-25. The Toyota team extended its
exile for the new Carolla.
</P>
<P>
The shorter Carolla has a narrower track and much shorter
overhangs at front and rear than most of its main rivals, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, this car has more potential than our old
car. There is no question about that," said Toyota Team Europe's
president Ove Andersson in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Celicas proved its twice winnings of the manufacturers'
title by success in the 1993 and 1994 world championships.
</P>
<P>
Juha Kankkunen of Finland set a record fourth world
championship for the team in 1993 and Auriol won the 1994
title. By 1995, Toyota had won 39 world championship rallies,
including seven Safaris and three RACs.

<HEADLINE> Future of Bangladesh's Ailing Jute Industry Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The future of Bangladesh's ailing
jute industry, suffering for years from various problems like
production and export losses, likely brightens again due to fresh
international loans and some technical progress.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the World Bank, after deciding to
discontinue its Jute Sector Adjustment Credit early this month, is
now showing renewed interest to help Bangladesh overcome the
problems facing the jute sector.
</P>
<P>
Although the bank is yet to decide its strategic steps in this
regard, it has already sought the advice of the government and the
private jute mills owners on the ways for energizing the ailing
sector, it was learnt.
</P>
<P>
"A new program is expected to be developed for making the
country's jute sector viable. We are having discussions with the
World Bank on this," said an official from the Ministry of Jute.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, The Bangladesh Jute Mills Association (BJMA)
-- the organization of the private sector jute mills owners -- has
suggested the need for devaluation of the Bangladeshi Taka to make
its jute exports competitive with India.
</P>
<P>
The BJMA also requires retrenchment or replacement of redundant
workers and employees for rationalization of the industry's
workforce, which could cost around 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BJMA, in its suggestion, also pointed out that the private
mills might be provided about 30 to 35 million dollars loan to
import power generators as the mills lost a huge production due to
irregular and uncertain supply of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The International Jute Organization (IJO) is very
upbeat about the future of jute following success in transforming
its fiber into a very good quality input for textile industry.
</P>
<P>
"Jute is no longer a low grade fiber as it can be improved and
used for producing good quality fabric," said the IJO executive
director Golam Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said that jute had been facing stiff competition from
the low cost synthetic fibers on the international market and that
research in the area was aimed at reducing the production cost,
from growing to manufacturing levels.
</P>
<P>
Despite a remarkable success in research on diversified use of
jute, there had been lack of initiatives in carrying the outcome
to the field or factory, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the missing link could be solved by taking
initiatives such as preparation of project proposals and a
networking arrangement between all the relevant institutions, he
said, adding that the fund required for the steps might be given
by donor agencies either in grants or credits.

<HEADLINE> India's Bihar Chief Minister Steps Down over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- India's Bihar Chief Minister
Laloo Prasad Yadav resigned today shortly after an arrest warrant
was issued against him for his alleged involvement in a
multi-crore rupee scandal, the Press of Trust of India (PTI)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Yadav met the Bihar Governor to present his resignation and
also urged him to swear in his wife Rabri Devi as the next chief
minister. Devi is expected to be sworn in as new Bihar chief
minister later in the day, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
A special court of the Central Bureau of Investigation issued
an arrest warrant against Yadav, accusing him of taking bribes in
the sensational fodder scandal in which huge sums of public funds
earmarked for purchasing fodder were embezzled in the state
between 1985 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of India immediately stalled the arrest
against him. But Yadav, who had been refusing to quit in defiance
of huge pressures, still decided to resign.
</P>
<P>
Yadav, former president of the Janata Dal, floated the
Rashtriya Janata Dal earlier this month due to power struggles
within the ruling United Front.
</P>
<P>
The move has plunged the United Front into a serious crisis and
the bickerings over whether to allow Yadav's new party to stay in
the front have undermined the unity of the front.
</P>
<P>
When Yadav announced his resignation, leaders of the ruling
United Front were convening a crucial meeting to make a final
decision on the entry of Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal into the
front.

SHANGHAI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Customs on Thursday
named 308 local exporters with clean records who from now on will
enjoy quick clearance in customs.
</P>

smuggling or evaded taxes, in addition to sound business
performance and a good record with regard to tax procedures.
</P>
<P>
To date, Shanghai has a total of 14,159 foreign traders which
exported and imported 52.87 billion yuan-worth goods in 1996.

BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A party was held in Beijing today
in honor of the 13 Chinese middle school students who won a total
of six gold and seven silver medals at the World Olympiad of
Scientific Subjects.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, president of the China Association for Science
and Technology (CAST), which hosted the party, congratulated the
young people who showed their mental prowess in physics, chemistry
and biology.
</P>
<P>
China first participated in the International Olympiads of
mathematics, physics, chemics, information science and biology in
1985, said Zhou, adding that by 1996, some 207 Chinese students
had taken part in the competitions, receiving 120 gold, 55 silver
and 28 bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
"The selection of the participants for the Olympiads was based
on national contests on relevant scientific subjects, which
started in 1978," said Zhou. "Many scientists and academicians
have been involved in the preparatory advising and instruction for
the activities."
</P>
<P>
The contests are aimed at developing the interests of
youngsters in the sciences, pushing forward educational reforms,
and discovering the country's talented youth, he explained.
</P>
<P>
China won four silver medals in the chemistry contest -- a poor
showing in the eyes of the Chinese participants -- due to a failed
experiment. The same thing happened in the physics contest.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that we should put more emphasis on the
training of the students' ability to use their hands in addition
to educating them with theory," said Jin Sizhao, head of the
delegation of chemistry students.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation of biology students scored the highest, though
they spent only two weeks preparing for the contest this time,
much shorter than in the past," said Zhao Jindong, head of the
biology group.
</P>
<P>
China has hosted three International Science Olympiads since
1990, and will hold the 12th International Information Science
Olympiad in the year 2000.

He said that the two countries share a common desire to
safeguard world peace and stability and to promote peace and
development in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Ranks Fifth in World's Top Foreign Exchange Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) has jumped to fifth place from the
seventh place in the ranking of the world's top foreign exchange
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the land fund boosting Hong Kong's total
foreign exchange reserves to more than 82 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release received here today, the figure
was released on Thursday by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA), which has managed the land fund as a separate portfolio
under the direction of the financial secretary since the July 1
handover.
</P>
<P>
Inclusion of the Land Fund has pushed Hong Kong's ranking up to
the fifth from the seventh in the world, surpassing the United
States and Singapore but remaining behind Japan, the Chinese
inland area and Taiwan, and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The official foreign currency reserves of the HKSAR, including
those held in the land fund, exceeded 82 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of June, placing HKSAR at the fifth position in the world
ranking, the HKMA announced.
</P>
<P>
The land fund, now with 170 billion HK dollars (about 21.96
billion U.S. dollars), has become a financial source of the HKSAR
government.
</P>
<P>
As HKMA announced, the total assets of HKSAR's exchange
reserves reached 569 billion HK dollars (about 73.5 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of June, an increase of 6.4 percent from the
end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the results which were achieved amidst
difficult market conditions in the first half of 1997," Joseph
Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, said. "We steered a steady,
defensive course through volatile bond and currency markets."
</P>
<P>
"The investment outlook for 1997 remains difficult. Forecasts
on U.S. interest rates remain mixed and a strong U.S. currency may
also adversely affect the non U.S. dollar assets of the Exchange
Fund," he added.
</P>
<P>
The huge reserves constitute the first line of defense against
attacks on Hong Kong's financial markets, though the land fund
cannot be used to stabilize the financial markets, experts here
believe.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, the HKMA acted swiftly
and decisively in defending the HK dollar. It raised, for example,
the short-term interest rates in the interbank market.
</P>
<P>
The time-tested strategy achieved its objective as the pressure
on the HK dollar eased on Thursday afternoon, with the local
currency even gaining strength marginally against the U.S. dollar,
the paper pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Low Inflation Rate Expected in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Projections call for China to
maintain a low inflation rate throughout the remainder of this
year, with retail and consumer prices remaining at two percent and
four percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ren Caifang, director of State Statistical Bureau (SSB) General
Urban Socioeconomic Survey Department, told reporters attending a
Friday press conference that small price hikes should be
attributed to the government's sustained macroeconomic control
policies and adjustments to the domestic market resulting from
maturation of the price system.
</P>
<P>
Ren said the central government will adhere to a financial
policy calling for "appropriately tight control on currency
issues," and noted that the market environment will continue to
improve in the last half of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Ren, the country's bumper summer grain harvest
will guarantee an abundant nationwide supply of agricultural
products. SSB projections call for the summer grain output to hit
123.95 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices were up 1.8 percent for the first half the year,
with consumer prices rising 4.1 percent on last year's period.
</P>
<P>
Prices fell for grain, vegetables, household electronic
appliances, jewelry. building and decoration materials, machinery
and electric equipment. However, prices for various service grew
by noticeably large increments during the January-June period.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reiterates Opposition to Religion Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today defended his opposition to a religion bill, which he said
restricted non-traditional religions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some provisions of the "bill on the freedom of conscience and
religious associations" infringe on constitutional rights and
freedoms of citizens and run counter to Russia's international
obligations, Yeltsin said in a regular weekly radio address to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
"A democratic state cannot infringe on the interests of
minorities for whatever seemingly noble motives," said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, admitted that "it was difficult" for
him to veto the bill that had been adopted by the legislature and
backed by the Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
Religious adherence is varied in Russia, with many religions
closely connected with many ethnic groups. But the Russian
Orthodox Church is the largest domination.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin vetoed the draft of the controversial bill Tuesday,
saying that it violated religious freedom prescribed in the
constitution by restricting the flow of information, making it
hard for "nontraditional religions" to open representative offices
in Russia and giving special status to the Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill not only had the support of the powerful
Russian Orthodox Church, but also was passed by overwhelming
majorities in both houses of parliament earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign observers feared that the bill would handicap the
activities of the scores of foreign and non-mainstream religions
in Russia, including evangelical Christianity and Roman
Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II sent Yeltsin a letter protesting against the
bill, and the U.S. Senate threatened to cancel an aid of 200
million U.S. dollars for Russia if the bill was signed into law.
</P>
<P>
Patriarch Alexy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church,
however, warned Yeltsin Thursday that Russia faces civil discord
if he fails to abandon his veto on the bill.

continuously under the personal guidance of Deng.

participate in national political life and NPC elections at the
grassroots level.
</P>
<P>

objective appraisal of China's democratic elections at the grassroots
level.
</P>

direct elections in rural areas. Carter added that the US public

the nation's positive progress in related activities.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar today ended
more than half a US cents higher as the market was disappointed
that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) did not take up an
opportunity to ease monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"The market was disappointed, as the cut had been on the cards,
the press had been calling for it and it was widely tipped so the
market was caught unawares," Citibank Australia senior dealer
Geoff Last said.
</P>
<P>
"But the market still believes there is one more rate cut to
come and it could come at any time," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 74.05 US cents from 73.48
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Financial market economists are now looking to August 6, the
day after the RBA's next board meeting, to consider monetary
policy, as the next most likely timing for a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Geoff Last said the local unit could head down again and would
remain under pressure until the rate cut was out of the way.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended at 86.35 from
85.08 against the Japanese yen and was at 1.3643 from 1.3304
against the German mark.

Ms. Yambo (Only one name) was quoted as saying, ''Uganda as our
pilot-case, has a very impressive record in market-growth, which
has risen from a volume of two million unit-cases in consumption
of coca-cola products nine years ago in 1989, to four million in
mid-1990s and six million unit-cases today (1996/97).''
</P>
<P>
Yambo who is based in Nairobi, Kenya said although Uganda's
volume of six million cases annually is small compared to Kenya
and Tanzania's, the rate of growth from 16 percent of
market-share in 1995-96 to 30 percent in 1997 was the fastest.
</P>
<P>
Due to this high response by the Ugandan market, Coca-cola
International and the local Franchise holders-century bottling
company are planning two more bottling lines worth 30 million
U.S. Dollars this year, she added.
</P>
<P>
The plants are to be constructed in Namanve forest reserve,

LAGOS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The police in Lagos, Nigeria's
largest city and commercial center, has got two helicopters to
help them fight against rampant criminals.
</P>
<P>
The official "New Nigerian" newspaper reported today that the
helicopters were offered by the Nigerian Police Force
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this to a group of journalists on Wednesday, Lagos
State Administrator Colonel Mohammed Marwa said the helicopters
are necessary as the criminals are using sophisticated arms.
</P>
<P>
As the police has its own helicopters, he said the state would
drop its earlier plan to ask for helicopters from the air force.
</P>
<P>
Declining economy and serious unemployment has led to a high
rate of armed robbery and other serious crimes in Lagos and all

LAGOS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Charles Taylor, who was on Thursday
announced the winner of the Liberian presidential election, has
promised a strong but humane leadership once he assumes
presidency.

<P>
"Liberia cannot afford a wicked or weak leader," Taylor said

leader.
</P>
<P>
On taking office on August 2, Taylor said, he will set up two
commissions right away, one on human rights and the other on
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He admitted some excesses by the 60,000-strong troops of his
former National Patriotic Front-line of Liberia during the civil
war, but assured that such excesses would not be tolerated now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Sani Abacha, chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) under the supervision
of which the Liberian election has been made possible, has
congratulated Taylor on his victory.
</P>
<P>
In a statement soon after the announcement of the election
results by the Independent Electoral Commission, Abacha said he
hoped that Liberia will emerge from the civil war as a prosperous
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
The statement announced by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi
called on both the winner and the losers of the election to
cooperate for the reconciliation and reconstruction of the
country.
</P>

The ECOWAS chairman directed the west African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) under the command of Major-General Victor Malu to

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Rudolph Schlais, president of GM
China Operations, recently noted the US-based General Motors
Corp. has mapped out a plan for "long-term cooperation with China."
</P>
<P>
Schlais informed Xinhua that GM's strategic goals for China are
to "become the nation's largest foreign auto parts and components
supplier, and one of the top three foreign motor vehicle
manufacturers."
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Opel, GM's European branch, and relevant
Chinese departments are currently engaged in negotiations related
to the establishment of a comprehensive automobile manufacturing
venture in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Schlais, China is an extremely important part of
the global auto market. He added that "Guangzhou's unique location
makes its an ideal candidate to become GM's gateway to the south China
market, as well as markets throughout southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
He said "the outcome of the negotiations will in no way damper
GM's investment enthusiasm," and added that the company also plans
to explore other opportunities for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Schlais, who also serves as a GM vice president, pointed out
that the company has already established 14 joint ventures and two
wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, and has invested well over
two billion US dollars in the country since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Schlais expressed great confidence in the China market. He said
that various cooperative means, such as joint production,
technology transfers and joint management, have either been or
will be worked out between his operations and relevant Chinese
departments and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to Schlais, GM's utmost confidence in China is based
on the country's rapid economic growth and the expertise the Chinese
government has exhibited in controlling the market.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that GM actively supports approval of China's
application for membership in the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Manila Reiterates Commitments to Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
said that it remains firm in ensuring that its commitments under
the Peace Agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
are implemented.
</P>
<P>
The government was reacting to published reports citing the
statement of MNLF spokesman Absalom Cerveza that the government
has yet to deliver its commitments under the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Cerveza allegedly said that part of the agreement is that the
government will waive the prescribed requirements for MNLF
integration to the Philippine National Police.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Aguirre, chairman of the government panel in the
Joint Monitoring Committee on the Implementation of the Peace
Agreement forged between the government and the MNLF last
September, said the integration program is earnestly being pushed
by both parties.
</P>
<P>
The problem initially encountered by MNLF candidates on the
lack of civil service qualifications could not be waived because
these were prescribed by law, Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
This problem, however, is now being addressed by a special
education program for the MNLF to be implemented by the
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, MNLF candidates will undergo six months of
intensive training as government scholars.
</P>
<P>
After going through this program, he said, the MNLF candidates
will be able to get the necessary eligibility for appointment in
the police.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre also noted that President Ramos had ordered all cabinet
members to take measures to further boost the implementation of
development projects in the Special Zone of Peace and Development
in Mindanao.

</P>
<P>
In terms of the Drug and Drug Trafficking Act, carrying drugs
was considered to be dealing, and a maximum penalty of 25 years'
imprisonment could be imposed, she noted.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspector Says Iraq Has Spirit of Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The new chief of the U.N. Special
Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) said here today that Iraq
and the U.N. have had a "new spirit of cooperation" and set
disarmament tasks for next month.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, who has replaced Rolf Ekus as executive
chairman of the UNSCOM as of July 1, made the remarks at a news
conference after several rounds of talks with the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he has seen a "new sense of determination"
and cooperation between Iraq and the UNSCOM to eliminate Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day stay here, Butler held talks with officials
headed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. The U.N. inspector
told local official television that he was pleased with the talks.
</P>
<P>
His predecessor used to lodge complaints of non-cooperation
against Iraq, while Baghdad rejected the charge, described Ekues
as a stooge of the United States and held him responsible for the
maintenance of the international sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N.-imposed sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in August, 1990. The harsh sanctions will not be lifted
before the UNSCOM verifies that the country has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have mapped out new tasks in wiping out the
country's missiles, chemical and biological weapons of mass
destruction in the following month. Butler singled out biological
weapons as a priority among others.
</P>
<P>
He added that these tasks "should produce concrete advances and
results" in the elimination of those categories of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who has pledged a speedy mission to disarm Iraq, said
"I earnestly hope that the work will be done practically,
scientifically and objectively in three or four weeks' time."
</P>
<P>
However, Butler declined to disclose at the press conference if
Iraq has provided UNSCOM with new information on its prohibited
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who arrived here Monday on his first visit to Iraq,
will visit Kuwait today and Bahrain, Saturday before returning to
New York.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senator Opposes Cunanan's Burial in Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Bulacan, a central province in the
Philippines and home town of Andrew Philip Cunanan, may reject the
plan to bury his remains in the province.
</P>
<P>
Cunanan is the principal suspect in the murder of international
fashion designer Gianni Versace.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency today quoted Philippine Senate
President Blas Ople, a native of Cunanan's home province as saying
that his home province "does not deserve to be part of Cunanan's
global notoriety."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the senator noted that "Andrew Cunanan is a product
of American culture and owes nothing to his Bulacan roots. They
should bury him in San Diego where he grew up and where all his
friends are."
</P>
<P>
Cunanan, who appeared to be a high-class gay prostitute
inflicted with AIDS, was believed to be the murderer of Versace on
July 15 and a prime suspect in several other slaying cases.
Cunanan was found dead in a houseboat just four kilometers from
the spot where Versace was gunned down.
U.S. police said Cunanan may have shot himself after eluding
arrest for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that it is the right of Cunanan's family to
determine his burial place, Ople said: "I'm not sure this will be
welcomed in Bulacan which has a strong, peace-loving, law-abiding
and religious tradition."
</P>
<P>
"Andrew Cunanan's burial in Bulacan will draw global attention
to this province on the eve of the glorious centennial of
Philippine independence which was formalized in Bulacan," he said.

BAGHDAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Several unidentified aircraft last
Monday dropped thermal torches on plantations in eastern Iraq,
causing damages, the Iraqi news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, the report said, dropped the combustible torches
at 11 p.m. Monday on wheat and barley fields at the district of
Duela, Diali Province, causing fires that burnt the fields in the
area.
</P>
<P>
No more details were given about the incident.

In several similar cases before, Iraq accused U.S. and British
aircraft of dropping thermal torches in north and south Iraq to
burn wheat and barley plantations. Baghdad has condemned such
actions as aimed at "starving and harming the Iraqi people."

CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
discussed with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad on the stalled

<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on how to break the deadlock

<P>
Egypt has been actively mediating a revival of the negotiations

Calling Mubarak, Asad also congratulated the Egyptian president
on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of July 23 revolution.
</P>

The revolution led by Gamal Nasser, leader of the "Free
Officers," deposed King Farouk and abolished the Monarchy, leading

<HEADLINE> Israel's Jewish Housing Plan in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Jerusalem municipality's
decision to carry out a plan to build Jewish housing in an Arab
neighborhood in East Jerusalem has once again aroused strong
criticism from the Palestinians and Israel's leftist politicians.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Radio today quoted chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat as saying that if the plan was actually
carried out, it would mean the end of the peace process. He urged
the Israeli government to revoke immediately the building license.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, leader of Israel's leftist opposition Meretz
Party, also blasted the housing project in the Ras Amud Arab
neighborhood for being part of the city's inappropriate policy
which began with opening the underground Hasmonean tunnel and
continued with the Har Homa construction.
</P>
<P>
Fearing it could aggravate the tension between Israel and the
Palestinians caused by the construction of Har Homa settlement,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai reportedly expressed anger at the bad timing of
the Ras Amud project. Netanyahu vowed he would fight to cancel
the plan.
</P>
<P>
However, Jerusalem's hardline Mayor Olmert insisted the
municipality could not postpone the project because U.S.
entrepreneur Irving Moskowitz, who owns the land, had obtained all
necessary permits from both the municipality and government to
carry out the project.
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz planned to build about 70 houses for Jews on the 3.5
acres of land, Olmert said. But he explained that the project
might be delayed because of an unresolved dispute over the
stories of the houses to be built.
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz wanted to build five-story houses while the
municipality only agreed to let him build two-story buildings. It
could take years for Moskowitz to obtain permits for the
five-story buildings, Olmert explained.
</P>
<P>
The news about the city's decision to carry out the Ras Amud
construction first surfaced late December last year, sparking
protests from Palestinians and Israeli leftist activists who
held demonstrations to demand an end to what they called
Judaization of Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The opening of Hasmonean tunnel in East Jerusalem last
September triggered a widespread Israeli-Palestinian violent
confrontation which killed over 70 people and wounded nearly
1,000 others, and the Har Homa construction has totally frozen
the peace process since March.

<HEADLINE> 50 Rebels Killed at Sea in North Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Navy destroyed
three Tamil rebel boats and killed about 50 rebels at sea in
Northern Sri Lanka Thursday night, according to a navy spokesman
here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said three large Tamil rebel boats carrying at
least 15 rebels in each were completely destroyed by the navy
gunboats in a confrontation late last night.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when the navy gunboats noticed a flotilla
of rebel boats sailing from Mullaitivu to Wakarai.
</P>
<P>
There were around 12 boats in the flotilla of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). After the destruction of the three
boats, the rest turned around and fled towards Mullaitivu sea.
</P>
<P>
One navy sailor was injured in the incident and a gun attached
to the naval vessel was damaged, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a 14-year guerrilla war
against the Sri Lankan government for a separate Tamil state in
the north and east of the island country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Time Has Come for Thailand to Borrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Thanong
Bidaya confirmed on Thursday that Thailand was considering
borrowing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or Japan to
boost the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
His confirmation ended speculation for weeks that the country
would seek 10-20 billion U.S. dollars in overseas loans to help
the cash-strapped economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not reveal how much his ministry would need to
borrow, adding, "the ministry will not tell the press if we decide
to borrow".
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday Thanong had been adamant that Thailand would not
borrow from overseas, believing that admitting borrowing from
overseas will further damage foreign investor confidence in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Supachai Panitchpakdi, former deputy prime minister and
chairman of the house committee on economics, has urged the
government to seek financial assistance from the IMF to boost
investor's confidence in the economy and stabilize the Baht's
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate
registered on Thursday a record low of 32.63 Baht to the dollar, a
26.52 percent depreciation from the rate of 25.79 Baht on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the most important thing the government should do
now is to borrow from the IMF, adding that the government should
acknowledge the severity of the country's economic problems and
take decisive measures to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
 The former deputy prime minister said that a limited
borrowing would have nothing to do with Thailand's sovereignty,
adding that an appropriate economic structure would enable
Thailand to repay the loan within two years at the latest and
would not tarnish the country's financial position in the eyes of
the world.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to de-politicize economic
policies,
saying that the Baht would only stabilize with the right policies
on exports, inflation and the stability of the financial system.
</P>
<P>
To seek assistance from the IMF, he believed, is the only way
now to restore confidence in Baht. He expected that the IMF would
force Thailand to further cut the 1997-1998 budget, restructure
the entire tax system to fit the changing economic conditions, and
speed up privatization to reduce the government's financial
burden.
</P>
<P>
Supachai advised the government to exploit the international
stage, notably the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), to
forge a wider swap line between the central banks or establish a
fund to help stabilizes currencies in trouble.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger reiterated here today that the Sino-U.S.
relations should be further developed.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger made the remarks at a reception in the

Kissinger said that the exchange of visits of the Chinese and

governments of both countries to take a strategic and decisive
step to develop the relations and establish partnership between
the two countries under the difficult and complicated situation of
that time.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. should look forward and establish a new sort of
cooperation to face the twenty-first century and should not repeat

Jiang Zemin to the United States will provide new opportunities

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Internet Market Sees 60-Percent Annual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The internet market in Lebanon is
expanding at an annual rate of 60 percent, a leading analyst of
the local information highway industry said today.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Soubra, commercial manager of Datanet, a Beirut-based
communication company, said a combination of good marketing,
better infrastructure and the internet's worldwide appeal has
made this industry attractive in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"From the demand we have been feeling in the past six months,
60 percent is the rate of internet growth. If another analyst said
75 percent, he might not be exaggerating," Soubra said.
</P>
<P>
There are 50,000 computer users in Lebanon, and one tenth of
them have subscribed the internet, he said, adding that 55 percent
of the subscribers are businessmen, while the remaining 45 percent
are households and students.
</P>
<P>
Soubra said that although the web allows companies to advertise
their products and offer faster service, most local businessmen
use the internet to communicate.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon has yet to tap the commercial potential of the
internet. Today most Lebanese businessmen are using the internet
to send and receive electronic mail, files, programs and
images," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the state of the local telephone network is
a big factor in securing customers' satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
"Although the modem might read 28.8 kilobytes per second
(kbps), there are bottle necks in the telephone network that make
data transfer unacceptably slow. This may make a subscriber
unsatisfied and prompt him to cancel the subscription," he said.
</P>
<P>
Richard Doyle, director of marketing at Cable and Wireless,
the state-run telecommunication company, said a new telephone
system will take in more internet bugs.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the old copper wires are in a very bad condition which
means if you put your modem on them you will get distortions,
noise, and the modem will operate very slowly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The new network still has copper wires, but the combination of
new modems plus the new fiber optic equipment we are putting in,
will result in much better quality and much higher speeds," Doyle
added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has set up two fiber optic cables, respectively
linking Beirut with Cyprus and the Egyptian resort of
Alexandria.

The profit increase was attributed to improved management which

In addition, Shougang introduced a series of technical

<HEADLINE> Frontlines North of Kabul Calm as Rival Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Frontlines north of the Afghan
capital Kabul were relatively calm today, but the atmosphere in
the capital was tense as rival forces prepare for new showdown.
</P>
<P>
No fighting was going on north of Kabul in the morning, a day
after forces opposing Islamic Taliban militia reportedly made
another major territorial gains near the capital, said Afghan
sources in Peshawar, a major city in northwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, anti-Taliban forces loyal to former military chief
Ahmad Masood have reportedly advanced within around 20 kilometers
of Kabul, less than a week after Masood's men recaptured the
strategic Bagram airbase, about 50 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan sources said the exact frontline positions of
Taliban and its rival forces remained unclear as conflicting
reports kept pouring in the city bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
But atmosphere in the capital was tense as Taliban, who had
rushed in reinforcements, stepped up search of all passing
vehicles after reports that anti-Taliban fighters have infiltrated
various parts of the capital. Some foreign aid workers are
preparing to leave the city due to uncertain security condition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, a salvo of six rockets, apparently by
anti-Taliban forces, struck close to the perimeter of Kabul
airport about five kilometers away from the city center.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the beleaguered capital city was within the
striking range of Masood's men who were armed with rockets of the
shooting range of around 20 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources in Peshawar said Thursday evening that the
Islamic militia were capable of not only defending Kabul but also
pushing back the opposition forces to the old frontlines.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China To Increase Economic Cooperation With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong to China
is providing opportunities for economic and trade co-operation
between Hong Kong and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Already, a large triangular economic zone formed by Hong Kong,
Macao, and Guangdong province is taking shape, and Guangxi, which
is next-door to Guangdong, will become an important part of it.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's capital, Nanning, has had close economic and trade
relations with Hong Kong since the 1980s, and, by the end of last
year, had 436 Hongkong-funded companies, accounting for two-thirds
of the foreign companies doing business in Nanning.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi now has economic and trade ties with more than 110
countries and regions. Its trade with Hong Kong, its largest
trading partner, accounts for more than half of its foreign trade
volume, according to Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Regional
Communist Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said he believes that bilateral economic co-operation will
increase because the two regions have similarities in dialects,
customs, and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
In order to create more favorable conditions for economic
co-operation, Guangxi is planning to improve its infrastructure,
adjust its export structure, and encourage more enterprises to get
listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Leader Escapes Opposition Captivity: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia is now free after being reportedly held by
the opposition forces for more than three month, reports monitored
here today said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ghaus, Taliban's foreign minister, "was safely taken
from Balkh to Kunduz," which are both northern Afghan provinces,
the reports quoted the Taliban-run Radio Shariat as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the broadcast stopped short of explaining when and how
Ghaus was "safely taken" on the more-than-170-kilometer journey
from opposition-held Balkh province across the frontlines to
neighboring Taliban-controlled Kunduz.
</P>
<P>
The story contradicted earlier reports that the Taliban foreign
minister was arrested by the opposition troops amid fighting
between the Taliban militia and anti-Taliban forces in northern
Mazar-e-Sharif in May.
</P>
<P>
Ghaus had flown to Mazar-e-Sharif for talks late May after the
Taliban entered the northern city following an understanding with
Uzbek general Abdul Malik, who had rebelled against his boss
general Rashid Dostum on May 19.
</P>
<P>
However, four days later Malik switched sides and drove Taliban
out of Mazar-e-Sharif inflicting heavy losses on the Islamic
militia, leaving an estimated 2,000 Taliban fighters including
some senior officials reportedly arrested.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Two illegal Mozambican
immigrants were eaten by lions in South Africa's Kruger National
Park on Tuesday night, The Citizen daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police said all that was left of an unidentified man and woman
was a small bone which was found at Pafuri camp, in the northern
part of the park in the country's northeast, on Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Inspector Samson Shabalala said the two were part of a group
of four illegal immigrants attempting to cross into South Africa.
Only one of them was able to escape by climbing a tree.
</P>
<P>
The man described how he had heard the lions devour his
companions but could not say how many lions were involved.
</P>
<P>
All that was left to identify the two people was the woman's
blouse and skirt, and a man's T-shirt, trousers and shoes.
</P>
<P>
Hyenas had eaten what was left by the lions, Shabalala said.
</P>
<P>
More than three million illegal immigrants from neighboring
countries are staying in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Conflict Escalates as Peace Efforts Stepped Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The war-torn Afghanistan has
witnessed a sudden upsurge in fighting over the past few days
while the world community geared up their efforts in brokering an
immediate ceasefire among the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Forces opposed to the Islamic Taliban militia, who have
surrounded Kabul since last weekend, were now only about 20 km
north of the beleaguered Afghan capital, Afghan sources said
Thursday in Peshawar, a major city in northwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The forces led by former military chief Ahmad Masood have
advanced earlier in the day to the Mibachakot area, around 20 km
away from Kabul, meaning that the city was within the striking
range of Masood's men, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
If the report is true, it would be the second major territorial
gains for Masood in a week after his men recaptured the strategic
Bagram airbase, about 50 km north of Kabul on July 20.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban, who seized Kabul on September 27 last
year, have so far made no formal confirmation or denial about the
reports.
</P>
<P>
A raid by an anti-Taliban jet-fighter, which is believed to
belong to Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik, another strongman in the
anti-Taliban ranks, Thursday afternoon also reminded people in
Kabul that their city was becoming a battleground once again.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the jet flew low over the city and dropped a bomb
close to the presidential palace in the downtown area, killing at
least 4 people and injuring many more.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kabul was tense as Taliban rushed in
reinforcements and stepped up search of all passing vehicles on
major road intersections to prevent infiltration by the rival
forces. And as fighting continued to rage north of Kabul, about 45
foreign aid workers are preparing to leave.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge of the fighting coincided with the intensified
peace efforts made by the United Nations and Pakistan in a
desperate bid to bring the warring Afghan factions back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, held a
two-hour meeting with the leadership of Taliban Thursday in
Kandahar, the militia's southern stronghold, on the prospects of a
ceasefire between Taliban and their rivals.
</P>
<P>
Holl would then visit Mazar-e-Sharif, de facto headquarters of
the anti-Taliban alliance, to brief leaders of the alliance on the
outcome of his talks with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance is demanding the demilitarization of
Kabul before agreeing to a ceasefire while the Taliban, who
control two thirds of Afghan territory, called for the
unconditional release of all their prisoners held in the north as
a confidence-building measure for talks.
</P>
<P>
The UN envoy's visit to Kandahar took place three days after
Iftikhar Murshed, a Pakistani senior diplomat, toured the city.
Murshed was continuing his shuttle diplomacy in Afghanistan,
trying to persuade the protagonists to bury the hatchet.
</P>
<P>
Some progress has been made and the proposal for forming a
joint political commission to discuss future Afghan government "is
emerging as a distinct possibility", said a spokesman from the
Pakistani Foreign Office, referring to Murshed's shuttle
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting will have no impact on our determination to
continue with the shuttle mission," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A serious humanitarian crisis is emerging in Afghanistan as the
recent heavy fighting has brought the number of displaced people
entering Kabul since the beginning of this year to 200,000,
according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand more are believed to be scattered across the
northern part of the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here are of the view that the escalating war is most
regrettable at a time when the search for peace through
negotiations is being stepped up by the UN and other concerned
countries.
</P>
<P>
It simply complicates the already difficult search for peace in
the war-ravaged Afghanistan, they said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 44 policemen have
been killed in more than 320 attacks on law enforcers in Gauteng
Province since the beginning of the year, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Azwinndini Nengovhela was quoted as saying
that the police had recorded 38 murders of policemen in the first
six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the official figure of 38 murders did not include the
three policemen murdered in Soweto this week, it still
represented a more than 100 percent increase from the 17
policemen reported killed during the first three months of the
year, said Nengovhela.
</P>
<P>
However, Nengovhela could not say how many of the police
officers killed this year had been on duty. 72 policemen were
killed while on duty throughout South Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
He said 228 of the 320 attacks on police in Gauteng were
against members who were on duty, while 87 were on off-duty
officers. A total of 121 police officers were also injured in
these attacks by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
He added that 186 suspects had been arrested in connection
with the attacks and killings.

<P>
Edward Musiga, resident district commissioner in Bundibugyo

harassment from rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces who

<P>
TIANJIN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- More laid-off workers in north
China's Tianjin will start their new careers in foreign-funded
companies and private businesses, which have grown into prime
spots for absorbing surplus laborers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 450,000 local unemployed workers had found
jobs in privately-owned enterprises. Of the number, 265,000 were
re-employed by overseas-funded companies, and 185,000 are working
for private businesses.
</P>
<P>
The city reported that it had 787 overseas-funded enterprises
as of April 10, including 190 trans-national groups which are
among the world's top 500, such as Mobil, Motorola, Honda, Samsung
and Siemens. Their demand for large staffs of skilled workers have
created more opportunities for the jobless.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Motorola recruited the first group of 90
female laid-off workers, who are now on the job on pager
production lines.
</P>
<P>
"They value the new start they have been given in life. They
also have strong sense of responsibility," said a delegate of the
company, adding since the company has received more orders and
another 100 laid-off workers have been given jobs.
</P>
<P>
The city government also mapped out a number of preferential
policies for those private companies, in which laid-off workers
get first choice of job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The number of privately-run enterprises in the city has reached
16,000.

<HEADLINE> Control on Bus Fares to Be Lifted in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The government will no
longer control fares for commuter and upcountry buses but it will
retain power to intervene when necessary to regulate competition,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Communication and Transport, William Kusila, told
the National Assembly in Dodoma, central Tanzania on Thursday
that the bus fares hitherto fixed by the Tanzania Licensing
Authority (TLA) would now be determined by market forces.
</P>
<P>
Tabling his ministry's estimates for 1997/98 at the house,
Kusila said TLA would continue supervising timetables for
upcountry buses to guard against accidents and ensure passenger
comfort.
</P>
<P>
The minister said all companies under the National Transport
Corporation (NTC) would be divested and a new authority formed to
replace the holding company in controlling inland transport.
</P>
<P>
The NTC companies include Tanzania Coastal Shipping Lines
(TACOSHILI), Regional Transport Companies (RETCOs) and Usafiri
Dar es Salaam (UDA).
</P>

GUANGZHOU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in south China's
Guangdong Province have formed over 3,200 technical associations
to improve market competition by themselves.
</P>
<P>
The self-help co-operatives, which were mainly started by large
privately-run businesses and families, are in touch with 110,000
households, with the goal of helping farmers adapt to the market
economy.

Liusha Township in Xuwen County set up a technical society to
provide techniques and information and short training classes for
pearl producers, to turn the township into the largest pearl
producer in China. It produces 320 ha of pearl, and produces more
than 2,800 yuan in pearl annual output value per capita, which
accounts for 80 percent of the growers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the associations offer technical advice, co-operative
opportunities, and production, processing, and sales services.

<HEADLINE> Indian New President Calles For Fight Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Kocheri Raman Narayanan, who was
sworn in as Indian president today, said that there was need for
people to sink their political differences to abolish poverty,
ignorance and disease in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his swearing-in ceremony here today, the new
president said that excessive obsession with the pursuit of pure
politics has often overshadowed the social, economic and
developmental needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
"We have, therefore, the obligation to direct all our efforts
to the task of abolishing poverty, ignorance and disease from
among our people," Narayanan said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the growing corruption and violence in
almost every walk of life, the new president went on to say that
"there are signs of the weakening of the moral and spiritual fiber
in our public life with evils of communalism, casteism, violence
and corruption bedeviling our society."
</P>
<P>
In such a situation, the elders and the leaders in society have
the responsibility of setting examples for the youth as they form
nearly 60 percent of the nation's population, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is necessary lest the youth become cynical about their own
lives and callous about the future of the nation, the president
added.
Narayanan, 76, was elected president in a poll held on July 14,
defeating former Indian Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan by
an impressive margin.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan had been a pen-pusher, teacher, journalist, diplomat,
minister of the Indian government and vice president of India.

ZHENGZHOU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan province
had a record 7.3 billion kg of dry wheat this summer, 22 percent
more than last year.
</P>
<P>
The province used 23 million mu (1.53 million ha) of

The provincial government is paying a great deal of attention
to agriculture production, and high-yield wheat varieties have
brought a steady improvement to wheat production.

Officials have taken an active role in getting local farmers to
get more technological training, something that has helped more
than five million rural people acquire greater skills.
</P>
<P>
Henan now has 200,000 mu (13,333 ha) of high-yield

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ Leaders Restrained Over Australian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand leaders have kept
restrained over the Australian allegation that NZ has not spent
enough on defense.
</P>
<P>
The criticism came from the leaked Australian government papers
for the South Pacific Forum economic ministers meeting held
recently in Carins, Australia, which said New Zealand's defense
spending is "inadequate" and criticized NZ Treasurer Winston
Peters as being a soft touch on the Australia's push to increase
the defense spending.
</P>
<P>
Peters was portrayed as a "loose cannon" and an "opportunist"
by Australian government officials in another secret report.
</P>
<P>
Despite the two offenses, both Prime Minister Jim Bolger and
Peters will travel to Melbourne at the weekend as planned to enjoy
a rugby match between the NZ All Blacks team and the Australian
Wallabies team.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to take the opportunity to talk with
Australian leaders on the latest blunders.
</P>
<P>
Most of the New Zealand officials have been so far in a
restrained mood. Peters, who was singled out for criticism,
described the events as being created by "mindless" officials in a
"dingo-istic" way.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he did not blame the Australian people or the
Australian government for the actions of "some bureaucrats with no
obvious job description to fulfill."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bolger refused to disclose the line he would
take when he meets with his Australian counterpart tomorrow
evening. But he has downplayed the issue in parliament, saying
Canberra had put more importance on the defense spending than on
the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We would expect nothing less from a close friend and ally," he
stated.
</P>
<P>
Calling for calm, Defense Minister Paul East said it is "time
for us to pause and try and reduce the temperature here."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, speaking from Indonesia, said
his Australian counterpart Alexander Downer has showed "some
contrition" for the blunders after the publication of the
documents.
</P>
<P>
Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare is the only NZ cabinet member
who has expressed anger at Australia's lack of public contrition
for the disparagement in the leaked official papers. He insisted
on an apology from the Australian side.
</P>
<P>
It is an open issue that Australia wants New Zealand to boost
its defense spending, which has declined by 20 percent since the
National Party came to power in 1990. But New Zealand intends to
put the money in other areas like health, education and social
welfare as agreed by the
National Party and the NZ First party when they formed the
coalition
last December.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here in February, John Howard also raised the
defense issue. It is known that Canberra hopes Wellington to buy
more
ANZAC frigates now being built in Australia. But NZ responded that
it
will not make a final decision on more purchase until October this
year.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gun Deaths Down, Traffic Deaths Up in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- People in the United States
were less likely to be killed with guns but more likely to die in
car crashes, a government report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More children and young adults die from injuries than from
disease, with most deaths being caused by motor vehicle accidents,
said the National Center for Health Statistics in its report for
1995.
</P>
<P>
The annual report also contains information on health in the
country:
</P>
<P>
-- Life expectancy at birth edged up to 75.8 years from 75.7.
</P>
<P>
-- People with HIV spent less time in the hospital as new drugs
improved their health.
</P>
<P>
-- One fourth of American adults smoke cigarettes, with college
graduates significantly less likely to smoke than others.
</P>
<P>
-- 17 percent of Americans under age 65 had no health
insurance, including 32 percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
After a steady increase, firearm deaths peaked in 1993 at 15.6
deaths per 100,000 people, a 22 percent increase over 1985, says
the report.
</P>
<P>
But the figure dropped in 1994 and again in 1995 as the number
of homicides dropped dramatically. Suicides and unintentional gun
deaths fell slightly, too.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, traffic deaths increased after a steady decline. In
1992, 15.4 of every 100,000 Americans died in car accidents, down
from 18.4 in 1985. But that number grew in the following three
years.

<HEADLINE> Spying Scandal Makes Romanian Intelligence Chief Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu today accepted the resignation of Ioan Talpes,
director of the External Information Service, following a spying
scandal related to a Swiss diplomat.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Swiss diplomat was arrested by the Swiss authorities
on charges of selling confidential political and economic
information to Romania, Romanian Media previously reported.
</P>
<P>
"The case has the danger to damage Romanian-Swiss
relationship," Talpes said in his resignation letter tendered to
the president. The foreign intelligence chief said he has to be
responsible for it and therefore requested resignation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a statement released by the Press Office of
the Presidency said today that Talpes would not admit that Romania
has conducted any spying activities against Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The statement, however, said that a Swiss diplomat had made
contact with the External Information Service for years. "The
diplomat has provided nonconfidential materials, but they have
nothing to do with the interests or security of Switzerland."
</P>
<P>
Romania has seven intelligence bureaus, and the largest two are
Romania Information Service and External Information Service,
responsible for collecting domestic and foreign information
respectively. Both agencies are under the direct leadership of the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament to Debate Curbs on President Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament will
reconvene at the end of next month to debate constitutional
amendments that would strip the president of many of the powers
accorded him under the one-year-old Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments would virtually eliminate the
presidential veto and strip the president of his power to fire the
prime minister without legislative backing, the press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The amendments would also make parliament the final arbiter
of the constitutionality of legislation.
</P>
<P>
President Leonid Kuchma, who has been increasingly at odds with
parliament over economic reforms, reacted by accusing
Parliamentary Speaker Alexander Moroz and his allies of planning a
constitutional coup.
</P>
<P>
"I want to warn Alexander Moroz personally, and the deputies
who want to play with the Constitution, that they should not do
it," the president was quoted by the Interfax news agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The 30 constitutional amendments to be debated by lawmakers,
which were drafted by the parliament's Legislative Institute,
would allow the 450-seat parliament to override a presidential
veto with two successive simple majority votes instead of the
current two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma would also lose outright the power to veto budget bills
and future amendments to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In addition, parliament wants to take away the Constitutional
Court's power to interpret legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The first year under the new Constitution has revealed many
irregularities which need to be corrected," Moroz said. "What
needs to be regulated in particular is relations between the
president and the parliament."
</P>
<P>
In June 1996, parliament passed the country's first post-Soviet
Constitution, five years after its independence from the Soviet
Union. The Constitution gives the president broad powers.
</P>
<P>
But it is unlikely the proposed amendments will become law
since Kuchma may veto the changes and for the time being,
parliament still needs a two-thirds majority to override his
veto.

<HEADLINE> Farmer-Salespeople Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
farmer-salespeople from north China's Shanxi Province are
travelling the country selling farm products.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers suffered heavy losses due to farm product
stockpiles when, in the late 1980s, Shanxi's agriculture expanded
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Farmer-salespeople began to emerge first in areas which serve
as bases for vegetables, fruit, livestock and crop planting,
serving as intermediaries between farmers and markets. They now
sell more than two billion kg of vegetables and fruit to other
parts of China annually.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Gui, a farmer-salesman from Yuci City, the major producer
of vegetables in the province, has contacts with more than 200
sales centers in 18 provinces and cities. He sold more than 10
million kg of vegetables last year.
</P>
<P>
The city's 2,000-plus vegetable salespeople like Zheng sell 150
million kg of vegetables annually, accounting for 80 percent of
the area's total output.
</P>
<P>
Good marketing records have encouraged vegetable growers to
build a 4,000-ha vegetable production base, the largest of its
kind in north China, and some 300 ha of greenhouses, with a total
annual output worth 250 million yuan, accounting for more than 40
percent of the city's agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Yue Jusen of Liulin County became wealthy by selling
jujubes. Later, he financed a jujube cultivation society and
invited experts to act as advisors. The society now has been
expanded to 15 villages, covering 400 jujube growers and
salespeople, and bringing more business to local farmers.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Help Albania Rebuild Army, Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Senate today approved a
bill to allow the country to help Albania rebuild its military and
police forces after the multi-national peacekeeping force leaves
the troubled Balkan country in early August.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which must be approved by the Chamber of Deputies,
allows Italy to help Albania rebuild order after the 7,000-strong
Italian-led multi-national force completes its withdrawal by
August 12.
</P>
<P>
But no troops will be involved after the withdrawal of the
multi-national force, which went to Albania in April to guard aid
delivery after armed unrest erupted in March following the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes which left thousands penniless.
</P>
<P>
Rexhep Mejdani was sworn in today as Albania's new president
after his Socialist Party won a landslide victory over former
president Sali Berisha's Democratic Party in parliamentary
elections held June 29 and July 6. Berisha, widely blamed for the
collapse of the investment schemes, resigned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Albanians today also enjoyed their first night without
curfew in five months after parliament lifted the nationwide
state of emergency and curfew imposed on March 2.

<HEADLINE> Health Reform Benefits Local People in Northwest China Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- People in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region now have access to better medical
treatment and health care, thanks to a far-reaching reform carried
out in the field in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The changes have focused on the establishment of a disease
prevention and health care network, improvement of health
facilities in rural areas, and development of traditional Chinese
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Indications that the health care network in Ningxia has
improved are that there are more than 1,000 medical treatment and
health care institutions; the number of hospital beds and that of
health care personnel for every 1,000 residents are higher than
the national average; the planned vaccination rate for rural
children has reached 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the early 1950s, soon after the founding of the
People's Republic of China, the mortality rate of newborn babies
has been reduced from 200 to 41 per thousand, that of pregnant
women and women in labor down from 15 to 1 per thousand, and life
expectancy up from 35 to 69.
</P>
<P>
To prevent endemic diseases, the region has completed a project
to let all the residents have access to iodized salt one year
ahead of schedule, and improve the quality of drinking water for
74.44 percent of its rural population.
</P>
<P>
From 1996-2000, the region aims to further upgrade the health
care service in rural areas by promoting a cooperative medicare
system, and establish a medical insurance system for urban
workers.

<HEADLINE> China-U.S."Ping Pong Diplomacy" Commemorated at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations and the United Nations Table Tennis Club
today jointly hosted a reception with the Chinese Mission to the
United Nations to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of
"Ping-Pong Diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
The "Ping-Pong Diplomacy" is a historical move taken
twenty-five years ago to resume contacts and exchanges between the
United States and China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception, Chinese permanent representative to
the U.N. Qin Huasun said: In April 1971, China decided to invite
the U.S. Ping-Pong team to visit China. What seems an extremely
ordinary decision today required great courage and wisdom under
the international situation then. It required the same courage and
wisdom on the part of the United Nations to accept the invitation."
</P>
<P>
"The visit to China by the U.S. Ping-Pong team and then the
return visit by the Chinese Ping-Pong team next year broke the ice
of several-decade estrangement between the Chinese and American
people and promoted the development of Sino-U.S.relations," Qin
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past twenty-five years, Sino-U.S. relations have been
on the whole move forward amidst setbacks. Recently, in
particular, there has been considerable improvement. The two sides
are making preparations for the exchange of state visit between
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton. The relations between
the two countries are faced with opportunities for further
development," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"Today while we commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of
Ping-Pong Diplomacy, it is all the more necessary to cherish and
protect this hard-won friendship and to have more people of
insight to work together to enhance understanding between the two
peoples and promote the establishment of 21st-century-oriented
long-term stable and healthy relations between the two countries,"
the ambassador added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved a second stand-by loan of 140 million
U.S. dollars to Bulgaria, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The loan was made in accordance with an agreement on stand-by
credits the IMF and Bulgaria signed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the IMF would extend a total of 680
million dollars in loans to Bulgaria, with the first loan of 130
million dollars made available in April.
</P>
<P>
The granting of the loan showed that the country had fulfilled
its commitment to international institutions to speed up its
reforms and had met the requirements of the IMF, Bulgaria's
financial analysts said.
</P>
<P>
It was a positive comment on the government's work, they added.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, a member of the London Club - the Nuclear Supplies
Group, would pay back the club a debt of 160 million dollars this
month, and the loan would greatly alleviate the government's
financial burden.

ZHENGZHOU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-Kowloon Railway is
expected to be a great help to the drive to help backward areas
alongside the tracks that are rich in natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Henan province is in the vanguard in looking for ways to better

within close reach of the railway.
</P>
<P>
The railway is a north-south arterial line that is close to 27
percent of the province. More than half of that area is
under-developed, partly because of the lack of transportation in
the past.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial mineral department, there are 171
proven mineral-bearing areas in the province that have metals,
precious metals, and energy sources, with an abundance of iron,
gold, silver, copper, and pearlite.
</P>

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's earliest chemical
products were developed more than 2,500 years ago, a joint
research team studying ancient ruins in Hengshui City, north
China's Hebei Province, has concluded.
</P>
<P>
Modern-day Chinese history books claim the origin of China's
chemistry started some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The ancient ruins were discovered about six meters underground
in 1989. Several dozen pottery vats were at the site, which many
experts first believed was a winery.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists sent samples of some of the fossilized materials
from the containers to two chemical research institutes.
</P>
<P>
The results all indicated that the main element of the fossils
is sodium carbon-atesoda. Ancient people used salt to decoct
nitric alkali.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists believed that the pottery vats date back some
2,250 to 2,500 years.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Simple Way to Rid Chemical Pollutants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand and Australian
scientists have developed a simple and relatively cheap process to
destroy deadly man-made chemicals in soil, local newspaper The New
Zealand Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The process, developed by the Australian defense engineering
and technology company ADI Ltd. and New Zealand's crown research
institute ESR Ltd., could mean a more cost-effective clear-up of
organochlorines created by timber treatment chemicals and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The one-step simple, yet chemically complex process involves
loading contaminated soil into a kiln, applying indirect heat and
some additives, including lime, and heating the mix.
</P>
<P>
What comes out is water, carbon and inorganic chloride as well
as soil which can be reused, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Persistent organochlorines, including polychlorinated biphenyls
or PCBs once used in electrical transformers, may be the most long
lasting, hazardous and difficult-to-dispose-of substances produced
by mankind.
</P>
<P>
They have the potential to cause cancer in humans and
accumulate in the environment and the food chain.

<HEADLINE> Fostering Nurtures Handicapped Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, July 25 (Xinhua)-- The former saintly serenity of
welfare organizations in metropolitan Shanghai has been
interrupted by ringing phones and bustling activity.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Charity Fund and local social welfare authorities
recently initiated a program encouraging local residents to
provide foster homes for orphans, with hundreds of warm-hearted
people having already expressed their support.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to ensure that orphans receive long denied
parental love and family warmth which are extremely important to
the healthy growth of children," said Zhou Zhuqing, director of
the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute.
</P>
<P>
Zhou described the program as part of the organization's
efforts to "explore new wholesome ways to enlist society's help in
raising orphans."
</P>
<P>
The charity fund has recommended the adoption of some 20
orphans, most of whom are handicapped children between the ages of
three and nine.
</P>
<P>
"Properly caring for a disabled child requires both time and
energy. Nonetheless, the tasks will be free of regret since the
mere sight of a happy child brings both joy and solace," said Fang
Jie. Fang and his wife, who learned of the program from an article
in Xinmin Evening News, arrived at the fund's headquarters early
the next morning to apply for adoption rights.
</P>
<P>
Most applicants echo the aforementioned couple's belief that
supporting the program is an exhibition of love, sympathy and
understanding -- hallmarks of a truly civilized society.
</P>
<P>
"Adopting a child will enable me to fulfill my lifelong wish of
helping to create a more caring society." said Gu Shiyin, a doctor
with two children.
</P>
<P>
While a loving heart is a primary condition for candidacy,
aplicants must also meet a number of other stringent requirements
to gain adoption rights. For example, foster parents must be
healthy, have a steady family income and adequate living space,
and the capacity to provide a child with proper education.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Report Outlines Beijing's Future Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of researchers under the
direct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the municipal government
recently finished a projection report on the Chinese capital's
development in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Regarded as the guideline for Beijing's cross-century economic
development, the report was described by experts as fully
reflecting the principles set down by the central leadership for
Beijing's development.
</P>
<P>
The report explicitly answers some strategic questions on
Beijing's development, including its status, functions, direction
of economic development, developmental background, goals and
principles of development, and the sectors to be given priority.
</P>
<P>
In order to turn Beijing into a modernized international
mega-city, the report says, adequate attention should be paid to
enhancing its economic strength.
</P>
<P>
The report describes the goal for Beijing's overall development
in the next 15 years as follows: the completion of the transition
from the traditional planned economy to a socialist market
economy; the intensification of the means of economic growth; the
establishment of a relatively complete economic set-up; and the
further enhancement of Beijing's status as the nation's political
and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
The report says that in the future development of the
municipality priority will be given to such sectors as high-tech,
and service industries, the upgrading of pillar industries,
construction and suburban agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of
the Communist Party of China, wrote a preface for the report,
saying that the next 15 years will be the most important period
ever for Beijing's economic development.

<P>
Beijing's comprehensive economic strength is expected to catch
up with those of the capitals of the medium-developed countries in
the next 15 years, according to a official report.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that the highest average annual gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rate for Beijing will be 10.6
percent during the 1996-2000 period and nine percent during the
2001--2010 period.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's GDP will reach 540 billion yuan (some 67 billion US
dollars) in the year 2010, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the report, Beijing's service sector during
the next 15 years will develop faster than the agricultural and
manufacturing sectors, with an expected annual growth rate of 11.4
percent during the 1996-2000 period and 9.4 percent during the
2000-2010 period.
</P>
<P>
The role played by science and technology will be further
enhanced during the coming 15 years, the report says, adding that
50 percent of the economic growth will come from scientific and
technological improvement by the year 2000, and the figure will
reach 60 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 the per capita GDP in Beijing will reach
19,800 yuan (about 2,300 US dollars), the report says, and by the
year 2010 the figure will reach 43,600 yuan (about 5,400 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report expects a 50 percent increase in average annual
income for both urban and rural residents in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The housing area per capita in the city's built-up area is
expected to reach 15 sq m.
</P>

<P>
The report says that over the next 15 years high-tech and
service sectors should be given top priority in the city's
development plans.
</P>
<P>
It says that Beijing has enough advantages to develop its
high-tech sector, which will bring great hope for the capital's
social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the fields to be highlighted include
the information industry, bio-engineering, new medicines,
optical-control machine tools and new materials.
</P>
<P>
The report says that a number of high-tech areas have been set
up in the city, including the Beijing Pilot High-Tech Industrial
Zone, Shangdi Information Industrial Base, Beida (Beijing
University) Bio-Science City, Qinghua (Qinghua University)
High-Tech Park and Zhongguancun High-Tech Zone.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, by the year 2010 the proportion of the
service industry to the city's GDP will exceed 60 percent, and
such fields as tourism, finance, insurance, transport,
telecommunications, international trade and consultancy services
will play leading roles in the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Beijing's economic development should
closely match its status as the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the report sets out seven principles for
Beijing's future economic development, as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Enhancing the comprehensive economic strength;
</P>
<P>
-- Optimizing the industrial structure to give more preference
to the development of the service industry;
</P>
<P>
-- Readjusting the distribution of industries to relocate
factories from the central areas to the suburbs;
</P>
<P>
-- Enhancing the development of technology-intensive industries.
</P>
<P>
-- Opening further to the outside and encouraging more
competition in markets;
</P>
<P>
-- Saving resources and energy, especially land and water; and
</P>
<P>
-- Controlling pollution and improving the environment.

<HEADLINE> IAAF to Elaborate Bans on Drug Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- World athletics chiefs are to set
the penalties on drug cheats next week when most court judges are
willingly to throw the present regulations out of the court.
</P>
<P>
With more athletes denouncing tough doping bans through
lawyers, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) will
determine on July 30-31 whether to halve its four-year ban for
serious offences at a two-day congress prior to the World
Championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The four-year ban was introduced in 1991 after the biggest
scandal unveiled when Ben Johnson tested positive for steroids at
the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the tough penalty has been in danger in recent years as
more and more athletes take their lawsuits to the civil courts.
</P>
<P>
German sprinter Katrin Krabbe suited the athletics authorities
in a much-publicised doping case, forcing the national body to
withdraw the four-year suspensions.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the IAAF is plunged into a dilemma as athletes who
cheated with drugs, are being treated differently depending on
their nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Although the proposal to return to two-year bans has the
backing of both the European governing body and the IAAF's ruling
council, the congress may still reject the changes and stick to
its tough policy, as it did two years ago at its last session.
</P>
<P>
But IAAF is nowsdays more likely to soften its stance under
prolonged legal battles and discrimination charges from parties
concerned.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will resume peace talks
on July 30 in the southern city of Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting negotiations next week," local newspaper
Philippine Daily Inquirer today quoted Executive Secretary Ruben
Torres as saying.
</P>
<P>
Torres said the date was agreed upon by the government and MILF
panels led respectively by ex-ambassador Fortunato Abat and
Ghazali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the two peace panels had yet to draw the agenda for the
resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to resume negotiations, stalled by bloody clashes
in two provinces in Mindanao in southern Philippines, followed a
complete pullout of military forces from Camp Rajamuda, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expected resumption of talks also followed last week's
signing of an agreement between the government and MILF panels for
a general cessation of hostilities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire went into effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos earlier expressed the hope that, with the
ceasefire agreement signed, a comprehensive peace agreement with
the MILF would not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
With the peace agreement forged between the government and the
Moro National Liberation Front last year, the 12,000-member MILF
remains as the only rebel movement in Mindanao.

<P>
TIRANA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Rexhep Mejdani, a 53-year-old
physicist and Socialist Party general secretary, was sworn in
today as Albanian's new president.
</P>
<P>
As sole candidate for the presidency, Mejdani was elected by
110 votes to three with two abstentions and seven invalid
ballots. The Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha,
which holds 27 of the 155 Parliament seats, boycotted the vote.
</P>
<P>
Berisha resigned hours before the new parliament opened on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance address, Mejdani said he would withdraw from
the Socialist Party and work toward reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"I call on all Albanians to help me realize my mission on the
difficult road of normalizing the life of the country and its
institutions," Mejdani said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Albanians to unite to combat corruption and
organized crime and restore order in the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani was elected general secretary of the Socialist Party in
September 1996 and became a parliamentary deputy in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his election as president, Mejdani met Socialist
Party Chairman Fatos Nano and asked him to form a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The previous government led by Berisha's party resigned in
March following weeks of unrest and an interim cross-party
government took over until elections were held on June 29.
</P>
<P>
Albanians today also enjoyed their first night without
curfew in five months after parliament lifted the nationwide
state of emergency and curfew.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency and curfew were imposed on March 2 after
armed unrest broke out in response to the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes in which thousands of families lost their live
savings.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Supply More Natural Gas to Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's largest natural gas
suppliers Gazprom today agreed to supply an extra 5 billion cubic
meters of natural gas to Ukraine every year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
and Gazprom President Rem Viakhyrev at a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has to import 53 billion cubic meters of natural gas
from Russia every year.
</P>
<P>
However, Gazprom has sharply cut gas supply to Ukraine because
Kiev has owed Moscow 625 million dollars of energy debts.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine became upset when it received only 125 million cubic
meters of natural gas this summer.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kuchma promised to repay all the debts while
Viakhyrev wished to expand cooperation with Ukraine by selling
natural gas to other countries through Ukrainian pipelines.

ROME, July 24 (Xinhua) - Former World Cup star Diego Maradona
could still earn a recall to the Argentine national side and may
still be good enough to return to Italy's serie A, former
Argentina coach Cesar Menotti said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If he carries on playing the way he's doing at the moment, I
have no doubt he can play for Argentina again, or for Milan, or
Juventus or Sampdoria," said World-Cup winning trainer Menotti,

Maradona, who played in serie A with Napoli in the mid-1980's,
has been out of regular professional football since he tested
positive for drugs at the 1994 World Cup finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOGA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Colombia is evolving a
maritime strategy for its economic development and preparing to
launch a maritime awareness campaign throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Colombian President ernesto Samper
during a ceremony commemorating the 174th anniversary of the
establishment of the National Navy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the two seas that surround it, Colombia ignores that
reality, said Samper.
</P>
<P>
"The destiny of Colombia would be different if we had had the
maritime conscience of other countries that took them to commerce
and industrialization in a big scale, and thanks to that became
world powers in all the fields," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Samper added that in this era of market blocs in the world,
Colombians have the duty of going out to sea if they do not want
to be left behind by the train of progress, development, and
well-being of the people.
</P>
<P>
"I want to repeat the importance it has for Colombia to have a
maritime strategy that permits it to choose other alternatives of
economic and social development through the riches the sea
offers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Samper said that a strategy is being elaborated in Colombia to
tap the great potential offered by the seas and create strong
national maritime conscience.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the end of his mandate next year he will
deliver to Colombians a policy that will answer to the maritime
reality of the country and to other economic challenges of the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
He invited all Colombians, especially businessmen, to
contribute to national development by promoting what he called the
maritime spirit in the society and looking for new partners in the
Pacific area that now offers Colombia multiple alternatives of
progress.

<HEADLINE> More Double-Deck Buses to Enter Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China will have 1,000 double-deck
buses shuttling in its major cities by the end of this century,
the latest issue of Business News has reported.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based newspaper said that the number may even
exceed 4,000, as the currently-operating buses are beginning to
lose their appeal, overshadowed by the double-decker with bigger
transport capacity and comfortable interior.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has bus services in 400 cities, but the
double-deck bus lines are available in only 20 Chinese cities,
including Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Though fortunate to have a huge market potential, the
double-deck bus manufacturers will face tougher competition among
each other, as the high profitability of the industry will attract
more newcomers, the paper said.

BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, one of China's four
province-level municipalities, will import 75,000 lines of
telephone switching machines from Northern Telecom (Nortel), the
leading telecommunications manufacturer of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The contract for 75,000 lines of DMS-100 switching gears was

Centrex to the local networks.
</P>
<P>
With a yearly capacity of three million lines of switching
machines, Guangdong Nortel is now one of the major suppliers of

CARACAS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government decided
to raise Medicine prices by 27-32 percent after they had been
frozen for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
The Industry and Commerce Ministry announced Wednesday that
prices for the medicines that cost less than 3,000 bolivars (6.25
dollars) will rise by 32 percent while the rest will be priced 27
percent higher than before.
</P>
<P>
The ministry ordered the laboratories to produce essential
medicines in sufficient quantities.
</P>
<P>
However, the laboratories are not happy with the decision
because the increase is 60 percent less than what they expected.
</P>
<P>
Some political leaders said that the price hike gives a heavy

NEW YORK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 28.57 to 8,116.93 Thursday, erasing a 95-point slide.
</P>
<P>
It was Dow's third consecutive record high. With its first
close ever above 8,100, the blue-chip barometer has now gained
25.9 percent this year, nearly equaling its 26 percent gain for
all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators also snapped back from steep morning
losses with some setting new highs.
</P>
<P>
After a three-day advance that added nearly 200 points to the
Dow, investors found an excuse to lock in some of those gains as
the bond market stumbled on some mildly unsettling economic news.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy again at 571.03
million shares at the closing.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 3.74 to 940.30 and
the NYSE composite index rose 1.80 to 487.31, a record-high finish
for both measures.

<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.40 to

<HEADLINE> US Swim Elite to Battle for World Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A field of 1,100 entrants will
compete in the week-long US Swimming Championships, to be started
on Saturday, for berths in the upcoming World Universiade and the
World Championships next year.
</P>
<P>
Among the elite were Amy Van Dyken, who won four gold medals at
the Atlanta Olympics, and Olympic 400-meter individual medley
champion Tom Dolan.
</P>
<P>
Van Dyken will compete in the 50m and 100m freestyles and 100m
butterfly. In Atlanta, she became the four-time champion in the 50
freestyle and 100 butterfly as well as a member of the two winning
US relay teams.
</P>
<P>
Dolan, the 400m medley world-record holder, will compete in the
200m medley, 400m freestyle and 200m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
The strong US women lineup features five-time Olympic champion
Jenny Thompson, who set a world 100 freestyle record at the World
Short Course Championships in April at Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champions Brooke Bennett in 800m freestyle and Beth
Botsford in 200m backstroke are the other top favorites for the
national meet.
</P>
<P>
However, several top women stars are absent from the roster,
including retired Janet Evans, former world champion who still
holds the long-distance world records.
</P>
<P>
But Van Dyken and Bennett were leading a young team with their
eyes firmly aimed at the 2000 Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
Among the men athletes, Josh Davis won three gold medals at
Atlanta while Brad Schumacher and Gary Hall each took home two.
</P>
<P>
Olympic 200 backstroke champion Brian Bridgewater is also in
the pool. But the star of the meet could be Chad Carvin, who
missed last year's Olympic trials with the heart ailments. Carvin
won four titles at the US Short Course National Championships.

The concilliation talks between the Argentine Football

Players voted on Tuesday to strike until troubled first
division side Deportivo Espanol agreed to allow six players whose
contracts expired on June 30 to move to other sides.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was complicated when a judge ruled that the players
counted as assets of the heavily-indebted club, and so cannot

<HEADLINE> Chinese People's Attitude to Mental Health Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese people are paying
equal attention to their mental and physical health, while they
used to care more about the latter.
</P>
<P>
As social competition intensifies and the tempo of life speeds
up, growing psychological stress has driven people to pay more
heed to maintaining mental health.
</P>
<P>
The Lushan Special Hospital for Mental Health, located on Mount
Lushan, a famous tourist spot in east China's Jiangxi Province, is
one of the country's few hospitals exclusively dealing with
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
It has treated over 3,000 patients from 25 provinces and
answered 60,000 letters and phone calls requesting psychological
counseling since its founding in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 90 percent of its patients have been
effectively treated. More importantly, many of the patients have
learned from Doctor Wu Jian's "Teapot Theory" to adjust themselves
psychologically.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a professor of psychology and one of the founders of the
hospital, pointed out that every person must have ways to relieve
themselves, just like a teapot should have a spout. "Our purpose
is to help the patients become their own psychological
counsellors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, psychological problems seldom caused the same
concern as that for physical illness, and they were usually
treated as physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago experts estimated that one out of five patients
coming to hospitals had actually no physical illness but
psychological problems instead. Now 2.23 percent of China's 1.2
billion population suffer from various kinds of psychological
problems, they estimate.
</P>
<P>
The China Association for Mental Health was re-established in
east China's Shandong Province in 1985, and subsidiary
organizations have been founded in different provinces to spread
basic knowledge about mental health.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals have opened special service for people with
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
Radio talk programs have been well received in most cities as
an effective way to relieve psychological pressures.
</P>
<P>
Some universities have started selective courses on mental
health. In Nanchang University 800 students attend such classes
per term now, compared with only 16 when the courses started in
1992.

SAN JOSE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Rains were less than usual in the
central valley of Costa Rica while the other areas saw much more
rains because of what is known as the phenomenon El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon has caused a change in the direction of the
winds in the Southern Pacific and is bringing in warm currents to
the Pacific coasts of Peru and Ecuador, said meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the El Nino has extended to the entire Pacific
coast of South America and has also been felt in a specially
intense manner in Central America.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino mainly causes much more rains with ensuing floods,
affecting agriculture and and the power industry.

If the present climate conditions linger on till September and
October, there will be more rainy months this year, said Jorge
Arturo Barrantes of the National Meteorological Institute.

items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The slowest wages growth in four-and-a-half years and weak
demand for skilled labor have bolstered the hope for an official
interest rate cut by Australia's central bank in coming days,
which would be the fifth in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The New South Wales state government is under increased
pressure on the law enforcement front with the release Thursday of
figures showing crime in the state increased 26 percent last year
over the previous year, accounting for almost all the national
increase.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The most exhaustive manhunt in recent U.S. history is over
after the body of a man officially identified as Andrew Cunanan
was found last night by Miami police. The most wanted person in

Versace and the slayings of four other men, Cunanan appeared to
have died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Azerbaijan in Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved a
70 million U.S. dollar credit to help strengthen the government's
economic reform program in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The credit, which will be financed by funds from the
International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's
concessional lending wing, will support the country's economic
recovery while helping to introduce greater competition and
flexibility to the economy, and to enhance the further development
of the private sector, especially in the non-oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be disbursed in two equal tranches and will be
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years, including a
10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Since joining the World Bank in 1992, and the IDA in 1995,
Azerbaijan has obtained some 270 million dollars equivalent in IDA
commitments for seven projects in the country.

<HEADLINE> Only 700 Non-Serbs Return to Serb Republic of Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Only an estimated 700 of
non-Serbs have returned to the Serb republic of Bosnia in the past
18 months, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said today.
</P>
<P>
Chris Janowski, spokesman for UNHCR operations in Bosnia, said
that out of those minority returnees, 450 were back to the
so-called "Zone of Separation" between two entities which is under
the control of NATO-led peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 Muslim refugees have returned to villages near Brcko,
the town controlled by Serbs but also contested by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR spokesman said the return of minority refugees to the
Muslim-Croat federation is more encouraging and, as an example,
5,000 Serbs have returned to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace agreement signed by the end of 1995 obliged
the Bosnian parties to allow refugees of all ethnic backgrounds to
return home, but so far out of 2 million refugees, only 300,000
have returned and most of them to regions where their ethnic
groups are majority.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Says US Cooperation Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Javier Solana
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) today stressed
the importance of the United States' role in the military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the American University here, Solana said that
Europe could not bear the burden of expanding NATO by itself.
</P>
<P>
"There are some Americans who argue that Europeans should pick
up all of the European burden. They suggest that the burden of
European security is now manageable by the Europeans alone,"
Solana said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet such a division of labor would run against all our shared
strategic interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that if the U.S. did not take part in NATO's
expansion plans, this would overtax the Europeans' capabilities
and deprive Washington of a major source of influence in shaping
the new Europe.
</P>
<P>
He added that it would mean that the U.S. could not look to its
traditional allies for support in global contingencies.
</P>
<P>
"So it is and remains true -- Europe needs us just as the U.S.
needs Europe. As long as the United States wants to remain a
global power, it will have to remain a `European power' as well,"
he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The alliance decided earlier this month at its special summit
in Madrid that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will be
invited to join by 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, many U.S. lawmakers oppose the expansion, arguing that
the Europeans should be able to take care of themselves since the
Cold War has ended and the U.S. should not take the burden any
more.

<HEADLINE> Greece Not Pleased With Name Talks With Skopje </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece said today that talks
between Athens and Skopje on the name of the latter could not be
allowed to carry on forever.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters today
that the issue of the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYROM) remained open and that the views of the two
sides did not converge.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that there was room for agreement on the
name issue and said that Greece entered the talks under Cyrus
Vance with its known position of not accepting the name
"Macedonia" or some derivative.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to Mr. Vance to undertake the appropriate initiatives
to resolve the issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greek-FYROM ties were guided by the bilateral
interim agreement signed in 1996 and that progress had been made
since then, particularly in the economic and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and the FYROM were strained when
Skopje declared its independence from Belgrade in 1991 because
Athens said that the name of Macedonia implied Skopje's
territorial claims for one of its province of the same name.
</P>
<P>
Since the FYROM's admission into the U.N. in 1993, Athens and
Skopje have been engaged in regular closed-door talks, chaired by
U.N. special representative Vance, aimed at finding a permanent
solution.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Lebanon Sign Accords to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and his Greek counterpart, Costas Simitis, today
signed two agreements to protect investments and promote economic
and technical cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers held talks after Hariri arrived here
today on a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their talks, Hariri said that he
had discussed with Simitis bilateral cooperation issues,
particularly Greek construction companies' participation in
Lebanese public works tenders and the need for increased
cooperation in the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to undertake necessary initiatives to
facilitate the speeding up of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In response, Simitis said that recent "delay" in the peace
process, particularly with regard to Israeli-Palestinian ties,
could jeopardize the entire effort.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Greece supported Lebanon's efforts to establish a special
relationship and cooperation with the European Union (EU), he
said. He stressed that Athens hoped to play a steady role in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the EU should undertake a peace
initiative in the Middle East rather than being a "spectator" of
developments in the region, so that Israel too would take
corresponding steps.

<HEADLINE> More Harassment Against Int'l Personnel in Serb Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- After a lull of three days,
harassment against international personnel has resumed in the Serb
republic of Bosnia, the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SPOR)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
An SPOR statement said that a Dutch soldier was wounded
Wednesday evening when two drunken civilians threw a grenade at a
group of Dutch soldiers who were trying to recover an armored
personnel carrier veering off the road near Kotar Varos in
northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers returned fire and captured one person and a second
one who ran away was subsequently arrested by local Serb police.
</P>
<P>
In another incident Wednesday night, two anti-tank rockets were
fired at a vehicle belonging to the local station of the UN
International Police Task Force (IPTF) in a northern Bosnian town.
</P>
<P>
The SPOR dispatched a quick reaction force to the scene, which
according to local press reports was in front of the residence of
an IPTF member. No one was injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
In the week up to last Saturday, there had been daily incidents
of explosions and other kinds of harassment against international
personnel in the Serb-controlled territory with two American
soldiers slightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
Although the IPTF said that there was no evidence that they
were organized by Serb authorities, the incidents were widely
believed to be of retaliation following the SPOR's capture of two
war crime indictees in the Serb town of Prijedor on July 10.
