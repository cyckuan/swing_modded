Key conservative won't back criticism of Malaysia's Mahathir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A conservative Australian state head
refused to join the prime minister Thursday in criticizing the
arrest of a Malaysian former deputy prime minister.
	   ``Malaysia is trying to adjust and I don't think we should be
too harsh on them for the measures they have taken,'' said
Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett.
	   Prime Minister John Howard criticized the arrest Sunday of Anwar
Ibrahim, saying that Malaysia was moving to a more ``authoritarian
approach.''
	   That drew protest from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who accused Howard of being ``wrong, absolutely.'' The
Malaysian government handed a letter of protest to Australia on
Wednesday.
	   ``I'm not going to enter into that,'' Kennett told reporters.
	   ``I have my own views, and we've all got to recognize we live in
different sovereign states and different sovereign countries and no
two countries are entirely the same.''
	   Kennett has recently returned from a trip to Malaysia and
Indonesia, where he met both Mahathir and Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie.
	   It was ``dangerous'' to judge other countries by Australian
standards, he said.

Booby trap explodes near convoy of Cambodian leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Hun Sen spokesman comment, other details
of attack, three soldiers detained, background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ A booby trap exploded near the convoy
of Cambodian leader Hun Sen Thursday, killing a young boy and
injuring three people, police said. Hun Sen was not hurt by the
blast.
	   Police said the attack was an attempted assassination by
terrorists, although suspects have not been narrowed down to any
one group.
	   Hun Sen was en route to the king's residence in this
northwestern town for ceremonies to swear in a new parliament, when
a B-40 rocket exploded on the side of the road just as his car had
passed by, said deputy police commander Col. Than Chay.
	   Than Chay said the car carrying Hun Sen was less than 10 meters
(33 feet) away when the explosion occurred.
	   Hun Sen's spokesman Prak Sokhon also described the explosion as
an attempted assassination.
	   ``The setup was meant to achieve the goal. They seemed to know
very well the car Hun Sen was in,'' he said. ``It is hard to deny
it was an assassination attempt.''
	   Prak Sokhon said a bodyguard riding with Hun Sen reported that
the rocket flew across the road a few feet (meters) in front of
their four-wheel-drive.
	   Three soldiers were detained for questioning. They were not
suspects but they had been absent from their barracks without
permission, police said.
	   Police said three more unexploded rockets were found by the
road, parts of what appeared to be a remote-control booby trap.
	   Explosive experts from the Cambodian Mine Action Center were
examining the device and searching the area.
	   The center handles the removal of the many land mines that still
litter the countryside after two decades of war.
	   On Sept. 7, a grenade was tossed at Hun Sen's residence in the
capital of Phnom Penh, but he was not home. No one was injured and
little damage was done.
	   The opposition charged that Hun Sen staged the incident to have
an excuse to crack down on his opponents. He banned anti-government
demonstrations the next day and threatened his opponents with
arrest.
	   Security has been very high for Hun Sen during his stay here,
with dozens of his military bodyguard unit guarding members of his
entourage and their vehicles around the clock since he arrived on
Monday. There is an armored personnel carrier parked at the hotel
where he is staying.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hurricane Georges
killed 70 people in the Dominican Republic and left hundreds
missing before sweeping over Cuba and threatening the Florida Keys.
In all, more than 110 people were killed in the storm's three-day
rampage through the Caribbean.
	   Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez, in a televised
address to the nation Wednesday night, confirmed the 70 dead and
the missing, including 45 who disappeared when a school being used
as a shelter washed away Wednesday.
	   He asked for unity in reconstruction efforts and urged people
``to pray and ask the Almighty to help the destiny of our people.''
	   Fernandez said more than half the power grid in the Dominican
Republic was destroyed by Georges' 110-mph (176-kph) winds at a
cost of dlrs 111 million. Seventy percent of the country's bridges
were damaged or destroyed, and 90 percent of its banana and other
plantations were destroyed, he said.
	   Georges pounded the Dominican Republic Tuesday after barreling
through Puerto Rico. It struck Haiti on Wednesday, where 27 were
reported killed, before moving on to Cuba and menacing southern
Florida.
	   At 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT Wednesday), Georges was centered 60
miles (96 kph) northwest of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and was moving
west-northwest at 12 mph (19 kph). Its winds had significantly
slowed to 75 mph (120 kph), down from 110 mph (176 kph) when the
storm swept over Puerto Rico.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
	   Hurricane watches were in effect for the northwestern Bahamas
and parts of Florida. The Cayman Islands issued tropical storm
warnings for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and heavy rains were
expected in Jamaica.
	   In Florida, up to 80,000 people were ordered to begin evacuating
the exposed Florida Keys on Wednesday. Cars, trucks and sport
utility vehicles streamed along the two-lane highway linking the
island chain to the Florida mainland.
	   South Florida was put under a hurricane watch and Gov. Lawton
Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern
Florida, allowing the state to use the National Guard, lift tolls
along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   In the Dominican town of San Cristobal, 20 miles (30 kilometers)
east of Santo Domingo, the Nizao River overflowed and knocked down
a part of a school used as a shelter, leaving five dead and dozens
missing.
	   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid
water. Residents swam out to their houses to try to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty water jugs tied to their arms to help
them float.
	   Looters in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic,
waded waist-deep in water, balancing televisions and air
conditioners on their heads on Tuesday as 110 mph (176 kph) winds
toppled trees and crushed houses. Bands of youths with machetes and
pistols roamed the streets, many of them drunk. Two of the dead
were looters shot by police enforcing a curfew.
	   From the Dominican Republic, Georges proceeded Tuesday night to
Haiti, which occupies the western third of the island of
Hispaniola. The storm unleashed flash floods that were no match for
the flimsy housing in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation.
	   Most of the deaths in Haiti reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there
were no public shelters. Four drowning victims were found in a
west-side suburb Wednesday afternoon. Deaths also were reported in
Gonaives and the northern town of Marmelade.
	   Yolaine Surena of the civil defense authority said the
government could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.
	   In the Cuban capital of Havana, President Fidel Castro put his
Cabinet on alert Wednesday and said the country's armed forces
would help get medicine, food and other help to hurricane victims
after Georges passes.
	   By late Wednesday, authorities had already evacuated 200,000
people from their homes in Cuba's eastern provinces.
	   Warnings were declared in Cuba from Sancti Spiritus province
eastward and in the central and southern Bahamas.
	   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity,''
Mexico's official Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying.
	   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the
government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in
Antigua.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent
hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and
utilities; on the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a
man while burglarizing his home. There were no other fatalities,
	   The effects of the storm were expected to be felt as far south
as Jamaica, where officials expected heavy rains.
	   Three people were killed directly by the storm in Puerto Rico,
where the government's insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia,
estimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. Another eight, most of them
elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the
storm.
	   The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that a
third of Puerto Rico's power was expected back Wednesday, but
715,000 remained without running water. FEMA said airport damage
was minimal and the port of San Juan reported no major damage.
Coffee and plantain crops, however, were badly harmed, FEMA said.

Singapore exercises

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A British Royal Navy co-pilot was missing
Thursday after his helicopter crashed into the South China Sea
during a training exercise with Singaporean forces, Singapore's
Ministry of Defense said.
	   Two Royal Navy personnel were aboard the Lynx helicopter when it
crashed late Wednesday about 90 miles (144 kilometers) northeast of
Singapore in international waters, Group Captain Christopher Lebas,
Defense Advisor at the British High Commission, told the Associated
Press.
	   The pilot, who suffered minor bruises, was retrieved at 11:15
p.m., according to a Singapore Ministry of Defense statement.
	   A search and rescue operation to locate the second crew member,
whose position is called observer, continued Thursday. The observer
acts as a navigator, systems operator, and co-pilot.
	   ``Obviously the major concern is to find out what happened to
the observer,'' said Lebas.
	   The names of the two British naval personnel were not released,
and the cause of the crash remained unknown.
	   Singapore's defense ministry said the helicopter was taking part
in a ``night encounter exercise'' involving three Singapore missile
corvettes and Britain's HMS Grafton.
	   The British vessel informed all units operating in the exercise
that communications with the helicopter were lost at 10:00 p.m.
Singapore's RSS Valour picked up a distress signal about 10 minutes
later.
	   The British and Singapore navies were engaged in the third day
of training activities that began Monday and were due to end
Thursday.
	   Lebas said the military exercise was suspended after the
accident.

Red Sox clinch tie for American Leage wild-card berth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The Boston Red Sox clinched a tie for the AL
wild-card berth Wednesday night, beating the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
5-4 as Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run homer to atone for his
error that led to three unearned runs.
	   Tom Gordon tied a major-league record with his 41st straight
save conversion. He got out of an eighth-inning jam by striking out
Paul Sorrento, then pitched a one-hit ninth for his AL-high 44th
save of the season.
	   Boston can eliminate Toronto, which beat Baltimore 6-3 Wednesday
night, by beating the Orioles in the opener of a regular
season-ending, four-game series Thursday night.
	   Steve Avery (10-7) became Boston's fourth 10-game winner,
allowing no earned runs and five hits in five innings.
 &UR; Blue Jays 6, Orioles 3 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Kelvim Escobar outpitched former teammate Juan
Guzman, and Carlos Delgado and Shannon Stewart each hit two-run
homers as Toronto beat Baltimore.
	   After Guzman (10-16) was traded to the Orioles on July 31,
Escobar (7-3) replaced him. Escobar went eight innings, giving up
three runs and 10 hits, striking out five and walking one.
	   Robert Person pitched the ninth for his sixth save.
	   Guzman, who spent 7 1/2 seasons with Toronto, made his first
start against his former team. He gave up six runs and seven hits
in 4 2-3 innings, struck out seven and walked three.
 &UR; Yankees 8, Indians 4 &QC; 
	   In New York, Shane Spencer and Chad Curtis hit three-run homers
as the New York Yankees matched the most wins in franchise history.
	   The Yankees, who equaled the 110 wins of the 1927 team, pulled
within one game of the American League record of 111 victories by
the 1954 Indians.
	   New York has four games remaining to catch the Indians but will
not be able to surpass the 116 victories by the Chicago Cubs in
1906.
	   Spencer hit his seventh homer in 51 at-bats to cap a five-run
third inning off Indians starter Jason Jacome (0-1), who was making
his first start for Cleveland after a 17-2 season in the minors.
 &UR; Tigers 5, Royals 1 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Bryce Florie allowed three hits in
seven innings and struck out nine to break his six-game road losing
streak.
	   Kansas City lost for the 48th time at Kauffman Stadium, breaking
the team record for home losses set last year when the Royals
posted their second straight last-place finish in the AL Central.
Detroit extended its season-high road winning streak to five games
and completed its first three-game sweep of Kansas City since 1991.
	   Florie (8-9) didn't walk a batter in earning his first road win
since beating the Brewers 9-3 on June 6.

Sosa homers twice, but Cubs lose
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Sammy Sosa kept the pressure on Mark McGwire,
but the Chicago Cubs couldn't keep the pressure on the New York
Mets.
	   Sosa homered twice to tie McGwire in the home run race at 65 and
give the Cubs a 7-0 lead Wednesday. They couldn't hold it, though,
and lost to the Milwaukee Brewers 8-7 when Brant Brown dropped a
fly ball that would have been the game's final out, allowing three
runs to score.
	   Chicago, which has three games remaining, remained tied with New
York atop the NL wild-card race.
	   Sosa broke an 0-for-21 slump, hitting solo shots in the fifth
and sixth innings. It was his 11th multihomer game this season,
tying the major league record set by Detroit's Hank Greenberg in
1938.
 &UR; Expos 3, Mets 0 &QC; 
	   In New York, Carl Pavano allowed three hits in six-plus innings
as Montreal dropped New York back into a tie with the Chicago Cubs
atop the NL wild-card standings.
	   The Mets close out the season with three games in Atlanta.
	   Pavano (6-8) also had an RBI double for Montreal, which went 8-4
against New York this year. Ugueth Urbina got three outs for his
34th save and seventh against the Mets.
	   Bobby Jones (9-9) allowed five hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Giants 4, Pirates 1 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Joe Carter hit a go-ahead, three-run homer and
Mark Gardner allowed five hits in eight innings as San Francisco
won its third straight.
	   The Giants, who moved to within 1 1/2 games of the Mets and Cubs
in the NL wild-card race, has four games left.
	   Gardner (13-5) won his fifth straight decision, matching his
career high with 11 strikeouts and walking two. Robb Nen finished
for his 39th save.
 &UR; Astros 7, Cardinals 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire failed to homer against Houston's
Randy Johnson to remain tied at 65 home runs with Sammy Sosa, as
the Astros won their 100th game.
	   Johnson (10-1) scattered eight hits in seven innings to end the
Cardinals' six-game winning streak.
	   Houston's Craig Biggio became only the second player this
century to have 50 steals and 50 doubles in a season, joining Hall
of Famer Tris Speaker, who achieved the mark in 1912.
	   The Astros clinched home-field advantage in the first round of
the playoffs.
	   The Astros knocked out St. Louis starter Darren Oliver (4-4) in
the third.
 &UR; Braves 11, Marlins 0 &QC; 
	   In Miami, John Smoltz allowed one hit in five innings and Andres
Galarraga hit his 44th homer for Atlanta.
	   The Braves reduced to one their magic number for clinching the
NL's best record, which would ensure a home-field advantage in the
first two rounds of postseason play.
	   Smoltz (17-3) retired the first 10 batters, including seven on
strikeouts.
	   Kurt Ojala (2-7) allowed six runs in four innings.
 &UR; Phillies 4, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Mark Portugal had a pair of hits and pitched 7
2-3 innings to lead the Phillies.
	   Portugal (10-5) allowed four singles and four walks. The
right-hander went 8-2 in 15 road starts with a 3.06 earned run
average this season.
	   Ricky Bottalico got the final two outs for his sixth save.
	   Steve Parris (6-5) lasted only 2 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Rockies 14, Diamondbacks 11 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Todd Helton homered twice and drove in a career-high
five runs to lead the Rockies.
	   Colorado's Larry Walker went 3-for-3 to improve his NL-best
batting average to .360.
	   David Wainhouse (1-0) got the win. Dave Veres pitched two
scoreless innings for his sixth save.
	   Arizona's Willie Banks (1-2) allowed the go-ahead run in the
seventh.

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on
Thursday refused to back down from his criticism of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad over the sacking and arrest of former
deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett and Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer refused to endorse Howard's views, which led
to an official complaint from the Malaysian government.
	   Kennett, the most outspoken conservative in the nation after
Howard, said he would not comment on Howard's statement that
Malaysia was moving to a more ``authoritarian approach'' following
Anwar's arrest, but indicated he held a different view.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday that
Howard was ``wrong, absolutely'' and should ``check the real
facts'' before making accusations.
	   Howard added Thursday, ``I don't at this stage have anything to
add but I certainly don't withdraw those remarks. I thought they
were measured, they were moderate, and they were entirely
appropriate.''
	   ``I'm not going to enter into that,'' Kennett told reporters.
	   ``I have my own views, and we've all got to recognize we live in
different sovereign states and different sovereign countries and no
two countries are entirely the same.''
	   His comments come just one week after he slammed The Age
newspaper for ``intolerance and lack of understanding'' after it
criticized Mahathir in an editorial, saying Australians should not
judge Malaysia too harshly.
	   ``Malaysia is trying to adjust and I don't think we should be
too harsh on them for the measures they have taken,'' Kennett said
after returning from a trip to Malaysia and Indonesia, where he met
both Mahathir and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie.
	   It was ``dangerous'' to judge other countries by Australian
standards and Australia should not dictate to its neighbors if it
valued its trade and diplomatic relationships, he said.
	   The Malaysian government on Wednesday handed a letter of protest
to Australian High Commissioner Robert Cotton over the comments by
Howard, and others from Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer and
former foreign minister Gareth Evans.
	   Howard's deputy prime minister, Tim Fischer, was asked Thursday
by a reporter if Mahathir is the wrong man in the wrong place at
the wrong time, with an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
summit coming up in November in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``I do not agree,'' Fischer said. ``And I wish Malaysia well and
Prime Minister Mahathir well in the roles they have to play for the
meetings scheduled for November.''

	   In Minneapolis, Chris Latham's two-out single in the 12th inning
scored Paul Molitor with the winning run as the Minnesota Twins
rallied from a six-run deficit.
	   The rally, sparked by Brent Gates' tying three-run homer in the
ninth, tied a team record for the biggest comeback in Twins'
history. It is the eighth time they have come back from six down.
	   Molitor started the winning rally with a two-out single off
Scott Eyre (3-8) and Doug Mientkiewicz followed with a check-swing
single. Molitor stole third without a throw and Latham singled up
the middle for his third RBI in 30 games this season.
	   Mike Trombley (6-5), the seventh Minnesota pitcher, pitched two
innings for the win.

<SLUG> Australian leader defends monopoly wheat-selling practices </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Trade Minister Tim Fischer strongly
backed Australia's controversial monopoly wheat and sugar selling
arrangements Thursday, describing them ``legitimate weaponry.''
	   Fischer, who leads the rural-based National Party, the junior
partner in the conservative coalition government of Prime Minister
John Howard, was releasing the government's trade policies for Oct.
3 elections.
	   U.S. trade negotiators have sharply criticized the way Australia
sells its wheat and sugar overseas, saying it involves both unfair
government assistance and monopoly practices.
	   Fischer did not deny either charge, but said the present
arrangements, which his party strongly supports, are not only
legitimate but also help customers.
	   He described both practices as single desk marketing.
	   ``Its a legitimate piece of weaponry at the point of export,''
he said.
	   All Australian wheat sold overseas must be marketed by the
Australian Wheat Board.
	   Similar arrangements apply for sugar sold from the Australian
state of Queensland.

Argentine judge requests extradition of IBM employees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A federal judge has requested the
extradition of two officials of computer giant IBM accused of fraud
and bribery in an alleged kickback scheme.
	   IBM Argentina has been accused of paying dlrs 21 million in
bribes to win a dlrs 249 million contract in 1994 to computerize
state-owned Banco Nacion, the country's largest bank.
	   Federal Judge Adolfo Bagnasco requested the extradition of Steve
Lew and Peter Rowley, who worked at the company's U.S. headquarters
at the time of the alleged scheme, the Diarios y Noticias agency
reported.
	   Judge Bagnasco was unavailable for comment.
	   In testimony before Bagnasco in April, former IBM Argentina
president Ricardo Martorana, who resigned after being indicted,
said Lew had been sent by IBM to oversee the contract.
	   And on Tuesday, former IBM Argentina vice president Gustavo
Soriani said that Lew and Rowley ``don't want to come to Argentina
to uphold (IBM's) official version.''
	   The Armonk, New York-based computer company has denied any
wrongdoing but has said it would initiate an inquiry.
	   Last year, 10 former IBM Argentina and Banco Nacion officials,
including Martorana, Soriani and former bank president Aldo Dadone
were charged with bribery. They are all free on bail.

Explosion casts pall on convening of Cambodian parliament

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Members of parliament were sworn in
as planned Thursday morning despite a violent explosion which
police described as an assassination attempt on Cambodian leader
Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen was unhurt, but two children died and two other people
were injured by the blast, caused by a rocket-propelled grenade
booby-trap that exploded as the strongman's convoy passed by.
	   The apparent attack took place shortly before the 122 elected
members from the ruling and opposition parties gathered at the
residence of King Norodom Sihanouk to prepare for the opening of
the new session of the National Assembly.
	   The occasion was supposed to mark a major step towards restoring
political stability after bitter post-election sparring, and in a
brief speech the king urged national reconciliation.
	   Hun Sen looked unperturbed after arriving at the residence of
the 75-year-old monarch, who spoke to the lawmakers before they
headed to the famous 12th-century Angkor Wat temple, located just
outside this northwestern town, to be officially sworn in.
	   King Sihanouk called on the new parliament to reach ``an
honorable compromise'' to form a new government to quickly act to
put an end to corruption, poverty and deforestation.
	   ``I ask our new National Assembly to see to it that the new
Royal Government of Cambodia comes to life, as a symbol of national
reconciliation ... able to make an effort and sacrifices so that
our country can rapidly rise out of the state of
underdevelopment,'' he said.
	   Parliament was to be convened after weeks of tensions between
Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party, which captured a
majority in elections held July 26, and the two opposition parties
that claimed Hun Sen won the polls through fraud and intimidation.
	   The opposition threatened to boycott parliament and organized
spirited street rallies in the capital of Phnom Penh calling for
the Hun Sen's ouster.
	   Police violently broke up the demonstrations, killing at least
four people and injuring or arresting dozens of others. A ban was
placed on foreign travel by all opposition legislators.
	   As the situation threatened to spin out of control, the
opposition agreed to end the boycott and attend tripartite talks,
which were led by Sihanouk on Tuesday.
	   Parliament is scheduled to meet in the capital early next week
to elect its leadership and try to form a government.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Josh Wolff drew a penalty kick, earned an assist
and scored the last-minute game-winner as the Chicago Fire defeated
the New England Revolution 3-2 Wednesday night.
	   Wolff took a pass from Chris Armas and scored on a breakaway
with just over a minute remaining. He has eight goals in his rookie
season, including three game-winners.
	   Wolff also assisted on the game-tying goal in the 74th minute.
He stole the ball from Brian Dunseth and dished off to Frank Klops
for a wide-open shot.
	   New England (11-19) drew even in the 43rd minute when Edwin
Gorter scored unassisted from over 20 yards out.

Malaysian politician's wife faces arrest if she talks about case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to move up arrest threat, CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of the country's
imprisoned opposition leader remained holed up at home Thursday
under threat of arrest if she addresses the public, while police
blockaded two streets to keep the press and supporters away.
	   In the government's drive to stifle any further challenge to
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule, a police order
under the Internal Security Act prohibited Azizah Ismail from
speaking at rallies or gatherings, including at her house.
	   A breach of the order would automatically lead to her arrest,
she said. Azizah also said there had been no directive prohibiting
reporters from meeting her.
	   However, about two dozen police set up roadblocks on two streets
leading to her home Wednesday and Thursday, refusing to let
journalists pass, even when a member of the family came out and
invited them in.
	   Supporters of Azizah's husband, Anwar Ibrahim, who had come by
the hundreds for two weeks to hear his speeches calling for reform
of Mahathir's government, were specifically prohibited by the
police order from coming to the house.
	   With the exception of relatives and a few close friends, anyone
who showed up was turned away.
	   No reasons were given. The Internal Security Act gives police
wide powers to issue restrictions on civil rights and detain people
indefinitely without trial.
	   Anwar, 51, was detained Sunday under the act, amid some of the
biggest upheavals in this country's four decades of independence.
He was dumped as deputy prime minister and finance minister on
Sept. 2 by Mahathir, who called him morally unfit to lead.
	   Anwar has been accused by police of a series of crimes,
including unlawful sex acts, disturbing public order, interfering
with police investigations, and leaking state secrets.
	   He has adamantly denied all the charges against him. He says
trouble started when he began questioning Mahathir's policies and
autocratic leadership, and became a popular alternative to the
prime minister.
	   Anwar's lawyers, Amnesty International and two local opposition
parties have demanded he be brought to court and charged.
	   Since his arrest a dozen other men, including leaders of the
ruling party's youth wing and opposition parties, have been
detained under the Internal Security Act.
	   The government has issued numerous reminders that the reform
movement's occasional demonstrations are illegal. There have been
no rallies since Monday when police used tear gas and
chemically-laced water jets to disperse a crowd chanting ``Reform,
reform'' in front of the courthouse.
	   On Tuesday, the government issued restrictions blocking foreign
news broadcasting agencies from transmitting footage that shows
Malaysia in a negative light.
	   ``... Government facilities will not be allowed to be used for
sending negative stories on Malaysia,'' said Mohamad Rahmat, the
information minister. He said, however, that private satellite
uplinks could be used by broadcasters. The impact of the new
restriction was not immediately clear.
	   Neither Anwar's family, nor lawyers, have been allowed to see or
speak to him since his arrest.
	   Azizah went to Sessions Court Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
expecting him to be arraigned, but he did not appear.
	   Azizah herself was questioned for two hours by police Wednesday
about her role in the reform movement and her allegation in an
interview that police may be planning to inject her husband with
the HIV virus while he is in custody.
	   Anwar had said before his arrest that she would continue to
lead. But Azizah has spent most of her time inside the family's
home with the couple's six children.
	   ``I don't have to do a lot. ... The reform (movement) has
started in the hearts of the people,'' she said late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders have urged Israel and the
Palestinians to continue a course of peace but are making
contingency plans if U.S. efforts to reach a settlement fail.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told the General
Assembly's annual debate Wednesday that France supports the efforts
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to move the peace
process forward.
	   ``But we do not wish to be left without any prospect should
those efforts unfortunately not succeed,'' he said.
	   That is why French President Jacques Chirac and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak have proposed that if the U.S. efforts
fail, ``a conference of the countries resolved to save peace''
should be convened, he said.
	   ``This concern for the future has been very well received,''
Vedrine said. ``We must not abandon the goal of responding to the
aspirations of the peoples of the region for a just and lasting
peace which respects the resolutions and agreements that have been
reached.''
	   On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses
the General Assembly. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat plans to
tell the body next week of his determination to declare a
Palestinian state by May, with or without Israel's approval.
	   Albright's spokesman James P. Rubin said that declaration
``would be a unilateral action we would oppose.''
	   Netanyahu told a news conference that interim Oslo agreements
between Israel and the Palestinians specifically rule out such
unilateral declarations, reserving statehood as an issue to be
settled between the two sides.
	   Netanyahu met Wednesday with Albright on plans for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from the West Bank, but they reached no
breakthrough.
	   In a speech Tuesday to the General Assembly, Russia's foreign
minister Igor S. Ivanov repeated Moscow's belief that a Palestinian
state ``is only in this way that the inalienable right of
Palestinians to self-determination and reliable assurance of
Israel's legitimate security interests can be realized.''
	   China's Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on Wednesday urged all
parties in the Arab-Israeli dispute to take ``a flexible and
pragmatic position to promote constant progress of the peace
negotiations under the principle of `land for peace.'''
	   In another eagerly anticipated speech during Thursday's session,
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was to address the
General Assembly, following a breakthrough speech by Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

Biggio gets 50 doubles, 50 steals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Houston's Craig Biggio became only the second
player this century with 50 steals and 50 doubles in a season
Wednesday night, joining Hall of Famer Tris Speaker.
	   With two outs in the sixth, Biggio singled for his second hit of
the game. Two pitches later, he easily stole his 50th base in 57
attempts.
	   ``It's a nice feeling, I'm not going to lie about it,'' Biggio
said. ``It's definitely not something you try to achieve, but it
did work out. Something that hasn't been done in 70-80 years, it's
kind of a nice thing.''
	   The Astros' leadoff man has 51 doubles, 20 homers and 87 RBIs
and is batting .330 for the NL Central champions. Speaker had 53
doubles and 52 steals for Boston in 1912.
	   ``When you've done something that's only been done by one other
guy in the whole history of baseball, that's remarkable,'' manager
Larry Dierker said. ``We've been playing baseball a long time.''
	   Biggio is also the first player since the Cardinals' Lou Brock
in 1968 to get at least 45 doubles and 45 steals in a season. Brock
had 46 doubles and 62 steals that year.

French prime minister arrives in Beijing for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin arrived
Thursday for a visit intended to highlight increasingly warm ties
between China and France.
	   Relations were strained in the early 1990s over French weapons
sales to rival Taiwan, but China has courted France to raise
Chinese influence in Europe.
	   Helped by high-level exchanges and a willingness by Paris to
place trade ties ahead of human rights, relations between China and
France have improved steadily in recent years.
	   On Thursday, Jospin was scheduled to mix business and
sightseeing. He was to address French businessmen, visit Beijing's
ancient Forbidden City, meet with Premier Zhu Rongji and attend a
concert featuring Chinese rock singer Cui Jian.
	   On Friday, Jospin was to leave Beijing for Hefei, a city in
eastern Anhui province, where he is to meet with President Jiang
Zemin, who has been inspecting the rebuilding of areas affected by
massive flooding this summer along the Yangtze River.
	   The unusual location for the meeting prompted speculation that
China was delivering a diplomatic slap in the face for France's
sale of Mirage jets to Taiwan in 1992. Jospin was secretary-general
of the French Socialist Party, which was in power at the time.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao denied that,
saying both sides had a hand in choosing the location.
	   After Hefei, Jospin will travel to Shanghai, China's financial
and commercial center, and then to Hong Kong.
	   Chinese officials said they hoped the visit would further
promote close ties between Beijing and Paris.
	   The two countries have paid particular attention to trade and
economic ties. Last year bilateral trade amounted to about 59
billion francs (dlrs 10 billion).

Research assistant, students in Japan sickened after drinking tea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A research assistant and eight college students
have been sickened after drinking cadmium-laced tea at their
university lab in western Japan, police said Thursday.
	   Though no one was in serious condition from the incident, the
news comes amid heightened concerns over a string of poisonings
that began in the summer. Five people have died as a result of two
of the poisonings. No arrests have been made.
	   The latest poisoning occurred last Friday morning, said Mitsuo
Sato, a spokesman for the prefectural, or state, police in Kyoto,
about 375 kilometers (235 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Junta Yanai, a 31-year-old research assistant and eight students
at Kyoto University's soil research department complained of
stomachaches, diarrhea and vomiting about an hour after drinking
Japanese tea together, he said.
	   Sato said police were investigating the case as an assault, or
possibly an accident, since the department has access to cadmium.
	   The heavy metal can cause kidney problems and calcium
insufficiency when taken internally, he said.
	   The victims reported the sickening to a local health center
after being treated at a nearby hospital. Health officials then
reported it to the police.
	   The health center and the police conducted separate tests on the
leftover tea. They both found a small amount of cadmium, Sato said.
	   Four people _ including two children _ died and dozens more were
sickened in July after eating curry laced with arsenic at a town
festival in western Japan.
	   Last month, a man in central Japan was fatally poisoned after
drinking a can of tea containing potassium cyanide.

U.S. central bank chairman creates heyday in Asian markets, too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The clearest sign yet that the United States plans
to lower interest rates proved as magical on Asia's stock markets
Thursday as it did on Wall Street.
	   Moments after they opened, the region's three top bourses shot
skyward, with Hong Kong's main index jumping 3.2 percent,
Singapore's gaining 2.4 percent, and Japan's rising 1.85 percent.
	   Fourteen months after Asia's financial crisis began, two of the
area's hardest-hit markets opened even better. Thailand's main
stock index began the day 6.9 percent higher, and South Korea's
closed its morning session with a 4.5 percent improvement.
	   One after another, Asian analysts attributed the good day to
U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. On Wednesday, he gave
the clearest indication yet that he'll fight the global economic
crisis with lower U.S. interest rates.
	   In Washington, Greenspan told a U.S. Senate panel that Fed
officials know they have to act quickly to contain the global
crisis. And many traders read that as a clear indication of an
interest rate cut at next week's Fed meeting.
	   Greenspan said, ``I think we know where we have to go'' in
dealing with the crisis, which has since spread from Asia to
Russia, and is now threatening Latin America as well.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average responded by
rising 3.3 percent to 8,154.41, its highest finish in a month.
	   The big gain lifted the Dow more than 200 points above this
year's starting point. But that still left the blue-chip barometer
nearly 1,200 points below its July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   Economists often disagree over whether a small U.S. interest
rate cut would have much of a long-term impact on other countries,
especially the markets of Asia, where some countries are working
hard to overhaul the structures of their battered economies.
	   But a cut in U.S. lending rates could help bolster global
confidence by showing that the United States will continue to serve
as an economic engine for the rest of the world.
	   But whatever the outcome, Asian markets are always looking for
any kind of good news. Earlier this month, stocks also rose when
Greenspan first hinted at a pending interest rate cut.
	   In Japan, where the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
reached its lowest level in 12 years on Monday, it surged 379.31
points, or 2.75 percent, to 14,169.12 points at the end of the
morning session on Thursday.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 403.01 points, or 5.3
percent, to 7907.40 by midday.
	   And Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index jumped 33.82
points, or about 3.8 percent, to 934.81 at the mid-day break.
	   Despite the rallies in these and other Asian countries, Abhilit
Chakrabortti, a regional analyst for HSBC Securities Asia Ltd. in
Hong Kong, said the outlook in Asia remains pessimistic.
	   ``We've seen tens of thousands of these rebounds this year,'' he
said in an interview.
	   In addition to Greenspan's remark, Chakrabortti said, the Asian
markets are reacting to what could be diminishing prospects of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's impeachment, and hopes of ``concerted
efforts to get things in Latin American right.''
	   He said a substantial cut or a series of cuts in U.S. interest
rates could help Asian economies recover somewhat.
	   They would boost currency liquidity in the United States and in
turn increase Asia's much needed export trade and stabilize the
Asian currencies and interest rates, he said.

China-Taiwan air route announced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Charter flights between the southern coastal city
of Ningbo and Taiwan, via Macau, will begin on Oct. 11, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   The report said the Ningbo Eastern International Airline Tourist
Service Co. would lease jets from Macau Airlines to use on regular
flights on Tuesday and Saturday between Ningbo and the Taiwan
cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   The flights will take four hours and 40 minutes and passengers
will not be required to change planes in Macau, a Portuguese colony
on the southern coast of China, the report said.
	   The route through Macau is required because of an official ban
on direct communications, transportation and business links between
China and Taiwan, whose rival governments have remained estranged
since the Communists vanquished the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949.

Reports: Indianapolis to host Formula One race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The Indianapolis Motor Speedway is about to
complete a deal to host a Formula One race as early as September
2000, according to published reports.
	   The Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Formula One officials have
an oral agreement for the track to stage a new U.S. Grand Prix in
September 2000, The Indianapolis Star, citing a source familiar
with the negotiations, said in a story for Thursday's editions. The
newspaper said a formal announcement could come as early as next
week.
	   Indianapolis television station WTHR reported Wednesday that the
deal has been completed but not signed. The Speedway has drafted
news releases that are being reviewed by Tony George, the Speedway
president, and Bernie Ecclestone, president of Formula One
Administration Ltd., The Star quoted sources as saying.
	   Speedway spokesman Fred Nation, who in recent months has
expressed optimism that the deal would come through, denied
Wednesday that one was imminent.
	   ``We can't say this is going to happen,'' he said. ``There are
no press releases, not even the start to that. I'm telling you we
do not have anything that firm,'' he told The Star.
	   Jeff Belskus, the Speedway's executive vice president, also
denied there is an oral agreement.
	   ``Of course, Tony George has been interested in this for quite a
while,'' he told the newspaper.
	   The deal would call for the Speedway to put up dlrs 10 million
to host the race and spend dlrs 15 million to build a road course
in and around the existing track, WTHR reported.
	   Installing the necessary 24 pit-side garages would require
removing a portion of the grandstand behind the existing pit row.
	   The Formula One racing course itself would be a 2.5-mile
(4-kilometer) stretch that would include the first and second turns
at the track, most of the front straightaway and a significant
portion of the infield, though not at the expense of its golf
course.
	   Formula One, which has an international following, has not raced
in the United States since 1991.
	   George, founder and president of the Indianapolis Racing League,
has long sought to establish Formula One racing at his track.
	   Indianapolis' bid for Formula One received a boost this month
when its main rival, Las Vegas, dropped out. A group trying to
attract Formula One failed to get political support for a plan to
develop a site near the Las Vegas Strip.
	   Other cities, including San Francisco, Atlanta and Dallas, also
courted Ecclestone. But none appears to have the resources that
George is willing to spend.

Prime Minister stands by criticism of Malaysia's Mahathir
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Howard standing by criticism, deputy prime
minister refusing to attack Mahathir &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on
Thursday refused to back down from his criticism of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad over the sacking and arrest of former
deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett and Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer refused to endorse Howard's views, which led
to an official complaint from the Malaysian government.
	   Kennett, the most outspoken conservative in the nation after
Howard, said he would not comment on Howard's statement that
Malaysia was moving to a more ``authoritarian approach'' following
Anwar's arrest, but indicated he held a different view.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday that
Howard was ``wrong, absolutely'' and should ``check the real
facts'' before making accusations.
	   Howard added Thursday, ``I don't at this stage have anything to
add but I certainly don't withdraw those remarks. I thought they
were measured, they were moderate, and they were entirely
appropriate.''
	   ``I'm not going to enter into that,'' Kennett told reporters.
	   ``I have my own views, and we've all got to recognize we live in
different sovereign states and different sovereign countries and no
two countries are entirely the same,'' he said.
	   His comments come just one week after he slammed The Age
newspaper for ``intolerance and lack of understanding'' after it
criticized Mahathir in an editorial, saying Australians should not
judge Malaysia too harshly.
	   ``Malaysia is trying to adjust and I don't think we should be
too harsh on them for the measures they have taken,'' Kennett said
after returning from a trip to Malaysia and Indonesia, where he met
both Mahathir and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie.
	   It was ``dangerous'' to judge other countries by Australian
standards and Australia should not dictate to its neighbors if it
valued its trade and diplomatic relationships, he said.
	   The Malaysian government on Wednesday handed a letter of protest
to Australian High Commissioner Robert Cotton over the comments by
Howard, and others from Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer and
former foreign minister Gareth Evans.
	   Howard's deputy prime minister, Tim Fischer, was asked Thursday
by a reporter if Mahathir is the wrong man in the wrong place at
the wrong time, with an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
summit coming up in November in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``I do not agree,'' Fischer said. ``And I wish Malaysia well and
Prime Minister Mahathir well in the roles they have to play for the
meetings scheduled for November.''

Rafter plays Ogorodov to open qualifying match

 &UR; EDs: restores first name of Stoltenberg in 3rd graf, adds quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ Two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter will open Australia's Davis Cup World Group qualifying
tennis match against Uzbekistan on Friday against Oleg Ogorodov.
	   Ogorodov beat Rafter at the Beijing Open in 1996 and the
powerful baseliner, although ranked in the 200s, will provide a
challenge for Rafter in his first match since winning at New York.
	   Following Thursday's draw, Jason Stoltenberg will take on
Uzbekistan's top-ranked player Vadim Koutsenko in the second
singles.
	   In the doubles on Saturday, Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde
will play Ogorodov and Dmitri Tomashevich, with the reverse singles
on Sunday on the Townsville Entertainment Center medium-fast hard
court.
	   Uzbekistan captain Genrich Dashevsky said his team would rely on
its baseline power on the indoor court _ just the third time
Australia has ventured away from grass at home in Davis Cup.
	   ``Pat Rafter and the other Australians are very good
serve-volley exponents, but our players have powerful
groundstrokes,'' he said.
	   ``If the Aussies come to the net they will have to contend with
our passing shots. If we lose, the fans at home will forgive us,
but if we happen to win, we will be princes in our country when we
return.''

Australian leader defends monopoly wheat-selling practices

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Trade Minister Tim Fischer strongly
backed Australia's controversial monopoly wheat and sugar selling
arrangements Thursday, describing them as ``legitimate weaponry.''
	   Fischer, who leads the rural-based National Party, the junior
partner in the conservative coalition government of Prime Minister
John Howard, was releasing the government's trade policies for Oct.
3 elections.
	   U.S. trade negotiators have sharply criticized the way Australia
sells its wheat and sugar overseas, saying it involves both unfair
government assistance and monopoly practices.
	   Fischer did not deny either charge, but said the present
arrangements, which his party strongly supports, are not only
legitimate but also help customers.
	   ``It's a legitimate piece of weaponry at the point of export,''
he said.
	   All Australian wheat sold overseas must be marketed by the
Australian Wheat Board.
	   Similar arrangements apply for sugar sold from the Australian
state of Queensland.

Taiwan and China plan breakthrough visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Rivals Taiwan and China cemented plans Thursday
for a mainland visit by a top Taiwanese negotiator that both sides
hope will break a three-year stalemate in ties.
	   After a day of talks and a working banquet, negotiators for the
estranged rivals agreed by early Thursday that Taiwan's Koo Chen-fu
will first travel to Shanghai next month to see his counterpart,
Wang Daohan.
	   Koo will then go to Beijing and meet with President Jiang Zemin,
Vice Premier Qian Qichen and Chen Yunlin, director of the
government's Taiwan Affairs Office _ a schedule that shows the
importance Chinese leaders attach to the visit.
	   Koo and Wang, elder statesmen charged with trying to forge
relations between the rival governments, have not met since their
first talks in Singapore in 1993. Plans were under way for a second
meeting in 1995 when China shut down negotiations in anger over
what it perceived as Taiwan's drift away from the goal of
reunification.
	   In an indication of the sensitivities in bringing the sides
together, Koo's Oct. 14-19 trip to China is being characterized as
a visit with opportunities to chat _ something less than formal
talks.
	   Still, negotiators for both sides appeared satisfied with the
results of Wednesday's meetings.
	   Before flying back to Taipei, Shi Hwei-yow, secretary-general of
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, visited the office of his
counterpart, Tang Shubei, for a private conversation Thursday
morning. The two parted smiling and waving in farewell.
	   Major differences remained. Beijing insists that formal talks
begin with political discussions about reunification. Taipei wants
to start with practical issues such as fishing disputes. By not
labeling next month's meeting as talks, the issue may be skirted
for the time being.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters outside Tang's office, Shi said
``more cooperation'' was needed to settle the matter.
	   Tang, vice director of China's Association for Relations Across
the Straits, reiterated the need for political talks, but added:
``We still hope everyone can find a method to pursue cross-strait
relations.''
	   Tang also said he hoped Koo's visit would help bring the two
government-backed organizations closer and promote overall
relations.
	   China and Taiwan are heirs to the combatants in an unresolved
civil war that began seven decades ago. The two sides separated but
vowed to reunite after Mao Tse-tung's communists forced Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists from the mainland in 1949.
	   In Taiwan, Chang Jung-kung, a mainland expert in the ruling
Nationalist Party, said the smoothness of the Beijing talks shows
the two sides may be ready to ease tensions.
	   He added that the plan for Koo to meet with President Jiang
indicates China is willing to deal with Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, despite past grudges.
	   Beijing was infuriated when Lee visited the United States in
1995, reading the trip as an indication of a drift toward
independence. In response, China launched test missiles and held
war games around Taiwan.

Australian Broadcasting Corp. news silenced in election protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Union staffers at the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. walked off the job Thursday, silencing news and
normal broadcasts, after its chairman endorsed Prime Minister John
Howard's re-election.
	   ABC Radio's noon news broadcast was intermittently interrupted
and eventually replaced by music as Community and Public Sector
Union (CPSU) staff walked out.
	   The Australian Broadcasting Corp., the national broadcaster, is
government funded but its charter calls for it to be independent of
politics.
	   But Howard, who is leading a campaign for re-election in the
Oct. 3 national election, and many conservatives have accused it of
being biased against them.
	   Paradoxically, three years ago, when Labor Prime Minister Paul
Keating was in office, he believed the ABC and other major media
opposed him and his administration.
	   ABC chairman Donald McDonald on Wednesday gave his close friend
Howard a a glowing endorsement at a luncheon:
	   ``He is a man of high courage, he has a transparent candor, he
is a proud man possessed of a true humility, he has balance, he has
always displayed grace under pressure,'' McDonald said.
	   ``He is quite without malice, he is unpracticed in derision, he
is a man acquainted with disappointment but blessed with a renewing
optimism. He is an absolute gentleman, a true patriot, a great
friend.''
	   CPSU spokeswoman Lisa Fowkes said members condemned the
chairman's statements and resolved to walk off the job for three
hours Thursday.
	   McDonald rejected a demand by the journalists' union to stand
down for the remainder of the election campaign because of his
comments.
	   Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance secretary Chris Warren
accused McDonald of bringing the ABC into disrepute.
	   ``When the chairman of the ABC, the public face of the ABC,
publicly identifies himself with one of the political parties in
that sort of manner it brings the entire ABC into discredit and
leaves it open to attack for political bias,'' Warren said.
	   However, Howard defended McDonald's remarks.
	   ``Of course I think it's acceptable for good friends to remain
good friends,'' he told reporters.

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Looting continued in the capital of this
mountain kingdom Thursday, but the pickings after two full days of
pillaging were growing slim.
	   Troops from South Africa and Botswana _ whose intervention
Tuesday against a mutiny by Lesotho troops sparked the looting and
arson spree _ played a cat-and-mouse game with the looters.
	   When an armored personnel carrier rumbled up to a hardware store
soon after dawn, dozens of looters tumbled out, dropping tools and
other goods. One man, carrying a load of pickaxe heads, walked away
and refused to drop his booty. He did after a soldier pointed an
assault rifle at him.
	   When the troops left, the looting continued.
	   But, unlike the previous two days, there was no gunfire in
Maseru early Thursday, a sign that the chaotic situation may be
settling down. And on the city's outskirts _ also unlike previous
days _ no boom of artillery or other shooting was audible.
	   Some shops in the almost completely gutted business district
continued to smoulder Thursday.
	   Smoke plumes towered over the city late Wednesday from arson
fires that had been burning since 600 South African soldiers
crossed the border Tuesday. Some 200 soldiers from Botswana joined
the intervention force Wednesday.

Fed chairman forsees Sammy's breakout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan is
known for his skill as an economic forecaster, not his prescience
in predicting sports.
	   On Wednesday, he may have demonstrated uncanny baseball
clairvoyance. As a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee was about
to begin, reporters asked Greenspan if he'd like to stop by the
press table first.
	   He almost never says a word to reporters, not even ``Hello,''
lest it be misinterpreted as a signal for the stock market. But
this time, after due consideration, he told them, ``I seriously
question whether Sammy Sosa is correct in conceding he will not
win.''
	   It was a reference to Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa, who on
Tuesday said he thought St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark
McGwire ``will finish a little bit higher'' in their
record-breaking home run race. Sosa had gone 0-21 and trailed
McGwire 65-63 in the race to hit the most home runs in a season in
major league history.
	   Ninety minutes after Greenspan spoke, Sosa hit his 64th homer in
the fifth inning against Milwaukee. In the sixth inning, he bounced
his 65th off the center-field bleachers, tying McGwire.

Angry farmers demand agrarian reform, return of Suharto ranch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Irate farmers, demonstrating outside
Parliament on Thursday, called for agrarian reform while others in
a nearby city demanded the return of land allegedly seized by
former President Suharto two decades ago.
	   About 300 farmers and students assembled outside the gates of
the legislature on National Farmers' Day as about 100 riot police
looked on.
	   Many farmers are among the worst hit by a deep economic crisis
now gripping the world's fourth most populous nation.
	   The protesters said they wanted soaring prices to be controlled
and liberalization of land ownership.
	   Meanwhile in Bogor, 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of Jakarta,
about 20 police officers, equipped with tear gas canisters and
sticks were on hand when 200 farmers staged a peaceful protest at a
local government office.
	   ``Return the people's land looted by Suharto,'' read one protest
banner.
	   The group, calling itself ``Indonesian Farmers' Solidarity,''
alleges that 450 hectares (1,110 acres) of Suharto's 700-hectare
(1,730-acre) Tri-S Tapos ranch rightfully belongs to them.
	   They claim Suharto, who quit the presidency after riots in May,
seized the land illegally in the 1970s.
	   Farmers around the ranch said they had cultivated the land for
many years before they were pushed out.
	   The ranch sits in lush, hilly country and is considered one of
Indonesia's foremost cattle breeding and producing ranches.
	   Several months ago some farmers moved into the land and planted
crops but were later ordered out by police.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hurricane Georges
killed 70 people in the Dominican Republic and left hundreds
missing before sweeping over Cuba and threatening the Florida Keys.
In all, more than 110 people were killed in the storm's three-day
rampage through the Caribbean.
	   South Florida was put under a hurricane watch, and faced an
expected hurricane warning later Thursday. Gov. Lawton Chiles
declared a state of emergency in central and southern Florida,
allowing the state to use the National Guard, lift tolls along
evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   Tropical force winds could reach the Florida Keys and extreme
south Florida by late Thursday, the National Hurricane Center in
Miami said.
	   Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez, in a televised
address to the nation Wednesday night, confirmed the 70 dead and
the missing, including 45 who disappeared when a school being used
as a shelter washed away Wednesday.
	   He said more than half the power grid in the Dominican Republic
was destroyed by Georges' 110-mph (176-kph) winds at a cost of dlrs
111 million. Seventy percent of the country's bridges were damaged
or destroyed, and 90 percent of its banana and other plantations
were flattened.
	   Fernandez asked for unity in reconstruction efforts and urged
residents ``to pray and ask the Almighty to help the destiny of our
people.''
	   ``We have a titanic task ahead of us,'' he declared.
	   Georges pounded the Dominican Republic on Tuesday after
barreling through Puerto Rico. It struck Haiti on Wednesday, where
27 were reported killed, before moving on to Cuba and threatening
southern Florida.
	   Hurricane watches were in effect for the northwestern Bahamas
and parts of Florida. The Cayman Islands issued tropical storm
warnings for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and heavy rains were
expected in Jamaica.
	   All 80,000 people in the Florida Keys, an exposed chain of
islands that extend 120 miles (190 kilometers) southwest of the
mainland, were ordered to begin evacuating Wednesday. Cars, trucks
and sport utility vehicles streamed along the two-lane highway to
the Florida mainland.
	   At 2 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT) Thursday, Georges was centered 80 miles
(128 kilometers) northwest of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It was moving
west-northwest at 12 mph (19 kph) with 75 mph (120 kph) winds, down
from 110 mph (176 kph) when the storm swept over Puerto Rico and
the Dominican Republic.
	   In the Dominican town of San Cristobal, the Nizao River
overflowed and knocked down a part of a school used as a shelter,
leaving five dead and dozens missing.
	   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to their roofs in
fetid water. Residents swam out to their houses to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty gallon water jugs tied to their arms
to keep afloat.
	   Looters in Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, waded
waist-deep in water, balancing televisions and air conditioners on
their heads Tuesday as the fierce winds toppled trees and crushed
houses. Bands of youths with machetes and pistols roamed the
streets, many of them drunk. Two of the dead were looters shot by
police.
	   From the Dominican Republic, Georges proceeded Tuesday night to
Haiti, unleashing flash floods upon the flimsy housing found in the
Western Hemisphere's poorest nation.
	   Most of the deaths in Haiti reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there
were no public shelters. Four drowned in a suburb Wednesday
afternoon. Deaths also were reported in Gonaives and in the
northern town of Marmelade.
	   In Cuba, President Fidel Castro put his Cabinet on alert
Wednesday and said the armed forces would help get medicine, food
and other help to hurricane victims. Authorities evacuated 200,000
people from their homes in Cuba's eastern provinces.
	   Hurricane warnings were declared from Cuba's Sancti Spiritus
province eastward and in the central and southern Bahamas.
	   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity,''
Mexico's official Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying.
	   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the
government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in
Antigua.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent
hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and
utilities. On the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a
man while burglarizing his home. There were no other fatalities,
	   Three people were killed directly by the storm in Puerto Rico,
where the government's insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia,
estimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. Another eight, most of them
elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the
storm.
	   Reconstruction efforts were under way Wednesday in Puerto Rican
communities like Loiza, where many wooden homes with zinc roofs
were either crushed or washed away.
	   ``My sister's house is all gone. And that used to be my uncle's
house,'' said Luis Manso, pointing to a pile of debris as he
struggled to repair his own shattered fruit and vegetable stand
``before the thieves come.''
	   The Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that a third of
Puerto Rico's power was expected back Wednesday, but 715,000
remained without running water. Coffee and plantain crops were also
badly damaged, FEMA said.

Japanese stocks finish sharply higher, dollar rises

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished sharply higher
Thursday on expectations that a possible cut in U.S. interest rates
will favorably affect global markets. The U.S. dollar rose against
the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 415.97
points, or 3.02 percent, closing the day at 14,205.78 points. On
Tuesday, the index gained 192.51 points, or 1.42 percent.
	   The dollar bought 136.80 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.66
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 135.75 yen overnight.
	   Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Wednesday for a national
holiday.
	   Traders said stock prices opened higher Thursday as investors
were cheered by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's signal
that U.S. interest rates may be lowered.
	   Greenspan testified Wednesday before the Senate Budget Committee
that Fed policymakers are fully aware of the widening financial
crisis that has spread from Asia to the rest of the world.
	   That was the clearest indication yet that he will fight the
crisis with lower U.S. interest rates. The Fed's policymaking
committee meets next Tuesday.
	   Following the Fed chairman's comments, the Dow Jones industrial
average surged to 8,154 at Wednesday's close, its highest finish in
a month. More than half of the 257-point gain came during the final
hour of trading.
	   Among gainers in Tokyo were high technology issues, including
Sony and Hitachi, and bank stocks.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
first section was up 27.84 points, or 2.65 percent, to 1,078.01.
The TOPIX rose 2.38 points, or 0.23 percent, on Tuesday.
	   Though an interest rate cut usually hurts a nation's currency,
traders said the dollar gained as a Fed credit easing now would
support U.S. stock prices and stabilize Latin American markets,
thus bolster the U.S. currency's value.
	   Also supporting the dollar was lingering uncertainty over a
stalemate between Japan's ruling and opposition parties over bills
to rescue troubled financial institutions, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.885 percent from Wednesday's finish of
0.900 percent, driving its price to 108.19 yen from the previous
day's 108.04 yen.

Philippine Airlines winds up business after shutdown

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Debt-laden Philippine Airlines began
winding up its business Thursday, as the government struggled to
fill the void in air services its closure would leave.
	   Asia's oldest airline closed at midnight Wednesday after
last-minute negotiations failed to persuade its largest union to
accept a recovery plan.
	   Jaime Bautista, PAL's chief finance officer, said the airline
would begin to work on a plan to dispose assets and pay off
creditors and more than 8,000 employees.
	   ``It'll take time, it will be a long process,'' he told
reporters.
	   Many PAL employees reported for work Thursday to retrieve
personal belongings and help PAL shut down its operations, an
airline spokesman said. Notices would shortly be issued, explaining
how and when separation benefits would be given.
	   The closure of PAL leaves many areas of the 7,000-island
archipelago without air service. Two smaller carriers were grounded
last week over safety concerns and financial problems.
	   PAL officials had threatened to close the company unless workers
accepted their rescue plan, which they said was crucial to the
airline's recovery from a series of crippling strikes and Asia's
currency crisis.
	   PAL is the largest Philippine company to fail since Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching a dlrs
4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   Its closure will have minimal impact on the economy, Finance
Secretary Eduardo Espiritu said, adding the government could rely
on government-owned aircraft and air force planes to move vital
cargo like cash, documents, medicine.
	   President Joseph Estrada said the government will be able to
have 11 aircraft servicing some routes to be left by PAL in three
days.
	   Central Bank Gov. Gabriel Singson, a PAL director, said the
airline owes about dlrs 2.1 billion to foreign and local creditors,
but they could still not collect because of a temporary prohibition
imposed by Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The SEC was attempting to rehabilitate the financially troubled
carrier until it shut down.
	   Philippine officials said they were meeting with owners of local
domestic airlines to help the carriers immediately expand their
fleet and ease the void in air services left by PAL. The airline
had a 50 percent share of domestic passenger traffic, down from 75
percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   Cebu Pacific Air general manager Diego Garrido said his company
has increased its daily domestic flights to almost 50 from 38 to
take up the slack left by PAL.
	   The other alternatives for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila, killing at
least 46 people.
	   Hours before its scheduled midnight closure, PAL resumed talks
with its ground workers' union. But after several hours of
negotiations, PAL said it could not accept the union's conditions.
	   ``It is unfortunate that no agreement was reached,'' said PAL
executive vice president Manolo Aquino. ``Therefore it is with a
sad note that we announce the closure of Philippine Airlines.''
	   PAL's demise saddened many Filipinos. Several television
stations broadcast poignant scenes Wednesday from its 57-year
history. At PAL offices around the country, airline workers held
masses and prayer rallies, hoping for a way to avoid the flag
carrier's closure.
	   PAL was founded on Feb. 26, 1941, by a group of businessmen who
wanted to profit from a gold mining boom in the northern
Philippines. The first flight carried five passengers from Manila
to the northern mountain city of Baguio.
	   In July 1946, four chartered PAL planes took American servicemen
home from the Philippines, making PAL the first Asian airline to
cross the Pacific.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with looting continuing Thursday, no gunfire &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ After suppressing mutinous Lesotho troops
in the capital of this mountain kingdom, soldiers from South Africa
and Botswana on Thursday moved to quell an outbreak of looting.
	   The South African and Botswanan troops _ whose intervention
Tuesday to thwart a mutiny by Lesotho troops sparked the looting
and arson spree _ played a cat-and-mouse with the looters.
	   When an armored personnel carrier rumbled up to a hardware store
shortly after dawn, dozens of looters tumbled out of the shop,
dropping tools and other goods. One man, carrying a load of pickaxe
heads, walked away and refused to drop his booty. He finally did so
after a soldier pointed an assault rifle at him.
	   But when the troops left, the looting continued.
	   Unlike the previous two days, there was no gunfire in Maseru
early Thursday, a sign that the chaotic situation may be settling
down. And on the city's outskirts _ also unlike previous days _ no
boom of artillery or other shooting could be heard.
	   Some shops in the almost completely gutted business district
continued to smolder Thursday.
	   Smoke plumes towered over the city late Wednesday from arson
fires that had been burning since 600 South African soldiers
crossed the border Tuesday. Some 200 soldiers from Botswana joined
the intervention force Wednesday.
	   Outside Maseru, the boom of artillery and the rattle of gunfire
echoed through the hills Wednesday as intervention forces tried to
snuff out resistance at a military barracks and other key areas.
	   South African troops distributed fliers telling the 2 million
people of Lesotho (pronounced le-SOO-too) the intervention was
aimed at preventing ``anarchy'' and at creating ``a stable
environment for law and order.''
	   But facing stiff resistance that killed at least eight South
African soldiers, the intervention force announced Wednesday the
peacekeepers would use heavier weapons and would shoot to kill.
	   Seventeen more South Africans were wounded in the combat _ South
Africa's first military intervention since the end of apartheid.
President Nelson Mandela said 58 Lesotho rebels had been killed.
	   The military also said 170 mutinous Lesotho soldiers had been
captured.
	   South African military officials in Pretoria warned in a
statement Wednesday that their men would now use more firepower to
suppress the Lesotho mutineers.
	   ``Where the peace forces started out by being circumspect in
clashes, they will now shoot to kill,'' a military spokesman told
the South African Press Association.
	   ``All we know is they are shooting at us, and we are fighting
back,'' South African army spokesman Maj. Ben van Zyl said, adding
that he didn't know if the resistance came only from the mutineers
or if they had been joined by loyalist Lesotho soldiers.
	   Lesotho's government requested the intervention two weeks ago
amid a revolt by junior Lesotho military officers and strikes that
paralyzed Maseru. The mutineers had apparently sided with
opposition parties that claimed elections last May _ swept by the
ruling Lesotho Congress Party _ were rigged.
	   South African officials have stressed the intervention came
under the authority of the Southern African Development Community.
	   ``South Africa and the other SADC countries have no alternative
but to try restore order,'' Mandela said, adding negotiations with
the mutineers had failed.
	   An opposition leader, Molap Qhobela of the Basotholand Congress
Party, predicted the intervention would solve nothing.
	   ``The (South Africans) are an invading army of aggression,''
Qholeba told reporters. ``As soon as they go we are back to square
one.''
	   The South African army said eight soldiers had been killed by
Wednesday. But a senior commander and other South African soldiers
said 10 had been killed in one battle alone Tuesday at the
Makonyane barracks, northeast of Maseru.
	   Some 900 people, mostly Asians, have reportedly crossed the
border and sought asylum in neighboring South Africa. Chinese and
Indian merchants were particular targets of the looters.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A bomb exploded at a Jerusalem bus stop during
morning rush hour Thursday, wrecking the station's shelter and
injuring an Israeli soldier.
	   The explosive device, weighing about one kilo (two pounds) and
possibly triggered by a timer, went off at about 8 a.m. (0600 gmt)
near the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
	   Police sealed the area, which is adjacent to the West Bank.
Officers conducted searches, backed by helicopters. The bomb squad
also combed the scene for other bombs.
	   A white car with Palestinian license plates was seen leaving the
scene and was stopped at a nearby Israeli army roadblock, said
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby. It was not immediately
clear whether the driver was detained for questioning.
	   A soldier sitting at the bus stop was lightly hurt in the head
when the bomb went off, said Ben-Ruby. The shelter was badly
damaged.
	   Israel has been on high alert for the past two weeks following
renewed threats by the Islamic militant group Hamas to carry out
attacks in Israel. Hamas wants to avenge the Sept. 11 killing of
the group's two top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   However, Hamas' trademark have been deadly suicide bombings
carried out in crowded downtown areas or on buses. Thursday's bomb
was relatively small and the bus stop was located in an outlying
neighborhood of Jerusalem.

Sports complex may not be ready for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With the Asian Games fast approaching,
the organizers announced Thursday that one of the major sports
complexes may not be finished and alternate sites for events may
have to be found.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who chairs the Bangkok
Asian Games Organizing Committee, said he was concerned that
liquidity problems of the main contractor may prevent the company
from finishing the Muang Thong Thani complex in time for the Dec.
6-20 games.
	   A statement from the committee said plans had called for seven
sports to be staged at the complex, which is about 80 percent
completed. A decision on whether to move some of the sports
elsewhere is to be decided Friday.
	   Bhichai was quoted in the Bangkok Post on Thursday as saying the
company, Bangkok Land, still needed 50 million baht (dlrs 1.22
million) to complete an expressway ramp leading to its sports
facilities.
	   ``I have no idea how to help,'' Bhichai was quoted as saying.
	   He also noted that the installation of communications facilities
at the complex would have to start by Oct. 1 and would take at
least two months to be completed.
	   Controversy surrounded the government's 1995 decision to award
the contract to Bangkok Land. Critics said it was an attempt to
bail out the property developer's failed housing estate, and
competing bidders alleged corruption.
	   Preparation for the games have been plagued by other problems
including political interference by previous governments, alleged
corruption and outright incompetence.
	   The body governing the Games threatened several times to award
Asia's version of the Olympics to other countries, but the Thais
argued that all would be ready by opening day.
	   The Bangkok games are expected to attract more than 10,000
athletes from 43 nations.

South Korea draws tight budget amid economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government unveiled an 85.79
trillion won (dlrs 61.25) budget proposal Thursday that calls for
sharp increases in welfare spending to combat soaring unemployment.
	   For the second straight year, the government predicted spending
would far exceed tax revenues. The 1999 proposal requires a 13.5
trillion won (dlrs 9.6 billion) bond offering to make up the
difference.
	   The plan calls for spending increases of 6.2 percent over this
year's budget, well below the average 14 percent annual budget
increases since 1990.
	   The budget will be submitted next week to the National Assembly,
where it is expected to be approved with little change by a
majority of lawmakers loyal to President Kim Dae-jung's ruling
coalition.
	   In 1998, the government issued bonds worth 7.9 trillion won
(dlrs 5.6 billion) to meet its budget of 80.78 trillion won (dlrs
57.7 billion). It was the first budget deficit since 1983.
	   Government officials said spending increases next year have to
be kept to a minimum because of the deepening economic crisis
gripping the country.
	   ``Many companies have gone bankrupt and surviving companies,
too, are making much less money, paying much less tax,'' said Chun
Jung-young, a spokesman for the Office of National Budget.
	   For the first time, defense spending was trimmed by 0.4 percent
to 13.74 trillion won (dlrs 9.81 billion). South Korea has boosted
its military spending by an average 11 percent annually since 1990.
	   Spending on education, another priority in past years, also was
cut by 5.1 percent to 16.59 trillion won (dlrs 11.85 billion).
	   But the 1999 budget calls for a drastic increase in funds for
social safety nets for jobless people and restructuring the
nation's troubled financial sector.
	   The government plans to spend 8.23 trillion won (dlrs 5.88
billion) on welfare, up 45.3 percent from this year, and 7.78
trillion won (dlrs 5.56 billion) on financial restructuring, up 120
percent.
	   The unemployment rate has risen to a 32-year high of 7.6
percent, with 1.65 million people out of work, since the nation was
forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund to bail out its
economy last year.

Officers seize more than 30,000 pirated compact discs imported from

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong customs officials have seized more
than 30,000 pirated compact discs imported from Taiwan this week,
most of them copies of Japanese TV dramas, the government reported
Thursday.
	   The discs, worth 450,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 57,700),
were taken from two cargo consignments from Taiwan at the airport
in the past five days, a statement said.
	   Earlier this month, Japanese anti-piracy officials were in the
territory to negotiate with authorities on efforts to crack down on
piracy of Japanese TV drama series, which are widely popular in
Hong Kong.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed the territory on a watch list of
countries suspected of copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in Hong Kong. Copies of local or Hollywood
movies are widely available for under 40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5) _ sometimes before they're released in local cinemas.

Stories of miraculous survival in flood-ravaged southern Mexico

<TEXT>
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo toured
flood-ravaged southern Mexico for a sixth time, promising that one
of the country's poorest regions would not be ignored after the
emergency has eased.
	   The floods that began earlier this month killed 185 people in
the southern state of Chiapas, with 89 others still missing.
Catholic Church leaders estimated the final toll could rise over
400.
	   The impoverished region has also been caught in 4 1/2 years of
leftist rebellion and political violence.
	   ``Chiapas, for its conditions of poverty and inequality, will
continue to receive the highest priority from the federal
government,'' Zedillo said Wednesday.
	   Tens of thousands of people lost their homes in the storms and
the government has begun sending in construction materials for new
ones. The president said the government will also launch a program
to replace 247,100 acres (98,800 hectares) of crops destroyed by
the floods.
	   State officials have also pledged to relocate some communities
built too close to rivers.
	   In the tiny Chiapas community of Valdivia, just a few miles
(kilometers) from the Pacific coast, some houses remained buried to
their roofs under tons of rock and mud.
	   Rene Ramon's house in Valdivia was built near a river bed that
carried little or no water much of the year. The river roared to
life in early September after the coast was doused with nearly two
feet of rain.
	   ``I think there are a lot of people still buried in Valdivia,
because many were sleeping when the water came,'' the 13-year-old
boy said while recovering in a nearby hospital.
	   His leg became trapped among trees knocked down Sept. 8 by the
raging Novillero and Arenas rivers. ``I cried out to God ... I saw
several dead bodies float by,'' he said.
	   When Rene finally freed himself, he realized that he was
floating above the roofs of houses. A neighbor pulled the boy to
the roof of a two-story house.
	   When the waters had receded somewhat, Rene found his mother and
grandmother alive and well in another part of the village. Hours
later, he was evacuated by helicopter.
	   ``I cried when I saw them because I thought I'd never find them
again,'' Rene said. ``I don't want to go back to Valdivia.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The pilot of a Russian hot-air balloon died when
the craft came crashing down, and one of the parachutists who
jumped before the accident was missing, news reports said Thursday.
	   The ill-fated balloon lifted off Wednesday from St. Petersburg
with the pilot and four parachutists on board, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   The parachutists jumped as planned, and three landed safely on
the edge of a forest. The fourth was missing and a search for him
was under way.
	   Shortly after the jump, the balloon began falling rapidly and
slammed into the ground, killing its pilot.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished sharply higher
Thursday on expectations that a possible cut in U.S. interest rates
will boost global markets. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 415.97
points, or 3.02 percent, closing the day at 14,205.78 points. On
Tuesday, the index gained 192.51 points, or 1.42 percent.
	   The dollar bought 136.80 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.66
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 135.75 yen overnight.
	   Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Wednesday for a national
holiday.
	   Traders said stock prices opened higher Thursday as investors
were cheered by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's signal
that U.S. interest rates may be lowered.
	   Greenspan testified Wednesday before the Senate Budget Committee
that Fed policymakers are fully aware of the widening financial
crisis that has spread from Asia to the rest of the world.
	   That was the clearest indication yet that he will fight the
crisis with lower U.S. interest rates. The Fed's policymaking
committee meets next Tuesday.
	   Following the comments, the Dow Jones industrial average surged
to 8,154 at Wednesday's close, its highest finish in a month. More
than half of the 257-point gain came during the final hour of
trading.
	   Among gainers in Tokyo were high technology issues, including
Sony and Hitachi, and bank stocks.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
first section was up 27.84 points, or 2.65 percent, to 1,078.01.
The TOPIX rose 2.38 points, or 0.23 percent, on Tuesday.
	   Though an interest rate cut usually hurts a nation's currency,
traders said the dollar gained as a Fed credit easing now would
support U.S. stock prices and stabilize Latin American markets,
thus bolster the U.S. currency's value.
	   Also supporting the dollar was lingering uncertainty over a
stalemate between Japan's ruling and opposition parties over bills
to rescue troubled financial institutions, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.885 percent from Tuesday's finish of
0.900 percent, driving its price to 108.19 yen from the previous
day's 108.04 yen.

Colonial makes good on Asia search with Hong Kong acquisition of
</HEADLINE>
Guardian

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Insurance giant Colonial's CMG Asia
on Thursday bought the Hong Kong pension and life insurance
business of British group Guardian Assurance for 90 million Hong
Kong dollars.
	   The purchase brings to CMG Asia another 1.8 billion Hong Kong
dollars in funds under management, placing the merged business
fifth in the Hong Kong pensions administration sector with 5
percent of that market.
	   Guardian Assurance in Hong Kong primarily comprises pensions
administration, in addition to group and individual life, offering
CMG Asia significant scale.
	   CMG Asia managing director Alan Beanland said the Guardian
Assurance purchase demonstrated Colonial's commitment to Hong Kong,
increasing scale at a time of economic contraction.
	   CMG Asia expected to extract cost savings from the merged
business, particularly across its existing pensions administration
business in Hong Kong.
	   Colonial will fund the acquisition from its existing capital
resources.
	   Regulatory approval was still pending. In the interim, CMG Asia
will be involved in the management of the business, Beanland said.

China's central bank cuts staff by 28 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ As part of a sweeping overhaul of government
bureaucracy announced this spring, the central bank has slashed the
senior staff at its headquarters by 28 percent, a bank official
said Thursday.
	   The Beijing-based People's Bank of China reduced the number of
its departments and offices to 112 from 138 in August. Only 189
senior staff were reappointed to their positions _ a 28 percent
decline, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Those laid off can continue studies at universities or to attend
retraining programs, the official said.
	   The ambitious plan of cutting the bureaucracy by as much as half
was aimed at reducing government inefficiency and waste, and at
ending official interference in business. According to most
reports, the reform has progressed slowly due to resistance within
the bureaucracy.
	   The China Economic Times, a newspaper associated with the State
Council, or Cabinet, reported that the central bank acted to reduce
bureaucratic overlap.
	   Departments that supervised the domestic currency, foreign
currency, currency spots and non-currency spots, for example, have
been combined into a single department, while some others have been
eliminated.

China moves to prevent price wars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese companies that are engaging in price wars
to rid themselves of excess inventory must stop slashing prices or
risk punishment, a top government official was quoted by state
media as saying Thursday.
	   Falling prices for many products have eroded state company
profits, hurt government tax revenues and may threaten national
economic growth, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   ``Dumping increases state company losses, disrupts market order,
and must be stopped,'' Chen Bangzhu, state economic and trade
commission vice minister was quoted by Xinhua News Agency as
saying.
	   To stop sliding prices, the government has set price-control
guidelines on some products, including building materials,
machinery, metallurgical products, textiles and petrochemicals,
Xinhua said.
	   Companies that don't adhere to these guidelines will be
punished, the report said without elaborating.
	   Instead of slashing prices, industries having trouble selling
their inventories should cut production, the report said.
	   Many of China's state enterprises, unable to compete in a market
economy, have seen their profits shrink due to overcapacity, weak
demand and overall inefficiency. Nearly half of China's state
companies are unprofitable.

Russian inflation up 67 percent since August crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian prices have soared 67 percent since the
country's economic crisis hit in mid-August, and most of the
increase is linked to the collapse of the currency, the government
said Thursday.
	   Before the crisis, prices were increasing at less than 1 percent
a month and the Russian ruble was holding steady at a little over
six to the U.S. dollar.
	   But the embattled ruble is now trading at around 15 to the
dollar, which means that Russia's many imports are now two or three
times more expensive than they were.
	   Prices have been increasing almost daily over the past five
weeks, and are up 67 percent since the crisis began, the Interfax
news agency quoted the State Statistics Committee as saying. The
figure includes prices hikes of 45 percent during the first three
weeks of September.
	   The ruble has strengthened a bit in the past few days, but it
remains highly unstable.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has yet to
unveil an economic plan for dealing with the crisis. Primakov has
spoken only in general terms, saying he plans to continue with
economic reforms, but pledging a larger state role in regulating
the economy.

Prosecutors vow to press rape cases against Mexico City policemen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The case against several police officers
charged with kidnapping and raping three teen-age girls will not be
weakened by apparent contradictions in the girls' testimony,
prosecutors said.
	   Lawyers for the officers had told local media the officers were
likely to be released soon because of conflicting testimony
presented by the three girls, aged 13 to 18, and one girl's
reported retraction of her account.
	   But the Mexico City Attorney General's Office dismissed that
claim on Wednesday, saying physical evidence exists which supports
the girls' claims that they were held in a police stable for three
days and were sexually attacked by some officers there.
	   ``There is no reason at all to anticipate the release of those
charged,'' spokesperson Susana Manterola told a news conference.
	   ``The 'retraction' of one of the minors, and the possible
contradictions of another of the victims, does not diminish the
probative value of the statements made by the victims,'' she said.
	   At least nine policemen were charged in July with luring the
three teen-age girls into a squad car, holding them as prisoners at
a police facility and raping the two younger women.
	   The prosecution's evidence includes physicians' testimony _
indicating that one of the girls suffered a ``violent
penetration,'' while the upper thighs of another were severely
bruised _ and extensive physical evidence, Manterola said.
	   DNA tests of the semen and pubic hair collected where the rapes
allegedly took place confirmed they belonged to three of the
charged policemen, she said.
	   In a capital where some of the most feared criminals wear
uniforms, the kidnapping and rape of the three teen-age girls by
Mexico City police has horrified even the most jaded observers.
	   Prosecutors say the policemen in the city's southern Tlahuac
borough lured the girls by offering them a ride and instead drove
them to a stable for police horses. The 18-year-old escaped by
hiding in a horse stall; the younger girls were found later,
wandering half-naked on a street, almost incoherent.
	   The accused officers face charges of rape and sexual abuse,
kidnapping and abuse of authority, crimes punishable by up to 67
years in prison.
	   Public outrage over the incident, known as the Tlahuac case, is
considered one of the causes that led to the resignation of the
capital's former Police Chief Rodolfo Debernardi last month.
	   Mexican police have little education or training, and get paid
very little: in Mexico City, salaries are the equivalent of about
dlrs 300 a month.

Defense begins for man accused of stalking Miller
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NORMAN, Oklahoma (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Shannon Miller
says an accused stalker bothered her so much she was reduced to
tears.
	   ``I was just trying to let itself burn out,'' she said
Wednesday. ``None of it seemed to work. It just grew and grew until
finally I burst into tears.''
	   Miller testified during trial for Joseph Whitney Vogt, 25. Vogt
is accused of a misdemeanor count of stalking Miller on the
University of Oklahoma campus and at her Norman apartment.
	   Vogt, originally of Connecticut, was arrested Feb. 23 on the OU
campus. Miller, an OU student, said at the time Vogt had been
stalking her for more than a month.
	   Miller said that by the third week of class, ``the amount of
time he was trying to spend with me was increasing.'' She said Vogt
would park in front of her apartment, follow her from classes, call
on the phone and make uninvited visits.
	   ``He didn't seem like a fan at the time because he never
mentioned anything about gymnastics,'' Miller said.
	   In March, a judge granted a request for permanent victim
protective orders for both Miller and her boyfriend, Chris
Phillips.
	   ``I was afraid he wanted to hurt me or even kill me,'' Phillips
testified. ``Obviously he didn't like me.''
	   Witnesses were expected to testify for the defense Thursday.

Walkouts affect air traffic, teachers, anesthesiologists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France pilots and Paris airport workers staged
a partial strike Thursday, causing some cancellations and delays.
	   Pilots with three smaller unions protesting salaries, schedules
and working conditions began a two-day strike Thursday to press
their demands.
	   All of Air France's long-haul international flights were
running. But the airline canceled 20 percent of its medium-range
flights out of Charles de Gaulle Airport and 10 percent of them
from Orly outside Paris, said company spokeswoman Fabienne de
Brebisson.
	   At Orly, meanwhile, unions for the airport's 3,900 personnel
called a strike from 7 a.m. to noon (0500 to 1000 GMT) Thursday.
	   A portion of the airport's 100 firefighters joined the walkout,
forcing officials to close one of the airport's two runways, said
Jacques Reder, spokesman for the airport authority, Aeroports de
Paris.
	   The runway shutdown caused delays of up to 30 minutes, he said.
	   Unions called the strike to pressure the Transport Ministry over
plans to shift some flights from Orly, the smaller airport south of
Paris, to Charles de Gaulle, north of the capital.
	   Reder said the plan was under negotiation and expected to be
finalized by the end of the year.
	   French teachers held a one-day strike Thursday, the second in a
week, over plans to reform the school system and on overtime rules.
Last week's walkout drew only a small percentage of teachers.
	   Three unions for anesthesiologists called a strike Thursday and
Friday, affecting only non-emergency surgery, to protest work
schedules and a lack of funding.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has sought to hold the
line on spending to keep France's budget deficit within 3 percent
of the gross domestic product, as required by the euro single
currency that takes effect at the end of the year.

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ A rocket exploded near the motorcade
of Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Thursday, leaving him unharmed but
killing a young boy, police said.
	   Hun Sen immediately blamed the opposition for the attack.
	   The rocket _ apparently detonated by remote control _ exploded
near Hun Sen's convoy as he was going to attend ceremonies marking
the opening of the new session of parliament, police said.
	   A 12-year-old boy was killed by the explosion and three members
of his family seriously injured, according to a local hospital.
	   The incident, described by police and government officials as an
assassination attempt, did not delay the swearing-in of the 122
members of parliament at the historic 12th-century Angkor Wat
temple.
	   Hun Sen linked the blast to another violent incident earlier
this month. He offered a dlrs 200,000 reward to the attackers if
they would name their ringleader, and warned of retribution.
	   ` I think if the opposition leaders do not instruct their forces
to stop activities which threaten my life, they would die with the
most severe suffering,'' Hun Sen told reporters. ``For a snake, if
we don't hit it on the head, it can still move and bite back, so we
must hit it on the head, not its tail.''
	   Previous alleged attempts on Hun Sen's life have served as
excuses to harass or arrest his opponents.
	   Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said
that they knew nothing about Thursday's attack.
	   ``All acts or kinds of violence have to be clearly condemned,''
Ranariddh said after the swearing-in ceremony.
	   Cambodian politics have been in upheaval since last year, when
Hun Sen deposed his co-premiers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
violent coup d'etat.
	   An election held this past July was supposed to restore
stability, but heightened tensions instead after the opposition
accused Hun Sen of winning through fraud and intimidation.
	   Hun Sen's national police chief, Hok Lundy, also blamed the
opposition FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy parties for Thursday's
incident.
	   He said eight people were being detained for questioning, but
that none of them had been declared suspects.
	   Government authorities have not produced any evidence linking
the opposition to the attack, and presented slightly contradictory
accounts of its circumstances.
	   Hun Sen was en route to the king's residence in this
northwestern town when a B-40 rocket exploded on the side of the
road just as his car had passed by, said deputy local police
commander Col. Than Chay.
	   The car carrying Hun Sen was less than 10 meters (33 feet) away
when the explosion occurred, he said.
	   Hun Sen's spokesman Prak Sokhon said a bodyguard riding with Hun
Sen reported that the rocket flew across the road a few feet
(meters) in front of their four-wheel-drive vehicle.
	   Hun Sen himself, however, speaking to reporters later, said the
explosion occurred after his car had passed. Several other sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the assertion.
	   Police said three unexploded rockets were found by the road,
parts of what appeared to be a remote-control booby trap. They
showed what they said were parts of it to reporters at Hun Sen's
hotel.
	   In a battery pack was a cryptic note that read in both English
and Cambodian: ``The King Bee will eliminate all the nation's
dictators gradually. Today the main nation's dictator must be
finished.''
	   Security has been very high for Hun Sen during his stay here,
with dozens of soldiers from his military bodyguard unit guarding
his entourage and their vehicles around the clock since he arrived
on Monday. There is an armored personnel carrier parked at the
hotel where he is staying.
	   Hun Sen left after the swearing-in ceremony by helicopter and
was expected to fly back to Phnom Penh later Thursday.
	   On Sept. 7, a grenade was tossed at Hun Sen's residence in the
capital of Phnom Penh, but he was not home. No one was injured and
little damage was done.
	   The opposition charged that Hun Sen staged the incident to have
an excuse to crack down on his opponents. He banned anti-government
demonstrations the next day and threatened his opponents with
arrest.

Tajik opposition fighters return from Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A total of 157 Tajik opposition fighters who were
based in neighboring Afghanistan during the country's civil war
have returned home, a news report said Thursday.
	   The rebels made their way across the Pyandzh River on Wednesday
night with the help of Russian border troops who provided a barge,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing Russian border guard
spokesman Alexander Kondratyev.
	   Tajik authorities have been seeking to bring back an estimated
250 rebels who have remained in Afghanistan. Some had already made
their way home in recent days, and it is unclear whether any were
still in Afghanistan.
	   The operation, overseen in part by the United Nations, is part
of a peace agreement signed last year that ended five years of
civil war. The deal called for the troops' repatriation and
integration into the Tajikistan government forces.
	   The fighters' weapons and vehicles were also ferried to
Tajikistan in what ITAR-Tass described as a ``special sealed
delivery.''
	   Outbreaks of violence between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition still occur periodically in Tajikistan,
despite the peace agreement.

Singapore Airlines doubles fare to Manila after PAL collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's national air carrier doubled its
fares to Manila and eliminated special price deals for Filipino
maids after Philippines Airlines shut down, Singapore Airlines said
Thursday.
	   Philippine Airlines ceased operations Wednesday over plummeting
profits and unresolved union negotiations, effectively handing
Singapore Airlines a monopoly on the busy sector.
	   One-way tickets from Singapore to the Philippine capital rose to
810 Singapore dollars (dlrs 471) from about 400 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 230), said a spokeswoman for Singapore Airlines.
	   Round-trip airfare shot up to 1,206 Singapore dollars (dlrs 701)
from a previous average level of about 630 Singapore dollars (dlrs
366), she added.
	   The estimated 100,000 Filipino maids in Singapore and their
employers are likely to be the worst-hit by the new pricing
arrangements, which scrap the popular ``maid fare'' of 430
Singapore dollars (dlrs 250), reported The Straits Times on
Thursday.
	   Agents, employers and the maids themselves will now have to bear
the burden of regular return airfare, now nearly three times the
price of the special deal.
	   The across-the-board fare revisions were ``a business decision
in view of the squeeze on seats,'' Singapore Airlines' passenger
marketing manager Tan Chong Beng was quoted as saying in the
newspaper.
	   The Philippine and Singapore flagships were the only carriers
offering direct flights between the two cities. Singapore Airlines
has 19 flights per week to Manila, while Philippine Airlines had
seven per week.
	   Philippine Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said in Manila on
Wednesday that Singapore Airlines was planning to make a bid for a
stake of its Philippine counterpart along with a host of other
international carriers, reported The Straits Times.

Chinese authorities execute man for child abuse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A 35-year-old man has been executed in Beijing
for severely abusing a three-year-old boy and for drug trafficking,
the official newspaper Beijing Daily reported Thursday.
	   Lin Kui, an unemployed former convict, was executed Wednesday
after the high court rejected his appeal. A woman, Wang Fengmei,
was also convicted in connection with the case, but the report did
not say if she also had been executed.
	   The newspaper said Lin and Wang, who were described in earlier
reports of the case as drug addicts, had been asked to look after
the boy by his mother, another drug addict.
	   They beat the boy with sticks, canes and a fly swatter and
burned him with lighters and cigarettes, causing burns to 30
percent of his body. The boy was hospitalized with severe injuries.
	   Lin and Wang also were found guilty of trying to sell 3 grams (1
ounce) of heroin, the report added.

Soldier flees unit, commits suicide in latest army drama
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A soldier fled his unit Thursday and then killed
himself after he was tracked down by his colleagues, the latest in
a series of violent incidents in Russia's demoralized military.
	   The shootings have come as Russia begins its regular fall
military call-up _ an order that thousands of young draftees
routinely ignore. The Soldiers' Mothers Committee, a leading
anti-draft group, sent an open letter to President Boris Yeltsin
this week urging him to cancel the draft.
	   ``Everyone clearly understands that there are no material
resources to provide conscripts with food, clothing and shoes,''
the letter read.
	   Russian media reports have said that money shortages have forced
some units to cut rations to two meals a day, and some officers
even asked soldiers' parents to help with money or food.
	   In the latest incident, Alexander Konovalov, who served with a
Border Guards on the eastern peninsula of Kamchatka Peninsula, fled
his post early Thursday with his assault rifle.
	   Konovalov was quickly tracked down on the outskirts of the city
of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. He killed himself when his colleagues
tried to arrest him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, another Russian servicemen remained on the loose for
a fourth day Thursday after shooting dead two comrades and wounding
a third in the Ural Mountains city of Ozyorsk, home to Russia's
main nuclear weapons arsenal. A huge manhunt continued.
	   In a third shooting this week, a sailor on guard duty shot dead
his commanding officer and wounded another sailor before being
taken into custody along the Caspian Sea coast in southern Russia.
	   Abysmal living conditions, ritual hazings and weak morale have
all contributed to frequent shootings and suicides in the
cash-strapped Russian military.
	   As a result, only about 20 percent of the young men drafted into
the military actually show up. The military openly complains that
most of those who do turn up are ill-qualified to serve.
	   Desperate to meet its quotas, the army often accepts youths with
physical problems, criminal records or drug habits.
	   According to official figures, 50 soldiers were killed by their
fellow servicemen last year, and about 500 committed suicide.
	   When running for re-election in 1996, President Boris Yeltsin
pledged to end the draft by the year 2000 and turn the Russian
military into an all-volunteer force. But military leaders have
since said it would be impossible to meet the target date.

Nedved rejects Penguins' latest offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The Penguins and Petr Nedved are talking
again, but apparently not solving anything.
	   The holdout center, who missed last season in an ongoing
contract dispute, has rejected the Pittsburgh Penguins' latest
offer of dlrs 17 million to dlrs 18 million over five years.
	   Nedved, who has not played in the NHL since the 1996-97 season,
still wants a dlrs 20 million contract. He and Penguins general
manager Craig Patrick spoke this week for the first time since last
season.
	   Nedved prefers to play for another team due to his acrimonious
contract dispute, and plans to switch agents in an effort to
accelerate a trade or a contract offer.
	   The center is in the process of replacing agent Tony Kondel with
Michael Barnett, who also represents Jaromir Jagr and Wayne
Gretzky.
	   A productive Nedved would help the Penguins make up for the
offense they lost when center Ron Francis signed with Carolina.
	   Nedved's negotiating position is hurt by the fact the Penguins
own his NHL rights for the next five years and because the team's
co-owners, Roger Marino and Howard Baldwin, are feuding. The team
has reported losses of dlrs 37.5 million over the last two seasons.
	   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has been unable so far to
negotiate a resolution to the ownership dispute.

Election results again postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Announcement of final
results of recent Bosnian elections, scheduled for Thursday, has
been postponed for ``at least'' another day, the international
organizer of the vote said.
	   Bosnians voted nationwide Sept. 12-13 for several levels of
authority in their complicated state structure. Officials had
promised preliminary results for Tuesday and final tallies for
Thursday.
	   But Nicole Szulc, Sarajevo spokeswoman for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said Thursday technical
problems forced a further delay.
	   The OSCE has been under pressure to make results public,
particularly from supporters of Nikola Poplasen, the apparent
winner of the race for the presidency of the Serb substate making
up half of Bosnia.
	   Backers of Poplasen, a nationalist radical who apparently
defeated western-backed incumbent Biljana Plavsic, accuse the
organization of delay tactics because it is unhappy with the
Poplasen victory.
	   ``We will be ready when we are ready,'' Szulc said. ``We're
trying to do this right.''
	   Bosnia is divided between a Bosnian Serb republic and a
federation of Muslims and Croats. Both of those entities have their
own governments but are linked by a third joint central government.
	   International officials had hoped the elections _ the third in
three post-war years _ would further sideline hard-line
nationalists opposed to ethnic tolerance and other provisions of
the 1995 peace agreement.
	   But officials familiar with unofficial results said Plavsic had
lost to a hard liner, and that Croat nationalists were winning over
more moderate Croats in the Federal Parliament.
	   In other races, however, moderates were reported to have gained
further on hardliners.

Fear of lingering injury could sideline Elway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ John Elway doesn't want a short-term hamstring
injury to become a long-term impediment.
	   Intent on keeping his strained right hamstring from lingering
throughout the season, the Denver Broncos quarterback is giving
serious consideration to skipping Sunday's game at Washington.
	   ``It's a matter of whether I think I can go in there and
perform, not hold us back and also not set myself back,'' Elway
said Wednesday. ``The last thing you want to do is set yourself
back for three or four weeks.
	   ``It's a fine line because you always want to play. But if I'm
not real close to 100 percent and I'm holding this offense back,
then I won't go.''
	   Elway, 38, was injured in the fourth quarter of a 42-23 win over
Dallas two weeks ago. After missing most of last week's practice,
he worked out on Friday and played in Sunday's 34-17 victory at
Oakland, only to aggravate the injury and depart in the second
quarter.
	   Veteran Bubby Brister relieved Elway and led the Broncos to
victory, completing 10 of 17 passes for 140 yards and two
touchdowns with one interception.
	   Last Wednesday, the timetable was for Elway to try to practice
on Friday in an effort to determine his availability for the Raider
game. This week, there is no such timetable.
	   ``It's a day-to-day thing,'' he said. Trainer Steve Antonopulos
``and I haven't talked about it. I've been rehabbing and those type
things, but those are all in the range where it doesn't hurt. The
bottom line is, I haven't run. Who knows where I am? I'll just have
to wait and see.''
	   Elway, who did some light running on a treadmill later
Wednesday, said his real fear was that the injury might persist all
season.
	   ``With a week of rest, I don't think it would,'' he said.
``That's why it's got to be the right decision that I can go play
against the Redskins and not have to worry about it getting worse
and lingering the rest of the year.
	   ``I think we showed last week that Bubby can come in and is very
capable of doing the job. Unlike the old days, we're a good enough
football team now that we can win without me.''
	   The Broncos listed Elway as questionable on their injury report.
	   Coach Mike Shanahan said the Broncos will have a better feel for
Elway's availability later in the week.
	   ``If we feel at the end of this week that John can play without
there being a good chance of him pulling the hamstring again, then
we'll go with John,'' Shanahan said. ``If he says it feels tight
and he thinks he might pull it again, then John won't play. There's
always a chance that if he plays, he could pull it again. But he
could sit out the next two weeks and pull it three weeks from now,
too.''
	   Elway, who has missed only 10 games in his career because of
injury or illness, missed a game in Washington in 1989 _ apparently
because of the flu, although it also was reported that he suffered
from food poisoning after a meal at the White House.
	   Washington, he said, ``is a bad place. Just ask Bill.''
	   Brister said Elway's uncertain status ``doesn't alter anything.
I'll just prepare like I did last week. John heals real quick. By
Friday or Saturday, he may be 95, 98 percent. I anticipate him
playing.''

China hits back at US remarks on trade imbalance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Stung by U.S. criticism of China's soaring trade
surplus, Beijing on Thursday blamed the imbalance on Washington's
restrictions on selling advanced technologies to China.
	   ``If this issue is solved there will be changes in the U.S.
trade deficit with China,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
told reporters.
	   In unusually blunt language, U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce
David Aaron said on Wednesday in Beijing that the deficit,
projected to rise 20 percent this year to dlrs 60 billion, would
strain diplomatic relations.
	   Aaron criticized China for erecting new barriers to trade in
pharmaceuticals, energy and telecommunications and urged Chinese
officials to revive a seemingly stalled effort to join the World
Trade Organization.
	   Zhu said China was aware of the concerns of the United States,
its largest export market, and had ``encouraged Chinese
enterprises'' to buy U.S. imports.
	   But in a recitation of a negotiating position Beijing has held
for years, Zhu insisted that a difference in accounting methods has
led Washington to overestimate the deficit and he maintained that
China had already met the conditions for WTO membership.
	   Given the size of China's economy, the United States and some
other leading trading partners want Beijing to open its domestic
markets before joining the world arbiter of trade.
	   Hinting at Beijing's frustration with the process, Zhu noted
that China had negotiated with 35 trading partners and signed
formal agreements with ten of them.
	   ``We hope the countries concerned could adopt more practical
measures for a resolution of this issue,'' Zhu said.

NATO ambassadors give green light for Kosovo buildup

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO ambassadors approved an
activation warning Thursday for both a limited air option and a
phased air campaign in Kosovo, NATO Secretary_General Joavier
Solana said.
	   He said the warning takes NATO ``to an increased level of
military preparedness'' and will allow commanders to identify
assets needed for strikes in the southern Serb province
	   Solana stressed that the actual use of force will require
further decisions by the North Atlantic Council.
	   The NATO decision follows a resolution Wednesday by the U.N.
Security Council demanding an immediate cease-fire in Kosovo and
negotiations between President Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslav
government and separatist ethnic Albanians.

Walkouts affect airports, schools, hospitals, prisons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Partial strikes affected airports, schools,
hospitals and prisons in France on Thursday, as unions protested
the leftist government's belt-tightening policies.
	   State-owned Air France was forced to cancel some flights, while
other airlines experienced delays at Orly Airport south of Paris.
	   Pilots with three smaller unions protesting salaries, schedules
and working conditions at Air France began a two-day strike
Thursday to press their demands.
	   All of the airline's long-haul international flights were
running. But Air France canceled 20 percent of its medium-range
flights out of Charles de Gaulle Airport and 10 percent of them
from Orly outside Paris, said company spokeswoman Fabienne de
Brebisson.
	   At Orly, meanwhile, unions for the airport's 3,900 personnel
called a strike from 7 a.m. to noon (0500 to 1000 GMT) Thursday.
	   A portion of the airport's 100 firefighters joined the walkout,
forcing officials to close one of the airport's two runways, said
Jacques Reder, spokesman for the airport authority, Aeroports de
Paris.
	   The runway shutdown caused delays of up to 30 minutes, he said.
	   Unions called the strike to pressure the Transport Ministry over
plans to shift some flights from Orly, the smaller airport south of
Paris, to Charles de Gaulle, north of the capital.
	   Reder said the plan was under negotiation and expected to be
finalized by the end of the year.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has sought to hold the
line on spending to keep France's budget deficit within 3 percent
of the gross domestic product, as required by the euro single
currency that takes effect at the end of the year.
	   That has triggered periodic walkouts since Jospin came to power
in June last year.
	   French teachers held a one-day strike Thursday, the second in a
week, over plans to reform the school system and on overtime rules.
Last week's walkout drew only a small percentage of teachers.
	   Three unions for anesthesiologists called a strike Thursday and
Friday, affecting only non-emergency surgery, to protest work
schedules and a lack of funding.
	   Prison guards staged a strike Thursday to protest a budget
clampdown by the Justice Ministry, France Info radio reported.
Strikers in southern France burned tires outside a prison in
Villeneuve-les Maguelonne and blocked the gates of another in
Muret.

Rivals Taiwan, China plan breakthrough visit

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Rivals Taiwan and China cemented plans Thursday
for a mainland visit by a top Taiwanese negotiator that both sides
hope will break a three-year stalemate in talks.
	   After a day of meetings and a working banquet, negotiators for
the estranged rivals agreed by early Thursday that Taiwan's Koo
Chen-fu will first travel to Shanghai next month to see his
counterpart, Wang Daohan.
	   Koo will then go to Beijing and meet with President Jiang Zemin,
Vice Premier Qian Qichen and Chen Yunlin, director of the
government's Taiwan Affairs Office _ a schedule that shows the
importance Chinese leaders attach to the visit.
	   Koo and Wang, elder statesmen charged with trying to forge
relations between the rival governments, have not met since their
first talks in Singapore in 1993. Plans were under way for a second
meeting in 1995 when China shut down negotiations in anger over
what it perceived as Taiwan's drift away from the goal of
reunification.
	   In an indication of the sensitivities in bringing the sides
together, Koo's Oct. 14-19 trip to China is being characterized as
a visit with opportunities to chat _ something less than formal
talks.
	   Still, negotiators for both sides appeared satisfied with the
results of Wednesday's meetings.
	   Before flying back to Taipei, Shi Hwei-yow, secretary-general of
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, visited the office of his
counterpart, Tang Shubei, for a private conversation Thursday
morning. The two parted smiling and waving in farewell.
	   Major differences remained. Beijing insists that formal talks
begin with political discussions about reunification. Taipei wants
to start with practical issues such as fishing disputes. By not
labeling next month's meeting as talks, the issue may be skirted
for the time being.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters outside Tang's office, Shi said
``more cooperation'' was needed to settle the matter.
	   Tang, vice director of China's Association for Relations Across
the Straits, reiterated the need for political talks, but added:
``We still hope everyone can find a method to pursue cross-strait
relations.''
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told reporters
that ultimately visits like Koo's will help the government-backed
associations reach ``a common understanding and create the
conditions for the start of cross-strait political negotiations.''
	   China and Taiwan are heirs to the combatants in an unresolved
civil war that began seven decades ago. The two sides separated but
vowed to reunite after Mao Tse-tung's communists forced Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists from the mainland in 1949.
	   In Taiwan, Chang Jung-kung, a mainland expert in the ruling
Nationalist Party, said the smoothness of the Beijing talks show
the two sides may be ready to ease tensions.
	   He added that the plan for Koo to meet with President Jiang
indicates China is willing to deal with Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, despite past grudges.
	   Beijing was infuriated when Lee visited the United States in
1995, reading the trip as an indication of a drift toward
independence. In response, China launched test missiles and held
war games around Taiwan.

Singapore Airlines doubles fare to Manila after PAL collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS grafs 10-11 on airline seeking increased capacity on
Manila route &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's national air carrier doubled its
fares to Manila and eliminated special price deals for Filipino
maids after Philippines Airlines shut down, Singapore Airlines said
Thursday.
	   Philippine Airlines ceased operations Wednesday over plummeting
profits and unresolved union negotiations, effectively handing
Singapore Airlines (SIA) a monopoly on the busy sector.
	   One-way tickets from Singapore to the Philippine capital rose to
810 Singapore dollars (dlrs 471) from about 400 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 230), said an SIA spokeswoman.
	   Round-trip airfare shot up to 1,206 Singapore dollars (dlrs 701)
from a previous average level of about 630 Singapore dollars (dlrs
366), she added.
	   The estimated 100,000 Filipino maids in Singapore and their
employers are likely to be the worst-hit by the new pricing
arrangements, which scrap the popular ``maid fare'' of 430
Singapore dollars (dlrs 250), reported The Straits Times on
Thursday.
	   Agents, employers and the maids themselves will now have to bear
the burden of regular return airfare, now nearly three times the
price of the special deal.
	   The across-the-board fare revisions were ``a business decision
in view of the squeeze on seats,'' Singapore Airlines' passenger
marketing manager Tan Chong Beng was quoted as saying in the
newspaper.
	   The Philippine and Singapore flagships were the only carriers
offering direct flights between the two cities. SIA has 19 flights
per week to Manila, while Philippine Airlines had seven per week.
	   Philippine Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said in Manila on
Wednesday that Singapore Airlines was planning to make a bid for a
stake of its Philippine counterpart along with a host of other
international carriers, reported The Straits Times.
	   SIA added Thursday that it is seeking approval from Philippine
civil aviation authorities to increase its capacity or frequencies
on routes between Singapore and Manila, according to Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   ``Flights are now pretty full,'' Rick Clements, SIA public
affairs director, was quoted as saying.

Israel says no progress in talks if Arafat raises statehood issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel warned Yasser Arafat on Thursday that he
will hurt prospects for a West Bank troop withdrawal if he
discusses his plans for a declaration of Palestinian statehood in
his speech to the U.N. General Assembly next week.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Arafat is determined to
use his rare appearance before the world body to rally
international support for a unilateral declaration of Palestinian
independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May when the
five-year interim period of Palestinian autonomy expires.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank in New York this week.
	   U.S. officials had considered arranging a meeting between Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York. However,
with both sides sharpening their rhetoric over the statehood issue,
it appeared very unlikely such a summit will take place.
	   Netanyahu is already in New York to address the U.N. General
Assembly later Thursday and Arafat is to arrive later in the week.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after a meeting
with Netanyahu on Wednesday that much work needed to be done on a
withdrawal agreement.
	   Israeli officials warned Thursday that the negotiations would
suffer if Arafat raised the statehood issue in his speech to the
United Nations on Monday.
	   ``If Arafat chooses the path of diplomatic struggle against
Israel in the United Nations and attempts to promote a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood, he will simply sabotage the
chance that exists to achieve agreement with Israel,'' said Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   Netanyahu said a unilateral declaration would violate the
autonomy accords which say the final status of the disputed
territories must be determined through negotiations.
	   If Arafat declares a state in May, this ``in effect cancels the
(peace) agreement,'' Netanyahu said in New York.
	   ``I very much recommend to Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority not to take this course. It will certainly trigger
Israeli measures,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu has not said specifically how he would respond, but it
is believed he would annex parts of the West Bank and seal off
autonomous Palestinian areas from one another.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Thursday that Arafat
would raise the statehood issue in his U.N. speech as planned.
	   Under the autonomy agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides are to conclude talks on a permanent
peace agreement by May 4, 1999.
	   However, with both sides still hung up over interim issues, such
as a staged troop withdrawal, such talks have not begun. It is
increasingly likely that a permanent agreement _ which will have to
address explosive issues like final borders and the future of
Jerusalem _ will be reached by the deadline.
	   The architect of the autonomy agreements, Israeli opposition
legislator Yossi Beilin, planned to make a last appeal to Arafat
not to go ahead with a declaration of statehood.
	   ``I see the fourth of May as the beginning of a tragedy,''
Beilin told The Associated Press ahead of a meeting with Arafat in
Gaza City on Thursday morning. ``I think both sides are not really
ready for what will happen after the Palestinians make such a
declaration. They haven't thought out the consequences fully.''
	   Beilin said he would propose that the Palestinians agree to
extend the deadline for a final peace agreement until January 2001.
	   Israel, in turn, would complete a withdrawal from half of the
West Bank by January 1999. It would also declare that it would
accept in principle the creation of a demilitarized Palestinian
state, with the final borders and its capital to be negotiated.
	   Beilin acknowledged that he does not have Netanyahu's backing
for such a plan.

Britain's Blair to travel to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit to
China next month will help propel steadily improving ties, a
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
	   Blair is scheduled to hold talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and other leaders and visit Shanghai and Hong Kong during his
Oct. 6-10 visit, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a
routine media briefing.
	   Blair's China tour, the first by a British prime minister in six
years, caps efforts by London and Beijing to repair ties damaged by
sometimes stormy disagreements over Hong Kong's return to Chinese
rule on July 1, 1997.
	   On a visit to Beijing in January, British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said both sides were keen for a ``fresh start,'' and
parade of Chinese and British officials have spoken of better ties
in the months since.
	   ``We believe that this visit will help to advance the
development of the friendly relations and cooperation between China
and Britain to a higher level,'' Zhu told reporters.

Announcement of election results postponed again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The announcement of final
results of recent Bosnian elections, scheduled for Thursday, has
been postponed for at least another day, the international
organizer of the vote said.
	   Final results from the Sept. 12-13 nationwide elections are
expected to confirm reports that Serb hard-liner Nikola Poplasen
upset the U.S. favorite, Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic.
	   Poplasen's victory is seen as a serious blow to Western efforts
to stitch Bosnia back together after a 3 1/2-year war that ended
with the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
	   Nicole Szulc, Sarajevo spokeswoman for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said Thursday that technical
problems had forced a further delay in announcing the results.
	   The OSCE has been under pressure to make the results public,
particularly from supporters of Poplasen, the apparent winner of
the race for the presidency of the Serb substate making up half of
Bosnia.
	   Backers of Poplasen have accused the OSCE of delaying tactics
because it is unhappy with the prospects of a victory by the
radical Serb nationalist.
	   ``We will be ready when we are ready,'' Szulc said. ``We're
trying to do this right.''
	   Robert Gelbard, the top U.S. envoy for the Balkans, expressed
doubt Wednesday that Poplasen will abide by the U.S.-brokered peace
agreement that ended the Bosnian war.
	   Bosnia is divided between a Bosnian Serb republic and a
federation of Muslims and Croats. Both of these entities have their
own governments but are linked by a third joint central government.
	   International officials had hoped the elections _ the third in
three post-war years _ would further sideline hard-line
nationalists opposed to ethnic tolerance and other provisions of
the 1995 peace agreement.
	   But officials familiar with unofficial results said Plavsic had
lost, and that Croat nationalists were winning over more moderate
Croats in races for the Federal Parliament.
	   In other races, however, moderates were reported to have gained
on hard-liners.

Yugoslav officials shrug off threats, advance into rebel stronghold

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces struck
deeper into the last pockets of separatist Kosovo Albanian
resistance Thursday, ignoring a U.N. resolution that edges open the
door for a NATO strike against them.
	   Artillery boomed across the central Drenica region of the
Serbian province Thursday, and Serb police sources said they cut
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army forces in two by taking over
a main road that passes through the last pocket of Kosovo Albanian
resistance.
	   ``The terrorists are now surrounded in several Drenica
villages,'' said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity,
alluding to KLA members.
	   The offensive continued despite a U.N. Security Council warning
Wednesday threatening further action unless the fighting stopped.
While not specifically mandating NATO action, the resolution opened
the way for international approval of involvement by the military
alliance.
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a a
province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Ethnic Albanians _ 90 percent of Kosovo province _ are
overwhelmingly in favor of independence. World powers back autonomy
for Kosovo instead, arguing that independence can be achieved only
through prolonged, and spreading, bloodshed.
	   Most victims of the Serb-Yugoslav military campaign have been
Albanian civilians. Upward of 275,000 have been driven from
hundreds of destroyed villages, including an estimated 50,000
people who have no shelter. They face the risk of death when winter
strikes.
	   That risk is driving Western efforts to get a commitment from
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the government
offensive and permit mass refugee returns.
	   Refugee numbers were swollen by the latest fighting, with up to
20,000 civilians fleeing their homes in the Drenica area, west and
southwest of Pristina.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians patrolled nearly all routes into the region, tightening
the noose on several hundred lightly armed rebels.
	   The U.N. resolution _ the toughest action the council has taken
to date _ came less than 24 hours before NATO defense ministers
were to meet in Portugal to discuss the situation.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the

military action against Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.''

	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) - Here is the text of the statement on
Kosovo made Thursday by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana:
	   Just a few moments ago, the North Atlantic Council approved the
issuing of an ACTWARN for both a limited air option and a phased
air campaign in Kosovo.
	   The ACTWARN will take NATO to an increased level of military
preparedness. In particular, the ACTWARN will allow NATO commanders
to identify the assets required for these NATO operations.
	   Let me stress that the use of force will require further
decisions by the North Atlantic Council. But today's decision is an
important political signal of NATO's readiness to use force, if it
becomes necessary to do so.
	   Finally, let me express the strong support of all the allies for
the firm resolution that was adopted in New York last night by the
U.N. Security Council. This resolution makes it clear what
President Milosevic must do:
	   - He must stop his repressive actions against the population;
	   - He must seek a political solution to the Kosovo crisis based
on negotiations, as must the Kosovar Albanians;
	   And he must take immediate steps to alleviate the humanitarian
situation.
	   The resolution and today's decision by NATO underline the unity
of the international community and our resolve to find a solution
to the Kosovo crisis.

Australian Broadcasting Corp. news silenced in election protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Union staffers at the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. walked off the job Thursday, silencing news and
normal broadcasts, after its chairman endorsed Prime Minister John
Howard's re-election.
	   ABC Radio's noon news broadcast was intermittently interrupted
and eventually replaced by music as Community and Public Sector
Union staff walked out.
	   The Australian Broadcasting Corp., the national broadcaster, is
government funded but its charter calls for it to be independent of
politics.
	   But Howard, who is leading a campaign for re-election in the
Oct. 3 national election, and many conservatives have accused it of
being biased against them.
	   ABC chairman Donald McDonald on Wednesday gave his close friend
Howard a a glowing endorsement at a luncheon.
	   ``He is a man of high courage, he has a transparent candor, he
is a proud man possessed of a true humility, he has balance, he has
always displayed grace under pressure,'' McDonald said.
	   ``He is quite without malice, he is unpracticed in derision, he
is a man acquainted with disappointment but blessed with a renewing
optimism. He is an absolute gentleman, a true patriot, a great
friend.''
	   CPSU spokeswoman Lisa Fowkes said members condemned the
chairman's statements and resolved to walk off the job for three
hours Thursday.
	   McDonald rejected a demand by the journalists' union to stand
down for the remainder of the election campaign because of his
comments.
	   Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance secretary Chris Warren
accused McDonald of bringing the ABC into disrepute.
	   ``When the chairman of the ABC, the public face of the ABC,
publicly identifies himself with one of the political parties in
that sort of manner, it brings the entire ABC into discredit and
leaves it open to attack for political bias,'' Warren said.
	   However, Howard defended McDonald's remarks.
	   ``Of course I think it's acceptable for good friends to remain
good friends,'' he told reporters.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A bomb exploded at a Jerusalem bus stop during
morning rush hour Thursday, wrecking the station's shelter and
injuring an Israeli soldier.
	   Near the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, several shots were
fired at a van driven by Jewish settlers, but no one was injured.
	   The explosive device in Jerusalem, weighing about one kilo (two
pounds) and possibly triggered by a timer, went off at about 8 a.m.
(0600 gmt) near the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University.
	   Police sealed the area, which is adjacent to the West Bank.
Officers conducted searches, backed by helicopters. The bomb squad
also combed the scene for other bombs.
	   A white car with Palestinian license plates was seen leaving the
scene and was stopped at a nearby Israeli army roadblock, said
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby.
	   Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki later said the driver
of the car probably had nothing to do with the bombing.
	   A soldier sitting at the bus stop was lightly hurt in the head
when the bomb went off, said Ben-Ruby. The shelter, which is
opposite the university's School for Overseas Students, was badly
damaged.
	   Israel has been on high alert for the past two weeks following
renewed threats by the Islamic militant group Hamas to carry out
attacks in Israel. Hamas wants to avenge the Sept. 11 killing of
the group's two top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   However, Hamas' trademark have been deadly suicide bombings
carried out in crowded downtown areas or on buses. Thursday's bomb
was relatively small and the bus stop was located in an outlying
neighborhood of Jerusalem.

Verdict in case of jailed German to be issued within a week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A verdict in the case of a German
businessman jailed in Iran for having a sexual relationship with a
Muslim woman will announced within a week, a judiciary official
said Thursday.
	   A hearing Thursday was the last session in the trial of Helmut
Hofer, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
During the 40-minute session, Hofer, hand-cuffed and wearing a
pea-green prison uniform, smiled and looked relaxed.
	   A German diplomat, two lawyers and an interpreter attended the
session with him.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with 26-year-old medical student Vahideh Qassemi, to
whom he was not married. Qassemi did not attend Thursday's session.
	   Hofer's lawyer, Malekhoushang Qahhari, expressed his optimism
and expected his client to be released next week.
	   ``Ten years ago, in Bosnia, he converted to Islam and became a
Muslim and he is now a sincere Muslim. There is no confession or
witness to a sexual act,'' said Qahhari.
	   At Thursday's hearing, the diplomat opened a can of ham and
offered it to Hofer, who refused to eat any, in an apparent ploy to
show he had converted to Islam.
	   ``I'm a Muslim now. I don't eat pork any more,'' Hofer said.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging, but if the man is a non-Muslim he faces the death
penalty.
	   The court had earlier reassured German officials that Hofer
would be freed because the court was satisfied he was a Muslim and
would marry the Iranian woman.
	   Iran has been keen to improve its relations with the European
Union, especially its top Western trade partner, Germany. Bonn had
warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed, German-Iranian relations
would deteriorate.
	   While there is no evidence that the government had influenced
the decision to retry Hofer, political considerations are generally
taken into account by Iranian courts.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NATO ambassadors giving green light for Kosovo
buildup; recasts to conform.
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces struck
deeper into the last pockets of separatist Kosovo Albanian
resistance Thursday, ignoring U.N. and NATO moves that edged open
the door for a military strike against them.
	   Artillery boomed across the central Drenica region of the
Serbian province Thursday, and Serb police sources said they cut
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army forces in two by taking over
a main road that passes through the last pocket of Kosovo Albanian
resistance.
	   ``The terrorists are now surrounded in several Drenica
villages,'' said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity,
alluding to KLA members.
	   The offensive continued despite a U.N. Security Council warning
Wednesday threatening further action unless the fighting stopped.
While not specifically mandating NATO action, the resolution opened
the way for international approval of involvement by the military
alliance.
	   On the heels of that move, NATO ambassadors meeting in Portugal
on Thursday approved increased planning for air strikes in Kosovo.
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the decision takes the
organization ``to an increased level of military preparedness''
without actually approving the use of force.
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a a
province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Ethnic Albanians _ 90 percent of Kosovo province _ are
overwhelmingly in favor of independence. World powers back autonomy
for Kosovo instead, arguing that independence can be achieved only
through prolonged, and spreading, bloodshed.
	   Most victims of the Serb-Yugoslav military campaign have been
Albanian civilians. Upward of 275,000 have been driven from
hundreds of destroyed villages, including an estimated 50,000
people who have no shelter. They face the risk of death when winter
strikes.
	   That risk is driving Western efforts to get a commitment from
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the government
offensive and permit mass refugee returns.
	   Refugee numbers were swollen by the latest fighting, with up to
20,000 civilians fleeing their homes in the Drenica area, west and
southwest of Pristina.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians patrolled nearly all routes into the region, tightening
the noose on several hundred lightly armed rebels.
	   The U.N. resolution _ the toughest action the council has taken
to date _ came less than 24 hours before the NATO defense
ministers' meeting in Portugal.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government unveiled an 85.79
trillion won (dlrs 61.25) budget proposal Thursday that calls for
sharp increases in welfare spending to combat soaring unemployment.
	   For the second straight year, the government predicted spending
in 1999 would far exceed tax revenues, requiring a 13.5 trillion
won (dlrs 9.6 billion) bond offering to make up the difference.
	   The proposal calls for spending increases of 6.2 percent over
this year's budget, well below the average 14 percent annual budget
increases since 1990.
	   The budget will be submitted next week to the National Assembly,
where it is expected to be approved with little change by a
majority of lawmakers loyal to President Kim Dae-jung's ruling
coalition.
	   In 1998, the government issued bonds worth 7.9 trillion won
(dlrs 5.6 billion) to meet its budget of 80.78 trillion won (dlrs
57.7 billion). It was the first budget deficit since 1983.
	   Government officials said spending increases next year have to
be kept to a minimum because of the deepening economic crisis
gripping the country.
	   ``Many companies have gone bankrupt and surviving companies,
too, are making much less money, paying much less tax,'' said Chun
Jung-young, a spokesman for the Office of National Budget.
	   For the first time, defense spending was trimmed by 0.4 percent
to 13.74 trillion won (dlrs 9.81 billion).
	   ___
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Moody's Investor Services on
Thursday downgraded New Zealand's credit rating, a move that had
been widely expected as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Moody's said the downgrade reflected New Zealand's worsening
economy conditions and continued pressure on the country's external
accounts.
	   Moody's said all Aa1 rated foreign currency bonds and notes
issued by the government had been downgraded to Aa2.
	   The effect of the downgrade is likely to be negligible, Finance
Minister Bill Birch said.
	   ``Over the last 18 months, domestic economic conditions and a
sharp deterioration in the country's external environment have led
to a marked increase in New Zealand's current account deficit,''
Moody's said in a statement.
	   Initiatives to narrow the deficit would be constrained by an
adverse and possibly worsening external environment.
	   Moody's said financial requirements resulting from the deficit
were likely to prompt a deterioration in New Zealand's external
debt profile, increasing ``the country's vulnerability to shifts in
investor confidence.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ As part of a cost-cutting program, All Nippon
Airways Co. will sell the two hotels it owns in the United States,
a company official said Thursday.
	   All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest airline, will sell
the hotels it bought in the late 1980s to Lowe Enterprises Inc., a
San Francisco-based real estate firm, for a combined 36.4 billion
yen (dlrs 270 million), said the spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   One hotel is in Washington, D.C. with 415 rooms, and the other
with 667 rooms is in San Francisco.
	   In June, ANA announced cost-trimming measures as part of a
three-year plan to boost profits. They included cuts in hiring,
senior executives' salaries and the planned purchase of aircraft.
	   The company said earlier this year it expects to post a loss of
6 billion yen (dlrs 44.7 million) for the fiscal year ending March
1999.
	   ANA has already concluded a deal with Lowe Enterprises, with the
sale happening as early as next Tuesday, the official said.
	   ANA bought the two hotels in 1988 and 1989, about the same time
it started its first regular flights between Japan and the U.S.
mainland.
	   ___
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese companies that are engaging in price wars
to rid themselves of excess inventory must stop slashing prices or
risk punishment, a top government official was quoted in state
media as saying Thursday.
	   Falling prices for many products have eroded state company
profits, hurt government tax revenues and may threaten national
economic growth, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   ``Dumping increases state company losses, disrupts market order,
and must be stopped,'' Chen Bangzhu, state economic and trade
commission vice minister was quoted by Xinhua News Agency as
saying.
	   To stop sliding prices, the government has set price-control
guidelines on some products, including building materials,
machinery, metallurgical products, textiles and petrochemicals,
Xinhua said.
	   Companies that don't adhere to these guidelines will be
punished, the report said without elaborating.
	   Instead of slashing prices, industries having trouble selling
their inventories should cut production, the report said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's national air carrier doubled its
fares to Manila and eliminated special price deals for Filipino
maids after Philippines Airlines shut down, Singapore Airlines said
Thursday.
	   Philippine Airlines ceased operations Wednesday over plummeting
profits and unresolved union negotiations, effectively handing
Singapore Airlines (SIA) a monopoly on the busy sector.
	   One-way tickets from Singapore to the Philippine capital rose to
810 Singapore dollars (dlrs 471) from about 400 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 230), said an SIA spokeswoman.
	   Round-trip airfare shot up to 1,206 Singapore dollars (dlrs 701)
from a previous average level of about 630 Singapore dollars (dlrs
366), she added.
	   The estimated 100,000 Filipino maids in Singapore and their
employers are likely to be the worst-hit by the new pricing
arrangements, which scrap the popular ``maid fare'' of 430
Singapore dollars (dlrs 250), reported The Straits Times on
Thursday.
	   Agents, employers and the maids themselves will now have to bear
the burden of regular return airfare, now nearly three times the
price of the special deal.
	   The across-the-board fare revisions were ``a business decision
in view of the squeeze on seats,'' Singapore Airlines' passenger
marketing manager Tan Chong Beng was quoted as saying in the
newspaper.
	   ___
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Trade Minister Tim Fischer strongly
backed Australia's controversial monopoly wheat and sugar selling
arrangements Thursday, describing them ``legitimate weaponry.''
	   Fischer, who leads the rural-based National Party, the junior
partner in the conservative coalition government of Prime Minister
John Howard, was releasing the government's trade policies for Oct.
3 elections.
	   U.S. trade negotiators have sharply criticized the way Australia
sells its wheat and sugar overseas, saying it involves both unfair
government assistance and monopoly practices.
	   Fischer did not deny either charge, but said the present
arrangements, which his party strongly supports, are not only
legitimate but also help customers.

July retail sales plunge 17 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Retail sales in Hong Kong fell by 17 percent in
July compared with the same month last year, marking the ninth
consecutive monthly decline, the government announced Thursday.
	   Retail sales fell to an estimated 17.0 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 2.19 billion). Volume also fell by 17 percent compared
with last July.
	   A government statement attributed the decline to weak consumer
sentiment which was ``very much dampened by the slackened income,
increased unemployment, high interest rates, and market correction
in the asset markets.''
	   The sales volume of motor vehicles posted the biggest fall,
losing 42 percent in value and 37 percent in volume year-on-year,
followed by sales of clothing and footwear, which fell 30 percent
in value and 31 percent in volume.
	   Commodities in department stores sales fell by 25 percent in
value and 26 percent in volume year-on-year, while miscellaneous
consumer goods lost 9 percent in value and 13 percent in volume
year-on-year.
	   For the first seven months this year, retail sales declined by
15 percent in value and 16 percent in volume, the government said.
	   Hong Kong's economy, hit the Asian financial crisis, contracted
5 percent in the second quarter and is expected to shrink by 4
percent for this year, compared with 5.3 percent growth in 1997.
	   Unemployment in the territory is at a 15-year high of 5 percent.
	   Tourist arrivals, which had declined steadily from July 1997,
have slowly increased since July. August arrivals were up 4.9
percent, compared with the same month last year, shortly after the
tourist slump began. Lower tourist arrivals had been blamed for the
decline in retail sales in the first half.

Israel says no progress in talks likely if Arafat raises statehood
</HEADLINE>
issue &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel warned Yasser Arafat on Thursday that he
will sabotage prospects for a West Bank troop withdrawal if he
discusses his plans for a declaration of Palestinian statehood when
he speaks to the U.N. General Assembly next week.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Arafat is determined to
use his rare appearance before the world body to rally
international support for a unilateral declaration of Palestinian
independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May when the
five-year interim period of Palestinian autonomy expires.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank in New York this week.
	   U.S. officials had considered arranging a meeting between Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York. However,
with both sides sharpening their rhetoric over the statehood issue,
it appeared very unlikely such a summit will take place.
	   Netanyahu is already in New York to address the U.N. General
Assembly later Thursday and Arafat is to arrive later in the week.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after a meeting
with Netanyahu on Wednesday that much work needed to be done on a
withdrawal agreement.
	   Israeli officials warned Thursday that the negotiations would
suffer if Arafat raised the statehood issue in his speech to the
United Nations on Monday.
	   ``If Arafat chooses the path of diplomatic struggle against
Israel in the United Nations and attempts to promote a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood, he will simply sabotage the
chance that exists to achieve agreement with Israel,'' said Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   Netanyahu said a unilateral declaration would violate the
autonomy accords which say the final status of the disputed
territories must be determined through negotiations.
	   If Arafat declares a Palestinian state in May, this ``in effect
cancels the (peace) agreement,'' Netanyahu said in New York.
	   ``I very much recommend to Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority not to take this course. It will certainly trigger
Israeli measures,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu has not said specifically how he would respond, but it
is believed he would annex parts of the West Bank and seal off
autonomous Palestinian areas from one another.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Thursday that Arafat
would raise the statehood issue in his U.N. speech as planned.
	   Under the autonomy agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides are to conclude talks on a permanent
peace agreement by May 4, 1999.
	   However, with both sides still hung up over interim issues, such
as a staged troop withdrawal, such talks have not begun. It is
increasingly unlikely that a permanent agreement _ which will have
to address explosive issues like final borders and the future of
Jerusalem _ will be reached by the deadline.
	   The architect of the autonomy agreements, Israeli opposition
legislator Yossi Beilin, planned to make a last appeal to Arafat
not to go ahead with a declaration of statehood.
	   ``I see the fourth of May as the beginning of a tragedy,''
Beilin told The Associated Press ahead of a meeting with Arafat in
Gaza City on Thursday morning. ``I think both sides are not really
ready for what will happen after the Palestinians make such a
declaration. They haven't thought out the consequences fully.''
	   Beilin said he would propose that the Palestinians agree to
extend the deadline for a final peace agreement until January 2001.
	   Israel, in turn, would complete a withdrawal from half of the
West Bank by January 1999, Beilin said. It would also declare that
it would accept in principle the creation of a demilitarized
Palestinian state, with the final borders and its capital to be
negotiated.
	   Beilin acknowledged that he does not have Netanyahu's backing
for such a plan.

Russian inflation up 67 percent since August crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's inflation rate has skyrocketed to 67
percent since last month, and the Central Bank said Thursday the
worst was still ahead _ price hikes could approach 300 percent by
year's end.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has been in office for
almost two weeks, but has yet to offer a comprehensive economic
plan, pledged strong steps to stabilize the crumbling economy.
	   He said the new government planned to pay off wage arrears to
millions of workers, would attempt to limit the painful effects of
inflation and would impose greater state control over the alcohol
industry, one of the government largest sources of tax revenue.
	   Primakov also took a slap at his predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko,
saying Kiriyenko's Aug. 17 announcement to devalue the ruble and
restructure government debt was ill-advised and had touched off the
crisis.
	   Primakov claimed that Kiriyenko had acted without the consent of
President Boris Yeltsin and that the results had been ``chaotic.''
	   ``It is essential to do everything to prevent the Aug. 17
statement ... from leading to dangerous socio-economic
consequences,'' said Primakov, speaking at the start of a cabinet
meeting.
	   Meanwhile, the government released several economic figures that
revealed how serious the crisis has become.
	   Inflation is up 67 percent since the crisis began in mid-August,
the State Statistics Committee said.
	   The Central Bank forecast that the rate could reach 240 to 290
percent by the end of the year, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   And Russia's dwindling hard currency reserves have dipped to
dlrs 12 billion, down from dlrs 12.3 billion a week earlier, the
Central Bank said.
	   No reason was given for the drop, though Russian media reports
have said that the Central Bank has been trying to support the
falling ruble.
	   Before the crisis, prices were increasing at less than 1 percent
a month and the Russian ruble was holding steady at a little over
six to the U.S. dollar.
	   But the embattled ruble is now trading at around 15 to the
dollar, which means that Russia's many imports are now two or three
times more expensive than they were.
	   The ruble has strengthened a bit in the past few days, but it
remains highly unstable.

Bomb explodes at Jerusalem bus stop; soldier lightly injured

 &UR; Eds: ADDS report of shots fired at settler's car. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A bomb exploded at a Jerusalem bus stop during
morning rush hour Thursday, wrecking the station's shelter and
injuring an Israeli soldier.
	   The explosive device, weighing about one kilogram (two pounds)
and possibly triggered by a timer, went off at about 8 a.m. (0600
GMT) near the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem.
	   Police sealed off the area, which is adjacent to the West Bank.
Officers conducted searches, backed by helicopters. The bomb squad
also combed the scene for other bombs.
	   A white car with Palestinian license plates was seen leaving the
scene and was stopped at a nearby Israeli army roadblock, said
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby. It was not immediately
clear whether the driver was detained for questioning.
	   A soldier sitting at the bus stop was lightly hurt when the bomb
went off, said Ben-Ruby. The shelter was badly damaged.
	   Israel has been on high alert for the past two weeks following
renewed threats by the Islamic militant group Hamas to carry out
attacks in Israel. Hamas wants to avenge the Sept. 11 killing of
the group's two top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   However, Hamas' trademark has been deadly suicide bombings
carried out in crowded downtown areas or on buses. Thursday's bomb
was relatively small and the bus stop was located in an outlying
neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   In another incident, shots were fired at an Israeli car near the
Palestinian-controlled town of Hebron on the West Bank Thursday,
but no one was hurt, Israel radio said.
	   The van, driven by a Jewish settler, was hit by several bullets,
the report said. Israeli soldiers were combing the area.
	   The shooting occurred between Hebron and the adjacent Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Rights group honors Thai, Taiwanese humanitarians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Thai democracy activist and a Taiwanese
Buddhist nun who heads an international charity group were
presented with the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples biennial human
rights award on Thursday.
	   Sulak Sivraksa of Thailand and Buddhist Master Cheng Yen were
recognized for furthering the Netherlands-based UNPO's goals of
democracy human rights and self determination for all peoples, said
Helen Corbett, the organization's general secretary.
	   A 30-year veteran of Thailand's democracy movement, Sivraksa has
been prominent in the struggle against a gas pipeline from Myanmar
that critics say is responsible for gross human rights violations
and environmental damage.
	   The Tzu Chi Foundation founded and headed by Cheng Yen provides
emergency relief and longterm assistance to the poor and disaster
victims in Taiwan and 17 countries abroad.
	   Sivraksa and Cheng Yen were honored for their ``ingrained
qualities such as respect, empathy and commitment to the people
they help,'' Corbett said.
	   Founded in 1991, the UNPO advocates for minorities and regions
not represented at the United Nations, such as Chechnya, Nigeria's
Ogoni people, Romania's Hungarian minority community, and Taiwan,
which is claimed by as a breakaway province by China.
	   Prominent members of Taiwan's main opposition party _ which
advocates formal independence for the island _ attended the
conference at a Taipei hotel. But the Foreign Ministry declined to
join and reportedly barred a Chechen representative from entering
Taiwan.

Doubts on panel's resolve to eludicte French role in genocide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ An adviser to President Pasteur Bizimungu
said Thursday he doubted the seriousness and resolve of a French
parliamentary panel to investigate France's role in the 1994
genocide in Rwanda.
	   But one of the panel members and another government official
were less pessimistic.
	   The panel, which is due to present its findings in December,
sent a four-member team to Rwanda apparently to corroborate
testimony that French military troops had intervened on the side of
the Hutu-dominated government, which was responsible for the 90-day
slaughter in which at least half a million people were killed.
	   Patrick Mazimhaka said he had presented the delegation with
videotapes, testimonies and the government's own evidence of the
French role before and after the genocide.
	   ``We gave them the statements by their own administrators in
Rwanda at the time. We want to show them that the French knew that
the genocide had been planned,'' he said. ``But they seemed not
receptive to our arguments. They seem to want to try to exonerate
the French role, or at least minimize it.''
	   He said the questions the French were asking indicated they
believed they were unable to support the testimonies before the
panel implicating the government of the late President Francois
Mitterrand in the genocide.
	   But Emmanuel Gasana, a political adviser to Vice President and
Defense Minister Paul Kagame, welcomed the visit.
	   ``I think it's the intention on both sides that this can
contribute to at least establishing the truth, and after
establishing the truth, we can look at ways to better relations,''
he said.
	   French deputy Bernard Cazenave said he believed the Rwandans
were less skeptical about the panel's intentions than they were a
few months ago.
	   ``Perhaps it's because we have worked hard in the past six
months, or perhaps also because the government of Rwanda wants to
know the truth,'' he said.
	   Former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who from April 6, 1994 shot
or hacked to death more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus were allowed to escape to neighboring
Congo _ then Zaire _ together with civilians under the protection
of French troops sent to Rwanda in June 1994 in an ostensibly
humanitarian gesture called Operation Turquoise.
	   Tutsi-led rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, whose first
incursion into Rwanda in October 1990 led to the beefing up of the
19-year French military assistance program to the government of
President Juvenal Habyarimana, accuse France of failing to act on
clear signals that the slaughter was being carefully planned,
sometimes with French support through arms supplies and troop
training.
	   The rebels ousted the Hutu government in July 1994 and stopped
the slaughter.
	   Gasana said French military assistance, France's decision to
evacuate foreigners once the genocide got underway and Operation
Turquoise ``further complicated the situation ... and unfortunately
ended up as assistance to those who committed genocide.''
	   Mazimhaka denied reports that Bizimungu and Prime Minister
Pierre-Celestin Rwigyema refused to meet the French team, saying
the delegation chose to meet specific officials and genocide
survivors.
	   Deputy Pierre Brana and two adminsitrative staff are also in the
delegation.

strikes against the Yugoslav leader unless he ends his offensive in
Kosovo.
	   NATO ambassadors, meeting in a special session here, approved an
``activation warning'' for a military campaign, preparing for both
``limited'' and ``phased'' air strikes against Yugoslavia.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the decision ``takes
NATO to an increased level of military preparedness.''
	   He said military commanders will now identify countries
participating in air strikes and the kind of hardware they will put
at NATO's disposal.
	   ``Let me stress that the use of force will require further
decisions'' by the NATO governments, Solana said in a brief
statement to reporters.
	   To date, only Germany and The Netherlands have publicly said
they will contribute 14 and eight jet fighters, respectively.
	   The NATO action came 12 hours after the U.N. Security Council
passed a resolution demanding a cease-fire in Kosovo, and
threatened further action if fighting continues. It urged both
sides to start negotiating a solution and demanded Milosevic allow
international monitoring in Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   The meeting of the NATO envoys was followed by a meeting of NATO
defense ministers. For the first time, the defense ministers of
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ three nations due to join
Nato next April _ participated in the meeting.
	   In recent months, officials in NATO capitals have made tough
statements but that has not been enough to get Milosovic to back
down in his offensive against separatist ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo. The war there has killed hundreds of people and made almost
300,000 people homeless, of whom some 50,000 are camped out in the
countryside in appalling conditions.
	   ``This is the last clear warning that should not be
underestimated by anyone ... Increasingly, people realize that a
lot of time has been wasted,'' said German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe.
	   He added: ``pictures of people (in Kosovo) camping out in the
open ... are in themselves an ultimatum'' to Milosovic that the
allies will no longer tolerate the accumulation of horror,
especially not at the outset of another winter.
	   Solana said the NATO allies warmly welcome the U.N. resolution
which passed by a 14-0 vote with only China abstaining.
	   ``This resolution makes clear what President Milosevic must
do,'' said Solana. ``He must stop his repressive actions against
the population, he must seek a political solution top the Kosovo
crisis based on negotiations as must Kosovar Albanians, and he must
take immediate steps to alleviate the humanitarian situation...''
	   Attacks by Serb forces in Kosovo have continued despite NATO
threats of retaliation. The allies have staged air and ground
exercises in Albania and Macedonia but these have not frightened
the Yugoslav leader.
	   Hampering the allies have been disagreements over whether or not
they need a formal mandate from the United Nations before stepping
in.
	   The latest U.N. resolution cited Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter,
which allows for the use of force if regional peace and security is
threatened. It did not explicitly authorize member states to
intervene in Kosovo and said ``the council would consider further
action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace and
stability in the region,'' if no political deal is reached.
	   France has been pushing hard for U.N. endorsement of any
military action. The United States believes no such mandate is
required. In Germany, Kinkel and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe _ in
the heat of a general election campaign _ have disagreed publicly
on the issue. Foreign

Russian crisis looms large as world business leaders meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX BANDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's prime minister urged world
business leaders to help stem Russia's financial and economic
crisis, suggesting, in comments published Thursday, that the fate
of former Soviet bloc countries hung in the balance.
	   Prime Minister Viktor Orban spoke late Wednesday at the opening
of a meeting bringing together present and past statesmen and heads
of major multinational to discuss global economic problems.
	   Sponsored by the American ``Fortune'' magazine, the theme of the
forum is ``Creating Wealth in the Global Economy.''
	   ``I have a pessimistic view of what is happening in Russia,''
Orban was quoted as saying by the daily Nepszabadsag. ``We have to
live together with a Russia that'll be in deep crisis for a long
time.''
	   The meeting of 110 CEOs offers Hungary a welcome opportunity to
persuade western business leaders that it ought not view Eastern
Europe in bloc terms and flee the region when problems arise in
Moscow.
	   Orban made a special plea to the CEOs, saying Hungary, which
turned from communism to democracy in 1989, is ``in the final stage
of rejoining western Europe (and) you are the main actors of this
final stage of the breakaway from the past.''
	   Analysts analysts believe that three billion dollars or more
have been withdrawn from Hungary's stock and bond markets by
western investors in recent weeks because of nervousness about
Russia.
	   Orban told the meeting that 75 percent of the country's exports
go to the European Union and only four percent to Russia, ``yet
investors have pulled out from the Hungarian stock exchange.''
	   United States Ambassador Peter Tufo told the gathering that
``the current Russian financial crisis has colored investors'
perspectives. Some wrongly view the region as one market.''
	   Among those at the meeting are are Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski; ex-President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines; former
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger; Juergen Schrempp,
Daimler-Benz; James Dimon, Salomon Smith Barney; Anthony Burns,
Ryder System, Inc., and Kim Woo-Choong of Daewoo group,

World Bank warns Indonesia to protect humanitarian aid from graft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The World Bank on Thursday warned
Indonesia that global financial support for its ailing economy was
at risk unless it stopped corruption from eating into humanitarian
aid.
	   The warning follows recent allegations that millions of dollars
in World Bank loans meant to aid growing throngs of poor and hungry
have been lost to graft in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
	   Bank officials announced Thursday that it would design an
anti-corruption strategy for Indonesia, where endemic bribery has
been identified as a major contributor to its near economic
collapse over the past year.
	   The bank's deputy vice-president for East Asia and the Pacific,
Julian Schweitzer, said Indonesia must protect billions of dollars
in aid for a growing number people slipping into poverty.
	   ``Social safety net programs must be allowed to work swiftly and
cleanly,'' he said.
	   He said that this was essential to the continued delivery of
financial aid needed to prop up the economy, hit by soaring
inflation and massive recession.
	   ``International donors will be watching very carefully to see
how things go in the delivery of food, medicines and other
essentials to the needy. This is a major test of sincerity,'' he
said.
	   Schweitzer identified the distribution of rice to the poor as a
major need.
	   Rice is the staple food for Indonesia's 202 million people. Its
price has tripled in the past few months despite government
attempts to control the market, which many say has also is riddled
with corruption.
	   He said the bank would propose that Indonesia's bureaucracy and
legal system be reformed so that incentives for bribery would
eliminated and the rights of citizens protected.
	   The bank's representative in Indonesia, Dennis de Tray, said it
would provide a loan to Indonesia to help implement the plan. He
did not say how much this would be.
	   The push to attack corruption has gained momentum since May when
former President Suharto quit amid riots and protests following 32
autocratic years in power.
	   Suharto is currently at the center of a corruption investigation
and faced initial questioning about his assets earlier this week.
Opponents say he amassed a fortune and misused his power so that
his family and friends could build huge business empires.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing.
	   The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Indonesian
officials were believed to have taken more than 20 percent of World
Bank project money allocated to the island nation.
	   De Tray has acknowledged that corruption had been a problem, but
that the claim that 20 percent of aid funds had been siphoned off
was not based on hard facts or legal evidence.

Takanohana, Wakanohana keep two-way lead at 11-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozunas (grand champions) Takanohana and
Wakanohana kept a two-way tie for the lead at 11-1 Thursday with
three days left in the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Hawaii-born yokozuna Akebono trailed the co-leaders at 9-3 by
beating ozeki (champion) Musashimaru, also from Hawaii.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, charged Musashimaru, or Fiamalu
Penitani, with fierce hand thrusts against his foe's throat and
drove him to the ring's edge.
	   Akebono then quickly pulled his opponent down, handing
Musashimaru his fourth defeat against eight victories.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 20th tournament victory following a
triumph in the last tournament, fought off No. 6 maegashira (senior
wrestler) Tochinonada's arm throw attempt and sent him out, leaving
Tochinonada at 6-6.
	   In the day's final bout, Wakanohana, Takanohana's elder brother,
slapped down No. 3 maegashira Tamakasuga after clashing hard
against him in the initial charge. Tamakasuga is 5-7.
	   In other major bouts, ozeki Takanonami grabbed No. 4 maegashira
Wakanosato's belt and bulldozed him out for his seventh victory
against five defeats. Wakanosato is 6-6.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotakiai charged equally-ranked
Takatoriki with a series of hand thrusts and sent him out from
behind for his eighth victory against four defeats. Takatoriki is
5-7.
	   No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was
thrown down by No. 10 maegashira Kaiho (6-6) for his eighth defeat
against four victories.
	   Kyokushuzan may be demoted from the present rank before the next
tournament in Kyushu beginning Nov. 8.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
crushed No. 2-ranked Dewaarashi for his sixth victory against six
defeats. Dewaarashi is 5-7.
	   No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
forced out No. 17-ranked Kitazakura (7-5) for his eighth victory
against four defeats.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 20-ranked Wakaazuma
(4-2), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, sent out No. 17-ranked
Tamanokuni from behind.
	   But No. 12-ranked Kaishinzan (4-2), or American Henry Armstrong
Miller, was sent out by No. 18-ranked Towanoyama.
	   No. 45-ranked Kitaazuma (3-3), or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda from
Sao Paulo, was slapped down by No. 42-ranked Akinohana.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 2-ranked
Ikemori (3-3), or Brazilian Luis go Ikemori from Sao Paulo, was
sent out by No. 7-ranked Kotohino.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

U.S. central bank chairman creates heyday in Asian markets, too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Hong Kong, Singapore and South
Korea markets closing higher, new midday figure in Thailand, and
London's stock market opening higher. &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The clearest sign yet that the United States plans
to lower interest rates proved as magical on Asia's stock markets
Thursday as it did on Wall Street.
	   Moments after they opened, the region's three top bourses shot
skyward. By the end of the day, Hong Kong's had jumped 4.4 percent,
Singapore's 3.4 percent, and Japan's 3.02 percent.
	   Fourteen months after Asia's financial crisis began, two of the
area's hardest-hit markets were doing even better. Thailand's main
stock index was 9.2 percent higher by midday, and South Korea's
closed with a 6.4 percent improvement.
	   As trading began in Europe on Thursday, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 1.8 percent at 5,309.5
in the first hour on the Stock Exchange in London.
	   One after another, Asian analysts attributed the good day to
U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. On Wednesday, he gave
the clearest indication yet that he'll fight the global economic
crisis with lower U.S. interest rates.
	   In Washington, Greenspan told a U.S. Senate panel that Fed
officials know they have to act quickly to contain the global
crisis. And many traders read that as a clear indication of an
interest rate cut at next week's Fed meeting.
	   Greenspan said, ``I think we know where we have to go'' in
dealing with the crisis, which has since spread from Asia to
Russia, and is now threatening Latin America as well.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average responded by
rising 3.3 percent to 8,154.41, its highest finish in a month.
	   The big gain lifted the Dow more than 200 points above this
year's starting point. But that still left the blue-chip barometer
nearly 1,200 points below its July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   Economists often disagree over whether a small U.S. interest
rate cut would have much of a long-term impact on other countries,
especially the markets of Asia, where some countries are working
hard to overhaul the structures of their battered economies.
	   But a cut in U.S. lending rates could help bolster global
confidence by showing that the United States will continue to serve
as an economic engine for the rest of the world.
	   Whatever the outcome, Asian markets are always looking for any
kind of good news. Earlier this month, stocks also rose when
Greenspan first hinted at a pending interest rate cut.
	   In Japan, where the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
reached its lowest level in 12 years on Monday, it surged 415.97
points to close at 14,205.78 Thursday.
	   ``There was nothing in the market today to oppose such bullish
incentives,'' said Masaaki Higashida, a manager of the investment
information and services department at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
	   But he warned that the rebound could be temporary as the city's
stock market lacks energy for a full-scale recovery without an
improvement in economic fundamentals.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 330.22 points to
close at 7,834.61. And Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index
jumped 30.99 points to close at 931.98.
	   Despite the rallies in these and other Asian countries, Abhilit
Chakrabortti, a regional analyst for HSBC Securities Asia Ltd. in
Hong Kong, said the outlook in Asia remains pessimistic.
	   ``We've seen tens of thousands of these rebounds this year,'' he
said in an interview.
	   In addition to Greenspan's remark, Chakrabortti said, the Asian
markets are reacting to what could be diminishing prospects of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's impeachment, and hopes of ``concerted
efforts to get things in Latin America right.''
	   He said a substantial cut or a series of cuts in U.S. interest
rates could help Asian economies recover somewhat.
	   They would boost currency liquidity in the United States and in
turn increase Asia's much needed export trade and stabilize the
Asian currencies and interest rates, he said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NATO ambassadors giving green light for Kosovo
buildup; fighting continuing. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces struck
deeper into the last pockets of separatist Kosovo Albanian
resistance Thursday, ignoring U.N. and NATO moves that opened the
door for a military strike against them.
	   Artillery boomed across the central Drenica region of the
Serbian province Thursday, and Serb police sources said they cut
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army forces in two by taking over
a main road that passes through the last pocket of ethnic Albanian
resistance.
	   ``The terrorists are now surrounded in several Drenica
villages,'' said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity,
alluding to KLA members.
	   The offensive continued despite a U.N. Security Council warning
Wednesday threatening further action unless the fighting stopped.
While not specifically mandating NATO action, the resolution opened
the way for international approval of involvement by the military
alliance.
	   On the heels of that move, NATO ambassadors meeting in Portugal
on Thursday approved increased planning for air strikes in Kosovo.
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the decision takes the
organization ``to an increased level of military preparedness''
without actually approving the use of force.
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population
_ are overwhelmingly in favor of independence. World powers back
autonomy for Kosovo instead, arguing that independence can be
achieved only through prolonged, and spreading, bloodshed.
	   Most victims of the Serb-Yugoslav military campaign have been
Albanian civilians. Upward of 275,000 people have been driven from
hundreds of destroyed villages, including an estimated 50,000
people who have no shelter. They face the risk of death when winter
strikes.
	   That risk is driving Western efforts to get a commitment from
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the government
offensive and permit mass refugee returns.
	   Refugee numbers were swollen by the latest fighting, with up to
20,000 civilians fleeing their homes in the Drenica area, west and
southwest of Pristina.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians patrolled nearly all routes into the region, tightening
the noose on several hundred lightly armed rebels.
	   The U.N. resolution _ the toughest action the council has taken
to date _ came less than 24 hours before the NATO defense
ministers' meeting in Portugal.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.''

Sanchez-Vicario, Seles advances to quarterfinals

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario ousted Elena
Likhovtseva of Russia 6-0, 6-4 on Thursday, advancing to the Toyota
Princess Cup quarterfinals.
	   Defending champion and second-seeded Monica Seles has already
reached the third round Wednesday by beating Naoko Sawamatsu of
Japan, who retired after the match from a six-year career on the
WTA Tour.
	   Seles, seeking her fifth victory of the tournament, faces No. 29
Julie Halard-Decugis of of France in the quarterfinals.
	   Sanchez Vicario, fresh from helping lift Spain to a 3-2 victory
against Switzerland in the Fed Cup final last week, said she was
happy with the way she played after having only one day to prepare
for the Toyota Princess Cup.
	   ``I am happy to win the first match after a long flight from
Europe and not having so much time to recover,'' she said. ``The
first match is the hardest one because I have a bye and the other
player has already played one match.''
	   ``I have a good memory from last week, but now I'm focused about
this tournament. I'll try to do my best and play as good as I can,
and see how it goes,'' said the world's No. 4 player. She is
currently ranked behind Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Jana
Novotna, who all skipped the Toyota Princess.
	   In the Fed Cup final in Geneva, which she says was ``a very
close, very emotional and very tough'' contest, Sanchez Vicario
combined with No. 7 Conchita Martinez to win the tiebreaking double
match last Sunday.
	   Martinez and Sanchez Vicario have led Spain to all five of its
Fed Cup titles.
	   In Thursday's match, No. 26 Likhovtseva shifted her tactics and
showed more interest in coming to the net in the second set,
volleying and winning some key points and four games.
	   Likhovtseva has now lost four of five lifetime meetings against
the Spaniard.
	   Sanchez Vicario is seeking her second victory of this
tournament. She won the title along with the doubles event in 1994.
	   Martinez also has skipped the Toyota Princess.
	   In the quarterfinals, Sanchez Vicario will face another Russian
player, fifth-seeded and up-and-coming Anna Kournikova. On
Thursday, Kournikova beat Taiwan's Wang Shi-tung 6-0, 6-4.
	   In her best finish this season, the 17-year-old Kournikova,
ranked 14th in the world, was the runner-up in the Lipton
Championships in March.
	   In an upset Thursday, No. 65 Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus
went full set to defeat fourth seed Dominique Van Roost of Belgium
3-6, 6-3, 7-5. Van Roost is 11th-ranked.
	   In the quarterfinals, Barabanschikova will face seventh-seeded
Anke Huber of Germany, who eliminated Li Fang of Taiwan 7-5, 6-3.
	   Huber, No. 21 in the world, said ``it was not the best match of
my career but I am happy to get through it.'' She's making her
debut in the Toyota Princess along with Kournikova.
	   ``Olga played very good today,'' Huber added. ``She beat Van
Roost, so she is in good shape and playing well. She obviously
likes the surface and the site. I'll have to play better than today
to win tomorrow.''
	   None of the players from host Japan survived the second round in
the singles and the first round of the doubles.

Construction worker crushed by bricks on Olympic site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A bricklayer died Thursday when he was
crushed by falling bricks at the Sydney 2000 Olympic village site,
the first casualty since the Games construction program began in
1992.
	   The man had been working under a two-story scaffolding when
about 80 bricks fell 6 feet (1.8 meters) onto him from a loading
bay, a spokeswoman for construction watchdog the Workcover
Authority said.
	   An ambulance paramedic rescue team treated the man at the scene
before he was transferred to hospital in a critical condition. He
was dead on arrival.
	   An Olympic Coordination Authority spokesman said the Games
construction program had been operating since 1992.
	   ``This is the first death to have occurred during this time,''
said the spokesman, on condition of anonymity.
	   Up to 4,000 workers are involved in building projects each day
at the Olympic site.
	   Developer Mirvac Lend Lease Village Consortium expressed sorrow
at the death.
	   Consortium chief executive Hugh Martin said the dead man was one
of eight bricklayers and scaffolders working on 14 houses at the
site. The man's colleagues had been given counseling.
	   The consortium was cooperating with a WorkCover investigation
into the death, Martin said.
	   A coroner has been provided with a brief on the incident and a
post mortem examination would be conducted on the man on Friday.
	   The man's name has not been released by police.

Doctors transplant hand on accident victim, claim a first
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ An international team of doctors
transplanted a hand on an accident victim overnight, claiming a
medical breakthrough, a hospital said Thursday.
	   The right hand and forearm of an anonymous donor was attached to
the arm of a 48-year-old man whose own hand was amputated in 1989
after an accident, Edouard Herriot Hospital said in a statement.
	   In the operation, doctors attached ``all the arteries, veins,
nerves, tendons, muscles and skin after setting the two bones of
the forearm,'' the statement said.
	   The operation was the result of recent advances in microsurgery
and transplant techniques, the hospital said.
	   The team was headed by Jean-Michel Dubernard, head of transplant
surgery at the hospital, and Earl Owen, director of the Center for
Microsurgery in Sydney, Australia.
	   Other doctors on the team included Marco Lanzetta of the
University of Milan, Italy, Hari Kapila of Sydney, and Nadey Hakim
of Saint Mary's Hospital in London.
	   The team in Lyon was competing with other surgeons.
	   In July, a team of surgeons in Louisville, Kentucky said they
expected to perform such an operation by year's end.
	   They said such an operation could initiate a new era of
transplantation, with the potential to restore hope to thousands of
people with congenital defects and disfiguring injuries.
	   Such a transplant, however, faces risks. Patients must take
anti-rejection drugs that can be potentially fatal.

Protesting farmers demand agrarian reform, return of Suharto ranch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads to UPDATE with some color of Jakarta protest, grafs 3-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Irate farmers demanding agrarian
reform demonstrated outside Parliament on Thursday while others in
a nearby city called for the return of land allegedly seized by
former President Suharto.
	   About 300 farmers and students assembled outside the gates of
the legislature as about 100 riot police looked on.
	   While waiting for their representatives meeting with lawmakers,
some of the farmer performed a tradition martial art, named Dabus _
slicing their hands and other parts of the bodies with knives and
daggers.
	   On the background was a big banner that said, ``Land for
Farmers,'' and a small poster saying, ``Uphold Human Rights, Return
Farmers' Land.'' About 30 policemen tightly guarded the main
entrance of the parliament.
	   More than 100 students from the state-run University of
Indonesia joined the farmers, many of whom were calling for return
of land seized years ago.
	   ``Thanks to reform, we have got back our land seized for 15
years,'' said Abdul Kasim, a farmer from Lampung, suouthern
Sumatra. ``But our fellows in other regions still have to struggle
for theirs. They need support.''
	   Many farmers are among the worst hit by a deep economic crisis
now gripping the world's fourth most populous nation. The
protesters said they wanted soaring prices to be controlled and a
liberalization of land ownership.
	   Thursday was Indonesian National Farmers' Day.
	   Meanwhile, in Bogor, 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of Jakarta,
about 20 police officers equipped with tear gas canisters and
sticks were on hand, when 200 farmers staged a peaceful protest at
a local government office.
	   ``Return the people's land looted by Suharto,'' read one protest
banner.
	   The group, calling itself the ``Indonesian Farmers'
Solidarity,'' alleges that 450 hectares (1,110 acres) of Suharto's
700-hectare (1,730-acre) Tri-S Tapos ranch rightfully belongs to
them.
	   They claim Suharto, who quit the presidency after riots in May,
seized the land illegally in the 1970s.
	   Farmers around the ranch said they had cultivated the land for
many years before they were pushed out.
	   The ranch sits in lush, hilly country and is considered one of
Indonesia's foremost cattle breeding and producing ranches.
	   Several months ago some farmers moved into the land and planted
crops but were later ordered out by police.

Slovakia's hard-line ruler in electoral fight for survival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Two-day voting starts at 1200 GMT Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The billboards across Slovakia
seemed innocuous enough, depicting rugged mountains, lush green
countryside and a campaign pitch for Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's leadership: ``The country of your heart.''
	   The problem, as the opposition revealed during a particularly
bitter parliamentary election campaign that ended this week: The
country was Switzerland.
	   Meciar's self-portrayal as father of a modern, prosperous nation
faces a severe test Friday and Saturday as voters decide whether to
give his hard-line ruling party four more years in power.
	   Opposition parties, who accuse Meciar's government of marching
this central European country away from democracy, claim the
controversial billboard _ since removed _ typifies a penchant to
let nothing get in its way: not its opponents, the law, the media
or the facts.
	   ``Dictators cannot rule us any more,'' says Mikulas Dzurinda,
head of the Slovak Democratic Coalition and the leading candidate
to replace Meciar as premier. ``Disregard for the law cannot take
place any more.''
	   Opinion polls indicate that opposition forces likely have the
best chance to form the next government if they join together after
the vote as promised. But it may take weeks to determine who can
put together a ruling coalition.
	   Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia likely will get the
first chance, since it is favored to receive the most votes of any
party. It retains a loyal following among older, rural and less
educated voters as well as among business and industry, dependent
on his government.
	   ``Slovakia will never be like Switzerland,'' said pensioner
Jozef Galanda at a recent rally for the ruling party, known widely
by its Slovak acronym HZDS. ``But I still support Meciar. He speaks
the truth.''
	   Backers of the populist-nationalist party say Meciar has
provided firm leadership at a time of economic and political
turmoil in the region during his nearly seven years at Slovakia's
helm. The economy has grown, the military is well-regarded and he
has been a staunch defender of national interests, they say.
	   But critics, including Slovakia's European neighbors, say his
main priority has been consolidating his party's power while
shunning free-market and democratic reforms.
	   Living standards remain well behind those of the Czech Republic,
its former partner in Czechoslovakia before the two became separate
countries in 1993. Foreign economists and diplomats say the Slovak
economy has been held artificially stable in the runup to elections
and is due for a blowup soon.
	   In tightening its grip in the past two years the Slovak
government has effectively turned its back on the West, even as the
Czechs and Hungarians move toward swift entry into NATO and the
European Union. Concerned European officials say Slovakia is
becoming an ``island'' in the region while others catch up to the
West and adopt more open standards regarding media freedoms,
electoral law and privatization.
	   ``Meciar was repeatedly warned by the West Europeans and the
U.S.: 'If you want to join the 21st century and be a modern
democratic country, this is what you should do,''' says a Western
diplomat who declines to be named. ``He's decided against it every
time.''
	   Emblematic of the ruling party's desperation in an uphill race,
state-controlled Slovak Television violated the ban on campaigning
in the last 48 hours before the vote by airing an appeal by a top
ruling party official Wednesday night.
	   Appealing to Slovak nationalism, Parliament chairman Ivan
Gasparovic said: ``Find a moment for thinking of who has given you
the chance of living in a free, independent country, who has
staunchly defended its national interests and who has opened the
way towards advanced European countries.''
	   Preliminary results from the voting are expected Sunday.

Taiwan moves to scrap law on media controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's cabinet ruled to scrap the
publications law Thursday, calling it a holdover from an era of
heavy-handed state press control that clashed with the island's
newly opening society.
	   The law on publications, enacted 70 years ago and amended
numerous times, was ``incompatible with the spirit of the age,''
said government spokesman Chen Chien-jen.
	   Many of the law's articles beget ``controversies over thought
control and no longer suit the needs of the new environment,'' Chen
said. Numerous other laws already legislate sexual content in the
media, libel, defamation, and registration of publications, he
said.
	   Taiwan's Nationalist Party rulers harshly limited freedom of
speech under martial law, arresting writers and closing
publications that criticized the government or called for
democratic freedoms.
	   Most strictures were lifted soon after martial law ended in
1987, and Taiwan's media is now one of the most lively and diverse
in Asia, although the Nationalists still wield considerable
influence over the three main television networks.

Shares end higher on hopes for U.S. interest rates cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices closed sharply higher
Thursday, buoyed by expectations of U.S. interest rates cuts.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index was up 330.22 points, or 4.4
percent, to close at 7,834.61.
	   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments on Wednesday
on possible interest rates cuts buoyed sentiment in Wall Street,
which gained 3.3 percent to close at 8,154.41. The overnight gain
helped bolster local market sentiment, analysts said.
	   Trading volume was worth 6.84 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 888 million), more than double Wednesday's 3.01 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 390 million).
	   Investors bought shares despite assurances that the Fed would
immediately cut rates at its next Federal Open Market Committee
meeting next Tuesday, said Frederick Tsang of DBS Securities Hong
Kong Ltd..
	   HSBC Holdings was the day's biggest gainer, up 6.50 to close at
144.50. Other gainers were Hutchison Whampoa, up 2.40 to close at
39.80, and Cheung Kong Holdings, up 2.20 to close at 34.60.
	   The day's only loser was Hong Kong Telecom, which dropped 0.15
to close at 26.45.
	   Hong Kong's flag-carrier Cathay Pacific was up 0.25 to close at
7.15.

Italian TV reported ready for alliance with Murdoch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian state television group RAI is likely to give
the go-ahead for a digital alliance with Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., a RAI board member said in an interview published Thursday.
	   Telecommunications group Telecom Italia SpA is expected to
decide on the future of its digital pay-TV unit Stream at a board
meeting Friday. According to a recent report in the daily La
Repubblica, News Corp. wants a 40 percent stake in Stream.
	   RAI board member Alberto Contri told the newspaper Il
Messaggero: ``I think that, after setting a few criteria, we will
end up approving the plan on which our partner Telecom Italia is
already working.''
	   ``I say, if you cannot beat an opponent, join him,'' Contri
added. The conditions he listed included an Italian core group
keeping an absolute majority and a pledge from Murdoch not to go
into non-pay TV.
	   The Repubblica report said Murdoch will pay Telecom, which owns
100 percent of Stream, between dlrs 1,500 and dlrs 2,000 for each
of its 80,000 subscribers.
	   RAI could also take a 10 percent to 15 percent stake, while
Telecom Italia would retain at least 51 percent, according to
earlier reports.

Government suspends deportations after Nigerian woman's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Belgian government Thursday
suspended the deportation of asylum seekers from Brussels
international airport after a Nigerian woman died following a
struggle with police.
	   Two policemen have been charged with assault in Tuesday's death
of Semira Adamu, a 20-year-old woman who resisted police efforts to
get her on a Togo-bound plane. Police subdued her by putting a
pillow on her face. She lapsed into a coma and died afterwards.
	   On Thursday, the police union called on its members to refuse
cooperation in any forced expulsion of asylum seekers.
	   Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her
family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has
three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her
refugee status.

NATO finalizing preparations for military action against
</HEADLINE>
Yugoslavia &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with activation order, start of meeting, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ The NATO allies moved a step closer
Thursday toward launching military strikes against Yugoslavia if
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic fails to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo province.
	   NATO ambassadors, meeting in a special session in Vilaohere,
approved an ``activation warning'' for a military campaign,
preparing for both ``limited'' and ``phased'' air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the decision ``takes
NATO to an increased level of military preparedness.''
	   He said military commanders will now identify countries
participating in air strikes and the kind of hardware they will put
at NATO's disposal.
	   ``Let me stress that the use of force will require further
decisions'' by the NATO governments, Solana said in a brief
statement to reporters.
	   To date, only Germany and The Netherlands have publicly said
they will contribute jet fighters for the mission.
	   The NATO action came 12 hours after the U.N. Security Council
passed a resolution demanding a cease-fire in Kosovo, and
threatening further action if fighting continues. It urged both
sides to start negotiating a solution and demanded that Milosevic
allow international monitoring in Kosovo and the safe return of
refugees.
	   The meeting of the NATO envoys was followed by a meeting of NATO
defense ministers. For the first time, the defense ministers of
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ three nations due to join
NATO in April _ participated in the meeting.
	   In recent months, officials in NATO capitals have made tough
statements but that has not been enough to get Milosovic to back
down in his offensive against separatist ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo. The war there has killed hundreds of people and left almost
300,000 people homeless, of whom some 50,000 are camped out in the
countryside in appalling conditions. Ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the population of Kosovo.
	   ``This is the last clear warning that should not be
underestimated by anyone ... Increasingly, people realize that a
lot of time has been wasted,'' said German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe.
	   He added, ``Pictures of people (in Kosovo) camping out in the
open ... are in themselves an ultimatum'' to Milosevic that the
allies will no longer tolerate the accumulation of horror,
especially not at the outset of another winter.
	   Solana said the NATO allies warmly welcomed the U.N. resolution
which passed by a 14-0 vote with only China abstaining in the
Security Council.
	   ``This resolution makes clear what President Milosevic must
do,'' said Solana. ``He must stop his repressive actions against
the population, he must seek a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis based on negotiations as must Kosovar Albanians, and he must
take immediate steps to alleviate the humanitarian situation...''
	   Attacks by Serb forces in Kosovo have continued despite NATO
threats of retaliation. The allies have staged air and ground
exercises in Albania and Macedonia but these have not frightened
the Yugoslav leader.
	   Hampering the allies have been disagreements over whether or not
they need a formal mandate from the United Nations before stepping
in.
	   The latest U.N. resolution cited Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter,
which allows for the use of force if regional peace and security is
threatened. It did not explicitly authorize member states to
intervene in Kosovo and said ``the council would consider further
action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace and
stability in the region,'' if no political deal is reached.
	   France has been pushing hard for U.N. endorsement of any
military action. The United States believes no such mandate is
required. In Germany, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe _ in
the heat of a general election campaign _ have disagreed publicly
on the issue.

Japan opposition party head rejects compromise plan on banking
</HEADLINE>
crisis
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's largest opposition party rejected the
government's latest proposal on banking reform on Thursday, leaving
the two camps split despite pledges to cooperate to resolve the
nation's banking crisis.
	   Naoto Kan, leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, said his
party would not accept a ruling party plan to use 17 trillion yen
(dlrs 124 billion) in public money to protect depositors at banks
which must be nationalized.
	   Kan, speaking later after a meeting of party executives, said
parts of the proposal were inconsistent with a ``basic agreement''
on banking reform reached between the two sides last Friday.
	   ``I would like them to bring something that is based upon our
agreement,'' Kan said. ``What is the point of having this meeting
if they keep bringing us things that go against the agreement?''
	   He didn't elaborate on which parts were inconsistent. But the
plan did not specify under what terms the public aid would be
provided _ terms that the opposition has demanded be accompanied by
more stringent disclosure requirements for failed banks.
	   The repudiation of the plan comes amid intense political
jockeying over the details of a vaguely-worded pact reached last
week to deal with a banking industry awash in about dlrs 1 trillion
of bad loans.
	   Earlier Thursday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, just back from
discussing Japan's banking woes with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
pledged to work out a compromise over the fate of the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., one of the country's largest
banks.
	   ``It's desirable to deal with it under a new framework,'' Obuchi
said in testimony before Parliament. He did not provide any
details.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, rumored to be on the verge of
insolvency, has taken center stage in the standoff with the
opposition over broader bank reform.
	   The government's latest proposal, a copy of which was provided
by opposition party officials, calls for putting the LTCB under
state control. But it contains no mention of what will ultimately
become of the bank.
	   The government seems determined not to let the LTCB fail
outright, citing the potential damage to confidence in the entire
banking system.
	   ``Failure of a major bank would have negative effect on and
create substantial costs for the economy,'' said Obuchi, who also
indicated his support for merging the LTCB with suitor Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Co.
	   But opposition lawmakers appear reluctant to sign onto a bailout
package which sets a precedent for sticking taxpayers with the
bill.
	   The debate over the LTCB comes as the government has tried to
broker a deal with the opposition over a larger package of six
bills designed to revitalize the banking system by making it easier
for banks to rid themselves of bad loans.
	   But Parliament has been deadlocked as the debate rages over what
to do with troubled lenders which could face bankruptcy.
	   Another issue still separating the two sides is the
determination of exactly when Japan's powerful Finance Ministry
will relinquish its policy-planning and regulatory control over the
financial industry.

After crash, troubles, third Ariane 5 set for Oct. 20
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After a crash and a troubled launch, a third Ariane
5 will be test-shot next month after technicians modified the new,
larger rocket developed by the European Space Agency.
	   The Ariane 5, which the European consortium hopes will keep them
leading in the world's commercial launch market, will blast off
Oct. 20 from Guiana Space Center near Kourou, French Guiana, ESA
said in a statement Wednesday night.
	   The third launch, Flight 503, ``is the final qualification
flight,'' said the joint statement by ESA and Arianespace, the
agency's commercial arm.
	   ESA said reviews of the modification and testing at Kourou, on
the northeastern end of South American, ``were progressing
correctly.''
	   ESA said in June that trouble with the Ariane 5 forced officials
to switch a Eutelsat satellite to the older Ariane 4.
	   Flight 503 will instead carry a mockup of Eutelsat's W2
satellite and an ``Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator,'' ESA said.
	   In February, Arianespace admitted that the second launch of the
rocket last Oct. 30 experienced problems, after the first Ariane 5
launch from Guiana Space Center crashed in June 1996.
	   Officials said the second rocket had a ``higher-than-expected
roll'' after separating from its booster.

Russian inflation up 67 percent since August; expected to worsen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with additional comments from Primakov, economic
forecasts from Central Bank. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's inflation rate has skyrocketed to 67
percent since last month, and the Central Bank said Thursday the
worst was still ahead _ price hikes could approach 300 percent by
year's end.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has been in office for
almost two weeks, but has yet to offer a comprehensive economic
plan, pledged strong steps to stabilize the crumbling economy.
	   He said the new government would pay wage arrears to workers and
soldiers, offer compensation to offset the painful effects of
inflation, and impose greater state control on the alcohol
industry, a leading source of government tax revenue.
	   Primakov also blamed his predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, for
igniting the crisis last month. Primakov claimed that Kiriyenko's
Aug. 17 announcement on devaluing the ruble and restructuring
government debt was made without the consent of President Boris
Yeltsin and that the results had been ``chaotic.''
	   ``It is essential to do everything to prevent the Aug. 17
statement ... from leading to dangerous socio-economic
consequences,'' said Primakov, speaking at the start of a cabinet
meeting.
	   Yeltsin has remained largely in the background since the crisis
erupted. The president has never shown an appetite for handling
day-to-day policy matters, and as with past government failures, he
has responded by blaming subordinates and sacking them.
	   Meanwhile, inflation figures released Thursday confirmed what
Russians already knew _ prices have been going up by the day.
	   Inflation is up 67 percent since the crisis began five weeks
ago, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   The Central Bank forecast that the rate could reach 240 to 290
percent by year's end, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The prediction was based on a ruble rate of 20 to the U.S.
dollar. The ruble dipped to 20 earlier this month, but was trading
Thursday at around 15 to the dollar. It had been holding steady at
just over six to the dollar when the crisis began.
	   The weaker currency means that Russia's many imports are more
expensive, which fuels inflation.
	   The country suffered from hyperinflation in the early 1990s as
it began its rocky transition to a market economy, but prices had
become more stable in recent years.
	   Until August, inflation was running at less than 1 percent a
month and was expected to be under 10 percent for the entire year,
which would have been the best performance since the market reforms
began.
	   Now, Russia is once again threatened with hyperinflation. The
government is broke, and if Primakov wants to pay off wage debts
and bail out ailing banks, he appears to have few choices besides
printing money.
	   But that option will also make inflation worse. The Central Bank
said budget demands could require the printing of up to 40 billion
to 50 billion new rubles, which would greatly increase the money
supply.
	   Russia's present money supply has been put at 120 billion to 150
billion rubles, according to media reports.
	   In another dose of bad news, Russia's hard currency reserves
have dipped to dlrs 12 billion, down from dlrs 12.3 billion a week
earlier, the Central Bank said.
	   No reason was given for the drop, though Russian media reports
said that the Central Bank has been trying to support the ruble.
The ruble has strengthened a bit in the past few days, but remains
highly unstable.

Thousands join Istanbul's mayor to protest his ban from politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Istanbul's pro-Islamic mayor and tens of
thousands of his supporters assailed Turkey's justice system
Thursday, a day after an appeals court upheld the mayor's prison
sentence in a major blow to his political career.
	   ``This sentence has shaken the belief of millions of people in
justice,'' Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, while crowds gathered
outside shouting slogans.
	   ``Tell us to die, we will die. Tell us to shoot, we will
shoot,'' the crowd screamed.
	   ``My people will decide on my position in politics, not someone
else,'' Erdogan said, expressing his innocence and describing the
sentence as a political plot by his opponents to prevent the rise
of his Islamic Virtue Party.
	   Erdogan, seen as a future leader of the movement, will never be
eligible to run for any political office, according to Turkish law.
	   He was convicted of inciting religious hatred by reading a poem
in southeastern city of Siirt at a rally last year.
	   Erdogan, 43, has two weeks to ask the appeals court to again
review the case. Appeals courts very rarely overturn their own
verdicts.
	   In accordance with the sentence, Erdogan will be unseated as
mayor of Istanbul, Turkey's largest city with 10 million people,
probably before general and local elections in April. He will be
eligible for parole after serving about one-third of the sentence.
	   He had hoped to take over the leadership of Virtue, the new
Islamic party formed to replace the Welfare party, which was closed
down by the Constitutional Court in February for anti-secular
activity.
	   The fiercely secular military was instrumental in outlawing
Welfare, and maintains pressure on the government to crack down on
what it perceives as Islamic threats.

Myanmar government organizes public rally to denounce opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government organized a
public rally Thursday to denounce the party of pro-democracy leader
Aung San Suu Kyi, accusing the opposition of having disrupted
national unity by demanding that Parliament be convened.
	   A crowd of about 20,000 people, including representatives from
non-governmental organizations and the private sector, gathered at
the national indoor sports stadium to listen to speeches attacking
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.
	   Participants accused the opposition party of threatening
national security and economic development in collusion with
foreigners.
	   ``We urge the government to take action against the NLD to
ensure peace and stability for the Myanmar people,'' said Daw San
Phyu Phyu, who represented the Myanmar Women's Entrepreneurs
Association.
	   Suu Kyi, the Nobel Prize winner, and nine colleagues announced
last week that they would function as the country's Parliament to
fill in for representatives elected in 1990, but never allowed to
take their seats.
	   The party said it had the mandate of 251 elected NLD
representatives.
	   But the military government has warned the NLD leadership that
attempting to convene a session of Parliament would be illegal.
	   NLD said Thursday that the government has so far arrested 912 of
its members in a bid to prevent the opposition from convening the
assembly. The mass arrest, which began in May and intensified in
September, constitutes the largest clampdown against the opposition
since the early 1990s.
	   Meanwhile, Myanmar's state-run media continue their attacks
against Suu Kyi and the NLD, saying the party should be declared an
unlawful association.
	   Cartoons and articles carried in official newspapers demand
action be taken against the NLD, while statements from ethnic
groups denouncing the party's move to convene Parliament have also
been published.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, was a fractious parliamentary
democracy after gaining independence from Britain in 1948. In 1962,
Gen. Ne Win seized power in a coup d'etat. The country has been
ruled by military governments in various forms ever since.

Kohl's challenger: from humble childhood to media star

 &UR; With Germany Politics &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The man who wants to knock Chancellor
Helmut Kohl out of power wears natty suits, squeezes in a game of
tennis when he can and talks about becoming Germany's chief
executive.
	   Flash back two decades: Schroeder was a young lawyer and a
self-declared Marxist. Collar-length hair spilled onto his
turtleneck. He even defended a terrorist suspect in court.
	   The 54-year-old state governor of Lower Saxony stands for a
postwar generation in German politics rooted in the left-wing
student movement of the 1970s that has never gotten a shot at
governing the nation.
	   But much like U.S. President Bill Clinton, Schroeder learned to
widen his voter appeal by making himself over as a moderate. He's
put his Social Democrats within reach of regaining power in the
Sept. 27 election after 16 years of conservative rule.
	   The bright smile oozing statesmanlike confidence, the snappy
soundbites, his fashionable young wife _ they feed Schroeder's
image as a force for change as the nation tires of Kohl, 68.
	   And despite three failed marriages, the son of a cleaning lady
from Germany's Protestant north is one of the nation's most popular
politicians.
	   Schroeder is equally at home smoking cigars with business pals _
he sits on the supervisory board of automaker Volkswagen _ and
passionately pleading for a fairer society.
	   He has hewed to the left on the campaign trail, drawing
credibility from his own unprivileged childhood. He's pledging to
stop modest welfare-state reforms by Kohl's government and to curb
the gap between rich and poor.
	   Yet his ideas for tackling double-digit unemployment _ the core
campaign issue _ resemble pro-market solutions offered by Kohl's
Christian Democrats.
	   Critics label Schroeder an opportunist and a populist who will
do anything to get into power. He says he's just open to ideas.
	   Before running for the chancellery, Schroeder caused a stir with
his turbulent love life.
	   The breakup with his wife of 13 years, Hiltrud, played out
nationwide in talk shows and interviews. Irked in part by her
dabbling in environmental causes and organic food, Schroeder began
an affair with Doris Koepf, a journalist 20 years his junior.
	   They married last October, well before the election and less
than a month after his divorce came through.
	   Born April 7, 1944 in the rural Lower Saxon town of Mossenberg,
Schroeder was raised with five siblings by his mother in the tough
postwar years. He never knew his father, a fair worker who was
killed a few days after his son's birth while fighting for Hitler's
army in Romania.
	   Schroeder recalls his grandmother stealing food when he was a
boy. Later, he worked as a farmhand and in a hardware store. He
played striker on the local soccer team.
	   He joined the Social Democrats at age 19, finished high school
while holding down jobs and became an attorney in the 1970s.
	   By the 1980s, he was a member of parliament in Bonn. Once, after
a late of night of drinking, his ambitions surged out. He tugged at
the chancellery fence and shouted, ``I want to get in there.''

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hurricane Georges
charged across the Caribbean on a calamitous path toward the
Florida Keys Thursday, leaving rescuers to pull bodies from rivers,
collapsed houses and mudslides.
	   At least 110 people have died and hundreds were missing since
the sprawling storm began its rampage on Monday.
	   A hurricane warning was issued for south Florida early Thursday,
including Miami, Dade, Broward and Collier counties. A hurricane
watch was in effect for counties just to the north of that area.
	   All 80,000 residents of the Florida Keys were ordered to
evacuate Wednesday, and cars and trucks with boats in tow squeezed
onto the lone two-lane highway to the mainland.
	   Gov. Lawton Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and
southern Florida, allowing the state to use the National Guard,
lift tolls along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   Because of the storm's wobbly course, officials said 540,000
more people could be asked to leave Miami Beach and other low-lying
areas farther up the coast.
	   At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), Georges was centered 380 miles (608
kilometers) southeast of Miami, and was moving west-northwest at 10
mph (16 kph) with gusts to 80 mph (128 kph).
	   As Georges battered the northern coast of Cuba on Wednesday,
Dominican President Leonel Fernandez went on television to announce
that 70 people were dead and hundreds more were missing in his
nation alone. The missing included 45 people who disappeared when a
school shelter washed away Wednesday.
	   Officials have not even begun to reach the Dominican Republic's
hardest-hit areas, where many more victims are expected to be
found. Fernandez asked for unity and urged people to attend church
Thursday, the holy day for the nation's patron saint, Mercedes.
	   ``Pray and ask the Almighty to help the destiny of our people,''
he said.
	   In the Dominican town of San Cristobal, the Nizao River
overflowed its banks and knocked down a part of a school being used
as a shelter, killing five people and leaving 45 missing.
	   In La Cienega, a shantytown in the Dominican capital of Santo
Domingo, the swollen river stormed into thousands of homes,
covering some up to their roofs in fetid water. Residents swam to
their houses to try to retrieve some belongings, using empty water
jugs to keep afloat.
	   The government declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew, and soldiers and
police had orders to arrest anyone on the streets after drunken
looters raided stores and damaged homes.
	   Police killed two alleged looters at a shopping center Tuesday
night while 110-mph (176-kph) winds raked the Dominican capital.
From there, Georges proceeded to Haiti.
	   The flimsy housing in some areas of the Western Hemisphere's
poorest nation proved no match for the resulting flash floods, and
27 people reportedly drowned or were killed in Haiti when their
homes collapsed.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro put his Cabinet on alert and said
the armed forces would help get medicine, food and other help to
hurricane victims. Authorities evacuated 200,000 people from their
homes in Cuba's eastern provinces.
	   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people,'' Mexico's official news agency quoted Castro as saying.
``We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity.''
	   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the
government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in
Antigua.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent
hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and
utilities. On the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a
man while burglarizing his home.
	   Three people were killed directly by the storm in Puerto Rico,
where the government's insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia,
estimated damages at $1 billion. Another eight, most of them
elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the
storm.
	   The Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that a third of
Puerto Rico's power was expected to be back on Thursday but
hundreds of thousands remained without running water. Coffee and
plantain crops were badly harmed, FEMA said.
	   In the Dominican Republic, the president said 90 percent of the
country's banana and other plantations were destroyed and the sugar
crop suffered dlrs 13 million in damage.
	   He estimated it would take dlrs 113 million to rebuild the
country's electrical power system.
	   ``We are facing a Titanic task,'' Fernandez said. ``In a word,
the outlook is desolate.''

Libya replaces lawyers for two Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has replaced the lawyers for the two
suspects implicated in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, replacing them
with a government-appointed legal team, an attorney who had
represented the men said Thursday.
	   Ibrahim Legwell, the Libyan who had headed the defense team,
said he feared the change meant the case would now be focused on
political issues rather than legal points, adding he opposed such a
move.
	   ``Maybe they (Libyan officials) feel that we haven't taken
decisions according to their decision,'' Legwell said, commenting
on the reasons for replacing his legal team.
	   The new team, which is to be headed by former Foreign Minister
Kamal Mahgoub, is ``very likely'' to toe the government line in
reflecting political considerations, Legwell told The Associated
Press by telephone from his office in Tripoli.
	   ``I refused to be a part of the new team because ... it isn't
appropriate for the administration to take over,'' he added.
	   Libyan officials could not be immediately reached for comment on
Legwell's statements.
	   Libya recently accepted a U.S. and British proposal for the two
suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, to
be tried in the Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges
under Scottish law.
	   Despite U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992, Liban leader
Moammar Gadhafi refused for years to allow the men to be extradited
to the United States or Britain for trial, claiming they would not
get fair trials.
	   The sanctions, imposed to force Gadhafi to hand over the
suspects for trial, sanctions ban air travel to and from Libya,
freeze foreign assets and bar the sale of some oil equipment.
	   The two Libyans are charged in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were killed.
	   Libya still is demanding negotiations on the trial to ensure the
safety of the suspects and prevent their extradition from the
Netherlands.
	   Washington and London have said that the offer is non-negotiable
but that they are willing to discuss details through U.N.
officials.
	   Legwell said he was unsure how the decision would impact on the
prospect of the trial taking place, but added that he had been
retained by the two men and had not received word from them that
they no longer wanted his services.
	   ``The next step now depends on the (Libyan) administration),''
he said.
	   Legwell's legal colleagues, including lawyers from Britain, the
United States and the Netherlands, were expected to travel to Libya
to meet with the defendants and look into whether the U.S.-British
proposal offered the guarantees demanded by Libya.
	   But given the government's decision, ``they won't be coming,''
Legwell said.

Reactor stopped at Ukrainian nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A reactor was stopped at a Ukrainian
nuclear power plant following a leak of hydrogen from its cooling
system, officials said Thursday.
	   Reactor No. 2 at the Zaporizhya plant was stopped late on
Wednesday and repairs were expected to be completed by Saturday,
said the state nuclear energy company Energoatom. No radiation
leaks were reported.
	   The incident occurred two days after the plant's reactor No. 6
was restarted following turbine repairs.
	   Another reactor at Zaporizhya, Europe's largest nuclear power
plant, is presently undergoing repairs. The plant has six
Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors.
	   A total of 14 accidents have occurred at Zaporizhya in the first
seven months of this year, more than at any other of Ukraine's
nuclear energy facilities, according to the plant's figures.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear power plants accounting for more than
40 percent of the former Soviet republic's electricity production.

Ever underrated, German chancellor could be facing last stand
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Once written off as a provincial bumbler by
his many critics, Helmut Kohl has survived to become Germany's
longest-serving chancellor this century. In the process, he secured
a place in history.
	   Often seen as short-tempered and dull, the conservative who
united Germany in 1990 has a record of comebacks and a
self-confidence matching his massive 1.93-meter (6 foot-4 inch)
frame.
	   The ``old warhorse,'' as he calls himself, is in no mood to give
up power after 16 years of running Europe's biggest country.
	   Puffy and plodding on the campaign trial with his message of
stability, the 68-year-old incumbent is nevertheless neck-and-neck
with his Social Democratic challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, in polls
ahead of Sept. 27 elections.
	   Kohl has already governed longer than Konrad Adenauer, Germany's
first postwar chancellor and his political idol. Now he's trying to
break Adenauer's record of four consecutive terms of office and
remain the West's last Cold War leader.
	   Trusted but rarely loved by supporters, Kohl combined the
pursuit of European unity _ rooted in his family origins near
France _ with a down-to-earth feel for the worries of the average
German.
	   He was the butt of jokes until the Berlin Wall fell in November
1989 and he pushed through unification in an 11-month diplomatic
marathon.
	   But double-digit unemployment, centered on former communist East
Germany, has become a liability for the chancellor who promised the
east ``blooming landscapes.''
	   In fact, Kohl shuns nitty-gritty economic policy. He prefers
playing statesman with Germany's partners as well as Moscow, which
paid off in unification. A staunch U.S. ally, Kohl ignored protests
and approved the stationing of nuclear missiles in 1983.
	   The man who craves stuffed sow's belly and wine from his native
Palatinate region symbolizes a steadiness dear to many Germans as
well as the country's growing respect in the world.
	   To foreigners, he embodies an unaggressive Germany even after
the nation grew to 82 million with unification.
	   He was a prime mover behind Europe's soon-to-debut single
currency, portraying it as crucial to peace on a continent that
started two world wars this century.
	   Kohl has run his party, the Christian Democratic Union, with a
firm grip since 1973.
	   Born April 3, 1930 to a tax official in Ludwigshafen, an
industrial city on the Rhine near the French border, Kohl joined
the Hitler Youth but missed service in the Nazi army. His oldest
brother, Walter, was killed in action shortly before World War II
ended.
	   A Roman Catholic, he grew up and recruited for the CDU amid the
ruins of postwar Germany.
	   He studied history, writing a 1958 doctoral dissertation on
politics in his native Rhineland-Palatinate. He became governor of
the state in 1969.
	   His first attempt to unseat the government of Social Democrat
Helmut Schmidt failed in 1976. After the small Free Democratic
Party switched sides to the CDU, Kohl took power on Oct. 1, 1982.
He has defeated four Social Democratic challengers since.
	   The latest one, Schroeder, has a simple slogan: ``Thank you
Helmut, but that's enough.''

Sosa hits Nos. 64, 65 to tie MGwire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to read that 70 people died and hundreds were missing
in Dominican Republic. &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Sammy Sosa couldn't really celebrate hitting
home runs Nos. 64 and 65 to tie Mark McGwire for the record. He was
too busy worrying about others.
	   Sosa's thoughts and prayers were with his countrymen Wednesday
in the hurricane-ravaged Dominican Republic and with teammate Brant
Brown, whose error might end up costing the Cubs the National
League wild-card berth.
	   Brown dropped a fly ball that would have been the game's final
out, allowing three runs to score in Milwaukee's stunning 8-7
victory over Chicago. The Brewers had trailed 7-0.
	   Fortunately for the Cubs, the Mets lost 3-0 to the Expos, and
Chicago and New York remained tied atop the wild-card standings.
	   Sosa's homers once again put him back into the home run race
when it looked like he was all but out of it. Just a day before,
even he had conceded that McGwire would probably hold the record at
the end of the season.
	   While Sosa broke out of an 0-for-21 slump with the solo homers,
his thoughts were elsewhere after the game.
	   ``What happened to Brownie today can happen to anybody who plays
this game and I think that he has a lot of support from our team,''
Sosa said. ``We haven't given up yet. We have three games to go. We
need to just forget about it today and keep going.''
	   Sosa's slump-buster came on the same day his homeland began
recovery from Hurricane Georges, which set off looting and street
violence. At least 70 people died, hundreds more were missing and
much of the country lost power.
	   Most of Sosa's immediate family members were in Chicago, where
they had gathered for the ``Sammy Sosa Celebration'' last weekend,
but the slugger was concerned about many relatives and friends back
home.
	   ``Right now, the news that I've been hearing is it's a disaster
down there,'' Sosa said. ``It is bad.''
	   Even though Sosa jumped back into the homer race, he stuck by
his prediction that the St. Louis Cardinals slugger will emerge as
the Home Run King because he can swing for the fences with abandon
with his team out of the playoff race.
	   ``I still have that feeling for Mark. I think that he's going to
finish right in front of me,'' Sosa said. ``For me, it don't make
no difference. I think I have another thing to think about.''
	   The playoffs.
	   But you can bet he'll be keeping an eye, too, on McGwire. The
Cardinals faced Houston on Wednesday night in St. Louis, where
McGwire has hit a Busch Stadium record 33 home runs this season.
	   The Cubs slugger, picking on his favorite pitching staff,
homered against Milwaukee in the fifth and sixth innings, giving
him 12 against the Brewers this season.
	   No. 65 gave Sosa 11 multihomer games this season, tying the
major league record set by Detroit's Hank Greenberg in 1938.
	   Sosa got his first homer of the day with one out in the fifth
off rookie left-hander Rafael Roque, who also gave up McGwire's
64th homer. After walking his first two times up against Roque,
Sosa hit a 1-0 fastball to the opposite field. Then with two outs
in the sixth, he hit a 2-2 fastball to straightaway center off
rookie right-hander Rod Henderson.

Elections for Bougainville government delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Elections for a
reconciliation government for the war-torn island of Bougainville
are unlikely to be held until next year, the Papua New Guinea
government said Thursday.
	   Minister for Bougainville Affairs Sam Akoitai said a commitment
made in a peace accord between the Papua New Guinean government and
Bougainville independence rebels which called for elections by
year's end would probably not be kept.
	   The so-called Lincoln agreement signed in New Zealand last
January brought to an end an armed conflict between Bougainvillean
independence fighters and the Papua New Guinean military, the
longest war in the Pacific since World War II.
	   In addition to the election commitment, the agreement called for
a permanent cease-fire and provisions for talks on the issue of
independence for Bougainville.
	   Akoitai said a delay of a meeting between Bougainvillean and
Papua New Guinea government leaders _ which was supposed to be held
in July _ had set back the timetable for elections.
	   ``We have been delayed by about three months, so, in reality, we
are looking at an election in 1999,'' Akoitai said, noting the
meeting would probably be held next month.
	   Akoitai said he could not be more specific about the timetable
because the Bougainville peace process was ``very complicated.''
	   But he said the parties involved remain committed to the process
despite the delay.
	   Bougainville leaders are still trying to find a unified position
on issues to be discussed with the Papua New Guinea government at
the leaders' meeting, he said.

Court bars Vladivostok mayor from running again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ A city court ruled Thursday that the
mayor of Vladivostok may not run again in upcoming elections
because he illegally paid for his campaign with city money.
	   Mayor Viktor Cherepkov was found guilty of using city funds to
post campaign signs on public transportation, print personal
election messages in the city's free newspaper and dispense gifts
to local university students.
	   Cherepkov is likely to appeal the decision. If he does, he
probably will remain on the ballot regardless of what ultimately
happens in court, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   A local court would have to spend an additional 10 days
reviewing the appeal, which would extend beyond the Sept. 27
election date.
	   The squabble is the latest in a bitter turf war with the
regional government that has delayed city elections for months.
Cherepkov's term expired July 5.
	   The regional government had Cherepkov ousted in 1994 only to see
him reinstated by President Boris Yeltsin in 1996. The regional
parliament, backed by the governor, tried to boot Cherepkov from
office last September, only to be foiled again.

Norway's prime minister back on job after depression leave

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's prime minister returned to work
Thursday, after spending more than three weeks on sick leave to
recover from depression and build the strength to face challenges
that may be his hardest yet.
	   ``I've been looking forward to this day,'' Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik told reporters as he returned to work. ``This will
probably be a tough day, but I'm fit to fight.''
	   And fights are what the 51-year-old Lutheran clergyman can
expect in the coming weeks, when his minority coalition needs to
find support in parliament for its proposed 1999 national budget.
	   ``Back to a new political nightmare,'' wrote Norway's largest
newspaper, Verdens Gang. Bondevik is expected to face a tough time
over the budget even within his own governing coalition, which has
just 42 of the 165 seats in parliament.
	   Bondevik took a one-week sick leave on Aug. 30 to recover from
what his office called ``a depressive reaction to overwork.'' The
leave was extended twice to a total of 3.5 weeks.
	   In typical Nordic style, the Norwegian news media, which
generally respect the privacy of public figures, allowed Bondevik
to recover in peace.
	   Opposition politicians refused to use the sick leave against
Bondevik, and the public was largely sympathetic.
	   In a typical gesture, Bondevik's neighbors _ apparently
believing the prime minister needed a few more minutes of quiet _
tried to convince reporters gathered outside his home Thursday that
he had already left work. Bondevik was still at home.
	   The Christian Democratic prime minister's first day at work was
seen as an important test of his ability to take charge, 11 months
after he took power.
	   ``Bondevik needs to convince us that he is strong enough to be
prime minister, and that he can stand the strain,'' an editorial in
Verdens Gang said Thursday.
	   When Bondevik's black BMW rolled up to the government quarter in
Oslo, taxi driver Omed Majed, an Iranian Kurd who has lived in
Norway for 10 years, was waiting. He gave an armful of red roses to
the prime minister.
	   ``He is a good man,'' Majed said afterwards.
	   Early in his term, Bondevik had strong support in opinion polls.
However, his government has been rattled by economic pressures.
Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, has been stung by
low crude prices.
	   When he took over last October, Norway's economy was reaching
the peak of a boom that analysts said could not last. Last month,
the value of Norway's currency, the krone, was hard hit by
speculators and interest rates soared, indicating market doubts
that Bondevik's coalition had the backbone needed to cool off the
economy with tough budget cuts.
	   The moderate coalition of the Christian Democrats, the Center
and the Liberals needs support from other parties in Parliament for
what is likely to be a tight 1999 budget. Already split on where to
make cuts, newspapers said there is a good chance the coalition
could collapse over the budget.

Two Ukrainians commit double murder in search for alcohol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Two intoxicated young people in a small
village in southern Ukraine killed a food shop guard and a
pensioner while looking for more alcohol, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The unidentified suspects, arrested in the village of Novoraisk
in the Kherson region a day after the deaths, told police they
killed the guard after he refused to open the closed shop and sell
them several bottles of alcohol, the daily Kievskie Vedomosti said.
	   The two then allegedly killing a 69-year-old man who was walking

Euthanasia nurse: ``I listened to the patients''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French nurse who admitted helping about 30
elderly terminal patients to die says she was only carrying out
their requests.
	   ``I listed to these patients. I helped them,'' 28-year-old
Christine Malevre told French television Wednesday night, speaking
in public for the first time since the story broke in July.
	   ``It's true I couldn't stand their suffering, these patients who
moan, who look at you with eyes that beg you,'' she said on a talk
show on France 3 TV.
	   Malevre, suspended from her job at a hospital in Mantes-la-Jolie
west of Paris, was placed under formal investigation July 8 for the
deaths, but there have been numerous calls for leniency.
	   ``I've been criticized for being to human,'' she said. ``But in
this job, you can't be too human.''
	   Malevre said that when there is no further medication to
provide, ``when you know that medicine can't do anything more, must
you let the patients suffer, not respond to their requests?''
	   Earlier Wednesday, Health Minister Bernard Kouchner announced
100 million francs (dlrs 17.8 million) in measures to provide help
for terminal patients, including more painkilling drugs.
	   But Kouchner criticized euthanasia, ``which could seem, even at
the end of one's life, as being eugenics.''

Jilted Italian arrested after he allegedly phoned false bomb alarm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A man desperately trying to stop his
young wife from leaving Romania has admitted to phoning in a hoax
bomb alarm that delayed her Italy-bound plane, a police officer
said Thursday.
	   The Tarom Boeing 737 was delayed for three hours after a caller
warned of a bomb abroad. Police officer Marian Chirion identified
the suspect as Guido Basillo, 53.
	   He said the suspect, and Italian citizen, is not in custody and
had not yet been charged. But if charged and found guilty of
``threatening a state, an international organization, a person or a
company'' he could be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison, said
Chirion.
	   The suspect allegedly phoned in the bomb threat as the plane was
on the runway, leading to an immediate evacuation of all on board.
	   All phone calls to the airport are routinely taped as a security
precaution. Police said the voice making the threat was the same as
the one in repeated previous calls to the airport in which Basillo
identified himself and demanded to talk to his 24-year-old wife,
Ionela Mirea.
	   Chirion said Basillo acknowledged making the hoax bomb call.
	   Basillo came to live in Romania shortly after the 1989 collapse
of communism and had business interests here, the daily Evenimentul
Zilei reported. He married Mirea in July 1997 after putting a
lonely heart's ad in a provincial paper.
	   The paper said the marriage was stormy and divorce proceedings
were underway.

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ An alleged assassination attempt
against Cambodian leader Hun Sen heightened political tensions
Thursday, even as new members of Parliament were sworn in at the
country's historic Angkor Wat temple.
	   Hun Sen was unhurt, but a 12-year-old boy died when what police
said was a booby trap made with rocket-propelled grenades exploded
as the co-premier's convoy passed by.
	   The incident took place shortly before the 122 elected lawmakers
from the ruling and opposition parties gathered in traditional
formal dress at the residence of King Norodom Sihanouk to prepare
for the opening of the new session of the National Assembly.
	   The occasion was supposed to mark a major step toward restoring
political stability after bitter post-election sparring, and in a
brief speech at his royal residence the king urged national
reconciliation.
	   It followed weeks of jousting between Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian
People's Party, which captured a majority in elections held July
26, and the two opposition parties, which said Hun Sen won the
polls through fraud and intimidation.
	   Minutes after the explosion, Hun Sen looked unperturbed on his
arrival at the residence of the 75-year-old monarch.
	   Later, however, he blamed the incident on the opposition and
offered a reward if the attackers stepped forward to name the
ringleaders.
	   Previous alleged attempts on his life have served as excuses to
crack down on his opponents.
	   King Sihanouk spoke to the lawmakers before they traveled to the
nearby famous 12th-century Angkor Wat temple, where they were
officially sworn in by Siem Reap's chief monk.
	   Sihanouk called on the new parliament to reach ``an honorable
compromise'' to form a new government and work quickly to end
corruption, poverty and deforestation.
	   ``I ask our new National Assembly to see to it that the new
Royal Government of Cambodia comes to life, as a symbol of national
reconciliation ... able to make an effort and sacrifices so that
our country can rapidly rise out of the state of
underdevelopment,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen left Angkor Wat by helicopter after the ceremony and
departed later for the capital, Phnom Penh.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, expressed optimism after the ceremony that negotiations
would proceed smoothly in Phnom Penh.
	   ``From now on it will be possible for all Cambodians to work
together to achieve our goals including the working of the National
Assembly and the formation of the coalition government,'' he said.
	   He and junior opposition leader Sam Rainsy denied any knowledge
or involvement in the alleged attack on Hun Sen.
	   ``All acts or kinds of violence have to be clearly condemned,''
Ranariddh said
	   After the July elections, the opposition threatened to boycott
Parliament and organized spirited street rallies in Phnom Penh
calling for Hun Sen's ouster. Police violently broke up the
demonstrations, killing at least four people and injuring or
arresting dozens of others.
	   A ban was placed on foreign travel by all opposition
legislators.
	   As the situation threatened to spin out of control, the
opposition agreed to end the boycott and attend tripartite talks,
which were led by Sihanouk on Tuesday.
	   Hun Sen told journalists Thursday that travel restrictions had
been lifted for all newly sworn-in members of Parliament, but
remained for at least two other politicians.
	   Parliament is scheduled to meet in the capital early next week
to elect its leadership and try to form a government.

Bomb explodes at Jerusalem bus stop; soldier lightly injured

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with soldier lightly hurt, police saying car driver
had nothing to do with bombing, details on location of bombing &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A bomb exploded at a Jerusalem bus stop during
morning rush hour Thursday, wrecking the station's shelter and
injuring an Israeli soldier.
	   The explosive device, weighing about one kilogram (two pounds)
and possibly triggered by a timer, went off at about 8 a.m. (0600
GMT) near the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem.
	   Police sealed off the area, which is adjacent to the West Bank.
Officers conducted searches, backed by helicopters. The bomb squad
also combed the scene for other bombs.
	   A white car with Palestinian license plates was seen leaving the
scene and was stopped at a nearby Israeli army roadblock, said
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby.
	   Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki later said the driver
of the car probably had nothing to do with the bombing.
	   A soldier sitting at the bus stop was lightly hurt in the head
when the bomb went off, said Ben-Ruby. The shelter, which is
opposite the university's School for Overseas Students, was badly
damaged.
	   Israel has been on high alert for the past two weeks following
renewed threats by the Islamic militant group Hamas to carry out
attacks in Israel. Hamas wants to avenge the Sept. 11 killing of
the group's two top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   However, Hamas' trademark has been deadly suicide bombings
carried out in crowded downtown areas or on buses. Thursday's bomb
was relatively small and the bus stop was located in an outlying
neighborhood of Jerusalem.
	   In another incident, shots were fired at an Israeli car near the
Palestinian-controlled town of Hebron on the West Bank Thursday,
but no one was hurt, Israel radio said.
	   The van, driven by a Jewish settler, was hit by several bullets,
the report said. Israeli soldiers were combing the area.
	   The shooting occurred between Hebron and the adjacent Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Monument to Stalin's victims vandalized near Kiev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Vandals defaced a monument to victims of
Josef Stalin's terror, stealing two bronze crosses and smashing
stone inscriptions, newspapers said Thursday.
	   Officials suspected that the vandals stole the heavy 50 to 60
kilogram (110 to 132 pound) crosses in order to sell the metal, the
daily Segodnya said. Thefts of valuable metals have become common
in the former Soviet Union.
	   The chief of Kiev's municipal department for monument
preservation, Ruslan Kukharenko, appealed to the public to provide
information on the crime in the Bykovnia forest near Kiev, the
Ukrainian capital.
	   ``We'll restore the destroyed monument in the near future,''
Kukharenko told the daily Fakty. ``Unfortunately, it is not enough
to restore the lost parts. We would not be insured against a new
invasion of the vandals unless we stop them by force.''
	   The newspapers said architects now plan to substitute the lost
crosses with stone engravings in order not to attract thieves.
	   Ukraine suffered heavily during Stalin's repressions of the
1930s, losing millions to famine, which some say was planned by
Soviet authorities, and to the Soviet dictator's dreaded secret
police.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Four more democracy activists have been detained
and their homes searched by police in a widening crackdown on
dissidents in China, a human rights group said Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, activists in seven Chinese provinces have proposed
setting up civilian watchdog groups to combat the corruption that
has deeply angered many ordinary citizens in China.
	   Police took Qin Yongmin, a veteran activist in the central city
of Wuhan, from his home along with another dissident, Chen Zonghe,
on Thursday morning, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The police told Qin, who had tried to set up a human rights
monitoring group, that his organization was illegal, the Hong
Kong-based group said.
	   It said the police later took Qin to his home, searched it, and
confiscated his fax machine, articles and telephone books.
	   Another dissident, Liu Lianjun, was taken by police from his
home late Wednesday in Weifang in the eastern province of Shandong
province, the human rights group said. It said his whereabouts
Thursday were uncertain.
	   Liu is one of several Shandong activists who had sought to set
up an independent political group, the China Democracy Party.
	   Two weeks earlier, the dissidents said they had received vaguely
encouraging signals from local authorities. Since then, however,
many people associated with the organization have been questioned
or detained.
	   Police have detained at least 20 dissidents since they began
trying to register the would-be political party in late June.
However, the current police sweep has widened, and not all of the
11 people detained in the past week are associated with the group.
	   Police in Fuzhou, the provincial capital of southeastern Fujian
province, told activist Lin Xinshu's family that he was detained
Wednesday for seven days for violating rules requiring him to
report to a local police station three times a day, the Information
Center said.
	   Lin has been interrogated by police 12 times since sending an
open letter to President Jiang Zemin titled ``Without democracy, a
hopeless China,'' it said.
	   The center confirmed that Lin, who is in ill health, had refused
to report to police three times a day.
	   Elsewhere in China, dissidents in Henan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu,
Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan and Hunan provinces jointly submitted an
application to the Civil Affairs Ministry to set up anti-corruption
groups.
	   ``Corruption is a millstone on the economy, a time bomb
threatening to wreck social stability,'' the activists said in a
faxed statement.
	   The statement did not explain how the groups planned to help the
government curb rampant corruption.
	   China requires all organizations to register with the
authorities, and in most cases applications are turned down.

Police continue questioning of seven arrested in terrorism probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Seven Middle Eastern men arrested in an
anti-terrorist swoop were questioned for a second day on Thursday,
and published reports said one was under a death sentence in Egypt.
	   Police would not comment on reports that the seven arrested
early Wednesday were linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident
accused by the United States of directing the bombing of embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Reports from Egypt said the suspects included one Saudi
associated with bin Laden and six Egyptians. Scotland Yard would
not comment on the identity of the suspects other than to say they
were from the Middle East.
	   The Egyptian daily newspaper daily Al-Ahram and other Egyptian
and Middle East media identified one of the suspects as Adel
Abdel-Meguid Abdel-Bari, head of the International Office for the
Defense of the Egyptian People in London.
	   There is no telephone listing by that name in London, and the
group could not be contacted immediately.
	   Abdel-Bari was sentenced to death in absentia by a military
court in 1997 for conspiring to blow up the Khan el-Khalili bazaar,
Cairo's oldest market, and plotting to kill police officers.
	   The newspaper identified the Saudi suspect as Khaled Fawaz, a
spokesman for bin Laden. It identified the five other suspects as
Egyptians: Ibrahim el-Eidros, Hany el-Sibai, Sayed Ahmed
Abdel-Maqsood, Sayed Agamy and Osama Ahmed, but gave no details
about them.
	   Bin Laden is suspected of financing the Aug. 7 bombings of the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam that killed 258 people.
	   The attacks prompted retaliatory U.S. missile attacks on
suspected terrorist facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan, where bin
Laden is based. The Saudi escaped injury and remains at large.
	   Two men, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Sadeek
Odeh, were taken to the United States last month on murder and
conspiracy charges in connection with the Nairobi bombing.
	   The FBI is seeking Haroun Fazil, from the Comoros Islands, in
connection with the bombings, and has offer a reward of up to dlrs
2 million dollars for his capture.

Mass transit strike creates havoc in Greek capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Mass transit ground to a halt in the
capital because of a strike Thursday, while a labor action by civil
aviation employees at the country's airports led to flight
cancellations and delays.
	   Trolley, bus and subway operators walked off the job at around
noon for six hours, stranding thousands of passengers and creating
traffic jams throughout the city as people used their cars to drive
around the capital.
	   The mass transit drivers are protesting government plans to make
changes in urban transport.
	   A four-day strike by civil aviation workers caused some delays
and cancellations at airports around Greece, but authorities could
not yet say how many flights were affected.
	   The workers are not servicing any charter flights and only some
by foreign carriers. National carrier Olympic Airways is using its
own employees to replace the striking civil aviation employees.
	   The union is demanding more money and protesting government
plans to revamp the civil aviation service by splitting it up
according to specialization.

Slovakia's hard-line ruler in electoral fight for survival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Two-day voting starts at 1200 GMT Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The billboards across Slovakia
seemed innocuous enough, depicting rugged mountains, lush green
countryside and a campaign pitch for Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's leadership: ``The country of your heart.''
	   The problem, as the opposition revealed during a particularly
bitter parliamentary election campaign that ended this week: The
country displayed was Switzerland.
	   Meciar's self-portrayal as father of a modern, prosperous nation
faces a severe test Friday and Saturday as voters decide whether to
give his hard-line ruling party four more years in power.
	   Opposition parties, who accuse Meciar's government of marching
this central European country away from democracy, claim the
controversial billboard _ since removed _ typifies a penchant to
let nothing get in Meciar's way: not his opponents, the law, the
media or the facts.
	   ``Dictators cannot rule us any more,'' said Mikulas Dzurinda,
head of the Slovak Democratic Coalition and the leading candidate
to replace Meciar as premier. ``Disregard for the law cannot take
place any more.''
	   Opinion polls indicate that opposition forces likely have the
best chance to form the next government if they join together after
the vote as promised. But it may take weeks to determine who can
put together a ruling coalition.
	   Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia likely will get the
first chance, since it is favored to receive the most votes of any
party. It retains a loyal following among older, rural and less
educated voters as well as among business and industry, dependent
on his government.
	   ``Slovakia will never be like Switzerland,'' said pensioner
Jozef Galanda at a recent rally for the ruling party, known widely
by its Slovak acronym HZDS. ``But I still support Meciar. He speaks
the truth.''
	   Backers of the populist-nationalist party say Meciar has
provided firm leadership at a time of economic and political
turmoil in the region during his nearly seven years at Slovakia's
helm. The economy has grown, the military is well-regarded and he
has been a staunch defender of national interests, they say.
	   But critics, including Slovakia's European neighbors, say his
main priority has been consolidating his party's power while
shunning free-market and democratic reforms.
	   Living standards remain well behind those of the Czech Republic,
its former partner in Czechoslovakia before the two became separate
countries in 1993. Foreign economists and diplomats say the Slovak
economy has been held artificially stable in the runup to elections
and is due for a blowup soon.
	   In tightening its grip in the past two years the Slovak
government has effectively turned its back on the West, even as the
Czechs and Hungarians move toward swift entry into NATO and the
European Union. Concerned European officials say Slovakia is
becoming an ``island'' in the region while others are catching up
to the West and adopting more open standards regarding media
freedoms, electoral law and privatization.
	   ``Meciar was repeatedly warned by the West Europeans and the
U.S.: 'If you want to join the 21st century and be a modern
democratic country, this is what you should do,''' said a Western
diplomat who declines to be named. ``He's decided against it every
time.''
	   Emblematic of the ruling party's desperation in an uphill race,
state-controlled Slovak Television violated the ban on campaigning
in the last 48 hours before the vote by airing an appeal by a top
ruling party official Wednesday night.
	   Appealing to Slovak nationalism, Parliament chairman Ivan
Gasparovic said: ``Find a moment for thinking of who has given you
the chance of living in a free, independent country, who has
staunchly defended its national interests and who has opened the
way towards advanced European countries.''
	   Preliminary results from the voting are expected Sunday.

NATO takes first step to military action against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments, details; TRIMS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO moved a step closer Thursday to
launching military strikes against Yugoslavia if President Slobodan
Milosevic continues his offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo province.
	   The NATO ambassadors, meeting in this southern Portuguese
resort, approved an ``activation warning,'' preparing for both
``limited'' and ``phased'' air strikes against Yugoslavia.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said it ``takes NATO to an
increased level of military preparedness'' by asking military
commanders to identify participating countries and the kind of
hardware they will put at NATO's disposal.
	   ``Let me stress that the use of force will require further
decisions'' by the NATO governments, Solana told reporters.
	   To date, only Germany and The Netherlands have publicly said
they will contribute jet fighters for the mission.
	   NATO officials called the move ``psychologically important'' in
that after months of planning for action, NATO is now implementing
these plans.
	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
demanding a cease-fire in Kosovo, and threatening further action if
fighting continues. It urged both sides to start negotiating a
solution and demanded Milosevic allow international monitoring in
Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   Unless he complies, NATO can order up air strikes in a matter of
days, if needed. ``There are clear bench marks in the U.N.
resolution. The less Milosevic complies with these, the speedier
the consequences,'' said a Dutch official.
	   NATO plans are for an air campaign starting with cruise missile
attacks and air strikes that can be intensified as needed.
	   The meeting of the NATO envoys was followed by a meeting of NATO
defense ministers. For the first time, Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic _ three nations due to join NATO in April _
participated in the meeting.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told his counterparts that
in the U.S. view the international community needed no further U.N.
mandate to use force. The latest resolution cited Chapter 7 of the
U.N. Charter, which allows for the use of force if regional peace
and security is threatened. It did not explicitly authorize member
states to intervene in Kosovo and said ``the council would consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace
and stability in the region,'' if no political deal is reached.
	   Although NATO capitals have talked a tough line in recent months
this has failed to get Milosovic to end his offensive in Kosovo.
The war there has killed hundreds of people and left almost 300,000
people homeless, of whom some 50,000 are camped out in the
countryside. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population
of Kosovo.
	   ``This is the last clear warning that should not be
underestimated by anyone,'' said German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe.
	   ``Pictures of people (in Kosovo) camping out in the open ... are
in themselves an ultimatum'' to Milosevic that the allies will no
longer tolerate the accumulation of horror, especially on the eve
of winter.
	   The U.N. resolution passed by a 14-0 vote with only China
abstaining in the Security Council.
	   Solana said it ``makes clear what President Milosevic must do.
He must stop his repressive actions against the population, he must
seek a political solution to the Kosovo crisis based on
negotiations as must Kosovar Albanians, and he must take immediate
steps to alleviate the humanitarian situation...''
	   Hampering the allies have been disagreements over whether or not
they need a formal mandate from the United Nations before stepping
in.
	   France has been pushing hard for such endorsement. The United
States believes no such mandate is required. In Germany, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe _ in the heat of a general election
campaign _ have disagreed publicly on the issue.

No more replay provision for FA Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a break with 127 years of tradition, there will
be no provision for a replay if this season's FA Cup final ends in
a draw.
	   Instead, the world's most prestigious domestic cup competition
will be decided by extra time and, if necessary by penalties, if
the teams remain tied in the May 22 final.
	   The change was made by the Football Association because the
final of the European Champions Cup is scheduled on the following
Wednesday. With both Arsenal and Manchester United playing in the
Champions League, it is possible that one of the clubs could be
involved in both competitions.
	   In 117 previous FA Cup finals, a replay has been used on 14
occasions. The most recent was in 1993 when Arsenal beat Sheffield
Wednesday 2-1 after a 1-1 draw.
	   The decision brings the FA Cup final into line with all other
domestic, European and international finals, including the World
Cup final.

Warsaw police investigate two bomb explosions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Two professionally made bombs have
exploded over the past week in a high-crime Warsaw district,
seriously injuring one woman and sending another into shock, police
said Thursday.
	   The women were not the intended targets of the bombs, spokesman
Dariusz Janas said. He declined, however, to say whether police
knew who the targets were, who planted the bombs or whether the two
explosions were linked.
	   The explosions took place in two high-rise apartment blocks in
the north-eastern district of Praga Polnoc, one of Warsaw's poorest
neighborhoods.
	   Bordering on the town of Wolomin, the stronghold of one of the
region's two main criminal gangs, it has become the scene of bomb
attacks and murders among groups fighting for control of business
in stolen cars, alcohol and cigarette smuggling and extortion.
	   One bomb was found by a janitor Sept. 17 in a plastic bag on a
staircase. It exploded when she picked the bag up to throw it away,
causing serious injuries to her face and hands, police said.
	   On Wednesday, a 68-year-old woman narrowly escaped injury when a
bomb planted on her door mat exploded as she was leaving her
apartment. She was treated for shock.

No bail for bin Laden secretary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Rewrites throughout to ADD prosecutor's claims that suspect is
linked to second convicted conspirator and background on World
Trade Center bomber; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA DE LA CRUZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The former personal secretary of Muslim
extremist Osama bin Laden was ordered held without bail on a charge
of perjury, accused of lying about his ties to bin Laden's
terrorist group.
	   Bin Laden is the Saudi exile wanted by U.S. authorities for
allegedly coordinating attacks on American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7 that killed 259 people, including 12 Americans,
and wounded thousands.
	   An attorney for Wadih El Hage, 38, argued Wednesday that his
client was not charged in the bombing and would not flee the
country.
	   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said El Hage's
ties to bin Laden and World Trade Center bomber Mahmoud Abouhalima
were reason enough to keep him held without bail, and U.S.
Magistrate Judge Leonard Bernikow agreed.
	   Abouhalima was one of four men convicted of bombing the trade
center on Feb. 26, 1993. The blast killed six people and injured
more than 1,000 others.
	   Fitzgerald also said El Hage had ties to El Sayyid Nosair, who
was convicted of conspiracy in a federal trial for his role in a
plot to blow up the United Nations and other city landmarks.
	   Nosair was also convicted of gun possession and charges related
to the 1990 shooting of Rabbi Meir Kahane but acquitted of murder
in an earlier state trial. Kahane was gunned down as he finished a
speech in the Halloran House in New York, now the Marriott East
Side.
	   The grand jury that indicted El Hage has been investigating
whether he tried to procure chemical weapons for bin Laden. El
Hage, who was arrested last week, is charged with eight counts of
perjury and three counts of making false statements.
	   El Hage of Arlington, Texas, has admitted working for bin Laden
in the Sudan in 1994.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fighting easing in some region.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces struck
deeper into the last pockets of separatist Kosovo Albanian
resistance Thursday, despite U.N. and NATO moves that edged open
the door for a military strike against them.
	   Artillery boomed across the central Drenica region of the
Serbian province Thursday, and Serb police sources said they cut
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army forces in two by taking over
a main road that passes through the last pocket of Kosovo Albanian
resistance.
	   ``The terrorists are now surrounded in several Drenica
villages,'' said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity,
alluding to KLA members.
	   Later in the day, the intensity of the fighting appeared to ease
at least in some parts of the Drenica region, with reporters there
noting less shelling than early in the day. But it was impossible
to determine whether the overall offensive had lessened in response
to new signs of U.N. and NATO determination.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday threatened further action
unless the fighting stopped. While not specifically mandating NATO
action, the resolution opened the way for international approval of
involvement by the military alliance.

Police continue questioning of seven arrested in terrorism probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS number of deaths in graf 8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Seven Middle Eastern men arrested in an
anti-terrorist swoop were questioned for a second day on Thursday,
and published reports said one was under a death sentence in Egypt.
	   Police would not comment on reports that the seven arrested
early Wednesday were linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident
accused by the United States of directing the bombing of embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Reports from Egypt said the suspects included one Saudi
associated with bin Laden and six Egyptians. Scotland Yard would
not comment on the identity of the suspects other than to say they
were from the Middle East.
	   The Egyptian daily newspaper daily Al-Ahram and other Egyptian
and Middle East media identified one of the suspects as Adel
Abdel-Meguid Abdel-Bari, head of the International Office for the
Defense of the Egyptian People in London.
	   There is no telephone listing by that name in London, and the
group could not be contacted immediately.
	   Abdel-Bari was sentenced to death in absentia by a military
court in 1997 for conspiring to blow up the Khan el-Khalili bazaar,
Cairo's oldest market, and plotting to kill police officers.
	   The newspaper identified the Saudi suspect as Khaled Fawaz, a
spokesman for bin Laden. It identified the five other suspects as
Egyptians: Ibrahim el-Eidros, Hany el-Sibai, Sayed Ahmed
Abdel-Maqsood, Sayed Agamy and Osama Ahmed, but gave no details
about them.
	   Bin Laden is suspected of financing the Aug. 7 bombings of the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam that killed 259 people.
	   The attacks prompted retaliatory U.S. missile attacks on
suspected terrorist facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan, where bin
Laden is based. The Saudi escaped injury and remains at large.
	   Two men, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Sadeek
Odeh, were taken to the United States last month on murder and
conspiracy charges in connection with the Nairobi bombing.
	   The FBI is seeking Haroun Fazil, from the Comoros Islands, in
connection with the bombings, and has offer a reward of up to dlrs
2 million dollars for his capture.

French prime minister in Beijing, contracts signed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with business agreements signed, 5th graf; EDITS to
conform and trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin arrived
Thursday for a visit intended to highlight increasingly warm ties
between China and France.
	   Relations were strained in the early 1990s over French weapons
sales to rival Taiwan, but China has courted France to raise
Chinese influence in Europe.
	   Helped by high-level exchanges and a willingness by Paris to
place trade ties ahead of human rights, relations between China and
France have improved steadily in recent years.
	   On Thursday, Jospin mixed business and sightseeing. He met with
French and Chinese businessmen, visited Beijing's ancient Forbidden
City and met with Premier Zhu Rongji. Later in the evening, Jospin
was to attend a concert featuring Chinese rock singer Cui Jian.
	   Jospin attended a ceremony for the signing of 14 business
agreements. The deals, which include contracts for water treatment,
bank cards, environmental protection and cement, were worth about
1.9 billion francs (2.8 billion yuan or dlrs 339 million), the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   On Friday, Jospin was to leave Beijing for Hefei, a city in
eastern Anhui province, where he is to meet with President Jiang
Zemin, who has been inspecting rebuilding of areas affected by
massive flooding this summer along the Yangtze River.
	   The unusual location for the meeting prompted speculation that
China was delivering a diplomatic slap in the face for France's
sale of Mirage jets to Taiwan in 1992. Jospin was secretary-general
of the French Socialist Party, which was in power at the time.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao denied that,
saying both sides had a hand in choosing the location.
	   After Hefei, Jospin will travel to Shanghai, China's financial
and commercial center, and then to Hong Kong.
	   Chinese officials said they hoped the visit would further
promote close ties between Beijing and Paris.
	   The two countries have paid particular attention to trade and
economic ties. Last year bilateral trade amounted to about 59
billion francs (dlrs 10 billion).

Colombia's Herrera takes one-stroke first round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHIOYA, Japan (AP) _ Defending champion Eduardo Herrera of
Colombia shot a six-under-par 66 Thursday and took a one-stroke
first round lead in the 110 million yen (dlrs 803,000) Gene Sarazen
Jun Classic golf tournament.
	   The 33-year-old Herrera, seeking his second title of this season
and his fourth in his career, carded six birdies against no bogeys
on the 7,135-yard, par-72 Rope Club course in Shioya, 130
kilometers (78 miles) north of Tokyo.
	   Hajime Meshiai, seeking his second title of this season, shot a
67 with eight birdies and three bogeys and shared second place with
his fellow Japanese Satoshi Higashi.
	   ``I was very good all in shots, approaches and putts'' despite
rainy weather, said Herrera.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ After suppressing mutinous Lesotho troops
in the capital of this mountain kingdom, soldiers from South Africa
and Botswana on Thursday moved to quell an outbreak of looting.
South African and Botswanan troops intervened Tuesday to thwart a
mutiny by Lesotho troops, sparking the looting and arson spree.
Unlike the previous two days, there was no gunfire in the capital,
Maseru, early Thursday, a sign that the chaotic situation may be
settling down. And on the city's outskirts _ also unlike previous
days _ no boom of artillery or other shooting could be heard. Some
shops in the almost completely gutted business district continued
to smolder, after the revolt in the country that is surrounded by
South Africa. The mutineers had apparently sided with opposition
parties complaining of fraud in May elections, which the ruling
Lesotho Congress Party swept. (LESOTHO)
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Hurricane Georges kills at
least 70 people in the Dominican Republic and leaves hundreds
missing before sweeping over Cuba and threatening the Florida Keys.
At least 110 people have died throughout the Caribbean and hundreds
were missing since the sprawling storm began its rampage on Monday.
All 80,000 residents of the Florida Keys were ordered to evacuate
Wednesday, and cars and trucks with boats in tow squeezed onto the
lone two-lane highway to the mainland. Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles
declared a state of emergency in central and southern Florida,
including Miami. Haiti's flimsy housing proved no match for the
resulting flash floods, and 27 people reportedly drowned or were
killed in the Western hemisphere's poorest nation when their homes
collapsed. Cuban authorities evacuated 200,000 people from their
homes in Cuba's eastern provinces. (CARIBBEAN-HURRICANE)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel warned Yasser Arafat on Thursday that he
will sabotage prospects for a West Bank troop withdrawal if he
discusses his plans for a declaration of Palestinian statehood when
he speaks to the U.N. General Assembly next week. However,
Palestinian negotiators said Arafat is determined to use his rare
appearance before the world body to rally international support for
a unilateral declaration of Palestinian independence in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in May when the five-year interim period of
Palestinian autonomy expires. The diplomatic battle over the
statehood issue seems to be scuttling efforts by the United States
to wrap up an elusive deal on an Israeli withdrawal in the West
Bank in New York this week. U.S. officials had considered arranging
a meeting between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in New York. However, with both sides sharpening their
rhetoric over the statehood issue, it appeared very unlikely such a
summit will take place. Netanyahu is already in New York to address
the U.N. General Assembly later Thursday and Arafat is to arrive
later in the week. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ An alleged assassination attempt
against Cambodian leader Hun Sen heightened political tensions
Thursday, even as new members of Parliament were sworn in at the
country's historic Angkor Wat temple. Hun Sen was unhurt, but a
12-year-old boy died when what police said was a booby trap made
with rocket-propelled grenades exploded as the co-premier's convoy
passed by. The opening session of the National Assembly was
supposed to signal a restoration of political stability after weeks
of jousting between Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party,
which captured a majority in elections held July 26, and the two
opposition parties, which claimed fraud and intimidation. Hun Sen
blamed the booby trap on the opposition and offered a reward if the
attackers stepped forward to name the ringleaders. Previous alleged
attempts on his life have served as excuses to crack down on his
opponents. (CAMBODIA)
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ The NATO allies moved a step closer
Thursday toward launching military strikes against Yugoslavia if it
fails to halt an offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo
province. NATO ambassadors, meeting in a special session in
Portugal, approved an ``activation warning'' for a military
campaign, preparing for both ``limited'' and ``phased'' air strikes
against Yugoslavia. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the
decision ``takes NATO to an increased level of military
preparedness.'' He said military commanders will now identify
countries that could participate in air strikes and the kind of
hardware they will put at NATO's disposal. To date, only Germany
and The Netherlands have publicly said they will contribute jet
fighters for the mission. The NATO action came 12 hours after the
U.N. Security Council passed a resolution demanding a cease-fire in
Kosovo, and threatening further action if fighting continues. It
urged both sides to start negotiating a solution and demanded that
President Slobodan Milosevic allow international monitoring in
Kosovo and the safe return of refugees. (NATO-KOSOVO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The clearest sign yet that the United States plans
to lower interest rates proved as magical on Asia's stock markets
Thursday as it did on Wall Street. Moments after they opened, the
region's three top bourses shot skyward. By the end of the day,
Hong Kong's had jumped 4.4 percent, Singapore's 3.4 percent, and
Japan's 3.02 percent. Fourteen months after Asia's financial crisis
began, two of the area's hardest-hit markets were doing even
better. Thailand's main stock index was 9.2 percent higher by
midday, and South Korea's closed with a 6.4 percent improvement. As
trading began Thursday in Europe, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was up 1.8 percent at 5,309.5 in the first
hour on the Stock Exchange in London. One after another, Asian
analysts attributed the good day to U.S. Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan. On Wednesday, he gave the clearest indication yet
that he'll fight the global economic crisis with lower U.S.
interest rates. Greenspan said, ``I think we know where we have to
go'' in dealing with the crisis, which has since spread from Asia
to Russia, and is now threatening Latin America as well. (WORLD
MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's inflation rate has skyrocketed to 67
percent since last month, and the Central Bank said Thursday the
worst was still ahead _ prices could triple by year's end. Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has been in office for almost two
weeks, but has yet to offer a comprehensive economic plan, pledged
strong steps to stabilize the crumbling economy. He said the new
government would pay wage arrears to workers and soldiers, offer
compensation to offset the painful effects of inflation, and impose
greater state control on the alcohol industry, a leading source of
government tax revenue. Primakov also blamed his predecessor,
Sergei Kiriyenko, for igniting the crisis last month. Primakov
claimed that Kiriyenko's Aug. 17 announcement on devaluing the
ruble and restructuring government debt was made without the
consent of President Boris Yeltsin and that the results had been
``chaotic.'' (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The World Bank on Thursday warned
Indonesia that it risked losing global economic support unless it
stopped corruption from eating into humanitarian aid. The warning
follows recent allegations that millions of dollars in World Bank
loans meant to aid growing throngs of poor and hungry have been
lost to graft in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation. Bank
officials announced Thursday that it would design an
anti-corruption strategy for Indonesia, where endemic bribery has
been identified as a major contributor to its near economic
collapse over the past year. The bank's deputy vice-president for
East Asia and the Pacific, Julian Schweitzer, said Indonesia must
protect billions of dollars in aid for a growing number people
slipping into poverty. He said that this was essential to the
continued delivery of financial aid needed to prop up the economy,
hit by soaring inflation and massive recession. ``International
donors will be watching very carefully to see how things go in the
delivery of food, medicines and other essentials to the needy. This
is a major test of sincerity,'' he said. (INDONESIA-CORRUPTION)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Imports to some European Union countries have
risen by more than 20 percent since the Asian financial crisis, a
senior European Union official said Wednesday. Exports by the EU to
Asian countries, however, have declined by about 30 percent, said
Mogens Peter Carl, deputy director-general for commercial policy
for the European Commission, the EU's executive body. Figures were
unavailable from the European Union and no figure has been given
for Asia as a whole. Carl spoke in Geneva before Thursday's opening
of a World Trade Organization meeting to prepare for next year's
trade talks. The EU wants a comprehensive new round, which EU
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan has called the ``Millennium Round.''
Those talks aim to significantly reduce industrial tariffs, further
open markets in agriculture and services, including maritime
transport and other sectors not in existing agreements. Carl said
the talks should also cover new issues, such as international
investment rules and competition policy. (EU-TRADE-NEGOTIATIONS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Redesigned, harder-to-counterfeit dlrs 20
bills are entering circulation Thursday with appropriate hoopla
around America. One bank in California is even giving away free
samples. The Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks have two billion
new notes _ dlrs 40 billion _ ready to ship to banks and other
savings institutions. The old notes always will remain legal tender
and will continue circulating until they wear out, on average in
two years. After six months, officials expect one in every four
dlrs 20s will be of the new design, which incorporates a range of
features designed to frustrate counterfeiters armed with personal
computers, scanners, ink-jet printers and color copiers. The U.S.
government issued new dlrs 100 notes in March 1996 and new dlrs 50s
in October 1997, both in demand outside the United States. It plans
to issue new dlrs 10 notes and dlrs 5 notes simultaneously in 2000
and a more modestly redesigned dlrs 1 bill after that. (US-NEW

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ An alleged assassination attempt
against Cambodian leader Hun Sen heightened political tensions
Thursday, even as new members of Parliament were sworn in at the
country's historic Angkor Wat temple.
	   Hun Sen was unhurt, but a 12-year-old boy died when what police
said was a booby trap made with rocket-propelled grenades exploded
as the co-premier's convoy passed by.
	   The incident took place shortly before 121 elected lawmakers
from the ruling and opposition parties gathered in traditional
formal dress at the residence of King Norodom Sihanouk to prepare
for the opening of the new session of the National Assembly.
	   The occasion was supposed to mark a major step toward restoring
political stability after bitter post-election sparring, and in a
brief speech at his royal residence the king urged national
reconciliation.
	   It followed weeks of jousting between Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian
People's Party, which captured a majority in elections held July
26, and the two opposition parties, which said Hun Sen won the
polls through fraud and intimidation.
	   Minutes after the explosion, Hun Sen looked unperturbed on his
arrival at the residence of the 75-year-old monarch.
	   Later, however, he blamed the incident on the opposition and
offered a reward if the attackers stepped forward to name the
ringleaders.
	   Previous alleged attempts on his life have served as excuses to
crack down on his opponents.
	   King Sihanouk spoke to the lawmakers before they traveled to the
nearby famous 12th-century Angkor Wat temple, where they were
officially sworn in by Siem Reap's chief monk.
	   All but one of the newly elected representatives attended the
ceremony. The absent lawmaker was Son Chhay of the opposition Sam
Rainsy Party, a frequent outspoken critic of Hun Sen. He was
believed to be out of the country.
	   Sihanouk called on the members of Parliament to reach ``an
honorable compromise'' to form a new government and work quickly to
end corruption, poverty and deforestation.
	   ``I ask our new National Assembly to see to it that the new
Royal Government of Cambodia comes to life, as a symbol of national
reconciliation ... able to make an effort and sacrifices so that
our country can rapidly rise out of the state of
underdevelopment,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen left Angkor Wat by helicopter after the ceremony and
departed later for the capital, Phnom Penh.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, expressed optimism after the ceremony that negotiations
would proceed smoothly in Phnom Penh.
	   ``From now on it will be possible for all Cambodians to work
together to achieve our goals including the working of the National
Assembly and the formation of the coalition government,'' he said.
	   He and junior opposition leader Sam Rainsy denied any knowledge
or involvement in the alleged attack on Hun Sen.
	   ``All acts or kinds of violence have to be clearly condemned,''
Ranariddh said.
	   After the July elections, the opposition threatened to boycott
Parliament and organized spirited street rallies in Phnom Penh
calling for Hun Sen's ouster. Police violently broke up the
demonstrations, killing at least four people and injuring or
arresting dozens of others.
	   And a ban was placed on foreign travel by all opposition
legislators.
	   As the situation threatened to spin out of control, the
opposition agreed to end the boycott and attend tripartite talks,
which were led by Sihanouk on Tuesday.
	   Hun Sen told journalists Thursday that travel restrictions had
been lifted for all newly sworn-in members of Parliament, but
remained for at least two other politicians.
	   Parliament is scheduled to meet in the capital early next week
to elect its leadership and try to form a government.

Hundreds gather for funeral of Kosovo ``defense minister'' in
</HEADLINE>
exile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Hundreds of people gathered Thursday to
honor the ``defense minister'' of the Kosovo government-in-exile,
who was shot dead in the Albanian capital earlier this week.
	   Ahmed Krasniqi, 50, was found dead late Monday on a narrow
residential street in the Albanian capital with three empty
cartridges nearby. No arrests have been made and the motive was
unclear.
	   Addressing the crowd of mostly Kosovo Albanians Thursday, the
exiled government's ``minister of education'' Muhamed Bicaj praised
Krasniqi as ``a brilliant figure'' of the ethnic Albanians fighting
for independence from Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   ``His ideals were a free Kosovo and independent Kosovo,'' Bicaj
said.
	   He called on the Albanian government to investigate the killing.
	   Krasniqi was responsible for organizing paramilitary forces
which would parallel the Kosovo Liberation Army. For security
reasons, his identity was kept secret until his death.
	   The exiled government is headed by a self-styled premier, Bujar
Bukoshi, and operates in Switzerland and other Western European
countries.
	   Krasniqi was to be buried in Tirana later Thursday.

Chevenement taken off respiratory support, talks again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement is
talking again after being taken off respiratory support at a
military hospital, officials said Thursday.
	   The 59-year-old Chevenement, who suffered an allergic reaction
to anesthesia during a gall bladder operation Sept. 2, ``continues
to improve,'' a Defense Ministry statement said.
	   After lying in a coma for a week at Val de Grace Hospital in
Paris, Chevenement regained consciousness and ``has resumed normal
elocution,'' the statement said. ``Assisted respiration is no
longer necessary.''
	   But Chevenement was still receiving care for his ``general
condition, notably renal.''
	   The government has named as interim interior minister, Jean-Jack
Queyranne, the deputy minister for overseas territories. The
Interior Ministry is responsible for the nation's police and
security forces.
	   Chevenement has held several ministry portfolios, including
defense, industry, education, and resigned as defense minister in
1991 to protest France's involvement in the Gulf War.

Humble Mallorca nears top of Spanish soccer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Nowadays Mallorcans are not only proud of
their island, one of Europe's top tourist resorts, but also have an
upstart soccer team eyeing first place in Spain's premier division.
	   The team can pull off the feat when it hosts Oviedo on Sunday.
It is now second behind Real Madrid on goal difference following
the latter's 2-2 draw at home against archrival FC Barcelona a week
ago.
	   That setback for Madrid has put Mallorca and other teams, such
as Zaragoza, Athletic de Bilbao and Valencia, in a position to make
a run for the lead.
	   ``We're off to a good start. The hard part is to keep it up,''
Mallorca's goalkeeper Carlos Roa told the sports daily AS
Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, defending champion Barcelona will be looking to
improve its position, two points behind Madrid, when it hosts
15th-placed Celta for one of five games to be played Saturday.
	   In the other matches that day Valencia plays at Valladolid,
Athletic de Bilbao hosts Real Madrid, Atletico de Madrid receives
Real Sociedad and Betis hosts lowly Extremadura.
	   On Sunday Villareal plays Salamanca, Tenerife receives Alaves,
Deportivo de La Coruna takes on Espanyol while Zaragoza wraps up
the round against Racing de Santander.
	   Mallorca has an annual budget of 3.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 22
million), an amount that would pay for a few of Barcelona's or
Madrid's star players. And its modest Luis Sitjar stadium has just
10,000 seats, making it one of the smallest in the league.
	   Playing under Argentine coach Hector Cuper, the team has earned
its unexpected ranking by winning the Supercup against Barcelona in
August and finishing in a respectable 5th place last season, its
best finish yet in the first division.
	   Before that Mallorca had spent 13 of the past 20 years in
Spain's second division. It moved up to the premier division last
season.
	   Still, the club has goals _ it hasn't held second place in the
premier division since 1961.
	   In his second season as coach Cuper is trying to consolidate a
largely new squad that includes his fellow Argentinians Ariel
``Chupa'' Lopez and goalkeeper Roa, who was praised for his play in
the World Cup in France.
	   Mallorca has also recruited midfielders Veljko Paunovic and
Pablo Lago from Atletico de Madrid and Real Madrid's Daniel Garcia
'Dani'.
	   Elsewhere, Madrid will be crossing its fingers in the hope
Brazilian ace Savio, who has been the team's most exciting player
so far, will be fit for Saturday's tough match against Athletic de
Bilbao.
	   At the lower end of the standings Betis has a good chance to
recover its image against lowly Extremadura and win its first game.

U.N. says 16 killed during Cambodian election period
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ United Nations human rights
investigators reported Thursday that at least 16 people were killed
during Cambodia's recent election because of their political
beliefs or affiliations.
	   The report from the Cambodian Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights was its second dealing with 49
killings suspected of being linked to the July 26 parliamentary
elections.
	   The investigators said 16 people were apparently killed because
of election-related politics and six were killed ``in cases where
both political and personal aspects were present.''
	   Thirteen of the deaths were believed to be the work of Khmer
Rouge guerrillas, including a polling-day attack on a village near
the rebels' former stronghold of Anlong Veng. Seven civilians, two
government soldiers and two of the attackers were killed.
	   The remaining three victims were members of two established
opposition parties and one small party who were killed in the
pre-election period.
	   The government was given a copy of the U.N. report Wednesday. A
government spokesman contacted Thursday declined to comment on it.
	   Rosemary McCreery, chief of the U.N. human rights office in
Phnom Penh, said the report did not include suspected politically
motivated killings that occurred during anti-government
demonstrations in the capital this month.
	   U.N. investigators have discovered 21 bodies _ all but one
unidentified and many with signs of torture _ since police
violently broke up the protests. Another four people were killed as
police and demonstrators clashed.
	   ``We're trying to cut off one thing before we begin with the
next,'' McCreery said. ``Some time in the next couple of weeks we
will make a report on demonstration-related deaths.''

Nestle chairman: Asian nations emerging from problems in 2-3 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Crisis-hit economies in Southeast Asia will emerge
from their problems in two to three years' time, the president of
the International Chamber of Commerce predicted Thursday.
	   ``I am moderately optimistic that within a few years, we will
see the end of the tunnel again,'' said Helmut Maucher, who is also
the chairman of international food and drinks firm Nestle.
	   Indonesia and other Asian nations affected by the turmoil still
have many problems, but are now aware of the need to reform,
Maucher told a news conference in Geneva.
	   The world has learned from the International Monetary Fund,
which has been criticized for its response to the crisis, and other
global institutions about what needs to be done to avoid more
upheaval, he said.
	   Russia's troubled economy will likely suffer ``ups and downs''
for another 20 years, Maucher said. The country needs to set up
proper structures to collect taxes and to avoid trying to sort out
economic problems with ``sweeping statements.''
	   Maucher said, however, that the effect on the world economy of
the Russian crisis is not as important as the economic slump
affecting Japan.
	   ``I am hopeful that Japan is a strong economy, that they will
manage the problems, but that this will also take some time.''
	   China's biggest challenge is to rationalize its businesses
controlled by the state and the military and to make them more
competitive, Maucher said.
	   ``I am hopeful these two countries will not do things which will
be absolutely catastrophic for the world.''
	   On Thursday, the International Labor Organization said the
number of people without full time jobs around the world had
reached a 1 billion record.
	   Maucher said the unemployment was worrying and unfortunate but
not irreversible. Patience is needed for long term policies to
produce improvements and more cooperation between the G7 group of
industrialized nations, international business organizations and
governments is needed to tackle the problem.
	   Maucher said in a speech to a conference in Geneva organized by
the International Chamber of Commerce that gradual deregulation and
improvement of market access across the world must continue.
	   Negotiations scheduled to begin next year on new trade
liberalization measures should be extended to become more
comprehensive than currently planned and should avoid the
``damaging delays that characterized the Uruguay Round.''
	   He echoed European Union officials who called Wednesday for new
rules on cross-border investment and competition policies that
don't hinder trade and investment.
	   But Maucher countered calls by some for the WTO to become more
concerned with strengthening labor standards, saying they should
remain the responsibility of the ILO.

Tottenham confirms move for Leeds manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tottenham acting manager David Pleat confirmed
Thursday that his club is negotiating with Leeds to bring manager
George Graham to Spurs.
	   After days of media speculation, Pleat gave the clearest
indication that Tottenham was trying to lure Graham away from Leeds
to replace fired manager Christian Gross.
	   Pleat said Spurs chairman Alan Sugar was speaking with Leeds
counterpart Peter Risdale.
	   ``Mr. Sugar has made an approach to Leeds for Mr. Graham,''
Pleat said. ``The chairman is in dialogue with the Leeds chairman.
We have made an approach. ... We'll just have to wait and see if it
develops into a positive. Having made the approach, we hope it will
come to fruition.''
	   Graham, the former manager of Arsenal, is believed to be eager
to return to London. The Scotsman guided Arsenal to two League
Championships, the European Cup Winners' Cup, two League Cups and
the FA Cup. He was fired by Arsenal and handed a one-year ban for
accepting illegal tranfer payments.
	   There is widespread specuation that Graham will be installed as
Tottenham manger by the middle of next week.
	   Graham said Thursday he will still be manager of Leeds on
Saturday when the club, ironically, faces Tottenham. But he gave no
commitment beyond then.
	   ``I will be taking charge of training again today and I will be
in charge of Leeds on Saturday against Spurs,'' he said. ``It's a
match I'm looking forward to.''

Booby trap explodes near convoy of Cambodian leader

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ A rocket exploded near the motorcade
of Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Thursday, leaving him unharmed but
killing a young boy, police said.
	   Hun Sen immediately blamed the opposition for the attack.
	   The rocket _ apparently detonated by remote control _ exploded
near Hun Sen's convoy as he was going to attend ceremonies marking
the opening of the new session of parliament, police said.
	   A 12-year-old boy was killed by the explosion and three members
of his family seriously injured, according to a local hospital.
	   The incident, described by police and government officials as an
assassination attempt, did not delay the swearing-in of 121 members
of parliament at the historic 12th-century Angkor Wat temple.
	   Hun Sen linked the blast to another violent incident earlier
this month. He offered a dlrs 200,000 reward to the attackers if
they would name their ringleader, and warned of retribution.
	   ` I think if the opposition leaders do not instruct their forces
to stop activities which threaten my life, they would die with the
most severe suffering,'' Hun Sen told reporters. ``For a snake, if
we don't hit it on the head, it can still move and bite back, so we
must hit it on the head, not its tail.''
	   Previous alleged attempts on Hun Sen's life have served as
excuses to harass or arrest his opponents.
	   Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said
that they knew nothing about Thursday's attack.
	   ``All acts or kinds of violence have to be clearly condemned,''
Ranariddh said after the swearing-in ceremony.
	   Cambodian politics have been in upheaval since last year, when
Hun Sen deposed his co-premiers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
violent coup d'etat.
	   An election held this past July was supposed to restore
stability, but heightened tensions instead after the opposition
accused Hun Sen of winning through fraud and intimidation.
	   Hun Sen's national police chief, Hok Lundy, also blamed the
opposition FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy parties for Thursday's
incident.
	   He said eight people were being detained for questioning, but
that none of them had been declared suspects.
	   Government authorities have not produced any evidence linking
the opposition to the attack, and presented slightly contradictory
accounts of its circumstances.
	   Hun Sen was en route to the king's residence in this
northwestern town when a B-40 rocket exploded on the side of the
road just as his car had passed by, said deputy local police
commander Col. Than Chay.
	   The car carrying Hun Sen was less than 10 meters (33 feet) away
when the explosion occurred, he said.
	   Hun Sen's spokesman Prak Sokhon said a bodyguard riding with Hun
Sen reported that the rocket flew across the road a few feet
(meters) in front of their four-wheel-drive vehicle.
	   Hun Sen himself, however, speaking to reporters later, said the
explosion occurred after his car had passed. Several other sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the assertion.
	   Police said three unexploded rockets were found by the road,
parts of what appeared to be a remote-control booby trap. They
showed what they said were parts of it to reporters at Hun Sen's
hotel.
	   In a battery pack was a cryptic note that read in both English
and Cambodian: ``The King Bee will eliminate all the nation's
dictators gradually. Today the main nation's dictator must be
finished.''
	   Security has been very high for Hun Sen during his stay here,
with dozens of soldiers from his military bodyguard unit guarding
his entourage and their vehicles around the clock since he arrived
on Monday. There is an armored personnel carrier parked at the
hotel where he is staying.
	   Hun Sen left after the swearing-in ceremony by helicopter and
was expected to fly back to Phnom Penh later Thursday.
	   On Sept. 7, a grenade was tossed at Hun Sen's residence in the
capital of Phnom Penh, but he was not home. No one was injured and
little damage was done.
	   The opposition charged that Hun Sen staged the incident to have
an excuse to crack down on his opponents. He banned anti-government
demonstrations the next day and threatened his opponents with
arrest.
	   All but one of the newly-elected members of Parliament showed up
for the swearing-in ceremony. The absent lawmaker was Son Chhay of
the opposition Sam Rainsy Party, a frequent outspoken critic of Hun
Sen. He was believed to be out of the country.

Liberian government denies opening fire at U.S. Embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberia's government has denied its
forces opened fire at the U.S. Embassy during during a weekend gun
battle in which at least three people were killed and two Americans
were injured.
	   Witnesses have said Liberian commandos sprayed gunfire at former
warlord Roosevelt Johnson as he and a group of his supporters
sought refuge at the embassy Saturday morning.
	   But Justice Minister Eddington Varmah denies those accounts, the
Inquirer newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``The security forces did not fire at the embassy,'' Varmah said
Wednesday. He gave no explanation, though, for the deaths and
injuries.
	   The embassy has since been the scene of tension between the U.S.
government and President Charles Taylor, who wants Johnson expelled
from the compound and handed over to authorities in Monrovia.
	   Officials in Washington have been holding high level discussions
with Taylor's government since the shooting, trying to find an end
to the standoff. Fearing another attack, security has been greatly
increased at the embassy and most diplomats have been evacuated.
	   U.S. officials have said Johnson, Taylor's chief rival, will not
be handed over to the Liberian government.
	   Diplomats _ who did not want Johnson to come into the compound
in the first place _ now find themselves reluctantly protecting
him.
	   American officials have said the resolution to the standoff may
involve flying Johnson to a neutral country, though Taylor had
earlier insisted that was unacceptable.
	   Taylor and Johnson have been longtime rivals, heading opposing
factions during Liberia's seven-year civil war.
	   While the two men had ostensibly had made peace since Taylor was
elected president last year, Johnson's supporters and government
soldiers have repeatedly clashed over the past few months.
	   On Friday night, hundreds of government soldiers advanced
through Johnson's neighborhood _ a stronghold of his ethnic Krahn
supporters _ apparently coming to arrest him. A fierce battle
erupted, and bullets, rockets and mortars jolted parts of Monrovia
for two days. At least 47 people were killed.
	   Johnson and 21 other people have since been charged with
treason, accused of trying to overthrow Taylor's government.

Two officials killed in breakaway Georgian province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Unknown gunmen opened fire on officials
driving in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, killing two and
injuring one, an Abkhazian official said Thursday.
	   The Abkhazians were in the region's restive Ghali district
Wednesday night when the gunmen attacked their car, Abkhazian
Internal Affairs Minister Amazbei Kchack said.
	   Kchach blamed militants loyal to the Georgian government for the
attack, but did not offer any evidence.
	   The attack occurred as a Georgian delegation was in Abkhazia for
negotiations on the long-standing political dispute. Recently,
unknown gunmen in Abkhazia opened fire at a bus with 10 United
Nations representatives, and in a separate attack, fired on a
Georgian government official.
	   ``It is sad that talks are conduced with such a sad event in the
background,'' said Abkhazian leader Vladislav Arzinba.
``Nevertheless, the talks must be held to prevent such events in
the future.''
	   Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian soldiers and ethnic
Georgians in a 1992-93 civil war. Despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers, violent skirmishes have been frequent since then.

NATO takes first step to military action against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments, details; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO moved a step closer Thursday to
launching military strikes against Yugoslavia if President Slobodan
Milosevic continues his offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo province.
	   The NATO ambassadors, meeting in the southern Portuguese resort
of Vilamoura, approved an ``activation warning,'' preparing for
both ``limited'' and ``phased'' air strikes against Yugoslavia.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said it ``takes NATO to an
increased level of military preparedness'' by asking military
commanders to identify participating countries and the kind of
hardware they will put at NATO's disposal.
	   ``Let me stress that the use of force will require further
decisions'' by the NATO governments, Solana told reporters.
	   To date, only Germany and The Netherlands have announced they
will contribute jet fighters for the mission.
	   NATO officials called the move ``psychologically important'' in
that after months of planning for action, NATO is now implementing
these plans.
	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
demanding a cease-fire in Kosovo, and threatening further action if
fighting continues. It urged both sides to start negotiating a
solution and demanded Milosevic allow international monitoring in
Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   Unless he complies, NATO can order up air strikes in a matter of
days, if needed. ``There are clear bench marks in the U.N.
resolution. The less Milosevic complies with these, the speedier
the consequences,'' said a Dutch official.
	   NATO plans are for an air campaign starting with cruise missile
attacks and air strikes that can be intensified as needed.
	   The meeting of the NATO envoys was followed by a meeting of NATO
defense ministers. For the first time, Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic _ three nations due to join NATO in April _
participated in the meeting.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told his counterparts that
in the U.S. view the international community needed no further U.N.
mandate to use force. The latest resolution cited Chapter 7 of the
U.N. Charter, which allows for the use of force if regional peace
and security is threatened. It did not explicitly authorize member
states to intervene in Kosovo and said ``the council would consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace
and stability in the region,'' if no political deal is reached.
	   Although NATO capitals have talked a tough line in recent months
this has failed to get Milosevic to end his offensive in Kosovo.
The war there has killed hundreds of people and left almost 300,000
people homeless, of whom some 50,000 are camped out in the
countryside. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population
of Kosovo.
	   ``This is the last clear warning that should not be
underestimated by anyone,'' said German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe.
	   ``Pictures of people (in Kosovo) camping out in the open ... are
in themselves an ultimatum'' to Milosevic that the allies will no
longer tolerate the accumulation of horror, especially on the eve
of winter.
	   The U.N. resolution passed by a 14-0 vote with only China
abstaining in the Security Council.
	   Solana said it ``makes clear what President Milosevic must do.
He must stop his repressive actions against the population, he must
seek a political solution to the Kosovo crisis based on
negotiations as must Kosovar Albanians, and he must take immediate
steps to alleviate the humanitarian situation.''
	   Hampering the allies have been disagreements over whether or not
they need a formal mandate from the United Nations before stepping
in.
	   France has been pushing hard for such endorsement. The United
States believes no such mandate is required. In Germany, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe _ in the heat of a general election
campaign _ have disagreed publicly on the issue.

Germany offers aid to Kosovo refugees in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Seeking to prevent a wave of Kosovo
refugees from coming to Germany, the government said Thursday it
was making 5 million marks (dlrs 3 million) available to help take
care of them in Albania.
	   ``German help in the region is more effective and less expensive
than absorbing them in Germany,'' said Carl-Dieter Spranger,
federal minister for economic cooperation.
	   Spranger said the money would be used to help set up emergency
lodgings before winter for the more than 15,000 people that have
fled over the mountains from Yugoslavia to Albania to escape
fighting in Kosovo province.
	   It also will be used to help prevent the spread of disease, he
said.
	   Earlier this month, Germany pledged 7.5 million marks (dlrs 4.3
million) in aid for Kosovo refugees who have fled to the
neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   German officials say some 140,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo
are already here illegally and face deportation.

Doctors transplant hand on accident victim, claim a first

 &UR; Eds: ADDS doctor's comment, background on patient

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ An international team of doctors
transplanted a hand on an accident victim overnight, claiming a
medical breakthrough, a hospital said Thursday.
	   The right hand and forearm of an anonymous donor was attached to
the arm of a 48-year-old man whose own hand was amputated in 1989
after an accident, Edouard Herriot Hospital said in a statement.
	   ``It gives hope to all those who are victims of domestic or work
accidents, anti-personnel mines, or have congenital deformations,''
Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, a co-head of the transplant team, told
French TV.
	   In the operation, the team attached ``all the arteries, veins,
nerves, tendons, muscles and skin after setting the two bones of
the forearm,'' the statement said.
	   The patient was identified as an Australian businessman, France
2 television reported, adding it would take 12 to 18 months of
therapy for him to regain full use of the hand.
	   The operation was the result of recent advances in microsurgery
and transplant techniques, the hospital said.
	   Head of transplant surgery at the hospital, Dubernard co-led the
team with Earl Owen, director of the Center for Microsurgery in
Sydney, Australia.
	   Other doctors on the team included Marco Lanzetta of the
University of Milan, Italy, Hari Kapila of Sydney, and Nadey Hakim
of Saint Mary's Hospital in London.
	   The team in Lyon was competing with other surgeons.
	   In July, a team of surgeons in Louisville, Kentucky said they
expected to perform such an operation by year's end.
	   They said such an operation could initiate a new era of
transplantation, with the potential to restore hope to thousands of
people with congenital defects and disfiguring injuries.
	   Such a transplant, however, faces risks. Patients must take
anti-rejection drugs that can be potentially fatal.

Nestle chairman: Asian nations emerging from problems in 2-3 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Crisis-hit economies in Southeast Asia will emerge
from their problems in two to three years' time, the president of
the International Chamber of Commerce predicted Thursday.
	   ``I am moderately optimistic that within a few years, we will
see the end of the tunnel again,'' said Helmut Maucher, who is also
the chairman of international food and drinks firm Nestle.
	   Indonesia and other Asian nations affected by the turmoil still
have many problems, but are now aware of the need to reform,
Maucher told a news conference in Geneva.
	   Russia's troubled economy will likely suffer ``ups and downs''
for another 20 years, Maucher said. The country needs to set up
proper structures to collect taxes and to avoid trying to sort out
economic problems with ``sweeping statements.''
	   Maucher said, however, that the effect on the world economy of
the Russian crisis is not as important as the economic slump
affecting Japan.
	   ``I am hopeful that Japan is a strong economy, that they will
manage the problems, but that this will also take some time.''
	   China's biggest challenge is to make competitive businesses
controlled by the state and the military, Maucher said.
	   On Thursday, the International Labor Organization said the
number of people without full time jobs around the world had
reached a 1 billion record.
	   Maucher said the unemployment was worrisome but not
irreversible. He stressed the need for long-term policies to
improve cooperation between the G-7 group of industrialized
nations, international business organizations and governments to
tackle the problem.
	   Maucher advocated gradual deregulation and improved access to
markets worldwide.
	   Negotiations scheduled to begin next year on new trade
liberalization measures should be extended to become more
comprehensive and should avoid the ``damaging delays that
characterized the Uruguay Round.''
	   He echoed European Union officials who called Wednesday for new
rules on cross-border investment and competition policies that
don't hinder trade and investment.
	   But Maucher countered calls by some for the WTO to become more
concerned with strengthening labor standards, saying they should
remain the responsibility of the International Labor Organization,
the United Nations' oldest agency.

Malaysian police don't bring Anwar to court, assure he is safe

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's national police chief
vowed on Thursday to ``come down hard'' on anyone who tries to
continue the reform campaign of jailed opposition leader Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   Police have already threatened the former deputy prime
minister's wife with arrest if she addresses the public. Officers
blockaded two streets around her home to keep journalists and
supporters away.
	   Asked about reports that reformers planned a rally next Monday _
declared a national holiday to celebrate the success of the recent
Commonwealth Games _ Rahim Noor said, ``We'll come down hard on
them.''
	   ``The people here understand'' what that means, he said.
	   Anwar was arrested on Sunday in the midst of a reform campaign
he started after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ousted him Sept. 2
from his posts as deputy premier and finance minister, calling him
morally unfit.
	   There have been no pro-democracy rallies since Monday, when
police dispersed a crowd of 2,000 shouting ``Reform, reform'' in
front of the courthouse where Anwar was expected to be arraigned.
	   Some opposition groups have said that they were planning to hold
a pro-Anwar meeting over the weekend. A new umbrella organization,
comprising three opposition parties and nine volunteer groups, was
formed Wednesday to push for greater freedom in Malaysia.
	   Anwar was arrested hours after 35,000 people gathered at the
Merdeka (Independence) Square on Sunday for the biggest
anti-government rally ever during Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   Although Mahathir promised that Anwar would be brought to court
for an open trial, this had not happened by Thursday, the fifth day
of his detention. No one has been allowed to meet the jailed
politician _ the first in a decade to openly challenge Mahathir.
	   In their drive to stifle that challenge, officials on Wednesday
called Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to police headquarters and told
her she would face the same fate as her husband if she tried to
make speeches.
	   Police chief Rahim Noor told reporters that Anwar was in ``our
custody. He's safe and sound.''
	   He said that Anwar, 51, held under the Internal Security Act
that allows indefinite detention, would be charged very soon, and
there would be a fair trial open to journalists.
	   ``I'm quite sure he will be found guilty,'' Mahathir was quoted
as saying in The Sun newspaper Thursday.
	   He said Anwar had tried to stir up riots, like those that led to
the ouster of Indonesia's President Suharto. ``But in Malaysia, we
are well off, and everybody has food to eat and we live a peaceful
life,'' Mahathir said.
	   Anwar has adamantly denied a string of police accusations
against him, including unlawful sex acts, disturbing public order,
interfering with police investigations, and leaking state secrets.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A British Royal Navy co-pilot was missing
Thursday after his helicopter crashed into the South China Sea
during a training exercise with Singaporean forces, Singapore's
Ministry of Defense said.
	   Two Royal Navy personnel were aboard the Lynx helicopter when it
crashed late Wednesday about 90 miles (144 kilometers) northeast of
Singapore in international waters.
	   The pilot, who suffered minor bruises, was retrieved at 11:15
p.m. The second crew member, whose position is called observer, was
still missing. The observer acts as a navigator, systems operator,
and co-pilot.
	   The names of the two British naval personnel were not released,
and the cause of the crash remained unknown.
	   In addition to nine Singapore navy ships, two Singapore aircraft
and a British frigate, a New Zealand ship and two Indonesian patrol
aircraft have joined in the search, the ministry officials said.
Some aircraft parts have been recovered, they said.
	   Ministry officials said there was little hope that a missing
British navigator is still alive.
	   ``As time passes, hope decreases, but we'll continue with the
search efforts,'' Col. Simon Ong said.
	   Ong said the search was hampered when Malaysian officials
delayed 4 1/2 hours in granting approval for a Singapore search
helicopter to fly through Malaysian air space to the accident site.
Meanwhile, a search helicopter had left using an alternative route.
	   ``In a search and rescue operation every minute is vital. It can
mean the difference between life and death,'' said Col. Kevin Meta.
	   The British helicopter was taking part in a ``night encounter
exercise'' involving three Singapore missile corvettes and
Britain's HMS Grafton. The weather was fine.
	   The British frigate informed all units operating in the exercise
that communications with the helicopter were lost at 10:00 p.m.
Singapore's RSS Valour picked up a distress signal about 10 minutes
later.
	   The British and Singapore navies were engaged in the third day
of training activities that began Monday and were due to end
Thursday. But the exercise was suspended after the accident.

Landslide kills a family four in Bali

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A rain-triggered landslide killed a
family of four on the tourist island of Bali, the official Antara
news agency reported Thursday.
	   Two other people were severely injured in the accident early
Thursday in the village of Duda, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
east of Jakarta, Antara said.
	   Among the deaths was a 27-year-old pregnant mother and her two
children, the report said. The fourth dead victim was a 75-year-old
man.
	   Incessant rain in recent days have also caused landslides in the
Alas Tungga hamlet in the same region, injuring three people,
Antara said, quoting police spokesman May. Y. Suyatmo.

Popcorn, scarecrows feature in emotional Swiss truck, farm votes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Popcorn, scarecrows, accusations of fearmongering
and intimations of lying have turned a referendum campaign in this
normally genteel country into a bitter fight over trucking
regulations and farming subsidies.
	   The electorate votes Sunday on government plans to impose a new
``polluter pays'' tax on trucks meant to stem the increase in
traffic choking once-green valleys through the pristine Alps.
	   The levy is intended to raise 1.5 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 1.1
billion) for transportation projects like mountain railway tunnels.
	   It is also intended to bring Switzerland _ an isolated
non-member of the European Union _ into line with its continental
neighbors.
	   Transport Minister Moritz Leuenberger has warned a no-vote would
torpedo a vital accord with Brussels to phase out the Swiss ban on
rigs over 28 tons in return for charging foreign trucks in transit.
	   The EU has been pushing for more freight on the vital
Italy-Germany route across Switzerland. Part of the reason for the
tax is to push some of that EU traffic onto Swiss railroads for the
journey across the country.
	   The government says that voter approval of the tax will
strengthen Switzerland's negotiating position with the EU in trade
accords, giving Swiss exports greater access to European markets.
	   Opinion polls indicate the outcome of the vote will be tight.
	   The tax is supported by most employer, trade union, consumer and
environmental groups and opposed by a coalition of truckers and
anti-Europeans.
	   Both sides are warning of an ``avalanche'' of big trucks if the
other side wins. With the number of trucks rumbling through the
main north-south Gotthard tunnel axis tripling to 3,000 per day in
the past 10 years and expected to double again by 2015, the
environmental card is a vote-catcher.
	   Though the tax is aimed mainly at EU trucking, it will raise the
costs of shipping to Swiss destinations.
	   Leuenberger says the new levy will add just 11-55 francs (dlrs
8-39) to a Swiss family's annual cost of living. A jar of yogurt,
for example, would cost just half a cent more with the tax.
	   The truck lobby says the tax will increase transport costs by
about a third, making Swiss firms less competitive and adding 500
francs (dlrs 357) to the average annual household bill.
	   ``Mr. Leuenberger, why aren't you telling us the whole truth?''
demanded an anti-tax newspaper advertisement that riled some
feathers in a country where government leaders aren't used to being
called liars.
	   Supporters of the tax accuse the truckers of fearmongering and
exaggerating, saying that a household would have to buy 185 tons
worth of truck-transported goods to get hit with the 500 francs
(dlrs 357) bill.
	   To prove their point, they put 18,500 shopping bags of popcorn
in rows across the vast parliament square of the Swiss capital
Bern. Each bag was meant to symbolize 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of
goods each household would need to consume to feel the hard
economic hit.
	   ``Scandalous,'' fumed the trucking lobby over its opponents'
tactics.
	   In a nation which goes to the polls for referendums about three
times a year, the farming campaign also stands out for its
bitterness.
	   The idyllic Swiss landscape has been been dotted with thousands
of scarecrows, straw cows and hay bales all with the giant message
``NO'' to a proposal which would give government cash payments only
to small farmers who meet certain environmental and animal welfare
conditions.
	   The proposal, which got the 50,000 signatures necessary to force
a referendum, was submitted by an unlikely alliance of small
organic farmers and a discount supermarket chain several years ago.
	   But most farmers argue that the initiative is out of date as
environmentally friendly methods are now common. They say it would
penalize efficient producers, cut output and lead to an increase in
cheap imports _ which is what the Denner discount store wants.
	   The government and consumer groups have condemned the plan as
unnecessary.
	   In a third vote Sunday, the electorate will decide whether to
endorse a government overhaul of pensions, financed by provisions
for women to work until the age of 64 _ if they are willing and
able.

Government moves to seize all assets of Bahrain cable TV firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ The government has moved to seize
all the assets of a Bahrain-based company that was installing a
cable television system in the Indian Ocean archipelago.
	   In a notice served on the Global Investment and Business Corp.
Tuesday, the Ministry of Finance accused the firm of violating
import regulations.
	   The notice, signed by C. Morin, Director General of the
ministry's Trades Tax Import Division, stated that bills of entry
and invoices for goods imported for the project were false because
the price of the goods had been overstated.
	   The cable TV installation was a major project in the Seychelles,
whose main source of revenue is tourism. President France-Albert
Rene was a vocal backer of the project under which Global
Investment had been allocated one of the two sites formerly used by
the U.S. satellite tracking station at La Misere in the hills above
Victoria, the Seychelles capital on the largest island, Mahe.
	   Global Investment, owned by Bahrain businessman Abdulla bin
Yousuf Al-Shaibani, had been granted a special investment promotion
status which should have allowed the company to import all its
equipment duty free.
	   Global had just announced it would begin connections to
residences Oct. 1. and had earlier said it would be offering 20
channels.
	   Seychelles has an estimated population of 76,000 and the highest
annual per capita income in Africa.

Cambodian `prisoner of conscience' pardoned by king
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk on Thursday
pardoned an opposition party official convicted in a widely
criticized case of killing a relative of Cambodian leader Hun Sen.
	   Sam Rainsy Party security chief Srun Vong Vannak was convicted
last September for the 1996 murder of Kov Samuth, a national police
official who was Hun Sen's brother-in-law.
	   Vannak, currently serving a 13-year sentence at a Phnom Penh
prison, is expected to be freed Friday, according to prison police.
They did not say why he was not released right away even though the
pardon was supposed to take effect immediately.
	   Hun Sen agreed to the pardon during Tuesday's summit meeting of
rival party leaders in the northwestern town of Siem Reap. The
meeting was meant to end the nation's post-election political
turmoil and pave the way for formation of the next government.
	   In the past, the king has granted politically sensitive pardons
only with the agreement of the country's political leadership.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International had described
Vannak as a ``prisoner of conscience,'' charging he was detained
``solely for his peaceful political affiliation and wrongly
convicted on politically motivated criminal charges.''
	   An Amnesty spokesman in London welcomed the pardon for Vannak,
but expressed concern that its terms did not overturn the judgment
against him.
	   ``This does not constitute an unconditional release, which is
what we would ask for any prisoner of conscience,'' she said.
	   Vannak was arrested without a warrant in February 1997 and held
incommunicado for more than two weeks during which police extracted
a murder confession. He disavowed it in court.
	   Two other men charged and convicted in the case, whose testimony
was instrumental to Vannak's conviction, recanted their testimony
shortly after the trial. They told human rights groups in letters
from prison that their confessions had been made under duress.
	   The two men were also jailed and were not covered by the pardon.

Crown prince and commoner girl friend reportedly split
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A four-year royal romance between
Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and an orthodontist's daughter
is over, the nation's best-selling newspaper reported Thursday,
ending speculation that their engagement was imminent.
	   ``It is over!'' screamed a giant headline emblazoned across the
front page of the daily De Telegraaf.
	   The cause of the split between the 31-year-old prince and
commoner Emily Bremers was not disclosed, but citing unnamed royal
insiders, De Telegraaf reported the relationship hit the rocks a
few months ago.
	   The newspaper said it got confirmation of the split from the
mother of Marilene van den Broek, who recently married one of
Willem-Alexander's cousins and is a close friend of Bremers.
	   Bremers met Willem-Alexander when they were both students at
Leiden University, where the prince studied history while Bremers
took a law degree.
	   News of the royal romance began to trickle out in early 1995,
and since then, snippets of information and rumor about the
relationship have been fodder for Dutch tabloids.
	   Responding to Thursday's report, royal family spokesman Eef
Brouwers said only: ``She (Bremers) was a friend and is a friend of
the prince.''
	   The Royal House never officially confirmed that the relationship
existed and Willem-Alexander, one of Europe's most eligible royal
bachelors, has always remained silent on the topic.
	   In a rare television interview last year, the prince said he's
in no hurry to get married and even refused to acknowledge the
28-year-old Bremers as his girl friend.
	   ``When I have a suitable candidate whom I want to marry, then I
will announce her name,'' he said then.
	   But Bremers' appearance this year at a royal ball and a royal
wedding fueled talks that she had won official approval, and an
engagement was imminent.
	   The speculation spurred respected weekly magazine HP/De Tijd to
publish an 8-page profile of Bremers in a recent issue, describing
``Queen Emily'' as ``spontaneous, social and refreshing.''

Government moves to seize all assets of Bahrain cable TV firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ The government has moved to seize
all the assets of a Bahrain-based company that was installing a
cable television system in the Indian Ocean archipelago.
	   In a notice served on the Global Investment and Business Corp.
Tuesday, the Ministry of Finance accused the firm of violating
import regulations.
	   The notice, signed by C. Morin, Director General of the
ministry's Trades Tax Import Division, stated that bills of entry
and invoices for goods imported for the project were false because
the price of the goods had been overstated.
	   The cable TV installation was a major project in the Seychelles,
whose main source of revenue is tourism. President France-Albert
Rene was a vocal backer of the project under which Global
Investment had been allocated one of the two sites formerly used by
the U.S. satellite tracking station at La Misere in the hills above
Victoria, the Seychelles capital on the largest island, Mahe.
	   Global Investment, owned by Bahrain businessman Abdulla bin
Yousuf Al-Shaibani, had been granted a special investment promotion
status which should have allowed the company to import all its
equipment duty free.
	   Global had just announced it would begin connections to
residences Oct. 1. and had earlier said it would be offering 20
channels.
	   Seychelles has an estimated population of 76,000 and the highest
annual per capita income in Africa.

Spanish government under heightened pressure for gesture to ETA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government faced mounting pressure
Thursday to respond to ETA's truce with a conciliatory gesture, as
the main opposition party backed calls to move Basque separatist
prisoners closer to home.
	   In a meeting with reporters, Socialist Party secretary general
Joaquin Almunia sought to portray the party as being in sync with
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on his stance that negotiations
with ETA are impossible so long as its commandos remain armed and
committed to violence.
	   ``Before the ceasefire the guns were pointed at people. Now the
gunmen are just pointing at the ceiling,'' Almunia said, mimicking
a person holding a rifle.
	   But he suggested that the government was being too cautious at
what he described as a crossroads for Spaniards weary of 30 years
of separatist bombings and shootings in the Basque country and
elsewhere in Spain.
	   ``The government cannot remain immobile,'' Almunia said.
``Something must be done.''
	   He said he agreed with a suggestion by the president of the
Basque regional government, Jose Antonio Ardanza, that Madrid
should at least consider transferring ETA prisoners from jails
scattered around the country to ones closer to the Basque region of
northern Spain.
	   A total of 536 accused ETA members are in jail, some as far away
as the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in North Africa or in the Canary
Islands, off the coast of West Africa. One of ETA's long-standing
demands is that the prisoners be transferred to the Basque country
itself.
	   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja on Wednesday rejected the
idea of a transfer.
	   ``I see no need, other than to confuse people, to make gestures
that at this point would not serve any purpose,'' he said.
	   He and other government officials have expressed fears that ETA
might use the ceasefire, its first open-ended one yet, as a
smokescreen to regroup its forces after dozens of arrests in recent
months.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym that stands for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its drive for an
independent Basque homeland.

International Maritime Organization sets trust for training,
</HEADLINE>
monument &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The International Maritime Organization is setting
up a trust fund to improve training for merchant seafarers and
increase awareness of the shipping industry, the organization
announced Thursday.
	   The IMO, the United Nations agency that deals with maritime
safety and prevention of pollution from ships, hopes to raise at
least 6 million pounds (dlrs 10 million) from the shipping industry
and other sources for the programs, IMO Secretary-General William
A. O'Neil said.
	   The plan calls for establishment of a chair of maritime safety
and marine pollution prevention at World Maritime University in
Malmo, Sweden, fellowships for students at maritime training
institutes around the world, and funding of various other training
programs.
	   ``We're aware that we really cannot hope to improve safety
simply by adding more and more regulations to the pile we already
have,'' O'Neil said. ``We have to develop and encourage a culture
of safety.''
	   Money from the fund also will go toward construction of a
memorial to seafarers who lost their lives on the job, O'Neil said.
It is to be built next year at IMO headquarters in south London.
	   ``There are memorials to sailors in different parts of the
world, particularly related to wartime efforts, but I searched and
cannot find any place where there is any reference to sailors or
seafarers who have lost their lives in the course of their duty on
merchant ships,'' O'Neil said.
	   O'Neil said some of the major shippers he has approached about
the trust fund were ``supportive.''
	   The announcement coincided with World Maritime Day and the 50th
anniversary of the IMO's founding.

Record-high number of dengue fever cases in the Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Dengue fever cases have reached an
all-time high in the Philippines and are likely to rise further
because of expected heavy rains, the Department of Health said
Thursday.
	   As of Sept. 21, the number of people who died this year from
dengue was 276, while 15,650 others were hospitalized. That
surpassed the previous records of 205 deaths and 14,648 cases in
1996, the department said.
	   Weather forecasters have predicted heavy rains later this year.
	   A fourth dengue strain is also expected to appear during the
period. The last time the four strains were recorded simultaneously
in the Philippines was in 1983.
	   Dengue fever, which is carried by daytime biting mosquitoes,
causes high fever, rash, nose bleeds and sometimes shock and
internal bleeding. It can be fatal if not treated early.
	   The mosquitoes breed in standing water. On Thursday, a doctor
warned Filipino males against urinating in public because urine was
found to hasten the hatching of mosquitoes.
	   Lilian de las Llagas, an entomologist at the University of the
Philippines, said ammonia in urine can shorten the hatching period
from two days to four hours.
	   The health department said eradication efforts have reduced
dengue ``hot spots'' to just two places _ Bagong Silang in Caloocan
City, north of Manila, and Bacoor in Cavite province, south of the
capital. However, several other smaller outbreaks are also being
watched, it said.

Yugoslav officials shrug off threats, advance into rebel stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Serbs saying Albanian rebels
surrounded, fighting eased in some regions. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces on Thursday
struck deeper into the last pockets of Kosovo Albanian separatists,
despite U.N. and NATO moves that open the door for a military
strike against them.
	   The boom of artillery sounded Thursday across the central
Drenica region of the Serbian province, and Serb police sources
said they divided the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army by taking
over a main road through the rebels last stronghold.
	   Pristina's Serb-controlled Media Center said police had ``closed
the ring around strong groups of Albanian extremists,'' destroying
their bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, the vast majority in Kosovo, favor
independence. World powers instead back autonomy for Kosovo
instead, arguing that independence can be achieved only through
prolonged bloodshed.
	   Most victims of the Serb-Yugoslav military campaign have been
ethnic Albanian civilians. More than 275,000 have been driven from
hundreds of destroyed villages, leaving an estimated 50,000 with no
shelter as winter approaches.
	   Later Thursday, the intensity of the fighting appeared to ease
at least in some parts of the Drenica region. But it was impossible
to determine whether the overall offensive had lessened in response
to new signs of U.N. and NATO determination.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday threatened further action
unless the fighting stopped. While not specifically mandating NATO
action, the resolution opened the way for international approval of
military involvement.
	   NATO ambassadors meeting in Portugal on Thursday approved
increased planning for air strikes in Kosovo. NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said the decision takes the
organization ``to an increased level of military preparedness''
without actually approving the use of force.
	   The plight of the ethnic Albanian refugees is driving Western
efforts to get a commitment from Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end the government offensive and permit mass refugee
returns.
	   Refugee numbers were swollen by the latest fighting, with up to
20,000 civilians fleeing their homes in the Drenica area, west and
southwest of Pristina.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians patrolled nearly all routes into the region, tightening
the noose on several hundred lightly armed rebels.
	   The U.N. resolution _ the toughest action the council has taken
to date _ came less than 24 hours before the NATO defense
ministers' meeting in Portugal.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, have committed men and aircraft for any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.''

Israel says no progress in talks if Arafat raises statehood issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Palestinian negotiator, Arafat meeting
with Israeli opposition legislator over &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel warned Yasser Arafat on Thursday that he
will sabotage prospects for a West Bank troop withdrawal if he
seeks world support in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly next
week for a planned declaration of Palestinian statehood.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Arafat is determined to
use his rare appearance before the world body to win international
backing for independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May
when the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy expires.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank in New York this week.
	   U.S. officials had considered arranging a meeting between Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York. However,
with both sides sharpening their rhetoric over the statehood issue,
it appeared unlikely such a summit will take place.
	   Netanyahu is already in New York to address the U.N. General
Assembly later Thursday and Arafat is to arrive later in the week.
	   Israeli officials warned Thursday that the negotiations on a
West Bank withdrawal would suffer if Arafat raised the statehood
issue in his speech to the United Nations on Monday.
	   ``If Arafat chooses the path of diplomatic struggle against
Israel in the United Nations and attempts to promote a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood, he will simply sabotage the
chance that exists to achieve agreement with Israel,'' said Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   Netanyahu said a unilateral declaration would violate the
autonomy accords which say the final status of the disputed
territories must be determined through negotiations.
	   If Arafat declares a state in May, this ``in effect cancels the
(peace) agreement,'' Netanyahu said in New York.
	   ``I very much recommend to Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority not to take this course. It will certainly trigger
Israeli measures,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu has not said specifically how he would respond, but it
is believed he would annex parts of the West Bank and seal off
autonomous Palestinian areas from one another.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that when Arafat brings
up statehood in his U.S. speech, he is not trying to provoke
Israel. ``We are not threatening anyone. We are asking for the
world's help,'' Erekat sad.
	   Under the autonomy agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides are to conclude talks on a permanent
peace agreement by May 4, 1999.
	   However, with both sides still hung up over interim issues, such
as a staged troop withdrawal, such talks have not begun. It is
increasingly unlikely that a permanent agreement _ which will have
to address explosive issues like final borders and the future of
Jerusalem _ will be reached by the deadline.
	   The architect of the autonomy agreements, Israeli opposition
legislator Yossi Beilin, made a last appeal to Arafat not to go
ahead with a declaration of statehood.
	   ``I see the fourth of May as the beginning of a tragedy,''
Beilin told The Associated Press ahead of a meeting with Arafat in
Gaza City on Thursday morning. ``I think both sides are not really
ready for what will happen after the Palestinians make such a
declaration. They haven't thought out the consequences fully.''
	   Beilin proposed to Arafat that the Palestinians agree to extend
the deadline for a final peace agreement until January 2001.
	   Israel, in turn, would complete a withdrawal from half of the
West Bank by January 1999, Beilin said.
	   It would also declare that it would accept in principle the
creation of a demilitarized Palestinian state, with the final
borders and its capital to be negotiated.
	   Arafat told Beilin that he didn't think much of the ideas
because they did not have Netanyahu's backing, Palestinian
officials said.

Philippine Airlines winds up business after shutdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with PAL's closure affecting food, newspaper
distribution, comment by official in grafs 7-10; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos MLA101-106
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Debt-laden Philippine Airlines began
winding up its business Thursday, as the government struggled to
fill the void in air services left by its closure.
	   Asia's oldest airline closed at midnight Wednesday after
last-minute negotiations failed to persuade its largest union to
accept a recovery plan.
	   Jaime Bautista, PAL's chief finance officer, said the airline
would begin work on a plan to dispose of its assets and pay off
creditors and more than 8,000 employees.
	   ``It'll take time, it will be a long process,'' he told
reporters.
	   Many PAL employees reported for work Thursday to retrieve
personal belongings and help PAL shut down its operations, an
airline spokesman said. Notices will soon be issued explaining how
and when separation benefits will be given, he said.
	   The closure of PAL leaves many areas of the 7,000-island
archipelago without air service. Two smaller carriers were grounded
last week over safety concerns and financial problems.
	   In southern General Santos city, an official said 20 tons of
tuna and asparagus, their main products, could not be delivered
Thursday to Manila for eventual export to Japan because of PAL's
closure.
	   City administrator Rodrigo Salansang said tourism would also be
adversely affected. When PAL's flights were canceled for nearly a
month during a pilots' strike in June, hotel occupancy rates fell
by 50 percent, he said.
	   ``This is bad for our business,'' Salansang said. ``The
government has to do something before it endangers the national
economy.''
	   Several Manila newspapers said the copies they distributed to
the central and southern Philippines Thursday were reduced by up to
50 percent because the remaining airlines have limited cargo
capacity and have prioritized passengers and baggage.
	   PAL officials had threatened to close the company unless workers
accepted their rescue plan, which they said was crucial to the
airline's recovery from a series of crippling strikes and Asia's
currency crisis.
	   Hours before its scheduled closure at midnight Wednesday, PAL
resumed talks with its ground workers' union. But after several
hours of negotiations, PAL said it could not accept the union's
conditions.
	   PAL is the largest Philippine company to fail since Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching a dlrs
4 billion expansion and refleeting plan. It owes about dlrs 2.1
billion to foreign and local creditors.
	   President Joseph Estrada said the government has arranged for
the country's second-largest carrier, Air Philippines, to rent some
of PAL's aircraft to service some of its former routes.
	   Philippine officials said they were meeting with other domestic
airlines to help them expand their fleets to ease the void in air
services. PAL had a 50 percent share of domestic passenger traffic,
down from 75 percent before the pilots' strike in June.
	   Cebu Pacific Air general manager Diego Garrido said his company
has increased its daily domestic flights to almost 50 from 38 to
take up the slack.
	   The other alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila, killing at
least 46 people.
	   PAL's demise saddened many Filipinos. Several television
stations broadcast poignant scenes Wednesday from its 57-year
history. At PAL offices around the country, airline workers held
masses and prayer rallies, hoping for a way to avoid the flag
carrier's closure.

Ruling party readmits former rebels into gov't under U.N. pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Under pressure from the United Nations,
Angola's governing party on Thursday readmitted some officials from
the former rebel group UNITA into the government of national unity.
	   However, only those nine UNITA members who have split from rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi were allowed back. Another two whose position
was unclear were not called back.
	   The UNITA leadership in their central highland stronghold in
Bailundo, 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Luanda, said in a
statement that the announcement was meaningless because the
leadership had not been consulted.
	   The UNITA cabinet members were suspended earlier this month in
what was a serious blow to a 4-year-old peace process. The
government also severed relations with Savimbi, who is blamed by
the government and the U.N. for delaying the implementation of the
1994 peace accord which ended a two-decade civil war.
	   The U.N. Security Council urged the government to reverse its
decision to sever dialogue with the emblematic rebel chief last
week, reportedly angering President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   The Government of National Unity and Reconciliation was formed
in April last year but UNITA has complained that its members were
never consulted in executive decisions.
	   The U.N.-monitored peace process has been on hold since May
because of tension between the former foes.

Former Arsenal scout fined for accepting kickback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Arsenal scout who admitted receiving a
35,000 pound (dlrs 58,000) kickback from a player transfer deal was
fined 7,500 (dlr 12,450) Thursday by the Football Association.
	   Steve Burtenshaw, former Arsenal scout and current head scout at
Queens Park Rangers, received the payment from an agent after the
transfer of midfielder John Jensen from Brondby to Arsenal in 1992.
	   George Graham, current Leeds United manager, was fired as
Arsenal coach and served a one-year ban imposed by the FA after he
was found guilty of accepting kickbacks from transfer deals.
	   Burtenshaw last week admitted to an FA hearing to accepting the
kick-back from player agent Rune Hauge two months after Jensen's
move to Arsenal.
	   The FA ruled that Burtenshaw had not solicited the payment but
had accepted the unauthorized ``back-hander.'' The 62-year-old was
ordered to pay 2,500 (dlrs 4,150) legal costs.
	   An FA statement said the payment to Burtenshaw was a clear
conflict of interest with his club.
	   ``It was accepted by the commission that the payment was not
solicited by Burtenshaw. However, the payment of back-handers to
management, with or without their knowledge, is unacceptable,'' the
statement said.
	   The Nottingham Forest club and its former assistant manager
Ronnie Fenton still face charges of accepting a kickback from Hauge
after Alfe-Inge Haaland's transfer from Norwegian club Bryne in
1994.
	   Former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough was excused from
facing misconduct charges on the grounds of poor health.

Russian inflation up 67 percent since August; expected to worsen

possible default, more figures from the Central Bank, minor editing

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian inflation has skyrocketed 67 percent since
last month, and the Central Bank said Thursday the worst was still
ahead _ price hikes could approach 300 percent by year's end.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pledged strong steps to
stabilize the crumbling economy, and for the first time since
assuming office two weeks ago, he offered the outlines of a plan
for combating the crisis.
	   Primakov said he'll pay wage arrears to workers and soldiers,
offer compensation to offset the painful effects of inflation, and
impose greater state control on the alcohol industry, a leading
source of government tax revenue.
	   But the government is broke and will almost certainly have to
print more money to pay its debts, a move that's virtually certain
to push inflation even higher.
	   Primakov blamed his predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, for igniting
the crisis last month. Primakov claimed that Kiriyenko's Aug. 17
announcement on devaluing the ruble and restructuring government
debt was made without the consent of President Boris Yeltsin and
that the results had been ``chaotic.''
	   ``It is essential to do everything to prevent the Aug. 17
statement ... from leading to dangerous socio-economic
consequences,'' said Primakov, speaking at the start of a cabinet
meeting.
	   Yeltsin has remained largely in the background since the crisis
erupted. The president has never shown an appetite for handling
day-to-day policy matters, and as with past government failures, he
has responded by blaming subordinates and sacking them.
	   Meanwhile, inflation figures released Thursday confirmed what
Russians already knew _ prices have been going up by the day.
	   Inflation is up 67 percent since the crisis began five weeks
ago, the State Statistics Committee said. The Central Bank forecast
that the rate could reach 240 to 290 percent by year's end, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Also, Russia's economy is expected to contract about 5 to 6
percent this year, the Central Bank said. The Russian economy has
been shrinking throughout the 1990s, except for last year when it
eked out 0.8 percent growth.
	   A top government official warned Thursday that Russia could
default on its international debt if the International Monetary
Fund does not continue to extend financial help to Russia in the
coming months.
	   ``I don't want to scare people with the possibility of default
on foreign debt,'' said First Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin. ``But
we do need to count on the loyal attitude of our partners in the
international financial organizations ... in not canceling earlier
agreed-upon aid packages.''
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package in July and
has issued the first installment. But it is expected to delay
additional money _ perhaps for several months _ until it's
satisfied that Russia has sound financial policies.
	   ``Such an approach would drive Russia into a corner,'' Shokhin
said.
	   Thursday's grim economic statistics made clear that Russia was
once again facing another round of hyperinflation and depression.
	   The country suffered from several bouts of uncontrolled
inflation in the early 1990s as it began its rocky transition to a
market economy, but prices had become more stable in recent years.
	   Until August, inflation was running at less than 1 percent a
month and was expected to be under 10 percent for the entire year,
which would have been the best performance since the market reforms
began.
	   But when the ruble began to tumble last month, prices
immediately soared.
	   The ruble went from about six to the dollar last month to as low
as 20 to the dollar this month. It has strengthened a bit and was
trading Thursday at around 15.
	   The weaker currency means that Russia's many imports are now two
or three times more expensive than before, and that has driven up
inflation.
	   The government's budget demands could require the printing of up
to 40 billion to 50 billion new rubles, which would greatly
increase the money supply, as well as inflation, the Central Bank
said.

Sri Lanka ups defense spending and vows to end war by military

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's governing coalition wants
a 28 percent increase in military spending, vowing to crush the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam guerrillas and ruling out talks to
end the 15-year insurgency.
	   ``We will never give the LTTE another chance to reorganize on
the pretext of peace talks. We pledge to fight until we destroy the
last terrorist,'' the state-run Daily News quoted Anuruddha
Ratwatte, the junior defense minister, as saying at a public
meeting.
	   The ruling party on Wednesday asked parliament for 12.2 billion
rupees (dlrs 184 million) more than the 44 billion rupees (dlrs 665
million) which was budgeted for the military for 1998. Parliament
is likely to approve the increase later this month, officials said.
	   The government did not give a reason for the increase, which
brings the total defense spending to 56.2 billion rupees (dlrs 850
million).
	   Six rebels were killed in clashes with government troops on
Wednesday in the northern jungles, said Major Kumar Dewage, a
military spokesman. There were no casualties on the government
side, he said.
	   President Chandrika Kumaratunga has repeatedly said that she
will not negotiate unless the guerrillas give up their weapons, but
opposition leader Ranil Wickremasinghe recently urged the
government to hold unconditional talks.
	   The war is at a stalemate after heavy battles in the last three
years. A 16-month-old battle over the control of the main highway
linking Colombo to the north has killed a total of more than 5,000
on both sides.
	   The last two attempts at talks, most recently in 1995, ended
with the guerrillas staging surprise attacks on the military.
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the population, accuse the Sinhalese of discrimination. But not
all embrace the rebel solution of a homeland in the north and east,
where Tamils predominate.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the war which began
in 1983.

Doctors baffled by deaths, seek federal help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Medical authorities in a northern Indian
state have turned to the federal government for help determining
why 42 people died after suffering high fever, and thousands are
hospitalized with the illness.
	   ``We are baffled. The patients are not responding to treatments
for viral fever or malaria,'' Dr. Suresh Bhandari said Thursday.
Bhandari is the chief medical officer in Etah district, the area in
Uttar Pradesh state where the deaths occurred over the last two
weeks.
	   District Magistrate Jeevesh Nandan said nearly 10,000 people
with high fever were being treated at hospitals serving some 200
villages in Etah, 200 kilometers (124 miles) southeast of New
Delhi.
	   State health director H.C. Vaish said blood and tissue samples
of the victims had been sent to New Delhi for analysis at federal
laboratories. He added he had contacted officials at the country's
main research hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences
in New Delhi, about taking patients if local hospitals are
overwhelmed.
	   It may be another four or five days before the cause of the
fever is identified, Vaish said. Until then, patients were being
treated with antibiotic and anti-malarial drugs.
	   Etah is not in the part of Uttar Pradesh that was recently
flooded. As the floods recede, health officials are combating
water-related diseases such as Japanese encephalitis.

Libya replaces lawyers for two Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has replaced the lawyers for the two
suspects implicated in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, replacing them
with a government-appointed legal team, an attorney who had
represented the men said Thursday.
	   Ibrahim Legwell, the Libyan who had headed the defense team,
said he feared the change meant the case would now be focused on
political issues rather than legal points, adding he opposed such a
move.
	   ``Maybe they (Libyan officials) feel that we haven't taken
decisions according to their decision,'' Legwell said, commenting
on the reasons for replacing his legal team.
	   The new team, which is to be headed by former Foreign Minister
Kamal Mahgoub, is ``very likely'' to toe the government line in
reflecting political considerations, Legwell told The Associated
Press by telephone from his office in Tripoli.
	   ``I refused to be a part of the new team because ... it isn't
appropriate for the administration to take over,'' he added.
	   Libyan officials could not be immediately reached for comment on
Legwell's statements.
	   Libya recently accepted a U.S. and British proposal for the two
suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, to
be tried in the Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges
under Scottish law.
	   Despite U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992, Liban leader
Moammar Gadhafi refused for years to allow the men to be extradited
to the United States or Britain for trial, claiming they would not
get fair trials.
	   The sanctions, imposed to force Gadhafi to hand over the
suspects for trial, sanctions ban air travel to and from Libya,
freeze foreign assets and bar the sale of some oil equipment.
	   The two Libyans are charged in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were killed.
	   Libya still is demanding negotiations on the trial to ensure the
safety of the suspects and prevent their extradition from the
Netherlands.
	   Washington and London have said that the offer is non-negotiable
but that they are willing to discuss details through U.N.
officials.
	   Legwell said he was unsure how the decision would impact on the
prospect of the trial taking place, but added that he had been
retained by the two men and had not received word from them that
they no longer wanted his services.
	   ``The next step now depends on the (Libyan) administration),''
he said.
	   Legwell's legal colleagues, including lawyers from Britain, the
United States and the Netherlands, were expected to travel to Libya
to meet with the defendants and look into whether the U.S.-British
proposal offered the guarantees demanded by Libya.
	   But given the government's decision, ``they won't be coming,''
Legwell said.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's oil minister said Thursday that members
of OPEC will meet with non-OPEC oil producers next month on the
sidelines of a producer-consumer conference in South Africa.
	   The minister, Sheik Saud al-Nasser al-Sabah, said the ministers
will evaluate the market to determine if more production cuts were
needed to help firm up world prices. He spoke in an interview with
Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The meeting in late October in Cape Town, South Africa, will be
ahead of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
November meeting.
	   ``From now through October, we will be watching the market very
closely,'' Sheik Saud said. ``The situation really requires more
decisive action for the future.''
	   He said producers must concentrate on price rather than volume.
While he acknowledged that ministers have discussed specific
reductions, he refused to give any figures.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait said Thursday it expected to have deals
with international oil companies by the end of the year to develop
a number of its oil fields.
	   ``Hopefully, by the end of the year ... we could have something
worked out,'' the country's oil minister, Sheik Saud al-Sabah, told
Dow Jones Newswires in an interview.
	   Sheik Saud said officials would be holding talks with
international companies over the next two months, but refused to
name any of the firms.
	   The negotiations are reportedly for the development of five
northern fields near the border with Iraq.
	   He noted that Kuwait's constitution bars production sharing
agreements. The new deals, he said, would be operating service
agreements.

	   Speculation characterized trading this week, the company said in
a weekly report about the exchange, which lists 76 companies and is
one of the most active in Arab countries.
	   Some 381.91 million shares changed hands in the five days of

	   A market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
declined 1.25 percent to 173.45 points.
	   Shares of industrial companies dropped 2.35 percent, commercial
banks 1.04 percent and insurance firms 0.20 percent. But shares of
the service sector increased 0.44 percent.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian officials will meet in Washington
on Tuesday with American agricultural companies to seek U.S.
investments in a huge irrigation project in southern Egypt.
	   The Egyptian delegation _ headed by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
and Water Resources Minister Mahmoud Abdel-Halim Abu-Zeid _ will be
discussing the Toshka project, the Arabic-language Al-Ahram daily
reported.
	   The meeting in Washington, expected to involve 50 large American
companies, is a follow up to a visit to Egypt last August by
members of the House Agriculture Committee.
	   Egypt wants American input to secure state-of-the-art technology
and expertise in areas like genetic engineering, water management
and crop production, Al-Ahram said.
	   The Toshka project involves a huge canal to irrigate some 1.2
million hectares (3 million acres) of desert land.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt and the United Arab Emirates are
discussing a joint free trade agreement to promote trade and
investment, the Egyptian Gazette reported Thursday.
	   The English-language daily said Egyptian Trade Minister Ahmed
Guweili was in touch with the Emirates' economy minister, Sheik
Fahim bin Sultan al-Qasimi, on the issue and that a draft agreement
was being discussed.
	   Egypt has negotiated a number of free trade deals with Arab
countries and also is a strong backer of the Arab League effort to
create a Middle East free trade zone.

Israel says no progress in talks if Arafat raises statehood issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Palestinian negotiator, Arafat meeting
with Israeli opposition legislator over &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel warned Yasser Arafat on Thursday that he
will sabotage prospects for a West Bank troop withdrawal if he
seeks support for a planned declaration of Palestinian statehood
when he addresses the U.N. General Assembly next week.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Arafat is determined to
use his rare appearance before the world body to win international
backing for independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip when the
five-year period of Palestinian autonomy expires in May.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
in New York this week on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   U.S. officials had considered arranging a meeting between Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they are both in
New York, where the United Nations is located. However, with both
sides sharpening their rhetoric over the statehood issue, it
appeared unlikely such a summit will take place.
	   Netanyahu is already in New York to address the U.N. General
Assembly later and Arafat is to arrive later in the week.
	   Israeli officials warned Thursday that the negotiations on a
West Bank withdrawal would suffer if Arafat raised the statehood
issue in his Monday speech to the United Nations.
	   ``If Arafat chooses the path of diplomatic struggle against
Israel in the United Nations and attempts to promote a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood, he will simply sabotage the
chance that exists to achieve agreement with Israel,'' said Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   Netanyahu said a unilateral declaration would violate the
autonomy accords which say the final status of the disputed
territories must be negotiated.
	   If Arafat declares a state in May, this ``in effect cancels the
(peace) agreement,'' Netanyahu said in New York.
	   ``I very much recommend to Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority not to take this course. It will certainly trigger
Israeli measures,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu has not said specifically how he would respond, but it
is believed he would annex parts of the West Bank and seal off
autonomous Palestinian areas from one another.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that when Arafat brings
up statehood in his U.S. speech, he is not trying to provoke
Israel. ``We are not threatening anyone. We are asking for the
world's help,'' Erekat sad.
	   Under the autonomy agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides are to conclude talks on a permanent
peace agreement by May 4, 1999.
	   However, with both sides still hung up over interim issues, such
as a staged troop withdrawal, such talks have not begun. It is
increasingly unlikely that a permanent agreement _ which will have
to address explosive issues like final borders and the future of
Jerusalem _ will be reached by the deadline.
	   The architect of the autonomy agreements, Israeli opposition
legislator Yossi Beilin, made a last appeal to Arafat not to go
ahead with a declaration of statehood.
	   ``I see the fourth of May as the beginning of a tragedy,''
Beilin told The Associated Press before a Thursday meeting with
Arafat in Gaza City. ``I think both sides are not really ready for
what will happen after the Palestinians make such a declaration.
They haven't thought out the consequences fully.''
	   Beilin proposed to Arafat that the Palestinians agree to extend
the deadline for a final peace agreement until January 2001.
	   Israel, in turn, would complete a withdrawal from half of the
West Bank by January 1999, Beilin said.
	   It would also declare that it would accept in principle the
creation of a demilitarized Palestinian state, with the final
borders and its capital to be negotiated.
	   Arafat told Beilin that he didn't think much of the ideas
because they did not have Netanyahu's backing, Palestinian
officials said.

Lebed calls for Yeltsin to step down, blasts Chernomyrdin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Gen. Alexander Lebed, one of Russia's most
influential politicians, called Thursday for the resignation of
President Boris Yeltsin and his entire Cabinet.
	   Lebed, the governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk region, has long
been critical of Yeltsin. But he has voiced support recently for
the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, who is still assembling a
Cabinet.
	   During a just-concluded visit to France, Lebed said, he was told
by French business leaders that Russia ``would not get a single
dollar'' so long as Yeltsin remains in power, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   A likely presidential candidate himself, Lebed said the entire
government should be replaced with a group that can be trusted and
doesn't have ``the previous frauds,'' Interfax said.
	   Lebed also said former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has
little chance at winning the next presidential elections in 2000,
despite his expressed intentions to run.
	   Chernomyrdin, who failed to win approval from Russia's
parliament as Russia's prime minister in a government shakeup last
month, is not seen as popular among ordinary Russians.
	   ``After the fiasco Chernomyrdin suffered in the Duma, one can
hardly expect a success,'' Lebed told reporters, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency. ``He will not become president.''
	   Lebed still refuses to say whether he plans to run for the 2000
elections.

Thousands join Istanbul's mayor to protest his ban from politics

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with quote from Erdogan, comments from Islamic party
leader; ADDs details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Istanbul's pro-Islamic mayor and tens of
thousands of his supporters assailed Turkey's justice system
Thursday, a day after an appeals court upheld the mayor's prison
sentence in a major blow to his political career.
	   ``This sentence has shaken the belief of millions of people in
justice,'' Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, while crowds gathered
outside shouting slogans.
	   ``Tell us to die, we will die. Tell us to shoot, we will
shoot,'' the crowd screamed.
	   ``My people will decide on my position in politics, not someone
else,'' Erdogan said, expressing his innocence and describing the
sentence as a political plot by his opponents to prevent the rise
of his Islamic Virtue Party. ``The will of God will come true.''
	   Erdogan, seen, as a future leader of the movement, will never be
eligible to run for any political office, according to Turkish law.
	   He was convicted of inciting religious hatred by reading a poem
in southeastern city of Siirt at a rally last year.
	   Erdogan, 43, has two weeks to ask the appeals court to again
review the case. Appeals courts very rarely overturn their own
verdicts.
	   In accordance with the sentence, Erdogan will be unseated as
mayor of Istanbul, Turkey's largest city with 10 million people,
probably before general and local elections in April. He will be
eligible for parole after serving about one-third of the sentence.
	   He had hoped to take over the leadership of Virtue, the new
Islamic party formed to replace the Welfare party, which was closed
down by the Constitutional Court in February for anti-secular
activity.
	   Recai Kutan, the current leader of Virtue, called on the angry
supporters to calm down. ``No doubt, these difficult days will
end,'' Kutan said. ``We will keep on going with patience and common
sense.''
	   Party officials warned the crowds not to attack TV crews at the
end of the news conference, in which Erdogan accused some media
outlets of pressuring the appeals judges to affirm his sentence,
private NTV television said.
	   The fiercely secular military was instrumental in outlawing
Welfare, and maintains pressure on the government to crack down on
what it perceives as Islamic threats.

Police chief threatens British reporter at news conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Malaysia-Politics

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's national police chief
told a British journalist to ``shut up'' and threatened to take the
writer to his ``room'' for asking questions about a jailed
opposition leader.
	   The argument erupted during a news conference where journalists
asked pointed questions about the whereabouts of former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was detained on Sunday.
	   The police chief, Rahim Noor, said Anwar _ who has not been seen
by family or lawyers since his detention _ is ``safe and sound''
and ``would be given a fair trial, very much like the British
system.''
	   John Sweeney, a London-based reporter with The Observer
newspaper, asked the police chief to explain how British law would
permit a man who was once deputy prime minister to simply disappear
in police custody.
	   ``I think you can come to my room!'' Rahim shouted at Sweeney.
	   ``Please arrange him to come to my room,'' he said, gesturing to
a police officer seated nearby.
	   When Sweeney attempted to ask more questions, Rahim lashed out.
	   ``You shut up! You come from where?'' he asked. ``Enough from
you!''
	   ``Enough from the foreign press,'' he then said.
	   Sweeney blurted out: ``You don't seem to understand the rules of
a press conference.''
	   ``This is a different kind of press conference,'' Rahim replied,
threatening to have a policeman show Sweeney the door.
	   ``I can be tough, you know.''
	   At one point, a plainclothes policeman grabbed Sweeney's arm.
	   Rahim denied that he was intimidating the reporter and backed
down when other reporters asked if they could accompany Sweeney to
the police chief's ``room.''
	   It was unclear why Rahim called the snap press conference.
	   He began the meeting by accusing the foreign press of
exaggerating the demonstration where more than 35,000 people
gathered in the capital's Merdeka Square on Sunday.
	   Rahim said international news reporters wanted riots like the
May violence in Indonesia that led to the downfall of President
Suharto.
	   On Wednesday, the government issued restrictions blocking
foreign news broadcasting agencies from transmitting footage that
shows Malaysia in a negative light.

Opponents of Berlin-Hamburg maglev train force new vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Opponents of a planned high-speed train between
Berlin and Hamburg have gathered enough signatures to force Berlin
lawmakers to debate their concerns again, petition-drive organizers
said Thursday.
	   But even if the Berlin parliament were to vote against the
project, it would have only symbolic effect, since the Transrapid
is sponsored by the federal government and German railway.
	   The 9.8 billion marks (dlrs 5.5 billion) magnetic-levitation
train is to link Germany's two biggest cities by 2005, and cut
travel time for the 297-kilometer (185-mile) trip by two-thirds, to
about an hour.
	   Opponents have challenged the project because of its cost and
charge the powerful electromagnetic force that will drive the train
could have adverse health consequences for humans and animals.

Palestinians establish committees to prepare for statehood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - The Palestinians have taken first practical
steps toward a declaration of statehood in May, forming committees
that will try to anticipate and counter Israeli retaliatory steps,
a senior Palestinian official said Thursday.
	   ``We expect that Israel will respond harshly to the declaration
and so we must prepare,'' said Imad Musa, a spokesman for the
Palestine National Council, a 545-seat legislative body with
members living in exile and the Palestinian areas.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 4, 1999,
the day the five-year interim period of autonomy expires.
	   By that time, Israel and the Palestinians are to have negotiated
a permanent peace agreement, but it appears very unlikely they will
meet the deadline.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that
such a declaration would trigger an Israeli reaction. Netanyahu has
not said specifically how he would respond, but it is believed he
would annex parts of the West Bank and seal off autonomous
Palestinian areas from one another for an extended period.
	   The head of the Palestine National Council, Salim Zanoun, has
held meetings with PNC members in the West Bank recently to sign
them up for five committees preparing for statehood, Musa said.
	   Zanoun is to hold similar meetings in the Gaza Strip and Jordan
in the coming days, said Musa. Once the signing up process is
completed, the committees will start meeting.
	   The committees deal, among other things, with political, legal
and economic aspects of statehood.
	   The economic committee will make preparations for an extended
Israeli closure of the Palestinian areas in response to a
declaration of statehood, Musa said. Such a closure would keep tens
of thousands of Palestinian workers from jobs in Israel.
	   ``We need to be ready for an economic battle, a political one
and even a possible military one, every thing is possible,'' Musa
said.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than one-third of Ukraine's housing is
not sufficiently equipped for warmth this winter, officials said
Thursday.
	   Some 89,000 apartment buildings throughout Ukraine, or 34
percent of the country's residences, need repairs before winter
arrives, the State Statistics Committee reported.
	   About 19,700 buildings have broken heating systems and 12,600
buildings have leaking roofs. Many others have outdated plumbing,
the committee said.
	   Winter temperatures in most areas of Ukraine hover around minus
10 Celsius (14 F), sometimes falling below minus 20 Celsius (minus

Spanish government under heightened pressure for gesture to ETA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's government faced mounting pressure
Thursday to respond to a truce by the Basque separatist group ETA
with a conciliatory gesture, as the main opposition party backed
calls to move ETA prisoners closer to home.
	   The leader of the opposition Socialist Party suggested to
reporters that the government was being too cautious at what he
called a crossroads for Spaniards weary of 30 years of separatist
bombings and shootings.
	   ``The government cannot remain immobile,'' said Joaquin Almunia,
the party's secretary general. ``Something must be done.''
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym that stands for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its drive for an
independent Basque homeland in northern Spain. The group declared
its first open-ended truce last week.
	   Still, Almunia sought to portray his party as being in line with
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in believing negotiations with ETA
are impossible as long as it remains armed and committed to
violence.
	   ``Before the cease-fire, the guns were pointed at people. Now
the gunmen are just pointing at the ceiling,'' Almunia said,
mimicking a person holding a rifle.
	   He said he agreed with a suggestion by the president of the
Basque regional government, Jose Antonio Ardanza, that Madrid
should consider transferring ETA prisoners from jails scattered
around the country to ones closer to the Basque region of northern
Spain.
	   A total of 536 accused ETA members are in jail, some as far away
as the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in North Africa or in the Canary
Islands, off the coast of West Africa. One of ETA's long-standing
demands is that the prisoners be transferred to Basque country in
the north.
	   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja on Wednesday rejected the
idea of a transfer.
	   ``I see no need, other than to confuse people, to make gestures
that at this point would not serve any purpose,'' he said.
	   He and other government officials have expressed fears that ETA
might use the cease-fire as a smokescreen to regroup its forces.

Romanian actor who starred in ``The Peacemaker'' opens first
</HEADLINE>
independent theater &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Marcel Iures, who played a Bosnian
terrorist in ``The Peacemakers,'' has opened Romania's first
independent theater, operating without any government funding.
	   The 100-seat theater opened Thursday in downtown Bucharest and
will stage avant-garde and experimental plays, Iures told a press
conference.
	   Iures received financial and moral support from international
stars including Tom Cruise, Judy Dench, Diana Rigg and Tom
Stoppard.
	   During the communist era, theaters as well as all other forms of
expression were under strict censorship. Since the fall of
communism in 1989, audiences have been declining because of a lack
of artistic and management reform.
	   ``In state theater you bash your head against a concrete wall.
We will be hitting our heads against a rubber wall,'' said
Alexandru Dabija, known as a revolutionary director.
	   Plays will run for a short period, unlike in state-run theaters
where they play for years. Sponsorship will come from businesses
and tickets will sell for about 70,000 lei (dlrs 8), more than
twice the state price.
	   The theaters opens with an adaptation of ``Fortress of the
Sun,'' by 17th century Italian playwright Tommasso Campanella.
``It's about a kind primitive communism,'' said director Mihai
Maniutiu, a theme which still sells in Romania.

Kabila promises elections for Congo next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila plans to stage
elections for the presidency next April, state-controlled radio
reported Thursday.
	   ``The election process will start with presidential elections,''
Voice of the People Radio quoted Kabila as saying.
	   Since coming to power last year after ousting longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, Kabila has come under international pressure to
hold national elections.
	   He initially promised elections in 1999, but hedged several
times saying conditions in the Congo may not be conducive to free
and fair voting.
	   Riding a wave of nationalist popularity, Kabila now appears
ready to commit to the polls.
	   ``Elections must be held over a pre-established calendar,''
Kabila said.
	   Although his popularity waned significantly over the past 15
months, many Congolese rallied behind their rebel-turned-president
in his bid to put down a military uprising led by ethnic Tutsis
from the country's east.
	   A rebel army of Tutsi fighters, opposition politicians and
former members of Kabila's army launched a rebellion in the
beginning of August in a bid to topple the government.
	   Kabila, with the help of Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops
has turned the tide of the civil war _ a move that appears to be
paying back in terms of political dividends for Kabila at home.
	   While many people had said Kabila during his year-and-a-half in
power had done little to help the economy or rebuild the country, a
growing number now say they support the president because of his
ability to fend off the rebels.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. authorities have seized a
Philippine Airlines plane in Los Angeles to pay off some of the
national flag-carrier's debt, an airline official said Thursday.
	   The Boeing 747-400 plane was the last PAL plane to leave Manila
before the 57-year-old airline closed at midnight Wednesday. The
plane had been scheduled to return to Manila on Friday.
	   PAL vice president Manolo Aquino said a U.S. court ordered the
garnishing of the aircraft at the Los Angeles international airport
on the demand of the U.S. Eximbank, one of the airline's creditors.
	   ``They wanted to be sure. They have lost their trust in us and
wanted to recover their assets,'' Aquino told The Associated Press.
	   The U.S. Eximbank financed four Boeing planes for PAL and the
airline still has to return the three other aircraft, he said.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, announced it was shutting down due
to disputes with labor unions and huge financial losses partly
caused by Asia's financial crisis.
	   The airline owes about dlrs 2.1 billion to foreign and local
creditors that still could not collect on PAL due to a temporary
prohibition by Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission, which
had tried to rehabilitate carrier.

Norway's prime minister back on job after depression leave

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's prime minister returned to work
Thursday, after more than three weeks on sick leave to recover from
depression and build inner strength to face unprecedented
challenges.
	   ``I've been looking forward to this day,'' Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik told reporters as he returned to work. ``This will
probably be a tough day, but I'm fit to fight.''
	   And fights are what the 51-year-old Lutheran clergyman can
expect in the coming weeks, when his minority coalition needs to
find support in parliament for its proposed 1999 national budget.
	   ``Back to a new political nightmare,'' wrote Norway's largest
newspaper, Verdens Gang. Bondevik is expected to face a tough time
over the budget even within his own governing coalition, which has
just 42 of the 165 seats in parliament.
	   Bondevik took a one-week sick leave on Aug. 30 to recover from
what his office called ``a depressive reaction to overwork.'' The
leave was extended to 3 1/2 weeks.
	   In typical Nordic style, the Norwegian news media, which
generally respect the privacy of public figures, allowed Bondevik
to recover in peace.
	   Opposition politicians refused to use the sick leave against
Bondevik, and the public was largely sympathetic.
	   In a typical gesture, Bondevik's neighbors _ apparently
believing the prime minister needed a few more minutes of quiet _
tried to convince reporters gathered outside his home Thursday that
he had already left work. Bondevik was still at home.
	   The Christian Democratic prime minister's first day at work was
seen as an important test of his ability to take charge, 11 months
after he took power.
	   ``Bondevik needs to convince us that he is strong enough to be
prime minister, and that he can stand the strain,'' an editorial in
Verdens Gang said Thursday.
	   When Bondevik's black BMW rolled up to the government quarter in
Oslo, taxi driver Omed Majed, an Iranian Kurd who has lived in
Norway for 10 years, was waiting. He gave an armful of red roses to
the prime minister.
	   ``He is a good man,'' Majed said afterwards.
	   Early in his term, Bondevik had strong support in opinion polls.
However, his government has been rattled by economic pressures.
Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, has been stung by
low crude prices.
	   When he took over last October, Norway's economy was at the peak
of a boom that analysts said could not last. Last month, the value
of Norway's currency, the krone, was hard hit by speculators and
interest rates soared, signaling market doubts that Bondevik's
coalition had the backbone needed to make tough budget cuts.
	   The moderate coalition of the Christian Democrats, the Center
and the Liberals needs support from other parties in Parliament for
what is likely to be a tight 1999 budget. Already split on where to
make cuts, newspapers said there is a good chance the coalition
could collapse over the budget.

Funeral plans announced; cause of death remains uncertain

<TEXT>
	   SANTA ANA, California (AP) _ Florence Griffith Joyner's fans
will have the opportunity to grieve and say good-bye to the world's
fastest woman sprinter in a public viewing to be held in nearby Los
Angeles on Friday.
	   Griffith Joyner, a star of the 1988 Olympics, died in her sleep
Monday at age 38 of undetermined causes at her home in Mission
Viejo.
	   A public viewing was scheduled for Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
at a funeral home in Los Angeles, USA Track and Field, the sport's
national governing body, announced Wednesday.
	   A public funeral is planned for Saturday morning in the Lake
Tahoe town of Lake Forest on the border between the states of
California and Nevada at Saddleback Valley Community Church, which
can accommodate about 3,200 people.
	   The cause of her death remained under investigation, coroner's
officials said Wednesday.
	   The gold medalist and record holder in the 100- and 200-meter
dashes, felt ``a little tired'' after appearing at a gymnastics
meet and visiting with her mother in Santa Barbara on Sunday, said
former coach Bob Kersee.
	   But there were ``no signs whatsoever that Florence was ill,''
Kersee said Tuesday.
	   Coroner's tests were continuing, and results might take weeks,
said Orange County sheriff's Lt. Hector Rivera.
	   Late Tuesday, hundreds of well-wishers and friends gathered in
Los Angeles' Leimert Park, not far from where Griffith Joyner grew
up, to say prayers, sing songs and remember her contributions to
the community.
	   She won gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter dashes and the
400-meter relay at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and at her death was
still the fastest woman sprinter ever.

U.S. rafter sets off on solo rowing attempt across the Atlantic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASCAIS, Portugal (AP) _ A Utah river-runner set off from this
town near Lisbon Thursday in an attempt to become the first
American _ and oldest person _ to row solo across the North
Atlantic.
	   Richard Jones, a 55-year-old river-rafter, aims to row 3,612
nautical miles (6,690 kilometers) on his own all the way to Miami,
Florida, in six to eight months. No American has completed such an
ocean-crossing quest.
	   Jones' attempt officially started Wednesday in Lisbon, with a
20-mile (30-kilometer) leg along the coast to Cascais. Just before
8 a.m. (0700 gmt) Thursday, he started rowing away from land
towards the ocean.
	   ``He is an experienced river-rafter, but has never been to sea
before,'' said Kenneth Cultrow, a spokesman for the Ocean Rowing
Society monitoring Jones' attempt.
	   Success, Cultrow said, depends mostly on weather conditions,
namely the wind and the currents.
	   ``The weather was incredibly smooth; absolutely no wind. It was
a good omen,'' Cultrow said after seeing Jones off on his solo
mission.
	   Earlier this month, hurricane-force winds foiled Kentucky woman
Tori Murden's attempt to become the first American and first woman
to row solo across the Atlantic.
	   But solo does not mean isolated. A lap-top computer aboard ``The
Brother of Jared'' will keep Jones tuned in to navigational
information and home, in Salt Lake City, via satellite.
	   The yellow, torpedo-shaped vessel is packed with
state-of-the-art gadgets _ from filtration equipment to make sea
water drinkable to electronic navigational and communications gear.
	   Rowing 12 to 15 hours a day, Jones expects to lose up to 20
pounds (9 kilos) from his 6-foot-3 (1-meter-90), 200-pound
(90-kilo) frame on a 7,000 calorie-per-day diet.
	   Norway's George Harbo and Frank Samuelsen were the first to row
across the ocean, in a 60-day crossing from New York to France in
1896. In 1969, Briton John Fairfax accomplished it on his own.

Angola's ruling party readmits former rebels under U.N. pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Under pressure from the United Nations,
Angola's governing party on Thursday readmitted some officials from
the former rebel group UNITA into the government.
	   However, only those nine UNITA members who have split from
former rebel leader Jonas Savimbi were allowed back. Another two
whose positions were unclear were not called back.
	   The UNITA leadership said in a statement from its central
highland stronghold in Bailundo, 290 kilometers (180 miles) south
of the capital Luanda, that the announcement was meaningless
because the leadership had not been consulted.
	   Angola's UNITA Cabinet members were expelled earlier this month
in a serious blow to a four-year peace process. The government also
severed relations with Savimbi, whom it and the United Nations
blame for delaying the implementation of the 1994 peace accord that
ended a two-decade civil war.
	   The U.N. Security Council urged Angola's government to reverse
its decision last week to sever dialogue with Savimbi, reportedly
angering President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   The Government of National Unity and Reconciliation was formed
in April 1997, but UNITA has complained that its members weren't
being consulted in executive decisions.
	   The U.N.-monitored peace process has been on hold since May
because of tension between the former foes.

Former heavyweight champ begings testing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Mike Tyson, suspended from boxing for biting an
opponent's ear, will let a team of Massachusetts General Hospital
doctors determine whether he is psychologically fit to return to
the ring.
	   The former heavyweight champion was in Boston on Wednesday to
begin the psychological and neurological tests ordered by the
western state of Nevada's Athletic Commission, which gave him a
list of three facilities to administer the tests, and a deadline of
next Monday for doctors to submit reports on his mental state.
	   Besides MGH, the other facilities were the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester Minnesota, and C.F. Menninger Memorial Hospital in
Topeka, Kansas.
	   The examination was ordered by the commission following a
six-hour hearing last Saturday on Tyson's request for reinstatement
of his boxing license in the state. He has been banned, a sanction
enforced virtually throughout the United States, since the
commission revoked his license July 9, 1997 for biting Evander
Holyfield's ears during their title bout.
	   ``We're putting together a complete evaluation, like any
evaluation involving the ability of people to return to work,'' Dr.
Ronald Schouten, who heads MGH's law and psychiatry program and is
overseeing Tyson's comprehensive work-up, told The Boston Globe.
	   ``It's a very sensitive matter, so we're being very careful
about confidentiality,'' said Schouten.
	   Schouten would not discuss details of the exams, or say when the
results might be completed.
	   Mark Ratner, spokesman for the Nevada commission, told the
Boston Herald the battery of tests was expected to last three days.
	   A letter sent to Tyson and his advisers on Monday from the
Nevada commission said the team of doctors evaluating him must
include a psychologist, a psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist.
Also, the boxer must be given comprehensive neuropsychological
testing as well as an MRI of the brain and a complete drug screen.
	   In addition, the commission wants the doctors who evaluate Tyson
to look at videotape of his fight against Holyfield, as well as
from post-fight interviews and license reinstatement hearings in
the American states of New Jersey and Nevada.
	   ``What we expect from the team that will be evaluating him is a
team approach to Mike, his cognitive abilities and his
psychological abilities, and his ability to go back into the
ring,'' Dr. Edwin ``Flip'' Homansky, chairman of the medical
advisory board to the Nevada commission, told the Globe.
	   If Tyson is cleared by the doctors, the Nevada commission is
expected to give the former heavyweight champion a new boxing
license on Oct. 3.
	   After his 1995 release from prison in the state of Indiana,
where he served a rape sentence, Tyson's first opponent was Peter
McNeeley of Medfield, Massachusetts. That bout ended after 89
seconds when McNeeley's corner stopped the bout.

Matthew Dunn sets short-course record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Commonwealth Games gold medalist Matthew
Dunn broke his second world record in two weeks at the Australian
short course swimming championships Thursday.
	   The 25-year-old shaved more than a second off the old mark for
the 400-meter individual medley by winning in a time of 4 minutes,
4.24 seconds in the 25-meter pool.
	   The previous record of 4:05.41 was held by Martel Wouda of the
Netherlands.
	   Dunn was also a member of the world record-breaking 4x200
freestyle relay team in Kuala Lumpur last week.
	   Dunn paid tribute to his coach Gennadi Touretski following the
swim.
	   ``Over the last few years I've been finding it easier and easier
to back up,'' he said. ``I suppose it's got a lot to do with
Gennadi Touretski's mentality of becoming more professional.
	   ``I've been preparing myself for it over the last week or so, it
was something I really wanted to target.''
	   Earlier in the night, 15-year-old Ian Thorpe broke a
Commonwealth record in the men's 200-meter freestyle.
	   Thorpe beat Michael Klim in 1:44.37 to lower the record by 0.84
of a second. Klim finished strongly and also broke his own record
with a time of 1:44.61. (djp)

Russian inflation up 67 percent since August; expected to worsen

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian inflation has skyrocketed 67 percent since
last month, and the Central Bank said Thursday the worst was still
ahead _ price hikes could approach 300 percent by year's end.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pledged strong steps to
stabilize the crumbling economy, and for the first time since
assuming office almost two weeks ago, he offered the outlines of a
plan for combating the crisis.
	   Primakov said he'll pay wage arrears to workers and soldiers,
offer compensation to offset the painful effects of inflation, and
impose greater state control on the alcohol industry, a leading
source of government tax revenue.
	   But the government is broke and will almost certainly have to
print more money to pay its debts, a move that's virtually certain
to push inflation even higher.
	   Primakov blamed his predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, for igniting
the crisis last month. Primakov claimed that Kiriyenko's Aug. 17
announcement on devaluing the ruble and restructuring government
debt was made without the consent of President Boris Yeltsin and
that the results had been ``chaotic.'' At the time, however,
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Kiriyenko had
consulted with the president.
	   ``It is essential to do everything to prevent the Aug. 17
statement ... from leading to dangerous socio-economic
consequences,'' said Primakov, speaking at the start of a Cabinet
meeting.
	   Yeltsin has remained largely in the background since the crisis
erupted. The president has never shown an appetite for handling
day-to-day policy matters, and as with past government failures, he
has responded by blaming subordinates and sacking them.
	   Meanwhile, Thursday's inflation figures confirmed what Russians
already knew _ prices have been going up by the day.
	   Inflation is up 67 percent since the crisis began five weeks
ago, the State Statistics Committee said. The Central Bank forecast
that the rate could reach 240 percent to 290 percent by year's end,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Also, Russia's economy is expected to contract about 5 to 6
percent this year, the Central Bank said. The Russian economy has
been in a severe depression for most of this decade and has also
been hit by several bouts of hyperinflation.
	   A top government official warned Thursday that Russia could
default on its international debt if the International Monetary
Fund does not continue to extend financial help to Russia in the
coming months.
	   ``I don't want to scare people with the possibility of default
on foreign debt,'' said First Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin. ``But
we do need to count on the loyal attitude of our partners in the
international financial organizations ... in not canceling earlier
agreed-upon aid packages.''
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package in July and
has issued the first installment. But it is expected to delay
additional money _ perhaps for several months _ until it's
satisfied that Russia has sound financial policies.
	   ``Such an approach would drive Russia into a corner,'' Shokhin
said.
	   As the crisis deepens, friction is increasing between Russia and
international financial institutions that have been lending money.
	   Foreign banks, which bought billions of dollars of Russian
government bonds, have complained that the Russian government is
discriminating against them as it attempts to rescue Russian banks.
	   The head of Russia's Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, said
Russia wanted to work out a settlement with the banks, but warned:
``Those who are stubborn in their greediness may end up getting
nothing.''
	   Before the crisis hit, Russian inflation was running at less
than 1 percent a month and was expected to be under 10 percent for
the entire year, which would have been the best performance since
the market reforms began.
	   But when the ruble began to tumble last month, prices
immediately soared.
	   The ruble went from about six to the dollar last month to as low
as 20 to the dollar this month. It has strengthened a bit and was
trading Thursday at around 15.
	   The weaker currency means that Russia's many imports are now two
or three times more expensive than before, and that has driven up
inflation.

Former heavyweight champ begings testing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS lead; ADDS 5th graf wth Tyson handlers having said
bout outside U.S. possible if request denied. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Mike Tyson is being tested by a team of
Massachusetts General Hospital doctors to determine whether he is
psychologically fit to return to the ring.
	   The former heavyweight champion was in Boston on Wednesday to
begin the psychological and neurological tests ordered by the
western state of Nevada's Athletic Commission, which gave him a
list of three facilities to administer the tests, and a deadline of
next Monday for doctors to submit reports on his mental state.
	   Besides MGH, the other facilities were the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester Minnesota, and C.F. Menninger Memorial Hospital in
Topeka, Kansas.
	   The examination was ordered by the commission following a
six-hour hearing last Saturday on Tyson's request for reinstatement
of his boxing license in the state. He has been banned, a sanction
enforced virtually throughout the United States, since the
commission revoked his license July 9, 1997 for biting Evander
Holyfield's ears during their title bout.
	   Tyson's handlers have said they may look to get a bout for Tyson
outside the United States if the Nevada commission rejects his
request for reinstatement.
	   ``We're putting together a complete evaluation, like any
evaluation involving the ability of people to return to work,'' Dr.
Ronald Schouten, who heads MGH's law and psychiatry program and is
overseeing Tyson's comprehensive work-up, told The Boston Globe.
	   ``It's a very sensitive matter, so we're being very careful
about confidentiality,'' said Schouten.
	   Schouten would not discuss details of the exams, or say when the
results might be completed.
	   Mark Ratner, spokesman for the Nevada commission, told the
Boston Herald the battery of tests was expected to last three days.
	   A letter sent to Tyson and his advisers on Monday from the
Nevada commission said the team of doctors evaluating him must
include a psychologist, a psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist.
Also, the boxer must be given comprehensive neuropsychological
testing as well as an MRI of the brain and a complete drug screen.
	   In addition, the commission wants the doctors who evaluate Tyson
to look at videotape of his fight against Holyfield, as well as
from post-fight interviews and license reinstatement hearings in
the American states of New Jersey and Nevada.
	   ``What we expect from the team that will be evaluating him is a
team approach to Mike, his cognitive abilities and his
psychological abilities, and his ability to go back into the
ring,'' Dr. Edwin ``Flip'' Homansky, chairman of the medical
advisory board to the Nevada commission, told the Globe.
	   If Tyson is cleared by the doctors, the Nevada commission is
expected to give the former heavyweight champion a new boxing
license on Oct. 3.
	   After his 1995 release from prison in the state of Indiana,
where he served a rape sentence, Tyson's first opponent was Peter
McNeeley of Medfield, Massachusetts. That bout ended after 89
seconds when McNeeley's corner stopped the bout.

 &UR; U.S. central bank chairman creates heyday in Asia, but joy fades in
London &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with afternoon trading in London &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Expectations of lower U.S. interest rates drove
shares higher in Asia Thursday, following sharp gains on Wall
Street a day earlier, but the momentum dried up in London and
Frankfurt where domestic worries flattened optimism.
	   U.S. and Asian shares rose after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said there were increasing indications fallout from
deteriorating foreign economies will be more than enough to keep
U.S. inflation in check without interest rate hikes.
	   At 1125 GMT, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 23.5 points, or half a percentage point, at 5238.2 _ after
being as much as 107 points higher earlier in the session.
	   Traders said the market sagged after a Confederation of British
Industry survey said export orders for U.K. manufacturers fell to
15-year lows.
	   ``We started off quite nicely this morning in reaction to
Greenspan's comments, but there has been very little follow-through
and volume has really dried up,'' said Peter Caulkett, a salesman
at Teather and Greenwood in London.
	   ``The good news at this stage is that the Fed will cut rates at
some stage, while the bad news is that things are certainly going
to get worse,'' Caulkett added.
	   Frankfurt's key index was down 1.0 percent at midday. ``People
are nervous going into the election this weekend,'' said Harry
Gegenwart of Frankfurt-based Dresdner Bank, referring to Germany's
national election on Sunday.
	   In Paris, however, shares rose 2.1 percent in morning trading.
	   Share values surged earlier in the day in Asia _ 4.4 percent in
Hong Kong, 3.4 percent in Singapore and 3.02 in Tokyo.
	   Fourteen months after Asia's financial crisis began, two of the
area's hardest-hit markets were doing even better. Thailand's main
stock index was 9.2 percent higher by midday, and South Korea's
closed with a 6.4 percent improvement.
	   Asian analysts attributed the good day to Greenspan.
	   In Washington on Wednesday, Greenspan told a U.S. Senate panel
that Fed officials know they have to act quickly to contain the
global crisis. And many traders read that as a clear indication of
an interest rate cut at next week's Fed meeting.
	   Greenspan said, ``I think we know where we have to go'' in
dealing with the crisis, which has since spread from Asia to
Russia, and is now threatening Latin America as well.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.3 percent
to 8,154.41, its highest finish in a month.
	   The big gain lifted the Dow more than 200 points above this
year's starting point. But that still left the blue-chip barometer
nearly 1,200 points below its July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   In Japan, where the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
reached its lowest level in 12 years on Monday, it surged 415.97
points to close at 14,205.78 Thursday.
	   ``There was nothing in the market today to oppose such bullish
incentives,'' said Masaaki Higashida, a manager of the investment
information and services department at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
	   But he warned that the rebound could be temporary as the city's
stock market lacks energy for a full-scale recovery without an
improvement in economic fundamentals.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 330.22 points to
close at 7,834.61. And Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index
jumped 30.99 points to close at 931.98.
	   Despite the rallies in these and other Asian countries, Abhilit
Chakrabortti, a regional analyst for HSBC Securities Asia Ltd. in
Hong Kong, said the outlook in Asia remains pessimistic.
	   ``We've seen tens of thousands of these rebounds this year,'' he
said in an interview.

Hundreds gather for funeral of Kosovo ``defense minister'' in

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with burial, ADDS details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Hundreds of people gathered Thursday to
honor the ``defense minister'' of the Kosovo government-in-exile,
who was shot dead in the Albanian capital earlier this week.
	   Ahmed Krasniqi, 50, was found dead late Monday on a narrow
residential street in the Albanian capital with three empty
cartridges nearby. No arrests have been made and the motive was
unclear.
	   Addressing the roughly 1,000 Kosovo Albanians at a memorial
ceremony in the National Museum in downtown Tirana Thursday, the
exiled government's ``minister of education'' Muhamed Bicaj praised
Krasniqi as ``a brilliant figure'' of the ethnic Albanians fighting
for independence from Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   ``His ideals were a free Kosovo and independent Kosovo,'' Bicaj
said.
	   He called on the Albanian government to investigate the killing.
	   Follwing the ceremony, seven Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers
accompanied the coffin, draped in two red-and-black Albanian flags,
to Sharre Cemetary outside of Tirana, where Krasniqi was buried.
	   Krasniqi was responsible for organizing paramilitary forces
which would parallel the Kosovo Liberation Army. For security
reasons, his identity was kept secret until his death.
	   The exiled government is headed by a self-styled premier, Bujar
Bukoshi, and operates in Switzerland and other Western European
countries.

Habibie orders military to take stern action against looting,
</HEADLINE>
violence

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president moved Thursday
to clamp down on mounting anti-government protests by ordering the
military to take strong action against looters and rioters.
	   ``Lootings and violence for whatever reason are actions of
criminality,'' President B.J. Habibie told a group of high-ranking
military officers led by commander Gen. Wiranto.
	   Habibie, who took over in May after riots and protests ousted
President Suharto, said some people have taken advantage of
protests and other mass gatherings to provoke rampages.
	   Unrest has increased in recent weeks as the country's economic
crisis has deepened. Hundreds of houses and shops have been burned,
many belonging to the ethnic Chinese minority resented for their
business success and comparative wealth.
	   ``We also acknowledged that a number of riots that have been
taken place have led to uncontrollable situations and disturbed the
mobility of the people as well as hampered reform efforts,''
Habibie said.
	   ``I instructed all the lines within the armed forces to take
measures and stern actions against any action by people or group of
people that destabilize the country and provoke people to commit
crime,'' he said.
	   Earlier in the day, Habibie lashed out at the foreign media for
allegedly carrying negative reports about rioting and protests that
led to a ``widespread belief in the international community that
Indonesia was not safe.''
	   Meanwhile, Armed Force Commander Gen. Wiranto, who led the
military group in the meeting, called on people to restrain from
destructive action and propaganda that lead to disintegration of
the national unity and integrity.
	   ``The armed forces will do it best to maintain the national
unity and stability,'' Wiranto said after a dialogue with the
president.
	   Meanwhile, a release issued by the military, warned that a group
of students have planned to hold national and regional ``People's
Committee'' movements next Wednesday.
	   ``There are matters of concerns that have to be alerted include
a planned action ... to stage national and regional People's
Committee movement on September 30,'' the statement said.
	   The warning coincided with the 33rd anniversary of an abortive
coup against then-President Sukarno in Sept. 30, 1965, that was
blamed on the outlawed Indonesian Communist Party. The coup
triggered the rise to prominence of Suharto, to took control of the
country the following year.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS thruout to RECAST lede, UPDATE with quote from Netanyahu
in new graf 8, TRIMS outdated information, ADDS Nigeria, Greece and
Turkey to speek later in the day &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned about Yasser Arafat's plans to
use his General Assembly speech to press his case for Palestinian
statehood, world leaders have urged Israel and the Palestinians to
continue a course of peace.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the General
Assembly later Thursday. Palestinian officials have said Arafat
plans to tell the body next week of his determination to declare a
Palestinian state by May, with or without Israel's approval.
	   Netanyahu told a news conference Wednesday that interim Oslo
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians specifically rule
out such unilateral declarations, reserving statehood as an issue
to be settled between the two sides.
	   ``I very much recommend to Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority that they do not take that course,'' Netanyahu said. ``It
will certainly bring parallel Israeli steps.''
	   The Palestinians are forming committees that will try to
anticipate and counter Israeli retaliatory steps, Imad Musa, a
spokesman for the Palestine National Council, said Thursday.
	   ``We need to be ready for an economic battle, a political one
and even a possible military one, every thing is possible,'' said
the spokesman for 545-seat legislative body with members living in
exile and the Palestinian areas.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's spokesman James P.
Rubin said that a unilateral declaration by the Palestinians
``would be a unilateral action we would oppose.''
	   Netanyahu met Wednesday with Albright on plans for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from the West Bank, but they reached no
breakthrough.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told the General
Assembly's annual debate Wednesday that France supports Albright's
efforts to move the peace process forward.
	   ``But we do not wish to be left without any prospect should
those efforts unfortunately not succeed,'' he said.
	   That is why French President Jacques Chirac and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak have proposed that if the U.S. efforts
fail, ``a conference of the countries resolved to save peace''
should be convened, he said.
	   In another eagerly anticipated speech during Thursday's session,
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was to address the
General Assembly, following a breakthrough speech by Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
	   Sharif said Pakistan would unilaterally adhere to the nuclear
test ban treaty, but warned that compliance would depend on whether
its rival, India, resumed its tests and on the world lifting
sanctions imposed after the tests.
	   Later in the day, Nigeran President Abdulsalami Abubakar was to
address world leaders. Turkey's prime minister and the foreign
minister of Greece were also on the speaker's list, and the thorny
issue of Cyprus was sure to be discussed.

Kohl firmly rejects possibility of Grand Coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl vehemently rejected on
Thursday the notion of his party sharing power with the opposition
Social Democrats in a ``grand coalition'' after Sunday's national
election.
	   With the two parties running neck-and-neck in the polls, Kohl
had said Wednesday that a grand coalition was ``possible in
principle,'' a comment that had suggested the chancellor might be
softening his stance.
	   Analysts for weeks have predicted a grand coalition as the
natural outcome of the vote, with public opinion almost equally
divided between the two parties. Kohl's Christian Democrats have
closed in on the Social Democrats to within 2 percentage points,
according a Campo-Data survey published Thursday that reviewed
recent polling.
	   The survey gave 40.5 percent of the vote to Schroeder's party,
compared to 38.6 percent for the chancellor's.
	   Schroeder's diminishing lead _ he led by up to 12 percentage
points last spring _ comes at a time of increasing international
turmoil, with economic crises in Asia and Russia and political
crisis in the United States.
	   Kohl, who after 16 years in power is seeking an unprecedented
fifth term, has stressed his status as a respected statesman
compared to the relative inexperience of Schroeder, the governor of
Lower Saxony state.
	   While Schroeder has supported a grand coalition all along, he
now hints his party could accept being the junior member of a
coalition led by Kohl's party.
	   ``The statement that all democratic parties must remain open to
any kind of coalition certainly is valid without any
preconditions,'' Schroeder told national ZDF television on Tuesday.

BayStars beat Dragons 7-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Robert Rose singled home the first run in the first
inning, launching the Central League's front-running Yokohama
BayStars' 7-1 rout over the Chunichi Dragons at Yokohama on
Thursday.
	   The BayStars added four runs in the sixth inning on a walk and
five consecutive hits, led by Motonobu Tanishige's double. They
finished off the victory with two runs in the seventh inning.
	   The victory widened the BayStars' lead over the second-place
Dragons to six games.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Yasuaki Taiho, or Cheng Tai-feng, from
Taiwan hit a two-run home run and Dave Hansen smashed another
two-run roundtripper as the Hanshin Tigers blanked the Yakult
Swallows 10-0.
	   Taiho's 20th homer of the season came in the three-run first
inning and former Chicago Cubs Hansen's 11th homer of the season in
the five-run third inning.
	   A scheduled game between the Yomiuri Giants and the Hiroshima
Toyo Carp at Hiroshima was rained out.
	   In the Pacific League, Domingo Martinez singled home the
tie-breaking run in the eight-run fourth inning as the Seibu Lions
beat the Orix BlueWave 10-3 and moved into first place.
	   Martinez was formerly with the Triple-A Rochester.
	   The Lions now are .002 percentage points ahead of the Nippon Ham
Fighters, who were idle Thursday and fell to second place.
	   No other games were scheduled Thursday.

Key economic priorities of Russia's new Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A list of priority goals for Russia's new Cabinet, outlined by
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials on Thursday:
	   _ Paying off existing wage and pension arrears, and making
timely payments starting Oct. 1. The government did not, however,
set a target date to pay off its huge debt.
	   _ Compensating the poor, starting Jan. 1, for the sharp drop in
their real income caused by inflation. The government did not say
where it would get the resources for compensation.
	   _ Requiring exporters to sell half of their hard-currency
earnings on the open market and one-quarter to the state, in order
to boost the hard-currency supply and prevent the ruble's further
fall.
	   _ Boosting tax revenues by enforcing stronger tax discipline and
lowering tax rates. The current rates have been criticized as
unrealistic.
	   _ Strengthening state control over the alcohol and tobacco
markets to eradicate illegal alcohol production and increase
government tax revenues.
	   _ Negotiating terms for paying off the government's bonds with
Russian and foreign companies and banks. The government has pledged
to set equal conditions for local and foreign creditors.
	   _ Conducting talks with the International Monetary Fund and
other lenders in order to persuade them to release the dlrs 22.6
billion aid package, which was agreed before the crisis. The IMF
has already issued the first installment, but put the remainder on
hold pending the new government's announcement of an economic
program.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army and Serb police forces
struck deeper into the last pockets of separatist Kosovo Albanian
resistance Thursday, ignoring U.N. and NATO moves that edged open
the door for a military strike against them.
	   Artillery boomed across the central Drenica region of the
Serbian province, and Serb police sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they split the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army
forces by taking over a main road that passes through the last
stronghold of Kosovo Albanian resistance.
	   Pristina's Serb-controlled Media Center said police had ``closed
the ring around strong groups of Albanian extremists,'' destroying
their bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   The offensive eased later in the day, but it was impossible to
determine whether that had occurred in response to new signs of
U.N. and NATO determination to stop the bloodshed.
	   A U.N. Security Council warning Wednesday threatened further
action unless the fighting stopped. While not specifically
mandating NATO action, the resolution opened the way for
international approval of involvement by the military alliance.
	   NATO ambassadors meeting in Portugal approved increased planning
Thursday for air strikes in Kosovo. NATO will begin asking military
commanders to identify participating countries and the kind of
weapons they will put at NATO's disposal.
	   Secretary-General Javier Solana said the decision takes NATO
``to an increased level of military preparedness'' without actually
approving the use of force.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   The risk to refugees facing the harsh Balkan winter is driving
Western efforts to get a commitment from Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end the government offensive and permit mass
refugee returns.
	   But an aide to the chief Albanian political leader in Kosovo,
Ibrahim Rugova, said U.N. and NATO moves may have already come too
late.
	   ``The resolution is a good step, but it came too late because
half of Kosovo is already destroyed and burned,'' the aide, Enver
Maljoku, said. ``I don't think Milosevic will take this message
from the U.N. seriously, and I'm afraid that he'll have enough time
to destroy the other half of Kosovo too.''
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.''
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   Ethnic Albanians _ 90 percent of Kosovo's population _ are
overwhelmingly in favor of independence. World powers back autonomy
for Kosovo instead, arguing that independence can be achieved only
through prolonged, and spreading, bloodshed.
	   Most victims of the military campaign have been ethnic Albanian
civilians. More than 275,000 people have been driven from hundreds
of destroyed villages.
	   Refugee numbers were swollen by the latest fighting, with up to
20,000 civilians fleeing their homes in the Drenica area, west and
southwest of Pristina.
	   Many refugees increasingly agree that Western actions should
focus on helping feed them or keeping them safe from police. Air
strikes to stop the Serb offensive might come too late for refugees
who need help now, they say.
	   ``I love NATO,'' says Xhavit Rudi, a 30-year-old farmer who lost
his house, cows and tractor to the scorched-earth campaign by Serb
security forces. ``But make them know that people are dying. It's
very late.''
	   Many Serb police fighting in Kosovo shrug off the possibility of
NATO intervention. Since late July, Serb forces started using heavy
artillery, Katyusha rockets and Russian-made tanks in an offensive
that devastated western Kosovo.
	   ``You're going to bomb us?'' taunts a wiry Serb police officer
guarding a main highway. His colleagues, wielding Kalashnikov
assault rifles, gather around and laugh.
	   He moved his left hand to represent a NATO fighter jet. He
pretended his right hand was an anti-aircraft missile that swooped
into its target.
	   The direct hit elicits a chuckle.
	   ``What do you think?'' the policeman said. ``Will NATO come?''

French prime minister in Beijing, contracts signed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS And UPDATES throughout with diplomatic agreements,
comments from Jospin; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin discussed
Asia's financial crisis with China's premier Thursday and presided
over the clinching of business deals pitched as evidence of Paris
and Beijing's ``global partnership.''
	   On the first of his three days in China, Jospin and Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji reviewed an honor guard on Beijing's vast
Tiananmen Square before going inside the Great Hall of the People
to discuss the Asian turmoil, economic ties and human rights.
	   Chinese police detained two dissidents Thursday morning in
central China, part of a widening sweep against democracy and human
rights campaigners pressing for political change.
	   Jospin told reporters that his discussions on human rights were
positive. He noted that China has made progress, signing one key
U.N. rights treaty and pledging to sign the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights next month.
	   Strained by French weapons sales to China's rival Taiwan in the
early 1990s, relations between Beijing and Paris have improved
steadily in the past three years, helped in part by an emphasis on
business ties. Capping the recovery, the French and Chinese
presidents pledged last year to form a ``global partnership.''
	   In what both sides billed as proof of that alliance, French and
Chinese officials signed agreements on developing information
technology, protecting copyrights, patents and trademarks and
increasing financial cooperation.
	   The financial agreement called for a more active role by the
International Monetary Fund and increased coordination by
governments to stabilize Asia's troubled economies.
	   Along the sidelines of Jospin's meetings, business executives
and government officials signed 14 agreements, worth 2.8 billion
yuan (dlrs 339 million or 1.9 billion francs). In the largest deal,
France's Lafarge agreed to build a dlrs 150 million cement plant in
Dujiangyan, a gritty, hard-luck town in Sichuan province.
	   On Friday, Jospin was to travel to Hefei, capital of eastern
Anhui province, where he is to meet President Jiang Zemin. Jiang
has been inspecting rebuilding efforts from catastrophic summer
flooding.
	   But the unusual location for an international get-together
prompted speculation that China was slighting Jospin for France's
sale of Mirage jets to Taiwan in 1992. Jospin was secretary-general
of the French Socialist Party, which was in power at the time.
	   Chinese officials have denied a snub was intended, and Jospin
said that Taiwan was not mentioned in any of his meetings Thursday.
	   After Hefei, Jospin will travel to Shanghai, China's financial
and commercial center, and then to Hong Kong.

Taliban clerics warn Iran against attacking Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED RIAZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Thousands of clerics of Afghanistan's
ruling Taliban religious army issued an edict, or fatwa, on
Thursday making it an Islamic obligation to go to war with Iran if
it attacks its neighbor.
	   The clerics, ordered to the Afghan capital by the Taliban's
reclusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, ended a three-day
convention by issuing six fatwas _ all warning Iran that a war with
Afghanistan would not stop at the border.
	   Such a war, they said, would engulf the entire region. The
clerics are high authorities in Taliban's Islamic militia, which
rules nearly all of Afghanistan.
	   Iran has deployed more than 200,000 soldiers in recent weeks on
its border with Afghanistan and is demanding the Taliban return an
estimated 40 Iranians it is holding in Kandahar, apologize for the
killings of Iranian diplomats last month and turn over the
culprits.
	   The clerics' gathering was held in the Taliban's Interior
Ministry, surrounded by tanks, armored personnel carriers and
scores of Taliban soldiers with automatic rifles. Several streets
leading to the ministry building were blocked to traffic.
	   While the clerics warned Iran against attacking Afghanistan,
they took a conciliatory approach toward the United Nations.
	   But the clerics rejected calls for a cease-fire, saying
previously the Taliban's opponents have used cease-fires to
reinforce their positions.
	   Afghanistan's six neighbors, the United States and Russia asked
for such a cease-fire and made other requests during a Tuesday
meeting at the United Nations.
	   The clerics did agree to a U.N.-led delegation to investigate
reports of mass killings by Taliban soldiers during their takeover
of the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
	   It was then that eight diplomats and an Iranian journalist were
killed and relations between the two countries nose-dived.
	   The Taliban maintains the diplomats were killed by renegade
soldiers and that the diplomats were ``conspirators'' aiding the
anti-Taliban alliance.
	   The clerics gave the Taliban's guarantee that humanitarian aid
groups, who left Afghanistan last month citing security reasons,
would be protected.
	   The clerics also agreed to a broader-based government, saying
that while the country's minority ethnic and religious groups
already were included they would accept additional represenation.
	   In another resolution, the clerics condemned drug production,
saying it was against Islam and that the Taliban should work to
eradicate it.
	   They denounced terrorism, but criticized the United States for
its missile attack in August against camps allegedly run by Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden.
	   The U.S. administration is demanding that bin Laden be delivered
to Washington to stand trial on charges he masterminded the deadly
attacks against U.S. embassies in East Africa last month.
	   The Taliban has refused, saying that bin Laden is a guest.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A soldier fled his unit Thursday and then killed
himself after he was tracked down by his colleagues, the latest in
a series of violent incidents in Russia's demoralized military.
	   The shootings have come as Russia begins its regular fall
military call-up _ an order that thousands of young draftees
routinely ignore. The Soldiers' Mothers Committee, a leading
anti-draft group, sent an open letter to President Boris Yeltsin
this week urging him to cancel the draft.
	   ``Everyone clearly understands that there are no material
resources to provide conscripts with food, clothing and shoes,''
the letter read.
	   Russian media reports have said that money shortages have forced
some units to cut rations to two meals a day, and some officers
even asked soldiers' parents to help with money or food.
	   In the latest incident, Alexander Konovalov, who served with a
Border Guards on the eastern peninsula of Kamchatka Peninsula, fled
his post early Thursday with his assault rifle.
	   Konovalov was quickly tracked down on the outskirts of the city
of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. He killed himself when his colleagues
tried to arrest him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Officials found a letter from home on Konovalov's body that told
of a grave ailment of a close relative. Officials had rejected
Konovalov's plea to go on leave, the report said.
	   Meanwhile, another Russian servicemen remained on the loose for
a fourth day Thursday after shooting dead two comrades and wounding
a third in the Ural Mountains city of Ozyorsk, home to Russia's
main nuclear weapons arsenal. A huge manhunt continued.
	   In a third shooting this week, a sailor on guard duty shot dead
his commanding officer and wounded another sailor before being
taken into custody along the Caspian Sea coast in southern Russia.
	   Abysmal living conditions, ritual hazings and weak morale have
all contributed to frequent shootings and suicides in the
cash-strapped Russian military.
	   As a result, only about 20 percent of the young men drafted into
the military actually show up. The military openly complains that
most of those who do turn up are ill-qualified to serve.
	   Desperate to meet its quotas, the army often accepts youths with
physical problems, criminal records or drug habits.
	   According to official figures, 50 soldiers were killed by their
fellow servicemen last year, and about 500 committed suicide.
	   When running for re-election in 1996, President Boris Yeltsin
pledged to end the draft by the year 2000 and turn the Russian
military into an all-volunteer force. But military leaders have
since said it would be impossible to meet the target date.

Parma can't score, can't win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ AC Parma has become painfully familiar with a simple
tenet of soccer: You can't win if you don't score.
	   The small-city club, for years a steady challenger at the top of
the Italian League, is in trouble. Parma is still searching for its
first goal of the Serie A season and Saturday night hosts two-time
defending champion Juventus of Turin (2-0-0).
	   A loss would leave Parma (0-2-0) seven points off the pace, a
large gap even if this is only Week 3 and there are 31 games left.
	   Earlier Saturday, AC Milan hosts Fiorentina in a game that pits
the only clubs other than Juventus to have opened the year with
back-to-back victories. Other games moved up one day to provide
extra rest for teams with UEFA Cup outings Tuesday are Bari vs.
Bologna, AS Roma vs. Venezia, and Udinese vs. Salernitana.
	   Sunday's games are Cagliari vs. Sampdoria of Genoa, Empoli vs.
Internazionale of Milan, Perugia vs. Lazio of Rome, and Piacenza
vs. Vicenza.
	   ``I am a humble worker, I have only just arrived at Parma and
there are already people who are at war with me,'' Alberto
Malesani, Parma's first-year coach, said in a locker room tirade
after an Italian Cup game Wednesday. ``It is unfathomable. What do
they want from me? Parma has never won the title in its history.
But they want everything right away.''
	   If he weren't blessed with one of the league's best defenses,
Malesani might have been fired right away. Baby-faced 'keeper
Gianluigi Buffon has registered shutouts against unheralded Vicenza
and promoted Venezia, so Parma still has two standings points
thanks to its 0-0 draws.
	   The offense has been miserable. Malesani has tried various
combinations with Enrico Chiesa, Colombia's Faustino Asprilla and
Argentines Abel Balbo and Hernan Crespo, but nothing has worked.
	   There has been little support from midfield, where big-money
transfers Diego Fuser, Argentina's Juan Veron and France's Alain
Boghossian have been disappointing. Making matters worse, Croat
midfielder Mario Stanic _ who has often provided a spark on the
left wing _ will miss the Juventus match with a sprained left
ankle.
	   The one thing in Parma's favor Saturday is that Juventus has had
problems with its backline. With star central defender Ciro Ferrara
still recuperating from last season's leg break, Uruguayan Paolo
Montero playing with a nagging back injury and Mark Iuliano out
with a hurt leg muscle, coach Marcello Lippi has been searching for
the right pieces to the defensive puzzle.
	   But Lippi does have an attack that can score in bunches (five
goals in its two wins so far), led by France's World Cup hero
Zinedine Zidane and forward tandem Filippo Inzaghi and Alessandro
Del Piero. The latter has yet to tally this season, though,
extending a slump that began in May.
	   Fiorentina and Milan are undefeated because their scorers are
scoring. German forward Oliver Bierhoff leads Milan _ and the
league _ with three goals so far, while Fiorentina's Argentine
striker Gabriel Batistuta has two goals and an assist.
	   Under new coach Giovanni Trapattoni, Fiorentina has won all five
games it has played, including UEFA and Italian Cup action. With
offseason pickups Jorg Heinrich of Germany and Moreno Torricelli
solidifying the flanks, the team has a legitimate defense for the
first time this decade.

U.S. general consulate in Hamburg threatened
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Police closed the street in front of the
U.S. general consulate in Hamburg on Thursday and drastically
increased security after receiving information about a planned
attack.
	   Police spokesman Reinhard Fallak said authorities learned about
the threat early this week from a ``first-class source.'' He
refused to comment on who investigators believed was planning the
attack. No arrests have been made.
	   U.S. consulate spokesman Michael McClellan also would not
comment on the threat, but said the office was open as usual.
	   ``We have taken all necessary measures to protect the security
of the consulate,'' he said.
	   Fallak said police divers have been checking the waters of the
Alster river in front of the consulate and air traffic controllers
have been instructed to notify them of any unauthorized flights
over the area.
	   Nothing suspicious has been found, he said.
	   Security was tightened at U.S. offices worldwide after the Aug.
7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   A suspected close associate of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,
who is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks, was arrested
last week by German officials acting on a U.S. warrant, raising
concerns of possible reprisals on German soil.
	   Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim, 40, of Sudan, was arrested on a U.S.
warrant charging him with conspiracy to kill Americans and
conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.

NATO prepares fro sir strikes against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes, details
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO began laying detailed plans for
air strikes and cruise missile attacks in Yugoslavia Thursday to
force President Slobodan Milosevic to end his offensive against
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   The 16-nation alliance issued an ``activation warning'' for
``limited'' and ``phased'' air strikes, meaning military chiefs are
now asking nations if they want to participate and what hardware
can they put at NATO's disposal.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the move ``takes NATO
to an increased level of military preparedness.'' But he added,
``Let me stress that the use of force will require further
decisions'' by NATO governments.
	   At a defense ministers meeting, the allies unanimously condemned
Milosevic.
	   ``Belgrade is clearly conducting a war against its own people,''
said German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. ``Pictures of people (in
Kosovo) camping out in the open ... are in themselves an
ultimatum'' to Milosevic that the allies will no longer tolerate
the accumulation of horror, especially on the eve of winter.
	   He said NATO should ``formulate an ultimatum'' to Milosevic, but
did not elaborate on that.
	   U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Walter B. Slocombe told reporters
``the international community has run out of patience ... We expect
any air campaign would be a phased campaign, the targets would be
military targets.''
	   There was no indication when the allies would move, but
officials said it could in a matter of days, if needed. To date,
only Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal have publicly said they
will contribute some 30 jet fighters in all.
	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
demanding a cease-fire in Kosovo, and threatening further action if
fighting continues. It urged both sides to start negotiating a
solution and demanded Milosevic allow international monitoring in
Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   The NATO allies were still struggling with the question if the
United Nations must give final approval for military action by
them.
	   That issue, said one official, who asked not to be named, ``is
something that must be resolved _ and will be resolved _ in the
alliance (but) this will not become some block on NATO action.''
	   NATO has plans for an air campaign of cruise missile attacks and
gradually escalating air strikes by war planes. The targets would
be across Yugoslavia and would notably be part of the country's
solid anti-air defense system such as communications facilities and
radar installations.
	   The ``activation warning'' was issued at a special meeting of
the NATO ambassadors in this southern Portuguese resort town and
which was followed by a defense ministers meeting.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen restated the U.S. view that
NATO needs no U.N. mandate to use force. Wednesday's resolution
already cited Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows for the
use of force if regional peace and security is threatened. It did
not explicitly authorize member states to intervene in Kosovo and
said ``the council would consider further action and additional
measures to maintain or restore peace and stability in the
region,'' if no political deal is reached.
	   In the American view, the destabilizing effect that the Kosovo
crisis has on the Balkan region by unleashing a stream of hundreds
of thousands of refugees merits retaliation.
	   NATO capitals have until now failed to get Milosevic to end his
Kosovo offensive, despite threats of military force and the display
of allied exercises on Yugoslavia's doorstep. The war in Kosovo has
continued, killing killing hundreds of people and leaving almost
300,000 homeless, of whom 50,000 are camped out in the countryside.
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo.
	   The U.N. resolution passed by a 14-0 vote with only China
abstaining in the Security Council. Although Russia went along with
the resolution, Russian support for a military campaign remains
uncertain.
	   France has been pushing hard for a U.N. mandate for military
action. In Germany, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe _ in
the heat of a general election campaign _ have disagreed publicly
on the issue.
	   ``We must avoid to be dependent on a Russian veto,'' Ruehe told
the meeting here. He said NATO's post-Cold War relationship with
Moscow is based on the notion ``that Russia has no veto whenever
NATO needs to act.''

Palestinians establish committees to prepare for statehood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians have taken the first steps toward
declaring statehood in May, forming committees to anticipate and
counter Israeli retaliatory moves, a senior Palestinian official
said Thursday.
	   ``We expect that Israel will respond harshly to the declaration
and so we must prepare,'' said Imad Musa, a spokesman for the
Palestine National Council, a 545-seat legislative body. ``We need
to be ready for an economic battle, a political one and even a
possible military one, everything is possible.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 4, 1999,
the day the five-year interim period of autonomy expires.
	   By that time, Israel and the Palestinians are to have negotiated
a permanent peace agreement, but it appears very unlikely they will
meet the deadline.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that
such a declaration would trigger an Israeli reaction. Netanyahu has
not said specifically how he would respond, but it is believed he
would annex parts of the West Bank and seal off autonomous
Palestinian areas from one another for an extended period.
	   The head of the Palestinian National Council, Salim Zanoun, has
held meetings with PNC members in the West Bank recently to sign
them up for five committees preparing for statehood, Musa said.
	   The economic committee, for example, will make preparations for
an extended Israeli closure of Palestinian areas, which would keep
tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from jobs in Israel, Musa
said.
	   Zanoun is to hold similar meetings in the Gaza Strip and Jordan
in the coming days, said Musa.

Euro preparations, Russian crisis to dominate EU finance talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia's crisis, balancing budgets and
a threat to royal heads will be just some of the issues on the
table for this weekend's gathering of European finance ministers in
Vienna.
	   Meeting Friday and Saturday amid in the Hofburg Imperial Palace,
ministers from the 15 European Union nations know the crowded
agenda reflects a growing urgency to wrap up preparations for the
birth of Europe's common currency in less than 100 days.
	   Ministers from the 11 nations that adopt the euro on Jan. 1 are
under particular pressure to set a deadline for eradicating budget
deficits. Germany insists the drive for balanced budgets is
essential for a strong euro.
	   Talk at EU headquarters was that 2001 will be the target date
for balancing budgets, but some think that is optimistic in the
light of threats posed by the current world financial turmoil.
Budget deficits among the euro-zone nations are expected average
2.4 percent of gross domestic product this year.
	   The financial crisis gripping Russia, much of Asia and Latin
America will top the EU agenda on Saturday, when Michel Camdessus,
head of the International Monetary Fund, joins the meeting.
	   The EU is anxious that Russia shores up its ailing economy, but
like the IMF, it is unwilling to pour more money into Russia unless
the new government can map out coherent reform plans.
	   Camdessus will be interested to discover if the EU resolves a
squabble over who will speak for the euro-currency nations in
international bodies such as the IMF or the G-7 group of economic
powers.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn is expected to
propose the three euro-zone nations in the G-7 _ France, Germany
and Italy _ take turns to represent the whole bloc. Smaller nations
complain that gives too much influence to the big three.
	   The EU's other G-7 nation, Britain, has opted out of the euro
for now, but that has not stopped it becoming consumed with a
controversy about what the currency will look like.
	   Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is under pressure to
overturn a decision by the European Central Bank banning national
symbols _ such as the Queen's head _ from euro-banknotes.
	   Britain's eurosceptics are incensed and say they'll redouble
resistance to joining the monetary union.
	   ``The Queen's head is more than just an image on a banknote,''
said William Hague, leader of the opposition Conservative Party.
	   ``It is a symbol of Britain's heritage, our independence and our
ability to run our own affairs.''
	   On Sept. 11, the ECB, reversed a decision to allow each
euro-zone nation a space for national symbols among the colorful
designs of bridges and doorways on the euro bills.
	   The royal heads of Europe will survive on euro coins _ one side
will carry a map of the EU, the other is free for nations to choose
their own images.

Report: Japan to apologize to South Korea for period of colonial

rule &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan plans to apologize for its harsh 1910-1945
colonial rule over the Korean peninsula during a visit next month
by South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, a news report said
Thursday.
	   The expression of remorse will not, however, go beyond a similar
statement three years ago by Japan on the 50th anniversary of the
end of the war, Kyodo News reported, citing an anonymous Foreign
Ministry official.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesmen were unavailable for comment late
Thursday.
	   Japan has long faced criticism for failing to owe up to
atrocities against its neighbors before and during World War II,
when it occupied much of Asia. Japan annexed the Korean peninsula
in 1910 and withdrew after its surrender to the Allies in 1945.
	   Former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama made one of the clearest
apologies of any postwar Japanese leader in 1995 when he expressed
``deep remorse'' and called Japan's conquest and colonization in
Asia ``a mistaken national policy.''
	   South Korea's Kim will make a four-day visit to Japan from
October 7, his first such trip since becoming president in
February.
	   It was unclear whether the reported apology will also be
directed at Koreans living in North Korea, which has no formal
diplomatic relations with Japan.

 &UR; Greenspan creates heyday in Asian markets, too &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Wall Street trading beginning, Dow
opening lower, European stocks retreating, fresh quote,
reorganizing and trimming to tighten. Changes byline.
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks opened lower on Wall Street on Thursday
as traders sold shares to cash in on big gains Wednesday, when
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sent a strong signal that
U.S. interest rates will be cut.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average _ up 257.21 points, or 3.3
percent, on Wednesday _ was down 28.58 at 8,125.83 in the early
going Thursday. Wednesday's rally was the fifth-largest point gain
ever for the Dow and also sent broader indicators rising sharply.
	   On Thursday morning, declines came across the board on Wall
Street in early profit-taking.
	   But Asian markets soared, lifted by hopes that falling interest
rates would help fight economic crises that have engulfed the
region, spread to Russia and threaten Latin America. European
markets, which opened higher, were giving up their gains in midday
trading.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index in London was
up 23.5 points, or half a percentage point, at midday after being
as much as 107 points higher earlier in the session.
	   Traders said the market sagged after a Confederation of British
Industry survey said export orders for U.K. manufacturers fell to
15-year lows.
	   ``The good news at this stage is that the Fed will cut rates at
some stage, while the bad news is that things are certainly going
to get worse,'' said Peter Caulkett, a salesman at Teather and
Greenwood in London.
	   Frankfurt, Germany's key index was down 1.0 percent at midday
amid nervousness in advance of the national election Sunday.
	   Key market indicators closed with gains of 3 percent in Japan,
4.4 percent in Hong Kong and 6.4 percent in South Korea.
	   Asian analysts attributed the stock rally to Greenspan's
testimony Wednesday to the Senate Budget Committee. He said the
central bank's policy-makers, who meet Tuesday, know they have to
act quickly to contain the global crisis. Traders and analysts said
it was a clear sign that rates would be cut soon.
	   Greenspan indicated the central bank was ready to act to prevent
the widening global turmoil ``from really spilling over and
creating some very significant difficulties for all of us.''
	   There was more evidence Thursday of a cooling economy in the
United States. The government reported the gross domestic product _
the sum of all goods and services produced within U.S. borders _
advanced at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this
year after shooting up at a 5.5 percent rate during the first three
months of the year.
	   Economists often disagree over whether a small U.S. interest
rate cut would have much of a long-term impact on other countries,
especially the markets of Asia, where some countries are working
hard to overhaul the structures of their battered economies.
	   But a cut in U.S. lending rates could help bolster global
confidence by showing that the United States will continue to serve
as an economic engine for the rest of the world.

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Moderate Bosnian Serb
leaders agreed Thursday to work together towards implementing
democratic processes, in a move to sideline an ultranationalist
victory for the presidency.
	   Final results of Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 nationwide were delayed
for a third time Thursday, but initial tallies indicate that
ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen will succeed U.S.-backed incumbent
Biljana Plavsic as Bosnian Serb president.
	   Officials had promised preliminary results for Tuesday and final
tallies for Thursday.
	   In Sarajevo, Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, charged with overseeing the
elections, said technical problems forced the elections to be
postphoned for ``at least'' another day.
	   A Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said Poplasen was some 40,000 votes ahead of U.S.-backed incumbent
Biljana Plavsic early Thursday, with some 4,000 ballots to be
counted.
	   A Poplasen victory is seen as a serious setback to Western
efforts to unite the country's disparate ethnic groups after the
3{-year war that ended with the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
	   The peace plan divided Bosnia into two entities, a Serb republic
and a Muslim-Croat federation. The Serb republic also voted for the
president of its entity.
	   Thursday's agreement, signed in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of
Banja Luka, envisages a future political platform between coalition
partners Plavsic, Socialist Zivko Radisic _ posied to win the Serb
seat in Bosnia's three-member presidency _ and incumbent prime
minister Milorad Dodik.
	   While seen as an attempt by the moderates to sideline Poplasen,
a supporter of No.1 indicted war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic,
the agreement will have little political significance until the
future Bosnian Serb parliament is constituted.
	   ``This agreement is a political platform which provides for the
continuation of democratic processes our coalition started, as well
as economic progress and social well-being,'' Radisic told
reporters at a post-signing news conference.
	   Dodik, the incumbent premier, indicated the moderates hope the
future premier would also come from their alliance, Harmony.
	   Although the president is responsible for nominating the premier
designate _ expected to be a hard-liner if Poplasen should take
office _ the 83-seat parliament has to approve the nomination with
42 votes in favor.
	   Speaking in Sarajevo, top U.S. envoy to the Balkans Robert
Gelbard said he hoped Dodik and his government would continue
``unless they are voted down.''
	   Gelbard said the elections were free and fair and judging by
unconfirmed reports based on yet incomplete accounts and confirmed
the trend towards democratic pluralism in Bosnia, with a few
exceptions.
	   But, he was ``not optimistic'' by exceptions from this trend, he
said, citing Poplasen's victory. He said Poplasen's history and the
one of his party, ``give us very little or no reason for
optimism.''
	   Gelbard also warned Poplasen from nominating a hard-liner as the
prime minister, saying it would be a powerful signal to his people
and to the rest of the world about his intentions.
	   Poplasen and his party have made no secret of their desire of an
ethnic pure Serb state that would succeed from Bosnia and join
neighboring Serbia.

Government sets Oct. 25 as date for Bucharest elections for mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government on Thursday set Oct. 25
as the date to elect Bucharest's mayor, reversing an earlier
decision to indefinitely postpone the vote for lack of money.
	   Eight men and one woman have already said they will run. Viorel
Lis, the acting mayor, and Sorin Oprescu, a respected surgeon from
a leftist opposition party, have the best chances.
	   The government bowed to the opposition, which claimed it would
``endanger democracy'' if elections were not held.
	   The 15 billion lei (dlrs 1.7 million) needed for the elections
will be come from Bucharest's budgets for heating, public
transportation and construction, said deputy Mayor George Nistor.
	   Bucharest's three million residents have had an acting mayor
since November 1996, when Mayor Victor Ciorbea was appointed prime
minister without formally vacating the mayor's office.
	   Amid economic and political pressures, Ciorbea stepped down as
premier in March and quit as mayor at the same time.

Romanian President blames he government for slow reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ President Emil Constantinescu strongly
criticized the government Thursday for failing to reform Romania's
limping economy and urged action to reverse the trend.
	   ``The government endlessly comes out with words such as reform
and restructuring which almost have lost all meaning,''
Constantinescu said during a student graduation ceremony.
	   He spoke one day after dismissed Finance Minister Daniel Daianu,
saying he hadn't done enough to retool the economy along market
lines, and it indicated more ministers may soon lose their jobs.
	   Constantinescu called on the government to urgently adopt a
``clear strategy'' for reforming the economy and stop ``cheap,
populist'' slogans.
	   Although reformists won elections almost two years ago,
promising to reform the economy along western lines, purchasing
power has slumped and the national currency is overvalued,
discouraging exports and foreign investment.
	   Only dlrs 3.6 billion of foreign money has poured into Romania
since 1989, when communism ended, a small amount compared to other
former communist countries.
	   Foreign and domestic investors have also been frustrated by
political bickering and bureaucracy.

India pressured after Pakistan pledges adherence to nuke accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With Pakistan saying it is ready to sign
on to the nuclear test ban treaty, India is under pressure to make
a similar gesture in a speech to world leaders at the General
Assembly.
	   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Wednesday that his
country was ready to adhere to the pact, even as he warned that
compliance would depend on whether rival India resumed its tests.
	   ``Pakistan is ... prepared to adhere to the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty,'' Sharif told world leaders at the U.N. General
Assembly session.
	   ``In this regard, we expect that the arbitrary restrictions
imposed on Pakistan by multilateral institutions will be speedily
removed,'' he said.
	   India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, addresses the
General Assembly later Thursday.
	   The United States and other nations imposed economic sanctions _
cutting off all loans _ after India and Pakistan carried out
nuclear tests.
	   That measure has been especially tough on Pakistan, which has
been struggling with severe economic woes.
	   Sharif and Vajpayee met for nearly two hours Wednesday but
achieved no breakthroughs over Kashmir, a simmering territorial
dispute that took a perilous turn since both countries carried out
nuclear tests last May.
	   Vajpayee said there would be further talks on Kashmir when the
foreign secretaries of both sides meet in Pakistan for a three-day
meeting beginning Oct. 15.
	   ``When declarations like this are made, it creates hope anew,''
said E. Deenadayalan, whose private Pakistan-India People's Forum
for Peace and Democracy promotes contacts between ordinary Indians
and Pakistanis in hopes of whittling away decades of prejudice and
hostility.
	   Wednesday's meeting between the two leaders was the second since
their nuclear tests drew international condemnation and pressure
for both sides to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over the
disputed state of Kashmir _ in the 51 years since the independent
states were carved out of the British empire.

</HEADLINE>
Germany &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Despite tight-fisted communist rule and
indoctrination, hundreds of neo-Nazi incidents were recorded in
former East Germany beginning as early as 1965, secret police files
show.
	   A researcher at the government office in charge of old East
German state security records _ better known as the Stasi files _
said Thursday that more than 700 neo-Nazi incidents were recorded
in the East German army and secret police between 1965 and 1980.
	   The incidents range from someone giving the outstretched arm
Nazi salute or spraying racist graffiti to harassing of colleagues
and beatings, the researcher, Bernd Eisenfeld, said.
	   In some case neo-Nazis in the military clashed with soldiers
loyal to the East German communists, he said.
	   According to Eisenfeld, investigation of the incidents was low
key and most of those involved in neo-Nazi activity were never
punished. Most cases were settled by ``counseling, surveillance, I
don't know what all,'' he said.
	   A study by the Stasi shows that efforts to curtail right-wing
extremism had failed and that instead it had grown, he said.
	   A skinhead scene developed in East Germany in the 1980s and
included at least a dozen members of the Stasi's elite guard in
East Berlin, Der Tagesspiegel newspaper reported Thursday.

Mahathir chides Anwar's handling of economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
was quoted Thursday as saying that managing the Malaysian economy
is easier without having to argue with his jailed former finance
minister.
	   Mahathir, already supervising the police as home affairs
minister, took the finance minister portfolio after firing Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sept. 2.
	   Anwar, who was also Mahathir's designated successor, was
arrested Sunday after starting a nationwide political reform
campaign against his former mentor.
	   Mahathir and Anwar had disagreed over International Monetary
Fund methods for dealing with the economic crisis. Anwar had
pressed for conservative management of banks, spending and
collapsing companies.
	   ``I was able to counter that and literally forced him to accept
that this is the wrong way to do it,'' Mahathir was quoted as
saying Thursday in local newspapers.
	   ``He just doesn't understand how to manage the economy,''
Mahathir said of the man who was his finance minister for seven
years.
	   ``Now that he is not there, I think we can manage very nicely,''
Mahathir said in the interviews. ``It is easier as I don't have to
argue with him.''
	   Meanwhile, in a home video made on the night of his arrest,
Anwar said that Mahathir had allowed his commercial interests and
those of his family and cronies to sway his judgment on public
spending and controls.
	   The video was aired twice Thursday by regional cable television
station CNBC Asia.
	   In it, Anwar compared Mahathir to ousted Indonesian President
Suharto, saying the 72-year-old Malaysian leader was ``hungry for
power and money, and wants to use the remaining time that he has in
power to strengthen the interests of his family, and the interests
of his cronies.''
	   Mahathir has been prime minister for 17 years.
	   In the video, Anwar said he angered Mahathir by not supporting
development of the new international airport.
	   ``There was too much interest (in it) for his family, his
children,'' Anwar said.
	   Mahathir shrugged off the video at a news conference, saying,
``I don't care. ... Tell the lies many, many times, and eventually
people will believe.''

 &UR; NATO: Bosnian election results not all that bad &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ While expressing concern at the
continuing cost of peacekeeping in Bosnia, the NATO alliance said
Thursday the country's Sept. 12-13 elections had brought some
encouraging signs.
	   International officials had hoped the elections _ the third in
three post-war years _ would further sideline radical nationalists
opposed to ethnic tolerance and other provisions of the 1995 Dayton
peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war.
	   The ballot's results won't be known until Friday. However,
initial indications are that extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen
has defeated Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic _ the favorite
of the international community _ in the presidential race.
	   Even so, Plavsic's showing was slightly up on the country's last
ballot, while the hardliners were slightly down.
	   ``The results are not all that we'd hoped for ... but they're
not an unmitigated disaster either,'' said a NATO official, who
spoke to reporters here on condition of anonymity.
	   ``There are some rays of light at the end of the tunnel,'' said
the official on the sidelines of a NATO defense ministers meeting
that reviewed the crisis in Kosovo and the situation in Bosnia.
	   The official said the allies welcomed the fact the elections
were ``free and fair'' and also the agreement of moderate Bosnian
Serb leaders agreed to work together towards implementing
democratic processes.
	   The West has deployed a 35,000-strong NATO-led multinational
peacekeeping force, known as the Stabilization Force or SFOR, and
invested billions of dollars a year to help rebuild Bosnia.
	   But efforts to bring Serbs, Croats and Muslims together again
have shown little result.
	   The defense ministers, while acknowledging the continuing vital
role of peacekeepers, expressed concern about ``drag factors'' on
the drive to cement peace and stability across Bosnia, said the
NATO official.
	   These include slow progress on restructuring the police, the
judiciary and the media, and a far-behind-schedule return of
refugees.
	   ``A lot of hard work is still needed. We can't allow a situation
where peace entirely depends on the presence of SFOR. We don't want
to create a dependence culture,'' the official said.
	   International officials are to conduct a six-month review of the
Bosnian peace process in the weeks ahead. Even so, it appeared
unlikely that the SFOR will be reduced dramatically at this stage.
	   ``The peace process remains dependent on the presence of a
substantial number of SFOR troops for now,'' said the NATO
official.

Russian parliament speaker calls for closer ties with Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliamentary speaker called Thursday for
boosting the nation's ties with Iran, including military
cooperation.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of parliament's lower house, the
State Duma, spoke to reporters after returning from a three-day,
official visit to Iran.
	   He said that Russia should complete an agreement to build a
nuclear reactor in Iran in spite of objections from the United
States. Russia says the 1,000-megawatt reactor is purely for
civilian purposes, but the United States fears it will help Iran
advance its suspected nuclear weapons program.
	   Seleznyov, a member of the Communist Party, also said Moscow
should continue selling weapons to Iran despite the fact that ``the
United States is still sharply criticizing Iran and calling it a
country of terrorists,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He said that bilateral trade reached dlrs 550 million last year.
	   Seleznyov said he had discussed the recent rise in tensions
between Iran and Afghanistan following the Taliban forces' killing
of eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist in the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   ``Despite the acute situation, we wouldn't like Iran to engage
in a war against the Taliban,'' Seleznyov said, adding that he had
received assurances that Iran would not use force against the
Taliban.

East Timorese, students, stage protest in Surabaya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of East Timorese staged a
peaceful protest Thursday in the East Java capital of Surabaya,
demanding an immediate referendum in the troubled territory.
	   Dozens of university students and pro-democracy activists from
other Indonesian provinces joined the East Timorese in the
half-hour demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate.
	   A statement submitted to a U.S. diplomat outlined three demands
_ an immediate referendum in East Timor, rejection of special
status and U.N. mediation to bring about the referendum.
	   ``Implement UN Resolutions and Hold Referendum in East Timor''
and ``Autonomy No. Referendum Yes,'' were among banners unfurled
during the 30-minute protest.
	   Surabaya is about 400 miles (650 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1976, a year after its troops intervened in a civil war that broke
out during the last days of Portugal colonization rule.
	   The United Nations still considers Portugal the administering
power of the half-island territory, and is sponsoring talks between
Jakarta and Lisbon.
	   Indonesia's new government under B.J. Habibie has offered to
grant a form of special autonomy to East Timor in return for
international recognition of its sovereignty over the half-island
territory, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.

Thieves break into Vatican offices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Thieves broke into Vatican offices on St.
Peter's Square and made off with about 2 million lire (dlrs 1,200)
officials said Thursday.
	   The thieves jimmied the locks to get into the offices in charge
of Catholic education and religious orders around the world and
scooped up cash found in desk drawers, Vatican officials said.
Computers and documents were left untouched.
	   The offices are in a Vatican building on the edge of St. Peter's
Square, which is crossed by thousands of tourists and Romans each
day. The theft occurred Sunday night, but was only confirmed by
authorities Thursday.
	   Such break-ins are rare, but there have been recent cases of
thefts from Vatican buildings. Four Greek vases were stolen in 1994
and two gold medals were taken the previous year.
	   In the most prominent recent case, a retired American art
history professor admitted to smuggling pages torn from a valuable
14th century manuscript in the Vatican Library and was sentenced to
14 months in prison in Ohio two years ago.

U.S. President urges political dialogue in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton condemned the
recent violence in Albania and urged his Albanian counterpart to
help start a constructive dialogue with all political forces.
	   In a letter sent Thursday to Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani,
Clinton said dialogue is the key to ending violence.
	   ``It is a difficult job, but the key to ending violence and
polarization that have been a destructive force in Albania's
development ...'' Clinton said of initiating discussions.
	   Violence broke out in the Albanian capital Tirana last week
during demonstrations organized by opposition leader, Former
President Sali Berisha, to protest the killing of popular lawmaker
and parliament member Azem Hajdari on Sept. 12.
	   During the riots, Berisha's supporters stormed government
buildings, including the parliament, and took control of state
television.
	   The violence has raised fears of a repeat of months of anarchy
last year after the collapse of pyramid schemes, which cost many
people their life's savings. Berisha was president during the
crisis and lost elections in its aftermath.
	   ``I join with other world leaders in condemning the use of
violence to achieve political ends ...'' Clinton said in his
letter. ``Support of democratic institutions and the rule of law
must be the guiding principles for all countries seeking to build a
stable, prosperous democracy.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A soldier fled his unit Thursday and then killed
himself after he was tracked down by his colleagues, the latest in
a series of violent incidents in Russia's demoralized military.
	   The shootings have come as Russia begins its regular fall
military call-up _ an order that thousands of young draftees
routinely ignore. The Soldiers' Mothers Committee, a leading
anti-draft group, sent an open letter to President Boris Yeltsin
this week urging him to cancel the draft.
	   ``Everyone clearly understands that there are no material
resources to provide conscripts with food, clothing and shoes,''
the letter read.
	   Russian media reports have said that the government's shortage
of money has forced some units to cut rations to two meals a day,
and some officers have even asked soldiers' parents to help with
money or food.
	   In the latest incident, Alexander Konovalov, who served with the
Border Guards on the eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, fled his post
early Thursday with his assault rifle.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces on Thursday
struck deeper into the last pockets of Kosovo Albanian separatists,
despite U.N. and NATO moves that open the door for a military
strike against them.
	   The boom of artillery sounded Thursday across the central
Drenica region of the Serbian province, and Serb police sources
said they divided the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army by taking
over a main road through the rebels last stronghold.
	   Pristina's Serb-controlled Media Center said police had ``closed
the ring around strong groups of Albanian extremists,'' destroying
their bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, the vast majority in Kosovo, favor
independence. World powers instead back autonomy for Kosovo
instead, arguing that independence can be achieved only through
prolonged bloodshed.
	   Most victims of the Serb-Yugoslav military campaign have been
ethnic Albanian civilians. More than 275,000 have been driven from
hundreds of destroyed villages, leaving an estimated 50,000 with no
shelter as winter approaches.
	   Later Thursday, the intensity of the fighting appeared to ease
at least in some parts of the Drenica region. But it was impossible
to determine whether the overall offensive had lessened in response
to new signs of U.N. and NATO determination.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday threatened further action
unless the fighting stopped. While not specifically mandating NATO
action, the resolution opened the way for international approval of
military involvement.
	   NATO ambassadors meeting in Portugal on Thursday approved
increased planning for air strikes in Kosovo. NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said the decision takes the
organization ``to an increased level of military preparedness''
without actually approving the use of force.
	   The plight of the ethnic Albanian refugees is driving Western
efforts to get a commitment from Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end the government offensive and permit mass refugee
returns.
	   Refugee numbers were swollen by the latest fighting, with up to
20,000 civilians fleeing their homes in the Drenica area, west and
southwest of Pristina.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians patrolled nearly all routes into the region, tightening
the noose on several hundred lightly armed rebels.
	   The U.N. resolution _ the toughest action the council has taken
to date _ came less than 24 hours before the NATO defense
ministers' meeting in Portugal.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, have committed men and aircraft for any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces on Thursday
struck deeper into the last strongholds of Kosovo Albanian
separatists, despite U.N. and NATO moves that open the door for a

Ibrahim Rugova, said the U.N. and NATO moves may have come too
late.
	   ``The resolution is a good step, but it came too late because
half of Kosovo is already destroyed and burned,'' the aide, Enver
Maljoku, said. ``I don't think (Yugoslav President Slobodan)
Milosevic will take this message from the U.N. seriously, and I'm
afraid that he'll have enough time to destroy the other half of
Kosovo too.''

Japan moves to halt harassment of ethnic Koreans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's law enforcement agencies have been ordered
to crack down on a wave of harassment of ethnic Koreans following
North Korea's launching of a rocket over Japan last month, a news
report said Thursday.
	   A Korean residents' group in Japan says ethnic Koreans have been
the target of death threats and other forms of harassment since
North Korea carried out its surprise launch on Aug. 31.
	   In one case, 20 Korean schools in the Tokyo area had to check
their water supplies after a cyanide poisoning scare, which later
proved to be a hoax.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka was quoted by Kyodo News
agency as saying on Thursday that the Justice Ministry, National
Police Agency and Foreign Ministry were instructed to help curb the
abuses.
	   The North's launch, which Pyongyang claims was conducted to put
a satellite in orbit, caused an uproar in Japan, where many were
unnerved by the brash display of advanced missile-based technology.
	   About 640,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of them born here as
descendants of workers and conscripts imported during Tokyo's
1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula.
	   Ethnic Koreans in Japan often face discrimination in hiring and
marriage. Roughly 180,000 are believed to loyal to the North,
though there is no official tally.

Russia says Sea Launch now expected to start in March
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The first launch of the international Sea Launch
project has been rescheduled from this fall to next March because
of American delays, a top Russian space official said Thursday.
	   The official, Valery Aliev of the Energia space corporation,
placed blame on the U.S. State Department and on Hughes Space and
Communications, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Hughes had
previously announced that the launch would be delayed until early
1999.
	   The State Department recently suspended work on Sea Launch out
of concern that Boeing Corp., a partner in the project, was giving
sensitive information to Russia. Meanwhile, Hughes has had problems
with a satellite that was to have been the first Sea Launch
payload.
	   Sea Launch is a dlrs 500 million program that will use a
modified version of the Soviet SS-18 intercontinental ballistic
missile to boost satellites into space from a floating platform
positioned at the equator.
	   According to Aliev, the first launch next March will send a
mockup rather than a real satellite into space, largely because of
the problems Hughes has had with the PanAmSat communications
satellite.
	   PanAmSat's Galaxy XI satellite, built by Hughes, was to have
been launched into space late this year using Sea Launch, but that
project was put on hold after PanAmSat's Galaxy IV satellite failed
in May, cutting service to 85 percent of the pagers in the United
States.

Minister considering tents to house asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government is
considering pitching tents to house asylum seekers as a growing
stream of refugees threatens to overwhelm the 42,000 beds provided
for them.
	   In August, more than 3,700 people applied for asylum in this
small, overcrowded nation of 16 million. In January that number was
2900.
	   If the current flood of applicants continues, beds will be
needed for 50,000 people by year's end, Werner van Bastelaar of the
Asylum Seeker Accommodation Center (COA) said Thursday.
	   Last year, 35,000 people applied for asylum in the Netherlands,
which has a tradition of welcoming the oppressed stretching back to
the Pilgrim Fathers who sheltered here before boarding the
Mayflower.
	   The government-funded COA runs a nationwide network of centers
housing refugees in everything from caravans to disused army
barracks, but demand for beds continues to outpace supply.
	   ``If we can't house these people in the traditional way, we will
have to look for less conventional alternatives and tents are a
possibility,'' Dutch Justice Secretary Job Cohen told Dutch
television Wednesday night.
	   Cohen was speaking from Brussels where he was attending a
meeting of European Union ministers called to discuss the growing
problem of asylum seekers. He was expected to raise the Dutch
problem with other E.U. member states who are less welcoming to
refugees.
	   A year ago, a small group of asylum seekers caused a national
uproar when they set up a tent village in a northern forest,
claiming they had nowhere else to go because their applications had
been rejected and their countries of origin would not take them
back.
	   But this time around, the government seems resigned to the fact
that pitching tents may be the only way to put a roof over the
heads of new arrivals as autumn turns to winter.
	   The majority of asylum seekers entering the Netherlands come
from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Bosnia, Justice Ministry
spokeswoman Maud Brederp said. The influx may further swell as
refugees flee fighting in the Serb province of Kosovo.
	   Many asylum seekers arrive in the Netherlands because of its
reputation for taking good care of refugees while they await the
outcome of their asylum applications _ a process which can take
months.
	   Brederp said the Dutch want to see a harmonization of asylum
procedures throughout the European Union, which would make the
Netherlands stand out less.
	   At the moment, refugees tour Europe until they reach the
Netherlands ``and they think, `Hey, this is the place to be,' ''
Brederp said.

Government orders probe into alleged rape of nuns in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian authorities ordered a judicial
probe into the alleged rape of four nuns by armed men in a village
convent and announced a reward for information about the accused,
domestic news agencies reported Thursday.
	   Police were searching the area around the Nawapada village in
India's largest Madhya Pradesh state where intruders brandishing
swords and canes allegedly dragged four nuns to a farm field and
raped them Wednesday, said Harvansh Singh, interior minister of the
province.
	   Police in the neighboring state of Gujarat on India's west coast
had also been alerted, Singh was quoted as saying by United News of
India news agency.
	   About 20 armed men allegedly broke open the grilled gates of the
convent at 2 a.m. after pleading with the sisters to accompany them
to a patient in the area. The sisters had refused to accompany
them, asking them to bring a letter from the local priest. The
identity of the nuns has not been disclosed.
	   A reward of 50,000 rupees (dlrs 1,190) would be given for
information about the attackers who also ransacked the convent, he
said.
	   Institutions run by Christian missionary groups in the state
remained closed Thursday in protest, Press Trust of India said.
	   The sisters belong to the Foreign Missionary Sisters, an order
providing medical help in rural areas and based in the southern
Pondicherry town. They were all under 35 year of age and belonged
to the southern coastal state of Tamil Nadu, the All India Catholic
Union said.
	   Hindu-majority India's 21 million Christians form a tiny
percentage of the country's population of nearly 1 billion.
Christian community leaders allege attacks against nuns and
preachers have increased since a Hindu nationalist-led government
took over six months ago.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were trading in a narrow range Thursday
as Wall Street caught its breath after sharp gains on Wednesday,
when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sent a strong signal
that U.S. interest rates will be cut.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average _ up 257.21 points, or 3.3
percent, on Wednesday _ was up an additional 3.09 at 8,157.50 in
active trading by midmorning.
	   Wednesday's rally was the fifth-largest point gain ever for the
Dow and also sent broader indicators rising sharply. On Thursday,
broader indicators were mixed after an early bout of profit-taking.
	   But Asian markets soared earlier in the day, lifted by hopes
that falling interest rates would help fight economic crises that
have engulfed the region, spread to Russia and threaten Latin
America. European markets, which opened higher, gave up their gains
by the afternoon.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index in London, up
107 points in the morning, was down 45 points late in the session.
Traders said the market sagged after a Confederation of British
Industry survey said export orders for U.K. manufacturers fell to
15-year lows.
	   ``The good news at this stage is that the Fed will cut rates at
some stage, while the bad news is that things are certainly going
to get worse,'' said Peter Caulkett, a salesman at Teather and
Greenwood in London.
	   Frankfurt, Germany's key index was down slightly in afternoon
trading amid nervousness in advance of the national election
Sunday.

German city celebrates Elvis' arrival 40 years ago
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BREMERHAVEN, Germany (AP) _ An Elvis Presley sighting 40 years
ago in the North Sea port of Bremerhaven is good enough reason for
city officials to throw a four-day festival honoring the King of
Rock.
	   ``The Day that Elvis Came'' festival on Oct. 1-4 commemorates
the young Army private's arrival in Germany on Oct. 1, 1958, to
begin doing his military service.
	   Already famous from such hits as ``Love Me Tender'' and
``Jailhouse Rock,'' the 23-year-old GI was greeted by crowds of
fans as he walked off the General G. M. Rendall troop transport
ship and down the gangway at the Columbuskaje pier.
	   He didn't stay in Bremerhaven long, moving on to Friedberg, in
central Germany, where he served until February 1960.
	   But the city plans to mark the anniversary of his arrival with
music, exhibits and a bronze plaque on the spot where Elvis first
touched German soil.

Police fire tear gas shells to disperse Sunni Muslim Protesters

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Police fired tear gas at hundreds of
stick-wielding extremist Sunni Muslim protesters who clashed with
police on Thursday, outside a Mosque in Lahore's main business
district.
	   Dozens of people, including several policemen, were injured in
an hour-long violence which turned the area into a virtual battle
field.
	   Violence broke out after supporters of Sipah-e-Sahaba, a
militant Sunni Muslim organization, protesting the arrest of their
leaders, attacked police and pelted stones at vehicles, a police
official said.
	   Police fired several rounds of tear gas shells as the
demonstrators tried to block the traffic.
	   Police arrested around 500 demonstrators .
	   '' Many of them are trained terrorists and are involved in
sectarian killings,'' said Ahmed Reza Tahir, senior superintendent
police.
	   Sipah-i-Sahaba has been locked in a fierce religious war with a
rival Shiite organization which has left hundreds of people dead
over the last few years.
	   The sectarian violence intensified after four leaders of the
Sipah-i-Sahaba were killed in Islamabad earlier this month
allegedly by Shiite militants.
	   There also were reports of violence in several other cities of
Punjab where militant Sunni Muslims attacked police.
	   More than 800 people were arrested in the province, police said.
	   The Sunni leaders have accused the police of provoking violence
and threatened to launch province-wide anti-government campaign.
	   ``Police attacked peaceful demonstrators, '' said Mohammed Alam,
a leader of Sipah-i-Sahaba.

tea in separate case. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A research assistant and eight college students
have been sickened after drinking cadmium-laced tea at their
university lab in western Japan, police said Thursday.
	   Though no one was in serious condition from the incident, the
news comes amid heightened concerns over a string of poisonings
that began in the summer. Five people have died as a result of two
of the poisonings. No arrests have been made.
	   The latest poisoning occurred last Friday morning, said Mitsuo
Sato, a spokesman for the prefectural, or state, police in Kyoto,
about 375 kilometers (235 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Junta Yanai, a 31-year-old research assistant and eight students
at Kyoto University's soil research department complained of
stomachaches, diarrhea and vomiting about an hour after drinking
Japanese tea together, he said.
	   Sato said police were investigating the case as an assault, or
possibly an accident, since the department has access to cadmium.
	   The heavy metal can cause kidney problems and calcium
insufficiency when taken internally, he said.
	   The victims reported the sickening to a local health center
after being treated at a nearby hospital. Health officials then
reported it to the police.
	   The health center and the police conducted separate tests on the
leftover tea. They both found a small amount of cadmium, Sato said.
	   Four people _ including two children _ died and dozens more were
sickened in July after eating curry laced with arsenic at a town
festival in western Japan.
	   Last month, a man in central Japan was fatally poisoned after
drinking a can of tea containing potassium cyanide.
	   On Thursday, Kyodo News agency reported that a housewife was
arrested on suspicion of putting insecticide into a bottle of juice
in an attempt to embarrass the supermarket where she bought it.
	   Naomi Nagakura called police in Shizuoka, central Japan, on
Sept. 6 to complain that her throat burned after she tasted the

Former Davis Cup chamipons struggle to stay in World Group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Without their top player Petr
Korda, the Czechs will drop out of the elite World Group for the
first time if they lose their Davis Cup match to South Africa this
weekend.
	   On Friday, Slava Dosedel takes on Wayne Ferreira and Bohdan
Ulihrach plays Marcos Ondruska.
	   In Saturday's doubles, David Rikl and Jiri Novak will face
Ferreira and Piet Norval. The reverse singles are Sunday.
	   Davis Cup champions in 1980 when Czechoslovakia was still one
country, the Czechs now face the prospect of falling out of the
World Group.
	   ``I hope our team will lead 2-0 after Friday's singles,'' Czech
captain Tomas Smid said. ``But Slava will have to leave his soul on
the court to win.''
	   Ferreira was instrumental in taking South Africa to the
threshold of the World Group again after his country was excluded
from Davis Cup play between 1978 and 1992.
	   ``We have two pretty much equal teams facing each other,'' South
Africa's coach Danie Visser said.

Kosovo rebels say U.N. resolution is useless

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. resolution threatening further action to
stop the fighting in Kosovo is ``good for nothing,'' Swiss-based
representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army said Thursday.
	   Air attacks by NATO on Serb forces are the only possible
solution to prevent the conflict continuing in the province, said
KLA spokesman Mahmuti Bardhyl.
	   ``The international community has become a spectator of the
situation in the Balkans,'' Bardhyl said.
	   While not specifically mandating NATO action, the U.N. Security
Council resolution passed Wednesday opened the way for
international approval of involvement by the military alliance.
	   Bardhyl told reporters in Geneva the KLA wouldn't react to the
resolution because it didn't contain any punitive measure against
Serb forces.
	   ``As far as this resolution is concerned, we are of the opinion
that it is good for nothing,'' Jashar Salihu, another KLA spokesman
accompanying Bardhyl, said.
	   Bardhyl said the KLA would only respond to an appeal by the
international community to negotiate if the conflict is halted and
the Serb military arsenal is removed from Kosovo.
	   Both Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics which constitute
Yugoslavia, have rejected an ethnic Albanian proposal that Kosovo
becomes a third republic within the country.
	   Salihu said independence was the only solution the KLA would
accept. He refused to say how many soldiers the KLA had at its
disposal, but said the KLA had a limited number compared to the
Serbs.
	   Talking about the progress of the KLA's fight so far, Salihu
said ``it could be better, but we have done a lot of the job.''

Police chief steps down after hostage chaos

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's police chief stepped down
Thursday in the widespread fallout following a bungled attempt to
free three hostages held by the country's top fugitive.
	   The Greek-Romanian hostage taker, one captive and 10 police
officers _ including Police Chief Thanassis Vassilopoulos _ were
injured when a hand grenade detonated during the late Wednesday
siege to end the four-hour standoff broadcast live on television.
	   The operation was criticized as badly mismanaged. Questions were
raised about whether top police officials joined the front-line
assault in order to gain nationwide publicity and redeem the image
of security forces, which allowed the convict to slip free earlier
this month after he took a police officer hostage.
	   The backlash reached as high as Public Order Minister George
Romeos. But resignations submitted by Romeos and the ministry's
secretary general, Yiannis Papadogiannakis, were not accepted by
Premier Costas Simitis.
	   Simitis described the police operation as ``a tragic event, a
criminal action.''
	   Romeos, who cut short a foreign visit, said he will suspend the
head of Athens' metropolitan police, Panagiotis Georgakopoulos, and
the head of security forces, Theodoros Papafilis.
	   ``They were responsible for these operations with these sad
results,'' Romeos said.
	   A new police chief is scheduled to be selected Friday.
	   Vassilopoulos, who submitted his resignation from his hospital
bed, suffered a ruptured ear drum from the grenade blast. Another
police officer was listed in serious condition after his left leg
was amputated.
	   The fugitive, Sorin Matei, was hospitalized with a bullet wound
in his neck and other injuries, media reports said. One of the
three family members held hostage, a 25-year-old woman, was in
critical condition. Doctors said she had few chances of survival.
	   Matei, 27, had shoved the grenade into the woman's pants when
police stormed the central Athens apartment, officials said.
	   According to government spokesman Dimitris Reppas, the police
force's leadership decided to participate in the raid in order to
be in the position to make on-the-spot decisions.
	   ``We express our deep sorrow for the wounding of innocent
civilians and police officers,'' said Reppas.
	   But he insisted the error-plagued operation does not indicate
the Greek police force is unable to handle crisis situations. The
leader of the opposition New Democracy party, Costas Karamanlis,
claimed the Greek state ``cannot protect its citizens.''
	   ``Isolated incidents, even when they take on these proportions,
mustn't lead us to generalizations on how safe citizens should
feel,'' Reppas responded.
	   The hostage standoff developed into a bizarre mix of media
coverage and participation.
	   Matei called Nikos Evangelatos, the main news anchor of the
private television channel Skai.
	   In a broadcast without precedent in Greece, Matei rambled on
about his life and drug habit, issued demands and at one point hung
up before calling Evangelatos again.
	   The police moved in when Skai interrupted its coverage for a
commercial break.
	   It was the second time Greek TV viewers were riveted to their
sets by Matei, who in July escaped from prison where he was serving
sentences for robberies and other crimes.
	   On Sept. 6, he used a hand grenade to take a police officer
hostage for almost eight hours before security forces released him.
	   He fled in a taxi and police were unable to track him down until
Wednesday, when they located him hiding inside a multi-storied
apartment building near the capital's red light district.

Humble Mallorca nears top

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Having spent all but 12 seasons playing
outside the Primera Division, RCD Mallorca is giving the islander
locals something more to be proud of other than their famous
resort.
	   A fifth place finish last year and an 2-1-0 start this season
have fans unaccustomedly hopeful _ and the club in a virtual tie
for the Spanish league lead.
	   ``We're off to a good start. The hard part is to keep it up,''
Mallorca goalkeeper Carlos Roa told the sports daily AS Wednesday.
	   Mallorca has a chance to take sole possession of the lead Sunday
at home against Oviedo. League leader Real Madrid must travel to
Bilbao on Saturday.
	   Also on Saturday, Barcelona hosts Celta, Valencia plays at
Valladolid, Atletico Madrid receives Real Sociedad and Betis hosts
Extremadura.
	   On Sunday Villareal plays Salamanca, Tenerife receives Alaves,
Deportivo La Coruna takes on Espanyol while Zaragoza wraps up the
round against Racing de Santander.
	   Mallorca's annual budget totals 3.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 22
million), about what Barcelona or Madrid pays for only a handful of
its starters.
	   Its modest Luis Sitjar stadium has just 10,000 seats, and room
for another 14,000 on the terraces, making it one of the smallest
in the league.
	   Playing under Argentine coach Hector Cuper, the team has grown
in stature, having finished its all-time best (fifth) last season
and having won the Spanish SuperCup by beating Barcelona in August.
	   Mallorca had spent 13 of the past 20 years in Spain's second,
third and fourth divisions. It reached the first division last
season after five straight years in the second.
	   Still, the club has goals _ it hasn't risen as high as second
place in the premier division since 1961.
	   In his second season as coach Cuper is trying to consolidate a
largely new squad that has four of his countrymen, including
striker Ariel ``Chupa'' Lopez and Roa, who was praised for his play
in the World Cup in France.
	   Mallorca also has recruited midfielders Veljko Paunovic of
Yugoslavia and Spaniard Pablo Lago from Atletico Madrid and Real
Madrid's Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia.
	   Elsewhere, Madrid will be crossing its fingers in the hope
Brazilian ace Savio, who has been the team's most exciting player
so far, will be fit for Saturday's match against Bilbao.

NATO: Bosnian election results not all that bad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Bosnia-Elections &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ While expressing concern Thursday at
the continuing cost of peacekeeping in Bosnia, the NATO alliance
said this month's elections showed encouraging signs for future
stability there.
	   International officials had hoped the Sept. 12-13 elections _
the third in three postwar years _ would sideline nationalists
opposed to ethnic tolerance and other provisions of the 1995 Dayton
peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war.
	   The ballot's results won't be known until Friday. However,
initial indications are that hard-liner Nikola Poplasen defeated
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic _ the favorite of the
international community _ in the presidential race.
	   Even so, Plavsic's showing was slightly up on the country's last
ballot, while the hard-liners were slightly down.
	   ``The results are not all that we'd hoped for ... but they're
not an unmitigated disaster either,'' said a NATO official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity at a NATO defense ministers meeting
in Portugal.
	   ``There are some rays of light at the end of the tunnel,'' said
the official on the sidelines of the meeting that reviewed the
crisis in Kosovo and the situation in Bosnia.
	   The official said the allies welcomed the fact the elections
were ``free and fair'' and also the agreement of moderate Bosnian
Serb leaders to cooperate in democratic ballots.
	   The West has deployed a 35,000-strong peacekeeping force, led by
NATO, known as the Stabilization Force or SFOR, and invested
billions of dollars a year to help rebuild Bosnia.
	   But efforts to bring Serbs, Croats and Muslims together again
have shown little result.
	   The defense ministers acknowledged that peacekeepers still play
a vital role given factors slowing the drive to cement peace and
stability across Bosnia, said the NATO official. These include slow
progress on restructuring the police, the judiciary and the media,
and a far-behind-schedule return of refugees.
	   ``A lot of hard work is still needed. We can't allow a situation
where peace entirely depends on the presence of SFOR. We don't want
to create a dependence culture,'' the official said.
	   International officials are to conduct a six-month review of the
Bosnian peace process in the weeks ahead. It appeared unlikely that
the SFOR will be reduced dramatically.
	   ``The peace process remains dependent on the presence of a
substantial number of SFOR troops for now,'' said the NATO
official.

Government suspends plans to expand biological center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Supreme Court appeal by a small town mayor to
block the expansion of a scientific institute he believes could be
manufacturing biological weapons, successfully forced the hand of
the Israeli government Thursday, which suspended the project.
	   The institute is located near family homes in Nes Tsiona, a
bedroom community south of Tel Aviv.
	   Nes Tsiona filed suit in Israel's Supreme Court to stop the
expansion plan, charging that it would endanger the city's
residents, some of whom live only a few hundred meters (yards) from
the center.
	   Just before the court was to convene to decide on the appeal
Thursday, government attorneys agreed to suspend the expansion
project until a comprehensive environmental impact study is
completed.
	   Nes Tsiona spokesman Tsahi Braverman hailed the move and said it
would was likely to delay the expansion project for years.
	   The town filed the suit after Israeli newspapers, quoting
foreign reports, ran stories that the institute may be
manufacturing biological weapons.
	   Braverman said ``bacteria from the center, as reported in
foreign media, could endanger Israelis from Tel Aviv to Ashdod.''
That area includes half of Israel's population.
	   Braverman said the impact study will be conducted by Israel's
environment ministry and not the defense ministry, which is
sponsoring the expansion project. Also, government lawyers agreed
to allow Nes Tsiona officials to appear before a closed-door
committee that meets on defense facilities.
	   The city had asked the court to halt the project altogether, but
Braverman said the compromise was just as good.
	   ``As far as we're concerned, the survey can take 100 years,'' he
said.

Mortuary problems in Zimbabwe, fraud alleged at Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
University &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ As bodies rot in overcrowded mortuaries,
the Health Ministry appealed for funds to expand facilities, the
state-controlled Herald newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The ministry said 10 million Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 300,000) are
needed for the main hospital alone. It was designed to hold 30
corpses and recently accommodated more than 200, the paper said.
	   It said in one state hospital on the outskirts of Harare,
decomposing corpses recently were piled on top of each other and
blocked passageways and doors in the the mortuary building.
	   The newspaper said the rising death toll from AIDS worsened the
crisis. Economic hardships also prevented speedy funerals, with one
provincial hospital reporting corpses left unclaimed since
December.

	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Denmark, eager to promote transparency
in next year's national elections in Malawi, said Thursday it will
donate ballot boxes made of reinforced glass.
	   Danish embassy spokesman Bo Jensen said glass ballot boxes have
been used in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Uganda, and reduced
accusations of vote rigging.
	   Denmark will spend 50 million Malawi kwacha (dlrs 1.25 million)
on the boxes.
	   Malawi held its first democratic elections in 1994, ending three
decades of dictatorship under Kamuzu Banda.
	   ___
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A panel of lawmakers has recommended that
the former head of the main Zambia University and his deputy be
charged for alleged fraud and financial mismanagement at the Lusaka
campus.
	   Professor Andrew Siwela, fired from the post of vice-chancellor
in 1997, and deputy Jorry Mwenechanya invested more than 18 billion
kwacha (dlrs 90 million) of university money without authority, and
there was no reflection of any interest or dividends being paid to
the university, according to a report of the parliament's public
accounts committee presented to lawmakers.
	   It further alleged irregularities over the issue of shares for
an Internet service provider operated during Siwela's term of
office. About dlrs 125,000 in aid from the World Bank to help
launch ``Zamnet'' disappeared after being paid to the university
authorities.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Hundreds of people marched in an
African National Congress rally Thursday to call attention to crime
and terror in the area.
	   The marchers, led by ANC provincial leader Ebrahim Rasool,
visited a number of police stations. Memorandums were presented
calling for more police units in high-crime areas.
	   ``We need to show the criminals, gangsters and terrorists that
we are determined to have peace and stability in our communities,''
Rasool said.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Thursday urged African governments to reject using force for
political change, opening a high-level meeting on the continent.
	   Annan, addressing a meeting of foreign ministers represented on
the Security Council, noted that the last six months, fighting has
erupted between Eritrea and Ethiopia and within the Congo,
Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Lesotho and Sierra Leone.
	   ``What will it take for Africa's leaders finally to reject
military solutions to political challenges?'' Annan asked in a
prepared text.
	   ``When will the realization arrive that no one _ not a single
one _ of these conflicts can end in the absence of compromise,
tolerance and the peaceful resolution of disputes?''
	   The Security Council echoed Annan's appeal in a presidential
statement urging all African nations to ``settle their disputes by
peaceful rather than military means.''
	   It pledged a renewed commitment to help prevent conflicts on the
continent.
	   There was reason for hope, Annan said, in the case of Nigeria.
	   ``In this regard, I would like to express my hope that the
leadership of Nigeria will continue on the path to good governance
and the rule of law.''
	   President Abdulsalami Abubakar, who came to power after the
death in June of Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani Abacha,	   Abacha's five years in power were marked by rampant human rights
abuses, including the controversial execution of author and
environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.
	   Abubakar was to address the General Assembly later Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's largest opposition party rejected the
government's latest proposal on banking reform on Thursday, leaving
the two camps split despite pledges to cooperate to resolve the
nation's banking crisis.
	   Naoto Kan, leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, said his
party would not accept a ruling party plan to use 17 trillion yen
(dlrs 124 billion) in public money to protect depositors at banks
which must be nationalized.
	   Kan, speaking later after a gathering of senior party members,
said parts of the proposal were inconsistent with a ``basic
agreement'' on banking reform reached between the two sides last
Friday.
	   ``I would like them to bring something that is based upon our
agreement,'' Kan said. ``What is the point of having this meeting
if they keep bringing us things that go against the agreement?''
	   He didn't elaborate on which parts were inconsistent. But the
plan did not specify under what terms the public aid would be
provided _ terms that the opposition has demanded be accompanied by
more stringent disclosure requirements for failed banks.
	   The repudiation of the plan comes amid intense political
jockeying over the details of a vaguely-worded pact reached last
week to deal with a banking industry awash in about dlrs 1 trillion
of bad loans.
	   Earlier Thursday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, just back from
discussing Japan's banking woes with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
pledged to work out a compromise over the fate of the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., one of the country's largest
banks.
	   ``It's desirable to deal with it under a new framework,'' Obuchi
said in testimony before Parliament. He did not provide any
details.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, rumored to be on the verge of
insolvency, has taken center stage in the standoff with the
opposition over broader bank reform.
	   The government's latest proposal, a copy of which was provided
by opposition party officials, calls for putting the LTCB under
state control. But it contains no mention of what will ultimately
become of the bank.
	   The government seems determined not to let the LTCB fail
outright, citing the potential damage to confidence in the entire
banking system.
	   ``Failure of a major bank would have negative effect on and
create substantial costs for the economy,'' said Obuchi, who also
indicated his support for merging the LTCB with suitor Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Co.
	   But opposition lawmakers appear reluctant to sign onto a bailout
package which sets a precedent for sticking taxpayers with the
bill.
	   Japan's national broadcaster, NHK, cited internal LTCB documents
Thursday in a report which said three of the bank's affiliates have
1.1 trillion yen (dlrs 8 billion) in previously undisclosed
outstanding loans. The figure appeared likely to stoke concern over
the bank's hidden losses on soured financing deals.
	   The debate over the LTCB comes as the government has tried to
broker a deal with the opposition over a larger package of six
bills designed to revitalize the banking system by making it easier
for banks to rid themselves of bad loans.
	   But Parliament has been deadlocked as the debate rages over what
to do with troubled lenders which could face bankruptcy.
	   Another issue still separating the two sides is the
determination of exactly when Japan's powerful Finance Ministry
will relinquish its policy-planning and regulatory control over the
financial industry.
	   Also Thursday, the president of Sumitomo Trust and Banking
reportedly said it would be difficult to carry out any merger with
the LTCB by April, as had originally been proposed.
	   Speaking to reporters in Osaka, bank head Atsushi Takahashi said
the earliest he expects the merger to be realized is next July once
a financial watchdog agency completes its audit of the LTCB, Kyodo
News reported.
	   Sumitomo Trust has expressed its willingness to absorb the much
larger credit bank, but has refused to take on the LTCB's huge bad
loan burden.

U.N. Refugee Commissioner arrives in Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees arrived Thursday to discuss the worsening humanitarian
situation in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   Ogata is scheduled to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
later Thursday. During her three-day visit Ogata will visit Kosovo
and meet other Yugoslav officials, foreign aid workers and
diplomats.
	   Upward of 275,000 people have been displaced by seven months of
clashes in Kosovo where Serb-led government forces are fighting
ethnic Albanian separatists seeking to wrest the province from
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. Some 50,000 people are
believed to be camping out in Kosovo forests and hills, leading to
fears that many will die with the approach of winter.
	   Fearing a humanitarian catastrophe unless Milosevic halts
government attacks and allows the return of the displaced to their
homes, the U.N. Security Council and NATO are moving toward using
force to stop the Kosovo bloodshed.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Tens of thousands of screaming
supporters massed Thursday outside the offices of Istanbul's
pro-Islamic mayor, enraged by a prison sentence that could end his
future as one of the next leaders of Turkey's Islamic movement.
	   Authorities deployed armored personnel carriers near city hall
and blocked off the nearby highway with riot police to contain the
30,000-strong demonstration for Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
	   Erdogan and his supporters denounced Turkey's justice system, a
day after an appeals court upheld his 10-month sentence for
allegedly inciting religious hatred by reading a poem at a rally in
the southeastern city of Siirt last year.
	   ``This sentence has shaken the belief of millions of people in
justice,'' Erdogan told reporters, while supporters gathered
outside shouting slogans.
	   ``Tell us to die, we will die. Tell us to shoot, we will
shoot,'' his followers shouted.
	   ``My people will decide on my position in politics, not someone
else,'' Erdogan said, declaring his innocence and describing the
sentence as a political plot to prevent the rise of his Islamic
Virtue Party. ``The will of God will come true.''
	   Erdogan, 43, has two weeks to ask the appeals court to again
review the case. Appeals courts very rarely overturn their own
verdicts, however.
	   In accord with the sentence, Erdogan will be unseated as mayor
of Istanbul, Turkey's largest city with 10 million people, probably
before general and local elections in April.
	   The sentence means a lifetime ban from running for political
office.
	   Erdogan had hoped to take over the leadership of Virtue, the new
Islamic party formed to replace the Welfare party, which was closed
down by the Constitutional Court in February for anti-secular
activity.
	   Recai Kutan, the current leader of Virtue, called on the angry
supporters to calm down.
	   ``No doubt, these difficult days will end,'' Kutan said. ``We
will keep on going with patience and common sense.''
	   The protesters eventually left city hall without further
incident; no arrests were reported. On Wednesday, police swung
clubs to disperse hundreds of Erdogan supporters protesting the
verdict in downtown Istanbul.
	   Turkey's fiercely secular military was instrumental in outlawing
Welfare, and maintains pressure on the government to crack down on
perceived Islamic threats.

Ganassi operation new dynasty in CART
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Move over Roger Penske. Step aside Pat Patrick.
Make way Carl Haas. Chip Ganassi is looking for a little elbow room
among the giants of CART Indy-cars.
	   With great vision, a little luck and a dash of personal
sacrifice, the former Champ car driver has built his racing
operation into a dynasty.
	   His teams won the CART FedEx Series title with Jimmy Vasser in
1996, and the last two seasons with Alex Zanardi. Only Penske's
teams in 1981-83 had managed such success.
	   And Ganassi has been dominant. Vasser and Zanardi have combined
for 21 victories in 49 races since the start of the 1996 season.
	   Ganassi is proud of that accomplishment but a little sensitive
about a lack of recognition for building a powerhouse.
	   ``Show me somebody who's gone from seven employees to 77,'' he
said. ``Show me somebody who's gone from eighth place in the points
to three championships, somebody who's gone from 4 million dollars
in sponsorship to 20 million dollars.''
	   Ganassi, who never finished better than second in a driving
career that ended in 1986, first got a feel for winning in 1988. As
co-owner of Patrick Racing, he watched driver Emerson Fittipaldi
win the Indianapolis 500 and the PPG Cup title.
	   But Ganassi played only a minor role in that success.
	   He took sole ownership of the team the next season _ renamed it
Target-Chip Ganassi Racing _ and began building for the future.
	   Growth came slowly.
	   Arie Luyendyk gave Ganassi the Indy 500 pole in 1993, and
Michael Andretti won two races for him 1994. But the breakthrough
didn't come until 1996, when Ganassi brought in the virtually
unknown Zanardi to join the unheralded Vasser.
	   The two drivers liked each other immediately, bringing a new
chemistry to the team. Ganassi put the rest of the pieces in place
by giving them Reynard chassis, Honda engines and Firestone tires.
	   ``There's no magic to all this stuff,'' Ganassi said. ``It's
just hard work and perseverance.''
	   And sometimes he has to be tough on his staff. He's been
criticized for being too quick to jump on team members or fire
them.
	   ``I've let some good people go and I've made some people mad at
me,'' he said.
	   But Rob Hill, Zanardi's crew chief, has said one reason for the
team's success is that Ganassi usually stays in the front office
and lets his people do their jobs.
	   ``I have people from top to bottom in my organization who can do
the task,'' Ganassi said. ``I'll give you the tools and I expect
them to get the task done.''
	   Does Ganassi believe he can sustain this level of success,
especially with Zanardi leaving after this season for Formula One?
	   ``It used to be you would have the most powerful engine, the
superior chassis and the superior tires _ and that was enough,'' he
said. ``It's getting to the point where the driver is the most
important factor again.''
	   So, how will the departure of Zanardi affect the operation?
	   ``We'll miss Alex,'' Ganassi said. ``He's been good for our team
and he's become a good friend of mine. But Jimmy is staying, and
we'll find another good driver to replace Alex, just like we found
Alex.''
	   Although he is just as likely to again hire a low-profile
driver, Ganassi says some big names have shown interest in what is
probably the best ride in a very competitive series.
	   Ganassi admits he never expected to have this kind of success
and realizes that his dedication to achieve it has been costly.
	   ``The last three years probably have been the most exciting in
my life, but I've made a lot of personal sacrifices along the
way,'' he said. ``I enjoy the business to a degree that I'm not
afraid to make those sacrifices to it, but I've paid my toll on the
turnpike.''

Euro preparations, Russian crisis to dominate EU finance talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia's crisis, balancing budgets and
a threat to royal heads will be just some of the issues on the
table for this weekend's gathering of European finance ministers in
Vienna.
	   Meeting Friday and Saturday amid in the Hofburg Imperial Palace,
ministers from the 15 European Union nations know the crowded
agenda reflects a growing urgency to wrap up preparations for the
birth of Europe's common currency in less than 100 days.
	   Ministers from the 11 nations that adopt the euro on Jan. 1 are
under particular pressure to set a deadline for eradicating budget
deficits. Germany insists the drive for balanced budgets is
essential for a strong euro.
	   Talk at EU headquarters was that 2001 will be the target date
for balancing budgets, but some think that is optimistic in the
light of threats posed by the current world financial turmoil.
Budget deficits among the euro-zone nations are expected average
2.4 percent of gross domestic product this year.
	   The financial crisis gripping Russia, much of Asia and Latin
America will top the EU agenda on Saturday, when Michel Camdessus,
head of the International Monetary Fund, joins the meeting.
	   The EU is anxious that Russia shores up its ailing economy, but
like the IMF, it is unwilling to pour more money into Russia unless
the new government can map out coherent reform plans.
	   Camdessus will be interested to discover if the EU resolves a
squabble over who will speak for the euro-currency nations in
international bodies such as the IMF or the G-7 group of economic
powers.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn is expected to
propose the three euro-zone nations in the G-7 _ France, Germany
and Italy _ take turns to represent the whole bloc. Smaller nations
complain that gives too much influence to the big three.
	   The EU's other G-7 nation, Britain, has opted out of the euro
for now, but that has not stopped it becoming consumed with a
controversy about what the currency will look like.
	   Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is under pressure to
overturn a decision by the European Central Bank banning national
symbols _ such as the Queen's head _ from euro-banknotes.
	   Britain's eurosceptics are incensed and say they'll redouble
resistance to joining the monetary union.
	   ``The Queen's head is more than just an image on a banknote,''
said William Hague, leader of the opposition Conservative Party.
	   ``It is a symbol of Britain's heritage, our independence and our
ability to run our own affairs.''
	   On Sept. 11, the ECB reversed a decision to allow each euro-zone
nation a space for national symbols among the colorful designs of
bridges and doorways on the euro bills.
	   The royal heads of Europe will survive on euro coins. One side
will carry a map of the EU, the other is free for nations to choose
their own images.

Kosovo rebels say U.N. resolution is useless

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. resolution threatening further action to
stop the fighting in Kosovo is ``good for nothing,'' Swiss-based
representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army said Thursday.
	   Air attacks by NATO on Serb forces are the only possible
solution to prevent the conflict continuing in the province, said
KLA spokesman Mahmuti Bardhyl.
	   ``The international community has become a spectator of the
situation in the Balkans,'' Bardhyl said.
	   While not specifically mandating NATO action, the U.N. Security
Council resolution passed Wednesday opened the way for
international approval of involvement by the military alliance.
	   Bardhyl told reporters in Geneva the KLA wouldn't react to the
resolution because it didn't contain any punitive measure against
Serb forces.
	   ``As far as this resolution is concerned, we are of the opinion
that it is good for nothing,'' Jashar Salihu, another KLA spokesman
accompanying Bardhyl, said.
	   Bardhyl said the KLA would only respond to an appeal by the
international community to negotiate if the conflict is halted and
the Serb military arsenal is removed from Kosovo.
	   Both Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics which constitute
Yugoslavia, have rejected an ethnic Albanian proposal that Kosovo
becomes a third republic within the country.
	   Salihu said independence was the only solution the KLA would
accept. He refused to say how many soldiers the KLA had at its
disposal, but said the KLA had a limited number compared to the
Serbs.
	   Talking about the progress of the KLA's fight so far, Salihu
said ``it could be better, but we have done a lot of the job.''

NATO prepares for air strikes against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from U.S., German defense
officials, defense ministers condemning Milosevic, details. TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO began laying out detailed plans
for air strikes and cruise missile attacks on Yugoslavia on
Thursday to force President Slobodan Milosevic to end his offensive
against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   The 16-nation alliance issued an ``activation warning'' for
``limited'' and ``phased'' air strikes, meaning military chiefs are
now asking nations if they want to participate and what hardware
can they put at NATO's disposal.
	   There was no indication when the allies would move, but
officials said it could be in a matter of days. To date, only
Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal have publicly said they will
contribute some 30 jet fighters.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the move ``takes NATO
to an increased level of military preparedness.'' But he added that
the use of force will require further decisions by NATO
governments.
	   The war in the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up the vast majority of the population, has killed
hundreds of people and left almost 300,000 homeless, of whom 50,000
are camped out in the countryside.
	   NATO's latest plans were laid out at a meeting of NATO
ambassadors in the southern Portuguese resort town of Vilamoura.
	   At a meeting of NATO defense ministers, the allies unanimously
condemned Milosevic.
	   ``Belgrade is clearly conducting a war against its own people,''
said German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe.
	   U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Walter B. Slocombe told reporters
``the international community has run out of patience. ... We
expect any air campaign would be a phased campaign, the targets
would be military targets.''
	   For the first time, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _
three nations due to join NATO in April _ participated in the NATO
meetings.
	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
demanding a cease-fire in Kosovo and threatening further action if
fighting continues. It urged both sides to start negotiating and
demanded that Milosevic allow international monitoring in Kosovo
and the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO's targets would be across Yugoslavia and would include
communications facilities and radar installations.
	   The NATO allies were still struggling with whether the United
Nations must give final approval for military action by them.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen restated the U.S. view that
NATO needs no U.N. mandate to use force. Wednesday's resolution
already cited Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows for the
use of force if regional peace and security is threatened. It did
not explicitly authorize member states to intervene in Kosovo.
	   In the American view, the destabilizing effect that the Kosovo
crisis has on the Balkan region by unleashing a stream of hundreds
of thousands of refugees merits retaliation.
	   The U.N. resolution passed by a 14-0 vote with only China
abstaining in the Security Council. Although Russia went along,
Russian support for a military campaign remains uncertain.
	   France has been pushing hard for a U.N. mandate for military
action. In Germany, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe _ in
the heat of a general election campaign _ have disagreed publicly
on the issue.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Five passengers were treated in
hospital for neck and back injuries Thursday after two trams
collided on one of the Dutch capital's busiest tourist streets.
	   The accident happened when one tram braked hard to avoid hitting
a pedestrian, according to an Amsterdam police statement.
Passengers in a tram riding close behind on the same rails were
thrown to the floor when its driver was unable to stop in time to
avoid crashing into the tram in front.
	   Emergency services treated a further 12 passengers for minor
injuries sustained in the crash. Both trams were slightly damaged
in the late-morning crash on the Damrak, a street linking
Amsterdam's central railway station and the city's downtown.

Government minister says 20 detained in connection with bomb plot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan authorities are holding 20 people
in connection with a plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Kampala,
and the FBI was invited into the East African nation to help with
the investigation, a government minister said Thursday.
	   Regional cooperation minister Amama Mbabazi told a parliamentary
question-and-answer session that the FBI agents were invited to
Uganda following the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. diplomatic
missions in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania in which 259 people,
including 12 Americans, died.
	   ``It is true that the Ugandan government through security
services asked for and obtained services of the FBI for expertise
on bomb attacks which are beyond our capacity to handle,'' Mbabazi
said.
	   He said Ugandan intelligence officials had learned that the
group that carried out the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
also planned to attack the U.S. Embassy in Uganda. He said the
attack was averted by a security network was already in place.
	   Over the weekend, security officials said 18 people had been
arrested in connection with plans to hit American and Ugandan
targets in the country. It was not clear when the other two people
were detained.
	   Among those picked up was a Kampala businessman and the imam of
Kampala mosque. Many of those detained were said to be Somalis,
although it is not clear whether they had Ugandan nationality.
	   Mbabazi said the FBI did not take part in the detentions.
	   Unlike their counterparts in Kenya and Tanzania, many Ugandan
legislators have criticized the presence of U.S. investigators.
	   Ken Lukyamuzi said as a sovereign state, Uganda did not have to
use foreign security agents, particularly since Uganda does not
have an extradition treaty with the United States.
	   But Minister of State for Internal Affairs Col. William Omaria
urged legislators to support the government in fighting terrorism
and its call to the FBI.
	   ``FBI agents give us technical backup support,'' he said.
``Terrorism is a new phenomenon (in East Africa). It is an
international problem and we have to seek support from all
countries. We have to make sure that we protect people under all
conditions.''

Leeds coach could swap camps after Tottenham clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Leeds manager George Graham has a dilemma going
into Saturday's Premier League clash against Tottenham Hotspur _
this week's opposition could be next week's charges.
	   Graham confirmed Thursday he will be at the Leeds helm at White
Hart Lane on Saturday but reports linking him with a move to Spurs
to replace ousted coach Christian Gross are intensifying.
	   The 53-year-old Scotsman pledged his allegiance to Leeds this
week but he could move to Tottenham as early as next Wednesday,
after Leeds' second-leg UEFA Cup match against Maritimo.
	   Graham joined Leeds in September 1996 and recently signed a
five-year contract worth a reported 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.66
million) per year.
	   He previously steered Arsenal to two league championships and an
F.A. Cup title before serving a one-year ban imposed by the F.A.
after he was found guilty of accepting unauthorized payments from
player transfers.
	   Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar has stated he wants Graham to take
over at White Hart Lane and Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said an
approach by Tottenham would be considered by his board.
	   But as far as Graham is concerned, Saturday is business as
usual.
	   ``It's a match I'm looking forward to,'' he said. ``We've drawn
a few games away this season, so I'm looking for us to get back on
the winning trail again. I just want to see us get back to the
attacking form of last year.''
	   Leeds is in sixth place in the standings and is undefeated this
season with two wins and four draws.
	   Leeds fought out a scoreless tie with league leaders Aston Villa
last week, while Tottenham had a 1-1 tie with bottom-of-the-table
Southampton.
	   On Wednesday, Tottenham came from behind to score an
unconvincing 3-2 win over division three team Brentford in a League
Cup match.
	   The North London club is 13th in the league standings, with two
wins, a tie and three losses from six games.
	   In other Premier League matches Saturday, Aston Villa meets
Derby in a top-of-the-table match at Villa Park.
	   Derby moved into No. 2 with a 2-0 win over Leicester in round
six.
	   Villa is a clear leader in the standings but showed in the 0-0
tie with Leeds that it lacks the strikepower to be a genuine
championship contender this season.
	   Under-fire Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialla needs a win against
Middlesbrough at Stamford Bridge on Saturday to reverse the
negative reaction he has received to his player rotation scheme.
	   The Italian player-manager splashed out 12 million pounds (dlrs
19.92 million) on foreign players in the off-season but has been
forced to rotate players to give all his internationals a chance.
	   As a result, the defending European Cup Winners' Cup and League
Cup titlist has only won two of its five matches this season and is
languishing in the bottom half of the standings.
	   Danish international Brian Laudrup, an off-season signing along
with French World Cup star Marcel Desailly, Spaniard Albert Ferrer
and Italian Pierluigi Casiraghi, has already complained about not
getting enough playing time.
	   It was Chelsea's existing international stars who ensured the
Blues scored a 4-3 win over Blackburn in the sixth round Monday.
	   Norway's Tore Andre Flo came off the bench to score two late
goals to secure the result after Italian Gianfranco Zola opened the
scoring in the 15th minute and French World Cup player Frank
Leboeuf scored Chelsea's second goal through a 51st minute penalty.
	   Vialli will wait until match day to name his starting line-up.
	   Everton is expected to unveil new goalkeeper Steve Simonsen
against Blackburn Rovers at Goodison Park on Saturday.
	   The 19-year-old set a new domestic transfer record for a
goalkeeper when he signed from Tranmere for 3.3 million pounds
(dlrs 5.5 million) on Wednesday.
	   Everton, which has only notched one league win this season,
escaped with a 2-1 league cup win over division one leaders
Huddersfield on Wednesday to advance to the next round.
	   In other Premier League matches Saturday, defending F.A. Cup and
League double-titlist Arsenal will play Sheffield Wednesday,
Charlton will be at home to Coventry and Newcastle meets Nottingham
Forest.
	   In the only Premier League match Sunday, Leicester plays
Wimbledon. West Ham and Southampton clash on Monday to complete the
seventh round.
	   In Division One matches Saturday, league leader Hudderfield is
at home to Bolton, Sunderland travels to Portsmouth and Birmingham
City travels to Norwich.
	   In Scottish Premier Division, defending titlist Celtic plays
Hearts, Dunfermline is at home to Rangers, Dundee takes on
Motherwell and St. Johnstone plays Dundee United.

Russian crisis looms large as world business leaders meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes and information &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX BANDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ World business leaders gave Hungary top
marks Thursday for its transition to a market economy. But the
leaders of the former Soviet bloc country warned that Russia's
crisis might dent Hungary's success.
	   ``The main topic of our talks was how the Russian crisis affects
our respective countries,'' said Hungarian President Arpad Goencz
after his meeting with Aleksander Kwasniewski, his Polish
counterpart and a keynote speaker at a forum organized by the
American ``Fortune'' magazine.
	   Ronald Freeman, co-Chief Executive of Salomon Smith Barney, said
Hungary was the ``most successful'' of the 26 countries that form
the post-Soviet region, adding: ``It is important that investors
realize Hungary is not Russia.''
	   The Hungarian stock exchange has taken a severe beating in
recent weeks, with western investors withdrawing at least dlrs
three billion as nervousness over Russia's financial and economic
crisis spilled over to its former Soviet bloc allies.
	   United States Ambassador Peter Tufo told the gathering late
Wednesday that ``the current Russian financial crisis has colored
investors' perspectives. Some wrongly view the region as one
market.''
	   Also Wednesday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged the
more than 100 company chief executives attending the forum to
maintain trust in Hungary.
	   Hungary, which turned from communism to democracy in 1990, is
``in the final stage of rejoining western Europe,'' he told
participants. ``You are the main actors of this final stage of the
breakaway from the past.''
	   Among those at the meeting are Kwasniewski; ex-President Fidel
V. Ramos of the Philippines; former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger; Juergen Schrempp, Daimler-Benz; James Dimon, Salomon
Smith Barney; Anthony Burns, Ryder System, Inc., and Kim Woo-Choong
of Daewoo group,

	   VASILEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Yugoslav jets swooped overhead,
frightened Kosovo civilians streamed southward Thursday, trying to
escape a Serb police and Yugoslav army offensive which has trapped
hundreds of ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   Artillery boomed across the central Drenica region of the
Serbian province, and Serb police sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they split the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army
forces by taking over a main road that passes through the last
stronghold of Kosovo Albanian resistance.
	   Pristina's Serb-controlled Media Center said police had ``closed
the ring around strong groups of Albanian extremists,'' destroying
their bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   The offensive eased later in the day, but it was impossible to
determine whether that had occurred in response to new signs of
U.N. and NATO determination to stop the bloodshed.
	   A U.N. Security Council warning Wednesday threatened further
action unless the fighting stopped. While not specifically
mandating NATO action, the resolution opened the way for
international approval of involvement by the military alliance.
	   NATO ambassadors meeting in Portugal approved increased planning
Thursday for air strikes in Kosovo. NATO will begin asking military
commanders to identify participating countries and the kind of
weapons they will put at NATO's disposal.
	   The risk to refugees facing the harsh Balkan winter is driving
Western efforts to get a commitment from Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end the government offensive and permit mass
refugee returns.
	   On the ground here in Kosovo, the situation appeared ever more
desperate for Albanian rebels and civilians alike. Small groups of
frightened, exhausted rebels hid in the bushes as civilians walked
past.
	   About every 20 minutes, Yugoslav jets streaked overhead,
apparently on reconnaissance missions. Refugee children would pick
up sticks and pretend to fire guns at the planes.
	   Several refugees stopped to ask reporters whether NATO was
coming soon to stop the fighting.
	   ``All of our houses were burned,'' said Kaytaz Hysni, 59. ``Even
our bread was inside.''
	   A rebel commander, who gave his name only as Milushi, said Serb
police had arrested about 200 Albanian men of military age and were
holding them at a factory. He insisted they were all civilians.
	   ``They steal their things, burn their houses and then take them
hostage,'' Milushi said.
	   A 23-year-old KLA fighter, who said he left a factory job in
Germany four months ago to join the rebels, said Serb forces had
them cornered and there was no escape.
	   ``They are there, there and there,'' he said, pointing to three
hilltops. ``We can't leave. We'll only live if we win or if NATO
threatens Milosevic to stop.''
	   In Vilamoura, Portugal, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said the Alliance was moving ``to an increased level of military
preparedness'' without actually approving the use of force.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   But an aide to the chief Albanian political leader in Kosovo,
Ibrahim Rugova, said U.N. and NATO moves may have already come too
late.
	   ``The resolution is a good step, but it came too late because
half of Kosovo is already destroyed and burned,'' the aide, Enver
Maljoku, said. ``I don't think Milosevic will take this message
from the U.N. seriously, and I'm afraid that he'll have enough time
to destroy the other half of Kosovo too.''
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.''
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   Ethnic Albanians _ 90 percent of Kosovo's population _ are
overwhelmingly in favor of independence. World powers back autonomy
for Kosovo instead, arguing that independence can be achieved only
through prolonged, and spreading, bloodshed.

Government suspends deportations after Nigerian woman's death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with report one policemen already
sanctioned in earlier incident. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Belgian government Thursday
suspended the deportation of asylum seekers from Brussels
international airport in response to an outcry a Nigerian woman
died after a struggle with police.
	   Two policemen have been charged with assault in Tuesday's death
of Semira Adamu, a 20-year-old woman who resisted police efforts to
get her on a Togo-bound plane. Police subdued her by putting a
pillow on her face. She lapsed into a coma and died afterwards.
	   One of the two policemen charged was sanctioned last year for
kicking an asylum seeker being deported, said police spokeswoman
Els Cleemput.
	   He had been put on non-active duty for one month and was removed
from deportation duty for seven months.
	   Since he was reintegrated in the service, he was always
supervised and videotaped during deportation operations, Cleemput
said. She pointed out he was not the man holding the pillow on
Adamu's face.
	   Cleemput said a pillow was only used twice last year to subdue
deportees. But this year resistance from deportees had increased
and the police had to use the practice a dozen times already. It
was the first serious incident involving a pillow.
	   On Thursday, the police union called on its members to refuse
cooperation in any forced expulsion of asylum seekers. Police at
Brussels international airport held a go-slow protest action,
delaying passport clearance.
	   Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her
family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has
three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her
refugee status.

Inventors show strange wares at London fair

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Next time you go for a haircut, shouldn't you find
a stylist who does the job with sharp glass instead of scissors?
	   Frank Bisson thinks so.
	   ``This is not just hairdressing _ this is pure art,'' Bisson
said Thursday as he showed off the ``glass-cutting technique for
hair'' on the opening day of the London International Inventors
Fair.
	   The glass cutting piece, placed on the end of a handle that
looks like an old ink pen, has more sharp edges than scissors or
razors, which Bisson says allows for better sculpting of a hair
style that won't require mousses, gels or hairspray.
	   ``We just wash it, shake it and there you go,'' Bisson said. The
process is safe, he insists, while acknowledging anything that can
cut hair can also cut fingers.
	   It remains to be seen whether glass haircutting, or any of the
other 200 inventions on display, can make it commercially.
	   Among the other gadgets: Talking toilets for children, little
fans that blow away the tear-inducing smell of onions without
scattering the peelings around the kitchen and a cat flap that
sprays your pet with flea killer when it walks in.
	   But what will the cat think about getting doused?
	   ``It gets used to it very quickly, particularly if the food is
on the other side,'' said Phyl Cooke, hoping to drum up business
for The Hobbs Cat Flap.
	   Not all of the inventors are English and not all are a bit mad,
although one wore a purple gown that would suit Merlin the
Magician.
	   The Zagreb Inventors Association of Croatia says it has come up
with a better traffic light _ a model said to improve safety
because it flashes numbers to show pedestrians how many seconds
they have to cross.
	   Liz Juniper brought little tubes of a product called Runaway,
which stops runs in women's hosiery from getting worse. Women have
done the same thing for decades with nail polish, but Runaway is
clear so there's no problem of having red polish on black hose _ or
vice versa.
	   ``It's an embarrassment preventer for women,'' Juniper said.
``It's not going to save the tights. You're going to have to throw
them away anyway.''
	   The inventions will be graded by a panel of judges whose main
criteria is their likely commercial success.
	   ``There are some very good inventions here that I am absolutely
certain we are going to see in the market soon,'' said Paul
Ambridge, the chief judge and chairman of Britain's Institute of
Patentees and Inventors. ``There are a large number of inventions
around here that would never see the light of day in shops.''
	   Being a discreet judge, Ambridge would not publicly identify the
turkeys.
	   ``No way am I going to quote you that,'' he said.

Jordan's parliament votes confidence in new government, criticizes
</HEADLINE>
Israel &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's parliament gave a strong vote of
confidence Thursday to the new Cabinet, but many legislators urged
the government slow any new ties to Israel under the peace treaty
negotiated by the new prime minister.
	   The 23-member Cabinet of Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh received
a resounding 64 votes in the 80-member Chamber of Deputies.
	   The vote in effect installs the Cabinet, appointed by King
Hussein on Aug. 20, a day after the previous government resigned
amid a public outcry over polluted drinking water and accusations
that it had misled the country about economic growth.
	   A unified statement by 53 deputies from both hard-line and
moderate blocs urged the government to cease a drive for normal
ties with Israel because of its ``egotistic and intransigent''
policies.
	   In response, Tarawneh said he was committed to the 1994 peace
treaty and vowed to use Jordan's good relations with Israel to help
move forward Israel's negotiations with other Arabs, namely Syria,
Lebanon and the Palestinians.
	   The statement against normalization with Israel reflects
widespread dissatisfaction with the peace treaty, which failed to
bring the economic benefits forecast to result from making peace
with the Jewish state.
	   Tarawneh, 50, is a liberal who served as ambassador to the
United States three years ago and led the Jordanian team that
negotiated the treaty with Israel.
	   Twelve lawmakers voted against the Cabinet, two abstained, and
one was absent. The speaker did not cast a ballot under
parliamentary bylaws.
	   The ballot followed three days of debate on the Cabinet. More
than 40 lawmakers _ some speaking for parliamentary blocs _ took
the podium to call for improved living conditions, fighting poverty
and unemployment, and more open policies and public freedoms.
	   Tarawneh promised improved economic performance by attracting
more investments to create jobs for Jordanians, privatizing state
firms and introducing a five-year development plan in accordance
with reforms launched after cash crisis in 1989.
	   He pledged to fight corruption, nepotism and bureaucratic
delays, to open the government to public scrutiny, and to study
calls for launching a center for training Jordanian civil servants.

Interpol chief: Internet crime caught law enforcers flat-footed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's governments and police forces were
caught unawares by burgeoning crime on the Internet and still are
trying to catch up, the head of the international police
organization said Thursday.
	   ``We were not ready for the extent to which this whole
phenomenon mushroomed,'' said Raymond Kendall, secretary-general of
Interpol. ``Many of our governments were not prepared for it
either.''
	   Police agencies lacked the specialists to track the problem and
have only recently begun to train officers, he said. There still
are no global agreements to handle the problem.
	   ``It's not even clear that if there were that they could be
effective in dealing with the problem,'' Kendall told reporters
during a two-day business conference organized by the International
Chamber of Commerce.
	   He said national laws can be used when criminals used the
Internet for traditional forms of crime in the same country.
	   The international chamber, meanwhile, announced that it is
setting up a special unit to combat cybercrime by emphasizing
prevention _ issuing warnings about criminal methods and scams and
training specialists.
	   ``The incidence of cybercrime will grow, at least in line with
the increase in the number of new Internet sites and users,'' said
Eric Ellen, who will oversee the unit.
	   ``Its big attraction for the criminal is that it can be
committed anonymously and far from the victim,'' Ellen said.
``Losses can be significant.''
	   Leading industrial countries have defined the five main areas of
cybercrime as sexual exploitation of children, drug trafficking,
money laundering, electronic fraud and political espionage.
	   Ellen said fraud on the Internet included nondelivery of items
purchased, charges for supposedly free services, pyramid sales and
get-rich-quick investment schemes.
	   Bryan M. Jenkins, a consultant who has advised the White House
and the international chamber on the issue, said the Internet aids
the criminal in the same way it helps small businesses _ by giving
it the extra muscle of a much larger enterprise.
	   The danger can be greatly exaggerated, Jenkins said. ``Computer
crackers may never hijack the world's banking system and hold
governments to ransom except in the movies.''
	   But, he added, ``the threat of cybercrime is nonetheless real
and it could reach truly alarming proportions.''

 &UR; NATO readies air strikes on Yugoslavia &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) - NATO issued instructions to its
generals Thursday to begin preparations for air strikes on
Yugoslavia unless President Slobodan Milosevic ends his attacks on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The big question is whether the tough
Yugoslav president will be impressed.
	   The difference between Thursday's action and previous hard words
aimed at Milosevic is the tone and the timing, NATO officials said.
A tough U.N. resolution Wednesday combined with a NATO ``activation
warning'' Thursday for air operations takes the 16-nation alliance
to the brink of shooting.
	   ``We expect any air campaign would be a phased campaign,'' said
Walter B. Slocombe, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy,
accompanying Defense Secretary William Cohen here for a meeting of
NATO defense ministers.
	   ``The targets would be military targets,'' he said. ``Very, very
effective and very, very strong blows would be aimed at the very
instruments that Milosevic is using to carry out this repression.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the ``activation
warning'' from the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking
body, was for both ``a limited air option and a phased air campaign
in Kosovo.''
	   That action, he said, takes NATO ``to an increased level of
military preparedness.'' He stressed, however, that further
decisions were required before the alliance unleashes any strikes.
	   Milosevic's massive attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in
Kosovo have continued unabated despite previous NATO threats. His
seven-month crackdown on separatists fighting for the independence
of Kosovo has claimed hundreds of lives and forced as many as
275,000 people from their homes.
	   Previous threats of military action have failed to persuade
Milosevic to mend his ways, and the latest saber-rattling from the
alliance did not appear to have slowed his onslaught against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which is the principal
state in the Yugoslav federation.
	   ``Belgrade is clearly conducting a war against its own people,''
said German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. ``Pictures of people
camping out in the open ... are in themselves an ultimatum'' to
Milosevic.
	   Slocombe said Thursday's NATO action signaled ``that the
international community has run out of patience with his action in
Kosovo.''
	   ``What the action by the alliance does is to position the
alliance to act very quickly,'' he said.
	   The call for a cessation of hostilities goes to both sides.
	   ``All of the blame for this war does not entirely rest with the
Serbian side,'' Slocombe said.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe, has
already surveyed the assets he will need for strikes on Yugoslavia.
Now, under the activation warning, he will be asking for specific
commitments.
	   A number of countries spoke up in Thursday's ministerial meeting
and said they would participate, according to Slocombe. None said
they would not.
	   NATO, which has no military assets of its own except for some
communications hardware and airborne warning and control aircraft,
does have access to a wide array of equipment from the national
armies of 15 members - Iceland has no military force. And the three
candidate members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, who will
be welcomed into the NATO fold next April, have said they are
prepared to participate in the Kosovo operation.
	   Four months ago, passions were high at NATO. Foreign ministers
meeting in Luxembourg issued a tough statement threatening action.
But those passions cooled as many questioned what could be
accomplished by direct military intervention. Now, however, as
winter approaches and the photos of cold, hungry displaced people
are on front pages around the world, the international community is
once again feeling pressure to do something.

Celebrities stream to Slovakia to stump for ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Slovakia-Elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Locked in a tight election race,
Slovakia's ruling party is calling on Europe's rich and famous to
help it retain power in the parliamentary vote Friday and Saturday.
	   Model Claudia Schiffer, actors Gerard Depardieu and Claudia
Cardinale, race car driver Paul Belmondo _ now Ornella Muti has
joined the parade of celebrities to come stump for the Movement for
a Democratic Slovakia.
	   The governing party, headed by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar,
has come in for criticism across the political spectrum for the
costly promotions, the fees for which it insists didn't come out of
state coffers.
	   That didn't stop it from trotting out one more star on election
eve Thursday, Italian actress Muti. Nor did the fact that her
appearance apparently violated the ban on campaigning during the
last 48 hours before the balloting.
	   Muti, considered one of Italy's most beautiful and elegant
women, was escorted by the premier to the opening of a Bratislava
hospital ward for children with cancer, then taken to see a folk
dance group.
	   The most ballyhooed of this month's visitors was Schiffer, who
said the 56-year-old Meciar reminded of her father, who ``also is a
lawyer.'' Independent radio Twist reported that Schiffer's visit
cost five million crowns (dlrs 143,000).
	   ``Meciar's party is spending a lot of money to invite foreign
stars. But people are not going to deceived by his celebrities,''
said the leader of the largest opposition party, Mikulas Dzurinda,
who hopes to replace Meciar as prime minister.

Ukrainian retirees trade unreceived pensions for food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The millions of Ukrainian pensioners who
are owed tremendous sums in social payments can now envy their
counterparts in a small town in eastern Ukraine.
	   Authorities in Valky, in the Kharkiv region, organized a fair
last week at which local pensioners could obtain food as
compensation for the pensions they were owed, the daily Fakty
reported Thursday.
	   The fair was a pleasant reward for some 3,000 people who were
able to choose among pork, beef, milk, sugar, flour and other goods
provided by enterprises that owe money to the state pension fund.
	   The vast majority of retired people throughout Ukraine have not
seen their pensions for months. The former Soviet republic has
consistently failed to implement reforms needed to increase budget
revenues and allow financing of social programs.
	   The fair in Valky, which was duplicated in 13 other towns in the
Kharkiv region, followed a massive but unsuccessful government
campaign against the largest pension fund debtors.
	   Despite threats to severely punish the indebted enterprises, the
total debt to the pension fund has remained virtually unchanged at
some 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 900 million) since authorities began
the crackdown last month.

Christian Democratic leader resigns

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Josef Lux, chairman of the
opposition Christian Democratic Party, has resigned Thursday from
all his posts for health reasons, CTK news agency reported.
	   Speaking at a press conference, Lux said he suffers from chronic
leukemia and doctors are looking for suitable donors of bone
marrow.
	   He will be temporarily replaced in his position of party
chairman and parliamentary faction leader by vice-chairman Jan
Kasal before a new election takes place, CTK reported.
	   The center-right Christian Democrats also known as the People's
Party control a total of 20 seats in the country's 200-seat
legislature, one of the two smallest parties in Parliament.
	   Lux, 42, was party chairman since 1990.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement,
who lay in a coma for a week after suffering an allergic reaction
to anesthesia, is able to speak again after being taken off a
respirator, hospital officials said Thursday.
	   The 59-year-old Chevenement, who suffered cardiac arrest before
undergoing gall bladder surgery Sept. 2, ``continues to improve,''
a Defense ministry statement said.
	   Officials at the Val de Grace military Hospital in Paris said
Chevenement regained consciousness and ``has resumed normal
elocution... Assisted respiration is no longer necessary.''
	   But Chevenement was still in intensive care and on dialysis, a
technique used to remove waste products from the blood when the
kidneys no longer work properly.
	   The statement said Chevenement's kidneys were ``damaged'' by the
pre-operative allergic shock he suffered when doctors administered
the anesthesia, which was based on curare.
	   The government has named as interim interior minister, Jean-Jack
Queyranne, the deputy minister for overseas territories. The
Interior Ministry is responsible for the nation's police and
security forces.
	   Chevenement has held several ministry portfolios, including
defense, industry, education, and resigned as defense minister in
1991 to protest France's involvement in the Gulf War.

Kohl firmly rejects possibility of grand coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl quote on coalition, announces lower economic
growth figures &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl vehemently rejected on
Thursday the notion of his party sharing power with the opposition
Social Democrats in a ``grand coalition'' after Sunday's national
election.
	   With the two parties running neck-and-neck in the polls, Kohl
had said Wednesday that a grand coalition was ``possible in
principle,'' a comment that had suggested the chancellor might be
softening his stance.
	   But in another television interview Thursday, he called the
grand coalition idea ``a Chimera'' from the Social Democrats to
distract voters from their real intention: forming a government
with the environmentalist Greens.
	   Analysts for weeks have predicted a grand coalition as the
natural outcome of the vote, with public opinion almost equally
divided between the two parties. Kohl's Christian Democrats have
closed in on the Social Democrats to within 2 percentage points,
according a Campo-Data survey published Thursday that reviewed
recent polling.
	   The survey gave 40.5 percent of the vote to Schroeder's party,
compared to 38.6 percent for the chancellor's.
	   Schroeder's diminishing lead _ he led by up to 12 percentage
points last spring _ comes at a time of increasing international
turmoil, with economic crises in Asia and Russia and political
crisis in the United States.
	   Kohl told his television interviewer Thursday that the global
financial turmoil also would be felt at home. He announced German
economic growth would be lower than government projections from
early this year _ 2.7 percent in 1998 and ``around 2.5 percent'' in
1999, compared with the earlier figures of between 2.7 percent and
2.9 percent in 1998 and 3 percent next year.
	   Kohl, who after 16 years in power is seeking an unprecedented
fifth term, has stressed his status as a respected statesman
compared to the relative inexperience of Schroeder, the governor of
Lower Saxony state.
	   While Schroeder has supported a grand coalition all along, he
now hints his party could accept being the junior member of a
coalition led by Kohl's party.
	   ``The statement that all democratic parties must remain open to
any kind of coalition certainly is valid without any
preconditions,'' Schroeder told national ZDF television on Tuesday.

Romanian president blames the government for slow reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ President Emil Constantinescu strongly
criticized the government Thursday for failing to reform Romania's
limping economy and urged action to reverse the trend.
	   ``The government endlessly comes out with words such as reform
and restructuring which almost have lost all meaning,''
Constantinescu said during a student graduation ceremony.
	   He spoke one day after dismissed Finance Minister Daniel Daianu,
saying he hadn't done enough to retool the economy along market
lines, and it indicated more ministers may soon lose their jobs.
	   Constantinescu called on the government to urgently adopt a
``clear strategy'' for reforming the economy and stop ``cheap,
populist'' slogans.
	   Although reformists won elections almost two years ago,
promising to reform the economy along western lines, purchasing
power has slumped and the national currency is overvalued,
discouraging exports and foreign investment.
	   Only dlrs 3.6 billion of foreign money has poured into Romania
since 1989, when communism ended, a small amount compared to other
former communist countries.
	   Foreign and domestic investors have also been frustrated by
political bickering and bureaucracy.

Micronesia focused on environment, nuclear concerns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Nuclear tests and the threat of rising sea
levels that could drown their low-lying countries are among the
main concerns of Micronesia and other South Pacific island nations,
Micronesia's president said Thursday.
	   ``One issue that received a great deal of attention at this
year's (South Pacific) Forum Summit was that of global climate
change, and in particular, the risk of sea-level brought on or
hastened by human activities affecting the atmosphere,'' Jacob Nena
told the U.N. General Assembly.
	   The Forum includes Micronesia and 15 other states: Australia,
Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau,
Papua New Guinea, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga,
Tuvalu and Vanuatu.
	   The Pacific island states, some of them lying only one or two
meters (3 to 6 feet) above sea level, fear they could be wiped out
by rising ocean levels caused by global warming.
	   Another environmental concern is ``the continuing practice by
industrialized powers to ship radioactive wastes back and forth
through our economic zones ... irrespective of our strenuous and
continuing protests,'' Nena said.
	   The island nations ``could not help but note with alarm'' the
recent nuclear testing by neighboring rivals India and Pakistan,
Nena said.
	   ``It will be recalled that the region encompassed by the Forum
members has perhaps greater standing than any other region in the
world to express alarm over continuing testing of nuclear
devices,'' Nena said.
	   Britain and the United States conducted nuclear tests in the
region in the 1950s and France continued to do so until 1996.
	   ``The Forum members have endured and continue to endure the
human suffering that has resulted from the curse of nuclear
proliferation and testing,'' Nena said.
	   France exploded at least 123 nuclear bombs in the volcanic rock
underneath Mururoa Atoll between 1975 and 1996 and eight under
nearby Fangataufa Atoll.
	   France has maintained the tests caused no lasting harm.
	   But Australia and New Zealand, as well as several tiny
island-states claimed atomic tests could have harmed the fragile
environment.
	   In 1996, France announced it would stop nuclear tests, sign the
nuclear test ban treaty, and return the islands to the civil
authorities of French Polynesia in pristine condition by 1998.
	   In his speech, Nena also praised plans by the French territory
of New Caledonia to hold a referendum Nov. 8 on an agreement that
could lead to independence for the South Pacific territory.
	   It comes after years of violence and negotiations over the
status of New Caledonia, which holds about 30 percent of the
world's nickel reserves.
	   France views New Caledonia as a strategic political and economic
asset in the Pacific, and has controlled it for almost 150 years.

 &UR; Election results again postponed, Serb moderates strengthen
coalition &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Moderate Bosnian Serb
leaders agreed Thursday to strengthen their coalition in the face
of an expected victory for the hard-line presidential candidate,
while final election results were delayed for a third time.
	   Initial tallies from Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 election indicate that
hard-liner Nikola Poplasen will succeed U.S.-backed incumbent
Biljana Plavsic as Bosnian Serb president.
	   Officials had promised preliminary results for Tuesday and final
tallies for Thursday.
	   But technical problems forced the results to be postponed for at
least another day, said Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
overseeing the elections.
	   A Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said
Poplasen was about 40,000 votes ahead of Plavsic early Thursday,
with some 4,000 ballots to be counted.
	   A Poplasen victory is seen as a serious setback to Western
efforts to unite the country's disparate ethnic groups after the 3
1/2-year war that ended with the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
	   The peace plan divided Bosnia into two entities, a Serb republic
and a Muslim-Croat federation. The Serb republic also voted for the
president of its entity.
	   Thursday's agreement by the moderates, signed in the Bosnian
Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, envisages a joint platform among
coalition partners Plavsic, Socialist Zivko Radisic _ poised to win
the Serb seat in Bosnia's three-member presidency _ and incumbent
prime minister Milorad Dodik.
	   The agreement ``provides for the continuation of democratic
processes our coalition started, as well as economic progress and
social well-being,'' Radisic told news conference.
	   While seen as an attempt by the moderates to sideline Poplasen,
a supporter of No. 1 indicted war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic,
the agreement will have little political significance until the
Bosnian Serb parliament is constituted.
	   Although the president is responsible for nominating the prime
minister _ expected to be a hard-liner if Poplasen should take
office _ the 83-seat parliament has to approve the nomination with
at least 42 votes.
	   Speaking in Sarajevo, the top U.S. envoy to the Balkans Robert
Gelbard said he hoped Dodik and his government would continue.
Gelbard also warned Poplasen against nominating a hard-liner as
prime minister.
	   While Gelbard said the elections seemed so far to be free and
fair, he said Poplasen's history and that of his party ``give us
very little or no reason for optimism.''
	   Poplasen and his party have made no secret of their desire for
an ethnically pure Serb state that would secede from Bosnia and
join neighboring Serbia.

	   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Wednesday in his
General Assembly speech that his country was ready to adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, even as he warned that compliance
would depend on whether rival India resumed its tests.
	   Vajpayee said India conducted its nuclear tests in May because
of the ``deteriorating security environment which has obliged us to
stand apart from the CTBT in 1996.''
	   Now that India's security interests are settled, India wants to
continue to cooperate with the international community and is in
discussions with key countries on a range of issues, including the
CTBT.
	   ``We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful
conclusion, so that the entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed
beyond September 1999,'' Vajpayee said in the text.

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ A hand transplant by surgeons using advanced
medical technology is raising new hope for victims of accidents,
land mines and birth defects, doctors said Thursday.
	   A team led by French and Australian doctors grafted a donor's
hand on an Australian businessman's arm Wednesday night in the
first known hand transplant in years. The coming weeks will
determine if his body will accept it.
	   In a painstaking 13-hour operation, the right hand and forearm
of the anonymous donor was attached to the arm of the 48-year-old
Australian man, whose own hand was amputated in 1989 after an
accident, Edouard Herriot Hospital in the French city of Lyon said
in a statement.
	   ``It gives hope to all those who are victims of domestic or work
accidents, anti-personnel mines, or have congenital deformations,''
Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, a co-head of the transplant team, told
French TV.
	   In the operation, the team attached ``all the arteries, veins,
nerves, tendons, muscles and skin after setting the two bones of
the forearm,'' the hospital statement said.
	   The patient was identified as an Australian businessman, France
2 television reported, adding it would take 12 to 18 months of
therapy for him to regain full use of the hand.
	   The operation was the result of recent advances in microsurgery
and transplant techniques, said the hospital. Doctors now assess
the chances of long-term success at 50-50.
	   The French hospital beat a Louisville, Kentucky team that was
planning such a transplant before the end of the year. A transplant
candidate was being sought there.
	   While the Lyon hospital billed the transplant as a first, it had
been done before. Doctors in Ecuador tried in the 1960s, but the
patient's body rejected the hand after two weeks.
	   Such a transplant, however, faces serious risks. Patients must
take anti-rejection drugs that can be potentially fatal, as they
suppress the immune system to keep the body from trying to destroy
the foreign tissue. That could also raise the risk of infection,
cancer and even death.
	   Doctors hope that this time, with new anti-rejection drugs, the
Australian patient's body would not reject the foreign hand.
	   Other key problems are nerve regeneration to allow sensation. A
transplant patient may never regain feeling of hot and cold in
their new hand.
	   The director of the UCLA Hand Center in Los Angeles, Neil Jones,
said in an interview last month that he didn't think transplant
research among animals so far ``allows us to move into the realm of
human application.''
	   Head of transplant surgery at the Lyon hospital, Dubernard
co-led the team with Earl Owen, director of the Center for
Microsurgery in Sydney, Australia.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A man pulled a knife during a murder
trial Thursday and threatened a witness he apparently thought was

	   ``We expect that other countries ... will adhere to this treaty

	   Sharif and Vajpayee met for nearly two hours Wednesday but

dispute that took a perilous turn after the tests.
	   Vajpayee said there would be further talks on Kashmir when the
foreign secretaries of both sides meet in Pakistan for a three-day
meeting beginning Oct. 15.
	   Wednesday's meeting between the two leaders was the second since
their nuclear tests.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over the
disputed state of Kashmir _ in the 51 years since the two states
gained independence from Britain.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The international press goes where
the action is. And that's one reason Malaysian authorities don't
want them here.
	   The government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad believes the
foreign reporters, photographers and television news crews that
have descended on Malaysia during the past week to cover an
unprecedented challenge to his 17-year rule are not neutral, but
are rooting for his overthrow.
	   ``Do you want a repeat of Jakarta here? Well, the foreign press
would have a field day,'' national police chief Abdul Rahim Noor
said Thursday during what he described as ``a different kind of
press conference.''
	   He told one British reporter to ``shut up'' and threatened to
evict him, accused foreign journalists of exaggerating the extent
of recent pro-reform rallies, and finally said he would take no
more questions from the foreign media.
	   When reporters mention that Mahathir is Asia's longest-governing
leader now that Indonesia's President Suharto has been overthrown,
the Malaysian establishment interprets that as meaning the
journalists would like to see it happen again, because it would be
a good story.
	   ``They come hoping to see the fall of Dr. Mahathir,'' said
Rohaizad A. Rahim, in a Thursday commentary printed in The Star, a
pro-Mahathir newspaper. ``Many of these foreign reporters continue
to see similarities between the situation in Malaysia and that in
Indonesia.''
	   Mahathir suggested earlier this year that Malaysians who speak
to foreign reporters are being disloyal to their country.
	   The theme that the foreign press is trying to make Malaysia look
bad has been echoed by others since Mahathir fired his former
deputy and finance minister on Sept. 2. The deputy, Anwar Ibrahim,
has since launched an unprecedented series of nationwide rallies.
	   ``Freedom of speech includes the freedom to tell lies. We accept
that,'' Mahathir said Thursday when CNBC Asia, a regional
television network, broadcast a home video Anwar had made before
his arrest.
	   As the crowds grew, and Anwar's attacks on Mahathir became
sharper, more international journalists arrived to cover the
phenomenon. The local press covered Anwar less and less.
	   The Anwar phenomenon peaked, embarrassingly for Mahathir, during
a visit of Queen Elizabeth II and the staging of the Commonwealth
Games Asia for the first time.
	   Officials were furious when TV crews tried to transmit footage
of the last big Anwar rally, and subsequent police use of tear gas
and water cannon to disperse the crowds.
	   Information ministry officials pulled the plug on the
transmissions, and only relented after British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook and others of high rank protested the censorship. Since
then, foreign broadcasters have been told they will have to find
private satellite link providers for footage that shows Malaysia in
a negative light.
	   Malaysian authorities acted quickly to smother the protest
movement.
	   They arrested 170 people, detained Anwar and a dozen other
leaders under a security law that allows indefinite custody, and
prohibited Anwar's wife from giving public speeches.
	   In the process, they inflicted very few injuries and no deaths,
despite the dramatic film footage.
	   Within the government, there is disappointment that the story,
and the reporters, haven't gone away. They still show up at Anwar's
house, and at the court, awaiting the detained man's delayed
arraignment.
	   And at news conferences, like the one police chief Rahim Noor
conducted on Thursday, they pester with cheeky questions.
	   Rahim Noor said Anwar was ``safe and sound'' and ``would be
given a fair trial, very much like the British system.''
	   John Sweeney, a London-based reporter with The Observer
newspaper, asked the police chief to explain how British Common Law
would permit the man who was once deputy prime minister to simply
disappear in police custody.
	   Rahim shouted at Sweeney that he should come to his room and
asked an officer to bring him there.
	   When Sweeney attempted to ask more questions, Rahim lashed out.
``You shut up! You come from where?'' he asked. ``Enough from
you!''
	   ``Enough from the foreign press,'' he said. Very few local
journalists had tried to ask questions.
	   Rahim denied that he was intimidating the reporter and backed
down when other reporters asked if they could accompany Sweeney to
the police chief's ``room.''

India, Pakistan speak different language on Kashmir
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UN-Pakistan-Nuclear &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ After trading tests of nuclear devices
and some of their heaviest conventional weapons fire short of war,
India and Pakistan are talking peace again. But when it comes to
Kashmir _ the core of their dispute _ they still seem to be
speaking different languages.
	   After a two-hour meeting in New York on the sidelines of the
U.N. General Assembly meeting Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif
announced their foreign secretaries would meet Oct. 15, reviving a
peace process that has been frozen for more than a year.
	   ``When declarations like this are made, it creates hope anew,''
said E. Deenadayalan, whose private Pakistan-India People's Forum
for Peace and Democracy promotes contacts between ordinary Indians
and Pakistanis in hopes of whittling away decades of prejudice and
hostility.
	   Deenadayalan said it remained to be seen how two governments
that ``differ diametrically on how Kashmir should be solved'' would
proceed in peace talks.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over who should
control the Himalayan territory of Kashmir _ since each gained
independence from Britain in 1947 _ and border clashes over Kashmir
are common. Two-thirds of Kashmir is held by India, the rest by
Pakistan.
	   India's nuclear tests in May and consequent tests from Pakistan
brought their long-standing rivalry back to the world's attention.
	   India and Pakistan don't have the range of economic and cultural
contacts that helped the United States and the former Soviet Union
avoid a nuclear eruption during their years of Cold War, making any
attempt to normalize relations important, said Richard N. Haass,
director of foreign policy studies at America's Brookings
Institution.
	   Haass, in New Delhi to discuss his new study of U.S. relations
with India and Pakistan, said Thursday he was ``heartened'' by the
steps Vajpayee and Sharif announced the day before, and hoped for
more.
	   ``The relationship between India and Pakistan is an
underdeveloped relationship, and that's very worrisome,'' Haass
said.
	   Vajpayee and Sharif tried to make progress at a regional summit
in July, in their first meeting since the nuclear tests. But those
talks failed amid the heaviest firing by their troops across
Kashmir in recent memory.
	   The July meeting stalled on the same question that derailed
talks between the foreign secretaries last September. Both times,
Pakistan insisted the main topic be the territorial dispute over
Kashmir. India, however, wanted the subject to be considered no
more important than increased trade, easing citizens' visits to the
other country, and cross-border terrorism, which it blames on the
Pakistani government. Pakistan says the border violence is carried
out is by independent groups it cannot control.
	   With the talks resumed, Indian negotiators will hold firm on not
giving Kashmir ``undue importance,'' said Bharat Karnad, an expert
on national security at New Delhi's independent Center for Policy
Research.
	   But Sharif was quick to demonstrate that Kashmir remains at the
center of his concerns, raising it during a speech to the U.N.
General Assembly after his meeting with Vajpayee.
	   Sharif urged people living in Indian-held Kashmir to be allowed
to vote on whether they wanted to remain part of India, a step New
Delhi opposes.

German suspected of selling Iraq uranium enrichment plans arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A fugitive German engineer suspected
of providing uranium enrichment plans to Iraq was arrested at
Frankfurt airport Thursday, police said.
	   Federal criminal police in Wiesbaden confirmed a report by the
Bild newspaper that Karl-Heinz Schaab, who has been sought since he
fled the country in January 1996, was arrested after arriving on a
Lufthansa flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil.
	   Authorities accuse the 63-year-old engineer of providing Iraq
construction plans for a uranium enrichment plant for 2 million
marks (dlrs 1.2 million). The plans were found by U.N. inspectors
in Iraq.
	   Enriched uranium is needed for building an atomic bomb.
	   Schaab disappeared from his home in Kaufbeuren in January 1996.
He was arrested in December that year in Rio de Janeiro while
reportedly trying to obtain a permanent visa.
	   He was released after 15 months in custody when Brazil's supreme
court rejected Germany's extradition request.
	   Der Spiegel weekly in Hamburg said in a March report that Schaab
had hired an attorney in Augsburg to negotiate conditions for his
voluntary return.
	   According to Bild, Schaab had informed German officials he was
returning because he wanted to visit a last time with his
96-year-old mother, who was critically ill.
	   The chief federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe also
confirmed Schaab's arrest, saying it expected to issue more details
on Friday.

Hakkinen and Schumacher battle out in F-1 finish
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen expects his
McLaren-Mercedes to be very competitive. Michael Schumacher expects
no less of his Ferrari. The stage has been set for a thrilling
Formula One finish.
	   Hakkinen can capture his first Formula One championship if he
wins Sunday's Luxembourg Grand Prix and Schumacher fails to finish
the race or ends up outside the top six point-earning places.
	   Any other outcome would postpone the championship decision until
the final race in Japan on Nov. 11.
	   The two drivers are tied on points (80) going into the last two
races of the season.
	   Although it is officially called the Luxembourg Grand Prix,
Sunday's 67-lap race is across the border on the 4.5-kilometer
(2.8-miles) Nuerburgring, not far from Schumacher's home town of
Kerpen.
	   Although Schumacher won here in 1995, Hakkinen says he likes the
circuit as well.
	   ``I like this circuit a lot, it's got tricky corners, it feels
good,'' Hakkinen said Thursday as the drivers arrived at the track.
	   The Flying Finn has six victories this season, like Schumacher.
But he has a certain advantage because he has two second-place
finishes, while the German has only one. This puts Hakkinen ahead
under the Formula One tie-breaking rules.
	   A victory is worth 10 points.
	   Schumacher comes off an impressive victory in Monza two weeks
ago, when he overcame a botched start to lead a 1-2 Ferrari finish.
Hakkinen was slowed down by brake problems and finished fourth,
allowing Schumacher to pull even on points.
	   The McLarens dominated the early part of the season and appeared
to be virtually invincible.
	   But the Ferraris have rebounded strongly in their reliability
and Schumacher could now have a mental edge over the Finn: the
German knows such end-of-season situations having already won the
title twice.
	   But that was in other cars, and Schumacher is now trying to
become the first Ferrari driver to win the drivers' championship
since Jody Scheckter in 1979.
	   ``You have moments when you feel the pressure, but once the race
starts, you concentrate on what you are doing and you don't think
about it,'' Schumacher said.
	   Hakkinen said there was always some pressure in Formula One.
``If you are not confident in your capabilities, there is pressure.
But there is also the positive pressure, that feeling in your
stomach before the race.''
	   ``We have a package that's very competitive,'' Hakkinen said.
``We have the fastest car, a very powerful engine, reliable cars,
very good tires and we are all very motivated.''
	   Schumacher said that ``after loads of testing, our strongest
point is reliability.''
	   ``Our package is certainly close to the top, we have been
competitive on may different circuits. The chances are 50-50,'' he
said.
	   On a circuit where speed is not paramount, Schumacher's Ferrari
could have an advantage over the McLaren.

India pledges to conclude discussions on nuclear treaty

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ India's prime minister said Thursday his
country was prepared to conclude discussions on the nuclear test
ban treaty, following Pakistan's pledge to sign on to the treaty.
	   In prepared text before the U.N. General Assembly, Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said India wanted the treaty to go into force no later
than September 1999.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his
General Assembly speech that his country was ready to adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, even as he warned that compliance
would depend on whether rival India resumed its tests.
	   Vajpayee said India conducted its nuclear tests in May because
of the ``deteriorating security environment which has obliged us to
stand apart from the CTBT in 1996.''
	   Now that India's security interests are settled, India wants to
continue to cooperate with the international community and is in
discussions with key countries on a range of issues, including the
test ban treaty.
	   ``We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful
conclusion, so that the entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed
beyond September 1999,'' Vajpayee said in the text.
	   In his address, Sharif also told world leaders that ``we expect
that the arbitrary restrictions imposed on Pakistan by multilateral
institutions will be speedily removed,'' Sharif said.
	   The United States and other nations imposed economic sanctions _
cutting off all loans _ after India and Pakistan carried out
nuclear tests.
	   That measure has been especially tough on Pakistan, which has
been struggling with severe economic woes.
	   Sharif warned that Pakistan would comply with a ban on nuclear
tests only so long as India did not carry out any more tests.
	   ``If India were to resume nuclear testing, Pakistan will review
its position,'' Sharif said.
	   Sharif and Vajpayee met for nearly two hours Wednesday but
achieved no breakthroughs over Kashmir, a simmering territorial
dispute that took a perilous turn since both countries carried out
nuclear tests last May.
	   Vajpayee said there would be further talks on Kashmir when the
foreign secretaries of both sides meet in Pakistan for a three-day
meeting beginning Oct. 15.
	   ``When declarations like this are made, it creates hope anew,''
said E. Deenadayalan, whose private Pakistan-India People's Forum
for Peace and Democracy promotes contacts between ordinary Indians
and Pakistanis in hopes of whittling away decades of prejudice and
hostility.
	   Deenadayalan said it remained to be seen how two governments
that ``differ diametrically on how Kashmir should be solved'' would
proceed in peace talks.
	   Wednesday's meeting between the two leaders was the second since
their nuclear tests drew international condemnation and pressure
for both sides to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over the
disputed state of Kashmir _ in the 51 years since they gained
independence from Britain.

KLM plane makes emergency landing after wheel falls off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A KLM UK plane made a successful
emergency landing Thursday after one of its undercarriage wheels
fell off during takeoff, an airline spokesman said. No one was
injured in the incident.
	   The outer wheel on the Fokker F100's left-wing undercarriage
fell off as the aircraft left Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport Thursday
morning. An investigation was immediately launched to establish how
the wheel came loose.
	   Flight UK2155, which was on its way to Belfast, had 62
passengers and 5 crew members on board.
	   ``While taking off, the pilot noticed troubles with the plane's
landing gears,'' said airline spokesman Ocki Wiemeier.
	   The pilot circled for about two hours to burn up fuel before
making an emergency landing, added Wiemeier.
	   KLM UK is owned by Dutch flag carrier KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

	   VASILEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Yugoslav jets swooped overhead,
frightened Kosovo civilians streamed southward Thursday, trying to
escape a Serb and Yugoslav offensive that has trapped hundreds of
ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The boom of artillery sounded Thursday across the central
Drenica region of the Serbian province, and Serb police sources
said they divided the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army by taking
over a main road through the rebels last stronghold.
	   The Serb-controlled Media Center in Kosovo's capital Pristina
said police had ``closed the ring around strong groups of Albanian
extremists,'' destroying their bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   A 23-year-old Kosovo Liberation Army fighter, who said he left a
factory job in Germany four months ago to join the rebels, said
Serb forces had them cornered in an area west of Pristina and there
was no escape.
	   ``They are there, there and there,'' he said, pointing to three
hilltops. ``We can't leave. We'll only live if we win or if NATO
threatens Milosevic to stop.''
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, the vast majority in Kosovo, favor
independence. World powers instead back autonomy for the province,
arguing that independence can be achieved only through prolonged
bloodshed.
	   More than 275,000 ethnic Albanian civilians have been driven
from hundreds of destroyed villages, leaving an estimated 50,000
with no shelter as winter approaches.
	   Later Thursday, the intensity of the fighting appeared to ease
at least in some parts of the Drenica region. But it was impossible
to determine whether the overall offensive had lessened in response
to new signs of U.N. and NATO determination.
	   The U.N. Security Council threatened further action unless the
fighting stopped. While not specifically mandating NATO action, the
resolution Wednesday opened the way for international approval of
involvement by the military alliance.
	   NATO ambassadors meeting in Portugal approved increased planning
Thursday for air strikes in Kosovo. NATO will begin asking military
commanders to identify participating countries and the kind of
weapons they will put at NATO's disposal.
	   The risk to refugees facing the harsh Balkan winter is driving
Western efforts to get a commitment from Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end the government offensive and permit mass
refugee returns.
	   In villages west of Pristina, the situation appeared ever more
desperate Thursday for Albanian rebels and civilians alike. Small
groups of frightened, exhausted rebels hid in the bushes as
civilians walked past.
	   About every 20 minutes, Yugoslav jets streaked overhead,
apparently on reconnaissance missions. Refugee children picked up
sticks and pretended to fire guns at the planes.
	   Several refugees stopped to ask reporters whether NATO was
coming soon.
	   ``All of our houses were burned,'' said Kaytaz Hysni, 59. ``Even
our bread was inside.''
	   In Vilamoura, Portugal, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said the Alliance was moving ``to an increased level of military
preparedness'' without actually approving the use of force.
	   NATO sources said several nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   But an aide to the chief Albanian political leader in Kosovo,
Ibrahim Rugova, said U.N. and NATO moves may have already come too
late.
	   ``Half of Kosovo is already destroyed and burned,'' the aide,
Enver Maljoku, said. ``I don't think Milosevic will take this
message from the U.N. seriously, and I'm afraid that he'll have
enough time to destroy the other half of Kosovo too.''
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive.''

Sudanese rebels rebut government claim on town capture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rebels in southern Sudan Thursday denied
Sudanese government claims that its troops retook a town near the
southern provincial capital of Juba and said fighting continued
closer to another government garrison.
	   On Monday, Sudanese army spokesman Gen. Abdul-Rahman
Sirul-Khatim said government troops destroyed 11 tanks, three
armored vehicles and several armored personnel carriers in clashes
with the Sudan People's Liberation Army in Eastern Equatoria
province and retook Liria.
	   ``Liria is firmly under the control of SPLA forces,'' SPLA
spokesman John Luk Jok said in a statement. ``There are no GOS
(government of Sudan) forces in Liria.''
	   There has been no independent confirmation of the rebel claim,
but if it is true, it would mean they have cut the road to a
strategic government garrison in Torit, about 120 kilometers (75
miles) southeast of Juba _ the only major town in southern Sudan
that remains in government hands.
	   Luk said the clashes began Sunday and that SPLA forces had
occupied government positions at Jebel Kotton northwest of Liria.
	   He said fighting continued Thursday around Jebel Ingelis.
	   The locations are government strongholds on hills along the road
from Liria to Juba, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) on the western
banks of the White Nile river.
	   Luk said the rebels had lost one tank in the fighting so far,
but made no mention of casualties on either side.
	   He said five government soldiers were killed in a rebel ambush
about 16 kilometers (9 miles) east of Juba.
	   Luk said a Sudanese army brigade was concentrated in Nangala,
halfway between Juba and Liria. On Sunday, the rebels bombarded
Nangala and in the ensuing battle lost the tank.
	   Sirul-Khatan accused Ugandan troops of carrying out the actual
fighting.
	   ``These attacks are essentially carried out by Ugandan troops
using their arms, equipment and recognizable military fatigues,''
Sirul-Khatim told a news conference in Khartoum Monday.
	   Luk said there are no Ugandan troops in southern Sudan, and the
battles Khartoum claims they have engaged them in are ``concocted
and untrue.''
	   The rebels took up arms in 1983 to press for increased autonomy
and development in the predominantly African, animist and Christian
south, traditionally dominated by the Muslim and Arabized north.
The rebels control most of the countryside.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
accompanying famines. Millions more have also been forced to flee
their homes.

Organizers unveil 1.4 billion-dollar budget for 2002 Winter Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTHEW BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The Salt Lake Organizing Committee
presented on Thursday a dlrs 1.4 billion budget to stage what
officials hoped would be a successful yet frugal 2002 Winter Games.
	   The proposed spending plan is more than dlrs 400 million larger
than the amount Nagano, Japan, spent to host this year's Winter
Olympics and just dlrs 300 million less than the cost of the 1996
Summer Games in Atlanta.
	   But SLOC officials described their proposed spending plan as
disciplined and lean.
	   ``The budget is confined to expenditures that are essential to
hosting a successful Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games,'' said
Frank Joklik, SLOC president and CEO. ``After repeated phases of
reduction, the estimated expenditures contain no fat nor
redundancies.''
	   The proposal was presented to SLOC's board of trustees, which is
scheduled to approved a budget on Oct. 8. The spending plan must
also gain the approval of Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, Salt Lake City
Mayor Deedee Corradini and the International Olympic Committee.
	   John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, said that while the proposed budget is comprised of
estimates, it is realistic.
	   ``There is always a degree of escalation, but these are very
achievable numbers and will enable us to put on a successful and
financially solvent Winter Games,'' he said.
	   SLOC's executive board was given a preview of the 45-volume
budget plan on Wednesday and received mostly favorable reviews from
those willing to talk after their four-hour closed-door meeting.
	   ``It was well thought out and a good presentation,'' said John
Price, a developer. ``I'm very elated.''
	   But Ken Bullock was more frustrated than impressed by the
voluminous budget.
	   He said much of the information could have been gathered and
disclosed to board members soon after Salt Lake was awarded the bid
in 1995.
	   ``To wait 3 1-2 years puts us at a disadvantage,'' he said.
	   Bullock, executive director of the Utah League of Cities and
Towns, has complained for months about SLOC not releasing more
details sooner so that board members can better understand what
they will vote on in October.
	   The budget came after 10 months of dissecting the Olympics into
thousands of tasks and assigning a dollar estimate to each.
	   The Salt Lake spending plan covers 41 functions, such as medical
services or security; 200-plus projects, like the torch relay; 400
subprojects and 3,000 activities, such as tree plantings.
	   SLOC leaders noted the budget balances without additional tax
dollars. Taxpayers have already committed dlrs 59 million to build
Olympic venues. And while a poll this year found taxpayers willing
to pay more, state lawmakers have made it clear they don't want
more tax dollars going to the Olympics.
	   Olympic organizers, while at one time warning that the 2002
Winter Games could go down as the ``cheap Olympics,'' have steered
clear of any suggestion of a tax increase earmarked for the
Olympics.
	   The proposed budget includes repayment of the dlrs 59 million
and sets aside a dlrs 40 million endowment to pay for site
operations after the 2002 Games.
	   SLOC Chairman Robert Garff, an automobile salesman and former
state legislature head, said organizers can stay within budget and
not embarrass the state.
	   ``It will not be the lap of luxury, but that's not the Utah
spirit anyway,'' he said.
	   About dlrs 44 million already has been spent planning for the
Games and work remains on the ski jumps at Utah Winter Sports Park,
the speed skating oval in Kearns and the cross-country and biathlon
courses at Wasatch Mountain State Park.
	   Covering the expenses are dlrs 1 billion in cash from television
rights, corporate sponsorships, ticket sales and licensed products.
Another dlrs 443 million is anticipated in goods and services
donated by sponsors.
	   Joklik said that organizers working with the USOC have raised
about half the cash and service contributions from sponsors needed
to balance the budget.

Johansson to make Davis Cup debut in the semifinals against Moya

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Thomas Johansson gets his long-awaited
Davis Cup chance for defending champion Sweden on Friday when he
plays Carlos Moya in the second singles match in the semifinals
against Spain.
	   ``He's ready for the big moment,'' said Swedish captain
Carl-Axel Hageskog, whose team trounced the United States 5-0 in
last year's final.
	   Johansson, 23, a surprising quarterfinalist in the U.S. Open,
agreed.
	   ``Yes, I'm ready,'' he said. ``I'm very happy to be one of the
singles players. I like the (indoor) court. It's getting faster and
faster. The low bounce is important for us.''
	   Hageskog picked Johansson for the No. 2 singles spot instead of
Magnus Larsson, another U.S. Open quarterfinalist. Larsson
aggravated a wrist injury in practice this week at the Royal Tennis
Hall and was admitted to a hospital Tuesday.
	   Jonas Bjorkman, the Swedish No. 1, was drawn to play Spanish
second-string Alex Corretja in the opening match in the best-of-5
series Friday.
	   Bjorkman also is expected to play in Saturday's doubles match
with Nicklas Kulti against veteran Javier Sanchez and Julian
Alonso. But Hageskog and Spanish captain Manuel Santana can change
their pairs up to one hour before the doubles match.
	   In Sunday's reverse singles, Bjorkman will start against Moya
followed by Johansson against Corretja.
	   At age 10, Johansson was a ball boy when Stefan Edberg clinched
Sweden's 1988 quarterfinal victory over Czechoslovakia at
Norrkoping, not too far away from Johansson's hometown of
Linkoping.
	   ``That's when I saw a Davis Cup match live for the first time,''
he recalled. ``After that I followed almost every Davis Cup final.
It's going to be a very special feeling to play Spain in
Stockholm.''
	   Johansson missed three match points in the U.S. Open quarters
against Mark Philippoussis before losing a fifth-set tiebreak to
the eventual finalist from Australia.
	   ``I've played pretty good for a long time now and I'm
confident,'' Johansson said. ``The confidence means a lot in the
Davis Cup.''
	   Two weeks before the U.S. Open, Johansson beat Moya in their
only previous meeting, winning an early round match on hardcourt in
Indianapolis in three sets (6-7, 6-0, 6-1).
	   ``I lost the first set after a tiebreak, but then I hardly
missed another point,'' Johansson said.
	   Moya, the highest ranked player (fifth) in this tie, is also
playing with confidence after reaching the semifinals in the U.S.
Open, where he lost to Philippoussis.
	   ``I'm confident,'' he said. ``Sweden has a very good team. The
surface is faster here (than the U.S. Open) and the ball doesn't
bounce that high here. But maybe Johansson will feel the pressure
in his Davis Cup debut, in front of 5,000 screaming fans.''
	   Spain reached the Davis Cup final in 1965 and 1967, but lost
both. Sweden has won the tournament six times. The first victory
came in the Royal Tennis Hall in 1975 with Bjorn Borg.
	   ``We want to make the final,'' Moya said. ``Last time Spain made
the final, we were not born. But 'Manolo' played.''
	   Santana, a former four-time Grand Slam winner, also played last
time Sweden met Spain in Stockholm, on one of the Royal Tennis
Hall's outdoor clay courts in 1970. Sweden leads the series 8-3.
	   Bjorkman lost both of his two previous matches against Corretja
on hardcourts.
	   ``I have nice memories of the Swedish capital,'' said Bjorkman,
who won the Stockholm Open in the same arena last year.
``Hopefully, the crowd support will be a big key in this Davis Cup
match.''
	   The United States plays Italy in the other semifinal in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Russian premier unveils part of economic plan; inflation soars

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new prime minister finally mapped out a
strategy Thursday for climbing out of Russia's deep economic chasm,
including payments to the poor to compensate for inflation that
could exceed 500 percent this year.
	   Two weeks after he was appointed, Yevgeny Primakov offered at
least portions of his long-awaited economic plan to his
still-incomplete Cabinet. There were no real surprises.
	   As he has hinted in the past, Primakov proposed greater
government intervention in the economy and a more tightly knit
social safety net. But he made it clear that there would be no
return to Soviet-style state socialism.
	   He said the government would impose tighter control over the
liquor industry, always a potent source of revenue, but would not
nationalize it. He promised better tax collection _ a pledge that
no Russian government yet has been able to meet _ and said Russia
would appeal to international lenders to make good on promised
loans.
	   At the same time, two of his top economic aides issued sharp
warnings to Western investors and lenders.
	   Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko said Russia wanted to
work out a settlement with foreign banks that hold billions of
dollars worth of Russian government bonds that are currently
frozen.
	   But he warned: ``Those who are stubborn in their greediness may
end up getting nothing.''
	   And First Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin warned that Russia
could default on its international debt if the International
Monetary Fund does not continue to extend financial help to Russia
in the coming months.
	   ``I don't want to scare people with the possibility of default
on foreign debt,'' he said. ``But we do need to count on the loyal
attitude of our partners in the international financial
organizations ... in not canceling earlier agreed-upon aid
packages.''
	   The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package in July and
has issued the first installment. But it is expected to delay
additional money until it's satisfied that Russia has sound
financial policies.
	   ``Such an approach would drive Russia into a corner,'' Shokhin
said.
	   Russia badly needs the money if it is to carry out the economic
plans outlined by Primakov. The government is broke and will almost
certainly have to print more money, a move that's virtually certain
to push inflation even higher.
	   In the plans Primakov announced to the Cabinet, he promised to
begin paying long overdue wages and pensions in the next few weeks,
offering hope to millions of Russians who have gone as long as six
or eight months without a paycheck.
	   Acknowledging that soaring inflation is likely to shred the
value of those paychecks, he added that the government would begin
compensating poor people after Jan. 1 for the rising cost of
living.
	   By then, people may desperately need such compensation, if
Central Bank projections prove accurate.
	   Before the country's economic crisis turned critical in August,
inflation had been running at about 1 percent a month. Since then,
prices have jumped 67 percent, the Central Bank said. It added that
they could be expected to rise by 240 to 290 percent by year's end.
	   That assumes a relatively stable ruble, though, with a value
higher than 20 to the dollar. If the value of the ruble tumbles
further, to 30 to the dollar, as some experts believe possible,
inflation could rise as high as 550 percent, the Central Bank said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin remained on the sidelines Thursday, as
he has in recent weeks, appearing with the newly appointed deputy
prime minister for social affairs, Valentina Matviyenko. Two other
Cabinet posts were filled Thursday _ fuel and energy minister and
transportation minister, both going to incumbents from the previous
government.
	   The value of the ruble rose slightly Thursday to 15.61 to the
dollar, and stocks rose slightly in very light volume. The ruble
was worth about 6 to the dollar when the crisis began.

	   VASILEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Yugoslav jets swooped overhead,
frightened Kosovo civilians streamed southward Thursday, trying to
escape a Serb and Yugoslav offensive that has trapped hundreds of
ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The boom of artillery sounded Thursday across the central
Drenica region of the Serbian province, and Serb police sources
said they divided the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army by taking
over a main road through the rebels last stronghold.
	   The Serb-controlled Media Center in Kosovo's capital Pristina
said police had ``closed the ring around strong groups of Albanian
extremists,'' destroying their bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   Serb police and the Yugoslav army are close to wiping out all
KLA resistance after a seven-month military campaign in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, the vast majority in Kosovo, favor
independence. World powers instead back autonomy for the province,
arguing that independence can be achieved only through prolonged
bloodshed.
	   More than 275,000 ethnic Albanian civilians have been driven
from hundreds of destroyed villages, leaving an estimated 50,000
with no shelter as winter approaches.
	   The risk to refugees facing the harsh Balkan winter is driving
Western efforts to get a commitment from Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end the government offensive and permit mass
refugee returns.
	   A 23-year-old Kosovo Liberation Army fighter, who said he left a
factory job in Germany four months ago to join the rebels, said
Serb forces had them cornered in an area west of Pristina and there
was no escape.
	   ``They are there, there and there,'' he said, pointing to three
hilltops. ``We can't leave. We'll only live if we win or if NATO
threatens Milosevic to stop.''
	   Later Thursday, the intensity of the fighting appeared to ease
at least in some parts of the Drenica region. But it was impossible
to determine whether the overall offensive had lessened in response
to new signs of U.N. and NATO determination.
	   The U.N. Security Council threatened further action unless the
fighting stopped. While not specifically mandating NATO action, the
resolution Wednesday opened the way for international approval of
involvement by the military alliance.
	   NATO ambassadors meeting in Portugal approved increased planning
Thursday for air strikes in Kosovo. NATO will begin asking military
commanders to identify participating countries and the kind of
weapons they will put at NATO's disposal.
	   In villages west of Pristina, the situation appeared ever more
desperate Thursday for Albanian rebels and civilians alike. Small
groups of frightened, exhausted rebels hid in the bushes as
civilians walked past.
	   About every 20 minutes, Yugoslav jets streaked overhead,
apparently on reconnaissance missions. Refugee children picked up
sticks and pretended to fire guns at the planes.
	   Several refugees stopped to ask reporters whether NATO was
coming soon.
	   ``All of our houses were burned,'' said Kaytaz Hysni, 59. ``Even
our bread was inside.''
	   In Vilamoura, Portugal, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said the Alliance was moving ``to an increased level of military
preparedness'' without actually approving the use of force.
	   NATO sources said several nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   But an aide to the chief Albanian political leader in Kosovo,
Ibrahim Rugova, said U.N. and NATO moves may have already come too
late.
	   ``Half of Kosovo is already destroyed and burned,'' the aide,
Enver Maljoku, said. ``I don't think Milosevic will take this
message from the U.N. seriously, and I'm afraid that he'll have
enough time to destroy the other half of Kosovo too.''
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive.''

India pledges to conclude discussions on nuclear treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background on India pulling out of talks in 1996.
EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ India's prime minister said Thursday his
country was prepared to conclude discussions on the nuclear test
ban treaty, following Pakistan's pledge to sign on to the pact.
	   Atal Bihari Vajpayee said in prepared text he planned to deliver
to the General Assembly Thursday that India wanted the treaty to go
into force no later than September 1999.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his
General Assembly speech that his country was ready to adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, even as he warned that compliance
would depend on whether rival India resumed its tests.
	   India had been participating in discussions in Geneva on the
treaty through 1996, when it refused to continue, arguing that the
declared nuclear powers had to agree to a deadline to destroy their
arsenals.
	   The five declared powers _ the United States, Britain, France
China and Russia _ refused, and India pulled out of the talks.
	   Vajpayee said India conducted its nuclear tests in May because
of the ``deteriorating security environment which has obliged us to
stand apart from the CTBT in 1996.''
	   Now that India's security interests are settled, India wants to
continue to cooperate with the international community and is in
discussions with key countries on a range of issues, including the
test ban treaty.
	   ``We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful
conclusion, so that the entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed
beyond September 1999,'' Vajpayee said in the text.
	   ``We expect that other countries ... will adhere to this treaty
without conditions,'' he said.
	   The United States and other nations imposed economic sanctions _
cutting off all loans _ after India and Pakistan carried out
nuclear tests in May.
	   The tests sparked fears of a nuclear arms race in South Asia.
	   Sharif and Vajpayee met for nearly two hours Wednesday but
achieved no breakthroughs over Kashmir, a simmering territorial
dispute that took a perilous turn after the tests.
	   Vajpayee said there would be further talks on Kashmir when the
foreign secretaries of both sides meet in Pakistan for a three-day
meeting beginning Oct. 15.
	   ``When declarations like this are made, it creates hope anew,''
said E. Deenadayalan, whose private Pakistan-India People's Forum
for Peace and Democracy promotes contacts between ordinary Indians
and Pakistanis in hopes of whittling away decades of prejudice and
hostility.
	   Wednesday's meeting between the two leaders was the second since
their nuclear tests drew international condemnation and pressure
for both sides to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over the
disputed state of Kashmir _ in the 51 years since the two states
gained independence from Britain.

Russian parliament speaker calls for closer ties with Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 5th graf, `He said ...,' to UPDATE with
Foreign Ministry statement on Taliban &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliamentary speaker called Thursday for
boosting the nation's ties with Iran, including military
cooperation.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of parliament's lower house, the
State Duma, spoke to reporters after returning from a three-day,
official visit to Iran.
	   He said that Russia should complete an agreement to build a
nuclear reactor in Iran in spite of objections from the United
States. Russia says the 1,000-megawatt reactor is purely for
civilian purposes, but the United States fears it will help Iran
advance its suspected nuclear weapons program.
	   Seleznyov, a member of the Communist Party, also said Moscow
should continue selling weapons to Iran despite the fact that ``the
United States is still sharply criticizing Iran and calling it a
country of terrorists,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He said that bilateral trade reached dlrs 550 million last year.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it is concerned about
reports that the Taliban forces in Afghanistan have deployed
long-range missiles along the Iranian border. Such actions ``pose a
threat to peace and security in the region,'' the ministry said,
according to Interfax.
	   Seleznyov said he had discussed the recent rise in tensions
between Iran and Afghanistan following the Taliban's killing of
eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist in the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   ``Despite the acute situation, we wouldn't like Iran to engage
in a war against the Taliban,'' Seleznyov said, adding that he had
received assurances that Iran would not use force against the
Taliban.

Ethiopia's coffee earnings rise; tea industry development planned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia's earnings from coffee
exports rose by 15 percent to dlrs 410.8 million in the financial
year ending in July, and the Horn of Africa nation is turning its
attention to developing a tea industry.
	   Abayneh Alemu, the deputy general manager of Ethiopia's Coffee
and Tea Development Authority, said Thursday the earnings were a
record and attributed the healthy coffee industry to
liberalization.
	   He said Ethiopia exported 121,366 tons of coffee during the
period.
	   The government plans to develop a tea industry in an area of an
estimated 6 million hectares (14.8 million acres) stretching from
western to southern Ethiopia considered ideal for tea production.
	   ``The plan to develop this potentially rich land for tea
production is now being worked,'' Abayneh said.
	   Despite its great potential, he said, Ethiopia only produced
3,800 tons of tea on two state-own plantations during the 1997-98
fiscal year, of which 226.4 tons were exported, mainly to the
United States and Britain, earning dlrs 573,365.
	   ``If we managed to develop 100,000 of the estimated 6 million
hectares in the near future, it would reduce our dependence on
coffee,'' he said.
	   But coffee, which now accounts for 65 percent of Ethiopia's hard
currency earnings and the production of which employs 25 percent of
the country's 59.8 million people, will remain the backbone of
Ethiopia's exports, he said.
	   Ethiopian arabica coffee, which Abayneh described as the
country's gift to the world, is now grown on an estimated 400,000
hectares of land in southern and western Ethiopia, 95 percent of it
on small peasant holdings.
	   Plans are underway to develop coffee production in northwestern
Gojjam region where 10 million coffee seedlings will be planted
this year, Abayneh said.

Interpol chief: Internet crime caught law enforcers flat-footed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's governments and police forces were
caught unaware by burgeoning crime on the Internet and still are
trying to catch up, the head of the international police
organization said Thursday.
	   ``We were not ready for the extent to which this whole
phenomenon mushroomed,'' said Raymond Kendall, secretary-general of
Interpol. ``Many of our governments were not prepared for it
either.''
	   Police agencies lacked the specialists to track the problem and
have only recently begun to train officers, he said. There still
are no global agreements to handle the problem.
	   ``It's not even clear that if there were that they could be
effective in dealing with the problem,'' Kendall told reporters
during a two-day business conference organized by the International
Chamber of Commerce.
	   He said national laws can be used when criminals used the
Internet for traditional forms of crime in the same country.
	   The international chamber, meanwhile, announced that it is
setting up a special unit to combat cybercrime by emphasizing
prevention, issuing warnings about criminal methods and scams and
training specialists.
	   ``The incidence of cybercrime will grow, at least in line with
the increase in the number of new Internet sites and users,'' said
Eric Ellen, who will oversee the unit.
	   ``Its big attraction for the criminal is that it can be
committed anonymously and far from the victim,'' Ellen said.
``Losses can be significant.''
	   Leading industrial countries have defined the five main areas of
cybercrime as sexual exploitation of children, drug trafficking,
money laundering, electronic fraud and political espionage.
	   Ellen said fraud on the Internet included nondelivery of items
purchased, charges for supposedly free services, pyramid sales and
get-rich-quick investment schemes.
	   Bryan M. Jenkins, a consultant who has advised the White House
and the international chamber on the issue, said the Internet aids
the criminal in the same way it helps small businesses, by giving
it the extra muscle of a much larger enterprise.
	   The danger can be greatly exaggerated, Jenkins said. ``Computer
crackers may never hijack the world's banking system and hold
governments to ransom except in the movies.''
	   But, he added, ``the threat of cybercrime is nonetheless real
and it could reach truly alarming proportions.''

 &UR; NATO readies air strikes on Yugoslavia &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos VLM101-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO instructed its generals Thursday
to begin preparations for air strikes on Yugoslavia unless
President Slobodan Milosevic ends his attacks on ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo. The big question is whether the words will impressed the
tough Yugoslav president.
	   The difference between Thursday's action and previous hard words
aimed at Milosevic is the tone and the timing, NATO officials said.
A strong U.N. resolution Wednesday combined with a NATO
``activation warning'' Thursday for air operations takes the
16-nation alliance to the brink of shooting.
	   ``We expect any air campaign would be a phased campaign,'' said
Walter B. Slocombe, an assistant to Defense Secretary William Cohen
at the meeting of NATO defense ministers.
	   ``The targets would be military targets,'' he said. ``Very, very
effective and very, very strong blows would be aimed at the very
instruments that Milosevic is using to carry out this repression.''
	   Attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo have continued
unabated despite previous NATO threats. Milosevic's seven-month
crackdown on separatists fighting for independence of Kosovo has
claimed hundreds of lives and forced as many as 275,000 people from
their homes.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the ``activation
warning'' from the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking
body, was for both ``a limited air option and a phased air campaign
in Kosovo.''
	   That action, he said, takes NATO ``to an increased level of
military preparedness.'' He stressed, however, that further
decisions were required before the alliance unleashes any strikes.
	   Previous threats of military action have failed to persuade
Milosevic to mend his ways, and the latest warning from the
alliance did not appear to slow the onslaught against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant state in
the Yugoslav federation.
	   ``Belgrade is clearly conducting a war against its own people,''
said German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. ``Pictures of people
camping out in the open ... are in themselves an ultimatum'' to
Milosevic.
	   Slocombe said Thursday's NATO action signaled ``that the
international community has run out of patience with his action in
Kosovo.''
	   ``What the action by the alliance does is to position the
alliance to act very quickly,'' he said.
	   The call for a cessation of hostilities goes to both sides.
	   ``All of the blame for this war does not entirely rest with the
Serbian side,'' Slocombe said.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe, has
already surveyed the assets he will need for strikes on Yugoslavia.
Now, under the activation warning, he will be asking for specific
commitments.
	   A number of countries spoke up in Thursday's ministerial meeting
and said they would participate, according to Slocombe. None said
they would not.
	   NATO, which has no military assets of its own except for some
communications hardware and airborne warning and control aircraft,
does have access to a wide array of equipment from the national
armies of 15 members _ Iceland has no military force.
	   Four months ago, passions were high at NATO. Foreign ministers
meeting in Luxembourg issued a tough statement threatening action.
But those passions cooled as many questioned what could be
accomplished by direct military intervention. Now, however, as
winter approaches and the photos of cold, hungry displaced people
are on front pages around the world, the international community is
once again feeling pressure to do something.

Iran accuses Taliban of genocide, troops to stay on border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan-Iran-Religious Gathering &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Accusing Afghanistan's Taliban
religious army of genocide, Iran's ambassador to Pakistan said
Thursday that Tehran will keep its 200,000 troops on the border
with Afghanistan.
	   ``As long as we feel insecure our forces will remain to protect
our integrity,'' said Mohammed Mehdi Akhoundzadeh.
	   He called the killing of Iranian diplomats in northern
Afghanistan last month ``genocide'' and accused the Taliban
religious army of carrying out a campaign of terror against
Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Taliban soldiers are
Sunni Muslims; Iran is a majority Shiite Muslim nation.
	   The Taliban say Iran is arming and financing the Taliban's
northern-based opponents, who control roughly 10 percent of
Afghanistan. The Taliban rule the rest.
	   Iran deployed its troops after the Taliban army acknowledged the
killing of the eight diplomats and an Iranian journalist during a
takeover of the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   ``For the people of Iran this barbaric act cannot go
unpunished,'' Akhoundzadeh told reporters in the Pakistani capital,
Islamabad.
	   Iran has demanded the culprits be caught and sent to Tehran to
stand trial. The Taliban maintains the diplomats were killed by
renegade soldiers and that the diplomats were aiding the
anti-Taliban alliance.
	   Regarding the war within Afghanistan, Akhoundzadeh said, ``It is
just Muslims killing Muslims. We demand an immediate end to this
fratricide.''
	   Calling for an immediate cease-fire in Afghanistan, something
the United Nations also is demanding, he said the ``only solution
for the problem in Afghanistan is through dialogue.''
	   But for Iran the dispute with Afghanistan cannot be settled
unless the deaths of the diplomats are avenged, he said.
	   Akhoundzadeh also said the porous border needs to be policed
even if the current dispute is settled, because of Afghanistan's
flourishing drug trade, which he complained has escalated in
western Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of the area in
1996.

Brzezinski awarded honorary citizenship of Ukrainian city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Former U.S. national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski was awarded the title of honorary Lviv citizen
on Thursday.
	   The city council said that Brzezinski was given the title for
his political achievements, including masterminding ``the collapse
of the USSR,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Polish-born Brzezinski, who served under President Jimmy
Carter, was visiting Lviv, some 500 kilometers (375 miles) west of
the capital Kiev, and said he was grateful for the honor.
	   Brzezinski also said he would work for the reconciliation of
Ukrainians and Poles in the region. Such reconciliation is
important for Ukraine's integration into Europe, he said, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Influential Ukrainian nationalists in Lviv are protesting plans
to restore a cemetery and build a memorial for Polish soldiers who
died in the region while fighting for Poland's independence in
1918. Lviv was then part of Poland, and was known as Lvov.
	   Although Poland has pledged in return to restore graves of
Ukrainian soldiers on its land, the Lviv nationalists say the
proposed inscriptions at Lviv's Lychakivske cemetery are offensive
to Ukrainians and might cast doubt over the city's Ukrainian
character.
	   At a recent meeting with city officials, leaders of the regional
Bloc of National-Patriotic Forces agreed not to stage protests
during Brzezinski's visit in exchange for a promise not to build a
memorial at the cemetery, the daily Den reported.

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ New lawmakers were sworn in Thursday
at Cambodia's historic Angkor Wat temple, but an alleged attempt to
kill the country's leader Hun Sen showed that the political climate
remained unstable.
	   Hun Sen was unhurt, but a 12-year-old boy died when what police
called a booby trap made with rocket-propelled grenades exploded as
Hun Sen's convoy passed by on its way to the swearing-in ceremony.
Three members of the boy's family were badly injured.
	   Hun Sen suggested the attack was the work of opposition parties,
linking it to another violent incident earlier this month, and
vowed retribution. He offered a dlrs 200,000 reward and amnesty to
the attackers if they would step forward and name their ringleader.
	   ``If the opposition leaders do not instruct their forces to stop
activities which threaten my life, they would die with the most
severe suffering,'' Hun Sen told reporters. ``For a snake, if we
don't hit it on the head, it can still move and bite back, so we
must hit it on the head, not its tail.''
	   Previous alleged attempts on Hun Sen's life have prompted
harassment and arrests of his opponents.
	   Thursday's incident took place shortly before 121 elected
lawmakers gathered in traditional formal dress at the residence of
King Norodom Sihanouk for the opening of the new session of the
National Assembly.
	   It was supposed to mark a major step toward restoring political
stability after bitter post-election sparring, and in a brief
speech at his royal residence the king urged national
reconciliation.
	   The swearing-in followed weeks of jousting between Hun Sen's
ruling Cambodian People's Party, which captured a majority in
elections held July 26, and the two opposition parties, which said
Hun Sen won the polls through fraud and intimidation.
	   Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said
they knew nothing about Thursday's attack.
	   Sam Rainsy, a bitter critic of Hun Sen who himself has been the
target of apparent assassination attempts, questioned the details
of the incident.
	   ``We are here together, who is the target?'' he asked. ``Was it
a serious try or not? Who can tell?''
	   Hun Sen's national police chief, Hok Lundy, blamed Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy Party for the blast.
	   He said eight people were being detained for questioning.
	   Police found three unexploded rockets which were part of what
they said was the remote-control booby trap used in the attack.
	   On Sept. 7, a grenade was tossed at Hun Sen's residence in the
capital, Phnom Penh, but he was not home. No one was injured and
little damage was done.
	   The opposition charged that Hun Sen staged the incident for an
excuse to crack down on his opponents. He banned antigovernment
demonstrations the next day and threatened his opponents with
arrest
	   Minutes after Thursday's explosion, Hun Sen looked calm when he
arrived at King Sihanouk's residence.
	   The 75-year-old monarch spoke to lawmakers before they traveled
to the nearby 12th-century Angkor Wat temple, where they were
officially sworn in by Siem Reap's chief monk. All but one of the
122 newly elected representatives attended.
	   Sihanouk called on them to reach ``an honorable compromise'' to
form a new government and work quickly to end corruption, poverty
and deforestation.
	   Ranariddh _ Sihanouk's son _ expressed optimism that
negotiations to form a new government would proceed smoothly when
parliament begins next week. Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as co-prime
minister in a bloody coup last year.
	   After the July elections, the opposition threatened to boycott
Parliament and organized spirited rallies calling for Hun Sen's
ouster. Police violently broke up the demonstrations, killing at
least four people and arresting dozens.
	   As the situation threatened to spin out of control, the
opposition agreed to end its boycott threat.

Dutch company signs cooperation deal with Ukraine's Naftogas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Top officials from Ukraine's state Naftogas
Ukrainy and the Dutch Schlumberger corporation signed a five-year
cooperation accord Thursday, Naftogas said.
	   Schlumberger plans to invest several hundred million dollars in
the Ukrainian oil and gas industry and will take part in exploring
and developing gas fields in the country, Naftogas said in a
statement.
	   The company also plans to service oil and gas industry
equipment, the statement said.
	   The status of Naftogas, however, remains in question.
	   President Leonid Kuchma created Naftogaz Ukrainy earlier this
year. The company was to be formed by uniting state-owned
companies, and transferring to it the stakes the government holds
in other partially privatized gas and oil enterprises.
	   But parliament then adopted a law that in practice banned the
company's formation by prohibiting the government from transferring
its stakes to it. Kuchma last month refused to sign the law and
urged parliament to cancel it.
	   The creation of Naftogaz Ukrainy was seen as an attempt to
circumvent a 1995 parliamentary ban on privatizing most of

	   ROME (AP) _ A Libyan gunboat rammed and fired on an Italian
fishing boat 30 miles off the Libyan coast on Friday, killing one
fisherman, news reports said.
	   The attack reportedly occurred around 2 a.m. and the Italian
boat, by the afternoon, was under tow, according to reports

Report: Microsoft may bid for Anglo-Dutch publisher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed
Elsevier and Microsoft Corp. are in talks on a deal that could
include a takeover bid by the U.S. software giant, Dow Jones
Newswires reported Thursday.
	   An unnamed source told Dow Jones that the two companies are in
talks about a large deal, but couldn't be more specific.
	   Officials at the publishing company's London and Amsterdam
headquarters refused to comment on or deny the report.
	   Microsoft's European office also declined comment and there was
no statement issued by the company's U.S. home office in Redmond,
Wash.
	   The source spoke after Reed Elsevier stock rose earlier this
week on rumors of a bid from a U.S. technology company. Market
watchers believe Elsevier may be looking for a partner or takeover
candidate after its merger plans with Dutch publisher Wolters
Kluwer fell through earlier this year.
	   ``We are aware of the rumors which have moved the shares in
recent days and we don't have any comment whatsoever,'' Fokko
Covers, head of Elsevier's European financial affairs, told Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   In May, Reed Elsevier signed a dlrs 30 million, five-year deal
to use Microsoft's commercial Internet services and its software to
support the publisher's products.

Indian, Pakistani anti-nuclear activists get tolerance prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Indian and Pakistani anti-nuclear activists on
Thursday were named winners of the UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize for
the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence.
	   Following underground nuclear weapons tests by the rival
countries last May, the prize ``is a very powerful symbolic gesture
on the part of UNESCO,'' said the award's jury chairman, Nobel
Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa.
	   India's Narayan Dasai, 74, won the award for campaigning against
nuclear weapons and for his work in promoting education and youth
training camps with his Shanti Sena (Peace Bridge) corps of
volunteers dedicated to non-violence.
	   Dasai has written more than 30 books on tolerance and peace.
	   The Pakistani group Joint Action Committee for Peoples Rights
won the prize for its campaigns for women's rights, religious
tolerance and against nuclear weapons. The committee is an informal
coalition of 30 non-governmental organizations and individuals,
founded in 1990.
	   The winners are to receive the dlrs 40,000 prize in a ceremony
at UNESCO headquarters in Paris on Nov. 16.
	   Given every two years, the award is funded by Madanjeet Singh,
imprisoned during Mohandas Gandhi's non-violent movement, and a
former Indian ambassador. He is now special adviser to Federico
Mayor, director-general of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural organization.
	   This year's jury also included former U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Ghali, Indian politician Inder Kumar Gujral and French
Rabbi Rene-Samuel Sirat. Mayor awarded the prize on the jury's
recommendation.

Tajik opposition fighters return from Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with government statement, opposition
response &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A total of 157 Tajik opposition fighters who were
based in neighboring Afghanistan during the country's civil war
have returned home, a news report said Thursday.
	   The rebels made their way across the Pyandzh River on Wednesday
night with the help of Russian border troops who provided a barge,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing Russian border guard
spokesman Alexander Kondratyev.
	   Tajik authorities have been seeking to bring back an estimated
250 rebels who have remained in Afghanistan. Some had already made
their way home in recent days, and it is unclear whether any were
still in Afghanistan.
	   The operation, overseen in part by the United Nations, is part
of a peace agreement signed last year that ended five years of
civil war. The deal called for the troops' repatriation and
integration into the Tajikistan government forces.
	   The fighters' weapons and vehicles were also ferried to
Tajikistan in what ITAR-Tass described as a ``special sealed
delivery.''
	   Outbreaks of violence between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition still occur periodically in Tajikistan,
despite the peace agreement.
	   The government issued a statement Thursday accusing opposition
field commanders of violating the country's General Peace
Agreement, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The statement accused some commanders of taking part in
kidnapping and looting, and blamed opposition forces for the recent
killings of four U.N. staffers.
	   An opposition leader, Mikzokhudzha Nizomov, disputed the
statement, saying opposition commanders had not acted ``counter to
the line of the ... leadership for establishing peace and national
accord,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   He acknowledged that three opposition members had been arrested
in connection with the U.N. staffers' deaths, and that one had
admitted guilt. He said the other two denied any complicity,
however.

CBK estimates 1997/98 coffee production at 60,000 tons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI (Dow Jones) _ The Coffee Board of Kenya estimates coffee
production for 1997/98 to be 60,000 tons, CBK spokesman Paul Kivila
said Thursday.
	   Kivila said CBK will give farmers a coffee picking advance loan
at interest rates of between 11 and 13 percent to facilitate the
the picking season that begins this month.
	   The commercial lending rate is 27.58 percent.
	   ``Our officials are in the field to assess the coffee and find
out who qualifies for the advance,'' Kivila said.
	   He was addressing some 300 coffee farmers in Kiambu outside
Nairobi.
	   The farmers resolved to remain in the Nairobi Coffee Exchange
central system in order to keep on earning the high prices Kenyan
coffee is fetching at auction.
	   He said a bank for coffee farmers proposed by the CBK will
beging operations soon with an intial capital of 500 million Kenya
shillings (dlrs 8.3 million).
	   ``We have meet the conditions, everything is finalized and the
bank is waiting for a license,'' Kivila said.
	   Last month, the Central Bank of Kenya said farmers should
concentrate on farming and not setting up lending institutions.
	   ``It is not the CBK bank,'' Kivila said. ``The farmers have
called for their own bank.''
	   The Kenya Fresh Produce Association has also expressed interest
in starting its own bank, a move also frowned upon by the central
bank.

Turkish Cabinet minister resigns following allegations of links to
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with minister resigning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One of Premier Mesut Yilmaz's Cabinet
ministers announced his resignation Thursday following allegations
linking him to a notorious mafia leader, Turkey's Anatolia news
agency reported.
	   A key political party had threatened earlier in the day to
withdraw its support from Yilmaz's minority government unless Eyup
Asik quit as minister in charge of state monopolies.
	   Asik said he would hand his resignation to Yilmaz when the
premier returns from a visit to the United States. He said he would
ask prosecutors to launch an investigation that he said would prove
his innocence.
	   On Wednesday, news shows aired what they said was a taped
conversation between Asik and godfather Alaattin Cakici. In
transcripts published by newspapers, Cakici thanks Asik for helping
him avoid arrest by tipping him off with details of a police
operation.
	   The conversation was seen by many as the latest evidence of
links between the Turkish state and underworld.
	   ``We give them until the end of the year for Asik to resign. If
not, we will withdraw our support,'' said Onur Kumbaracibasi,
deputy head of the center-left Republican People's Party.
	   Without the party's 55 deputies, Yilmaz lacks the parliamentary
majority he needs to govern.
	   On Wednesday, the party's general secretary urged the premier to
resign. Kumbaracibasi said that although Yilmaz should step down,
his party would not push for his resignation.
	   Asik, a close aide of Yilmaz, admitted to several conversations
with Cakici but says the barely audible tape was a fabrication,
perhaps made by splicing together segments of the other
conversations.
	   Yilmaz was quoted by Sabah daily as saying that he believed the
allegations were false.
	   Cakici was recently arrested in France, where he had been
traveling with a diplomatic passport, raising suspicion that he had
been under the protection of public officials. He is wanted in a
series of murders committed since 1978.
	   Turkey has been rocked by allegations of state-mafia relations
since 1996, when a car crash injured a legislator and killed a
police official and a fugitive terrorist _ all riding together in
the same car.

Liberal Democrat leader threatens to end cooperation with Blair
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIGHTON, England (AP) _ Paddy Ashdown, leader of Britain's
third-running Liberal Democratic Party, said Thursday that unless
the Labor Party government agrees to radical reform of the voting
system he will end cooperation with Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   ``I have one great question about you (Blair),'' Ashdown said,
delivering his keynote address to the party's annual conference in
this south England town.
	   ``Are you a pluralist or are you a control freak? Your decision
on fair votes ... will determine the future course of our work
together and it will tell us what kind of country you want Britain
to be,'' he added.
	   A commission is due to report next month on changing the voting
system to some form proportional representation _ allocating each
party seats in the House of Commons according to the overall share
of the vote it wins.
	   The present US-style system under which the candidate with the
most votes wins each constituency favors Britain's two big parties,
Labor and the Conservatives. Proportional representation, the
system used in many European countries, favors small parties and
often leads to coalition governments.
	   For example, the Conservative Party has held power in Britain
for most of this century, achieving comfortable parliamentary
majorities on less than 50 percent of the vote.
	   Similarly, Labor achieved a landslide victory in May 1997
national elections _ getting 43 percent of the vote and winning
two-thirds of the seats in the 659-member House of Commons.
	   Blair is reluctant to change the system. But he included a
pledge in Labor's election platform to have a commission
investigate and recommend on a new system.
	   If the government agreed to any change, a referendum would be
held.
	   In an unusual move in Britain's traditionally confrontational
style of politics, Ashdown sits at Blair's invitation on a Cabinet
sub-committee on constitutional change, which ranges from separate
assemblies for Scotland and Wales to a proposal to strip hereditary
members of the upper House of Lords of voting powers.
	   A policy of non-cooperation by the Liberal Democrats _ which
have 46 parliamentary seats _ would have little practical effect
because of Blair's huge Commons majority.

Year after tragic deaths, Egypt's young return to cotton fields
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos CAI102-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SA EL-HAGAR, Egypt (AP) _ A timid sun mounts the palm trees that
shroud the village, and streets moist with dew stir with life. In
the village's cemetery, mothers in black gather to mourn their
dead.
	   A year ago, 23 of Sa el-Hagar's children _ some as young as 12 _
were killed when a government-owned truck carrying them from work
in cotton fields skidded off a narrow, unpaved road and plunged
into the muddy, meandering waters of a Nile River canal.
	   The tragedy devastated the village of squat houses, where
donkeys outnumber cars in the winding streets. The memory remains
of the night when hundreds of villagers sat on the road to the
cemetery awaiting the return of young bodies caked in mud.
	   But their determination to keep their remaining children from
the harvest has run into the weary reality of the Egyptian
countryside.
	   ``We're dirt poor, the village has no other work and we have to
make money,'' said Jawahir Ibrahim al-Khalifa, standing next to the
tomb of her 14-year-old son, who drowned in the canal.
	   ``There's no other way to get food,'' she said, wiping away
tears. ``That's the way the village is.''
	   Egypt's annual cotton harvest began this month, and tens of
thousands of children _ from Sa el-Hagar and other desolately poor
villages like it in the Delta _ are flocking again into the fields
in feudal fashion to toil beneath a late summer sun.
	   They work under government supervision, despite a law that bans
employment of children under 14 and makes school mandatory until
15. They return to the fields every year, despite tragic accidents
like the one that shattered this village of several thousand.
	   As in past years, the government looks the other way, relying on
the cheap labor to harvest one of Egypt's biggest cash crops.
	   ``Anywhere you go, especially in the countryside, you can see
that people break the law,'' said Hosni Yusuf Suleiman, who
oversees programs for rural children at the Ministry of Social
Affairs.
	   Egyptian cotton once outstripped King Cotton of America's South,
its long fibers giving it a strength and softness that make it
prized throughout the world. Next to oil, cotton remains Egypt's
biggest export and its harvest _ with each boll picked by hand _
employs an estimated one-fifth of Egypt's rural workers.
	   Children are picked up in villages in the morning and driven to
the fields, where they often work until dusk. Crouched over, they
use three fingers to pluck the boll, stuffing fluffy white balls
into their shirts, pockets or pouches tied around their waist.
	   They earn the equivalent of 3 cents to 9 cents for about 2
pounds of cotton. Most children make perhaps a dollar a day,
usually far less.
	   ``It's not a lot. It wouldn't even pay for three or four
notebooks for school,'' said Mona Abdullah al-Faqih, a 15-year-old
girl in a red headscarf who began picking cotton when she was 10.
``If I could earn enough, I'd work all the time.''
	   Mona was one of the dozens of children riding in the truck that
overturned in September 1997. She was thrown from the car onto the
dirt road, but walked away unscathed.
	   The government since has paid compensation _ dlrs 880 for those
who died, dlrs 150 for those who were hurt. It banned the transport
of children in the big trucks that once plied the Nile Delta.
	   But it has taken no steps to keep children off the fields and in
the schools, where Mona says she would rather be.
	   ``The school is the future, and this is just work. The work will
eventually end, but the school will make for a life afterward,''
she said, her pouch filled with twigs, leaves and cotton.
	   Behind her, a man shouts, ``Gather it up, children!''
	   When Mona and the other children of Sa el-Hagar go to the fields
these days, it is not without their parents' regrets.
	   Fayza al-Sayyid lost her 13-year-old daughter, Ahlam, who had
earned the equivalent of 60 cents that day in the field.
	   On her cement tombstone painted in blue, a bittersweet message
speaks to resignation and solace _ ``Only God is eternal.''
	   ``If I knew she would die, I never would have sent her to the
fields,'' said al-Sayyid, crouched next to the grave and cloaked in
black, listening to a boy read from a tattered Koran.
	   She paused, then added sadly, ``But if we had another way to
make money, none of them would have to go.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ India's prime minister pledged Thursday
that India was prepared to sign on to the nuclear test ban treaty
but had to complete negotiations before it did so.
	   Atal Bihari Vajpayee told world leaders gathered for the U.N.
General Assembly debate that India wanted the treaty to go into
force no later than September 1999. India is one of the 44
countries that must ratify the treaty for it to go into effect.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his
General Assembly speech that his country was ready to adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, even as he warned that compliance
would depend on whether rival India resumed its tests.
	   India had been participating in discussion in Geneva on the CTBT
through 1996, when it refused to continue, claiming the treaty
discriminated against the countries with nuclear potential.
	   India wants the declared nuclear powers to agree to a deadline
to destroy their arsenals before India signs on. The five declared
powers _ the United States, Britain, France China and Russia _
refused, and India pulled out of the talks.
	   Vajpayee said India conducted its nuclear tests in May because
of the ``deteriorating security environment which has obliged us to
stand apart from the CTBT in 1996.''
	   Now that India's security interests are settled, India wants to
continue to cooperate with the international community and is in
discussions with key countries on a range of issues, including the
test ban treaty.
	   ``We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful
conclusion, so that the entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed
beyond September 1999,'' Vajpayee said in his speech.
	   ``We expect that other countries ... will adhere to this treaty
without conditions,'' he said.
	   The United States and other nations imposed economic sanctions _
cutting off all loans _ after India and Pakistan carried out
nuclear tests in May. The tests sparked fears of a nuclear arms
race in South Asia.
	   States that sign on to the CTBT must refrain from testing
nuclear devices and prevent any such nuclear explosion on their
territory.
	   It must be signed and ratified by 44 countries with any kind of
nuclear power before it can go into effect. Forty-one of those 44
states have signed: India, Pakistan and North Korea have not. Of
those 41 signatures, 10 have ratified the treaty: Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Peru, Slovakia, and
Britain.

Vatican signs accord with former Soviet republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican signed an accord Thursday
formally legalizing the status of the Roman Catholic church in
Kazakhstan, hailing it as a model for other countries.
	   The Vatican said the accord guaranteed ``high standards of
religious freedom,'' including access to the media, and allows the
church to own property needed to carry out its mission.
	   It described the agreement as a major step forward for the
church in the central Asian country, formerly part of the ex-Soviet
Union.

Parliament unanimously declares Sept. 14 `genocide' day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In a move sure to worsen already tense
relations with Turkey, Parliament on Thursday unanimously declared
Sept. 14 a day of remembrance for the ``genocide'' of the Greek
minority by the Turkish state.
	   In a vote by the 300-member unicameral chamber, the date was
officially named a day of ``National Remembrance of the Genocide of
Asia Minor Greeks by the Turkish State.''
	   The legislation was proposed by three hawkish members of Premier
Costas Simitis' governing socialist party.
	   It refers to the period in 1922 when Turkish forces took over
the predominantly Greek port city of Izmir, on Turkey's Aegean
coast.
	   At the time, the city _ then known as Smyrna _ was garrisoned by
Greek troops which were administering the Turkish port under a
treaty signed in 1920.
	   But in 1921, Greek forces launched an offensive that led them to
within 64 kilometers (40 miles) of Ankara, the capital of
present-day Turkey. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the
modern Turkish state, launched a counter offensive in August 1922
and his forces entered Smyrna in early September and torched most
of the city.
	   Because of the war and ensuing population exchanges, millions of
Greeks in Turkey and hundreds of thousands of Turks in Greece had
to flee. Today the Greek minority in Turkey numbers just a few
thousand.
	   Enmities between the two countries run long and deep, with the
two NATO allies coming to the brink of war twice in the past 11
years because of disputes in the Aegean Sea.

Milosevic's party says rooting out KLA top national priority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Set to defy renewed threats of a
NATO action in Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
declared Thursday his crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists
in the province a top national priority.
	   Milosevic called a meeting of his ruling Socialist Party's Main
Board on the Kosovo situation, as NATO advanced preparations for
possible air strikes against Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   In a statement issued after the session, the party ``expressed
bitterness'' over ``continuing policies of double standards and
pressure on our country, which gives direct and indirect support to
Albanian separatists and terrorists and can only postpone peaceful
and democratic solution of the problems,''
	   The party suggested the world should instead condemn the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army to stop all pressure on Yugoslavia,
and allow the country to return into world political and financial
bodies.
	   In the statement, carried by state-run Tanjug news agency, the
party praised the security forces fighting the KLA in Kosovo for
their ``honorable, responsible and professional'' work.
	   It added that ``rooting out terrorism ... and finding lasting
solution in Kosovo by political means, presents the issues of
priority national and state interest.''
	   The government crackdown against the KLA, which is fighting for
independence of Kosovo, has claimed hundreds of lives and sent as
many as 275,000 people fleeing. International officials fear a
humanitarian disaster unless Milosevic's forces are stopped before
winter.

Zimbabwe dollar hits record low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The national currency slumped to a
record low Thursday, weakening by about 14 percent.
	   It closed at 37.78 per U.S. dollar compared to Wednesday's
closing rate of 32.50-1.
	   Dealers said the latest run on the Zimbabwe dollar came after
the state power and telephone companies drew dlrs 5 million from
the nation's diminishing hard currency reserves to pay off some
offshore borrowings.
	   ``Normally, we could take that strain, but this shows how weak
our reserves are,'' said one dealer.
	   There was no immediate comment from the state central bank.
	   The British pound moved during the day between 61 and 65
Zimbabwe dollars to one sterling pound.
	   Last November, Zimbabwe's currency suffered its largest
single-day fall, from 17 to 28 per U.S. dollar. That decline has
continued.
	   In recent weeks, allegations of financial mismanagement by the
government, depressed tobacco and mineral prices, and the
deployment of Zimbabwean troops to support President Laurent Kabila
in Congo eroded citizens'and investors' confidence in the currency.
	   Tobacco and minerals are the nation's main foreign currency
earner.

Wall Street, European markets retreat, Asian markets rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES afternoon Dow, European markets closing with losses,
picking up 9th graf pvs bgng `Key market ...';
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were falling Thursday as Wall Street
traders sold shares to cash in on the powerful gains Wednesday that
followed Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's strong hint of
an interest-rate cut.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average _ up 257.21 points, or 3.3
percent, on Wednesday _ was off 72.35 at 8,082.06 in active trading
in the afternoon.
	   Wednesday's rally was the fifth-largest point gain ever for the
Dow and also sent broader indicators rising sharply. Today, broader
indicators were falling on profit-taking and worries about upcoming
corporate earnings reports.
	   But Asian markets soared earlier Thursday, lifted by hopes that
falling interest rates would help fight economic crises that have
engulfed the region, spread to Russia and threaten Latin America.
European markets, which opened higher, gave up their gains to close
with losses.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index in London, up
107 points in the morning, reversed course and fell 47.1 points to
close with a loss of 0.9 percent. Traders said the market sagged
after a Confederation of British Industry survey said export orders
for U.K. manufacturers fell to 15-year lows.
	   ``The good news at this stage is that the Fed will cut rates at
some stage, while the bad news is that things are certainly going
to get worse,'' said Peter Caulkett, a salesman at Teather and
Greenwood in London.
	   Frankfurt, Germany's key index closed down 1.1 percent amid
nervousness in advance of the national election Sunday. In Paris,
the main market gauge fell 1.2 percent.

Israel says no progress in talks if Arafat raises statehood issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATE with Netanyahu speech at UN &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel warned Yasser Arafat on Thursday that he
will sabotage prospects for a West Bank troop withdrawal if he
seeks world support in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly next
week for a planned declaration of Palestinian statehood.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the General Assembly such
a declaration would lead to the ``complete collapse of the (peace)
process.''
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank in New York this week.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Arafat is determined to
use his rare appearance before the world body to win international
backing for independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May
when the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy expires.
	   U.S. officials had considered arranging a meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu in New York. However, with both sides sharpening
their rhetoric over the statehood issue, it appeared unlikely such
a summit will take place.
	   ``An arbitrary unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state ...
would constitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords, it
would cause the complete collapse of the process. I strongly urge
the Palestinian Authority not to take this course,'' Netanyahu said
in his speech to the U.N. Thursday.
	   Arafat is to arrive in New York later in the week.
	   Israeli officials warned that the negotiations on a West Bank
withdrawal would suffer if Arafat raised the statehood issue in his
speech to the United Nations on Monday.
	   ``If Arafat chooses the path of diplomatic struggle against
Israel in the United Nations and attempts to promote a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood, he will simply sabotage the
chance that exists to achieve agreement with Israel,'' said Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   Netanyahu said earlier that a statehood declaration would
violate the autonomy accords which say the final status of the
disputed territories must be determined through negotiations.
	   If Arafat declares a state in May, this ``in effect cancels the
(peace) agreement,'' Netanyahu said in New York, adding that the
move would trigger counter measures by Israel.
	   Netanyahu has not said specifically how he would respond, but it
is believed he would annex parts of the West Bank and seal off
autonomous Palestinian areas from one another.

Heras wing 19th stage, Olano still top with three stages to go
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEGOVIA, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Roberto Heras of the Kelme-Costa
Blanca team won the 19th leg of the Tour of Spain cycling marathon
on Thursday, peddling past the finishing line 29 seconds ahead of
his nearest rivals.
	   Tour leader Abraham Olano of Spain and the Banesto team arrived
along with the other favorites a couple of seconds later, leaving
the overall standings little changed with just three stages to go.
	   Heras covered the 170.4-kilometer (105.6-mile) run between the
cities of Avila and Segovia in the mountains north of Madrid in 4
hours, 13 minutes and 28 seconds.
	   Teammate, fellow Spaniard and current overall No. 4 Fernando
Escartin came in next, alongside Alvaro Gonzalez de Galdeano of
Euskaltel-Euskadi. Escartin consequently cut two seconds off his
lag behind Olano to 36 seconds.
	   Numerous breakaway attempts were neutralized throughout the
stage until Heras opened up the gap during the approach to Segovia.
	   At the end of the day Banesto teamwork ensured Olano kept hold
of the leader's yellow jersey, 22 seconds clear of Frenchman
Laurent Jalabert of the ONCE-Deutsche Bank team.
	   Jalabert suffered during the grueling climb up the Navacerrada
mountain pass, but caught up with Olano and his other main rivals
on the way down.
	   Friday's 20th stage is considered the last chance for the
specialist climbers to attack Olano's dominance of the race
established in the 9th-leg time trial on Sept. 13.
	   The 206-kilometer (127.7-mile) run begins and ends with the
ascent up the Navacerrada pass and includes four other passes
in-between - a tough task for the leader who performs best on the
flat.
	   But on Saturday Olano is due to get another chance to display
his time-trial peddle power in the penultimate leg of the 22-stage
cycling race due to end Sunday in Madrid.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday that
his government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward
for killing British novelist Salman Rushdie, paving the way for

Kosovo rebels say U.N. resolution is useless

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. resolution threatening further action to
stop the fighting in Kosovo is ``good for nothing,'' Swiss-based
representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army said Thursday.
	   Air attacks by NATO on Serb forces are the only possible
solution to end the conflict in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, said KLA spokesman Mahmuti Bardhyl.
	   ``The international community has become a spectator of the
situation in the Balkans,'' Bardhyl said.
	   Serb forces in February launched an offensive against rebels
seeking independence in the majority ethnic Albanian province.
Since then, hundreds have died and more than 275,000 ethnic
Albanian civilians have been driven from hundreds of destroyed
villages.
	   While not mandating NATO action, Wednesday's U.N. Security
Council resolution opened the way for international approval of the
alliance's military involvement.
	   Bardhyl told reporters in Geneva the KLA wouldn't react to the
resolution because it didn't contain any punitive measure against
Serb forces.
	   ``As far as this resolution is concerned, we are of the opinion
that it is good for nothing,'' Jashar Salihu, another KLA spokesman
accompanying Bardhyl, said.
	   Bardhyl said the KLA would only respond to an international call
to negotiate if the conflict ends and the Serb military arsenal is
removed from Kosovo.
	   Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics that constitute
Yugoslavia, have rejected an ethnic Albanian proposal to make
Kosovo a third republic in the federation. Western nations are
proposing restorations
	   Salihu said independence was the only solution the KLA would
accept. He refused to say how many soldiers the KLA had at its
disposal, but said the KLA had a limited number compared to the
Serbs.
	   Talking about the progress of the KLA's fight so far, Salihu
said ``it could be better, but we have done a lot of the job.''

Official: Liberia won't object if warlord is flown from embassy

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The Liberian government will not object
if a former warlord taking refuge in the U.S. embassy is flown out
of the country, the president's spokesman said Thursday.
	   The change in official tone could signal an end may be in sight
to the six-day standoff.
	   Presidential spokesman Reginald Goodridge said it was the United
States' right to do as they wished with Roosevelt Johnson _ at
least for now.
	   Johnson, President Charles Taylor's main rival, has been holed
up in the embassy since Saturday morning, when Liberian soldiers
apparently fired on his group as they were trying to arrange for
refuge at the sprawling seaside compound. At least three of
Johnson's supporters were killed in the shooting and two Americans
were injured.
	   ``If they were to fly him out somewhere we cannot control
that,'' Goodridge said in an interview. ``It would be their
prerogative.''
	   He added, however, the government hopes the United States will
cooperate with Liberia in bringing Johnson to trial on charges of
treason.
	   ``But if they were to agree that they'd make Mr. Johnson
available on demand when the trial begins, I think that could be
acceptable to the Liberian government,'' Goodridge said.
	   Taylor's government has been demanding that Johnson _ along with
two of his supporters and two sons holed up with him _ be handed
over to Liberian authorities.
	   Officials in Washington have been holding high-level discussions
with Taylor's government since the shooting, trying to find an end
to the standoff. Fearing another attack, security has been greatly
increased at the embassy and most diplomats have been evacuated.
	   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special
envoy to Africa, has been doing most of the negotiating, according
to American diplomats and Liberian officials.
	   Johnson's group forced their way through an embassy gate during
the shooting. The U.S. Embassy, which did not want Johnson in the
compound in the first place, now finds itself reluctantly
protecting him.
	   American officials, who say Johnson will not be handed over to
the Liberian government, have said a resolution to the standoff may
involve flying Johnson to a neutral country, though Taylor had
earlier insisted that was unacceptable.
	   Diplomats say the attack on Johnson's group made it clear he
could not receive a fair trial in Liberia.
	   But Goodridge insisted Thursday that Johnson would be treated
justly, saying that representatives from the United States,
international organizations and human rights groups would be
invited to monitor the proceedings.
	   ``We will guarantee that Roosevelt Johnson and his people will
receive a fair trial,'' he said.
	   The crisis with Johnson began Friday when Liberian troops tried
to arrest the former rebel leader. Gun, rocket and mortar battles
erupted in the capital and spilled over toward the U.S. embassy
compound, eyewitnesses had said. At least 47 people were killed in
the weekend fighting.
	   Justice Minister Eddington Varmah had earlier denied that
Liberian forces opened fire at the U.S. Embassy, but Goodridge
acknowledged there had been a shootout between Johnson's supporters
and Liberian soldiers.
	   A Liberian government report on the incident, released Thursday,
said the shooting began when an American security officer fired a
warning shot to keep government forces at bay.
	   Embassy officials could not be reached for comment on that
assertion, but they have said earlier that the Liberian soldiers
opened fire unprovoked and that Johnson and his men were unarmed.
	   Taylor and Johnson have been longtime rivals, heading opposing
factions during Liberia's seven-year civil war.
	   While the two men had ostensibly made peace after Taylor was
elected president last year, Johnson's supporters and government
soldiers have repeatedly clashed over the past few months.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu speech warning Palestinians not to
declare statehood; Picks up 5th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
strongly urged the Palestinians Thursday against declaring
statehood, warning that an annoucement would destroy the peace
process and lead to unspecified Israeli responses.
	   Concerned about Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's plans to use
his upcoming U.N. General Assembly speech to press his case for
Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu used his speech to the world body
to spell out Israel's strong opposition.
	   ``I strongly urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this
course,'' the Israeli leader said. ``Such actions will inevitably
prompt unilateral responses on our part and this development will
not be good for the Palestinians, not good for Israel, not good for
peace.''
	   He said the only way for Israel and the Palestinians to live in
peace is to complete the current talks on a further Israeli
withdrawal and then negotiate a final settlement.
	   ``We must continue to negotiate earnestly, continuously,
tirelessly until the final peace agreement is reached. No other way
will do,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Palestinian officials have said Arafat plans to tell the body
next week of his determination to declare a Palestinian state by
May, with or without Israel's approval. The General Assembly
historically has looked with favor on Palestinian aspirations.
	   Netanyahu told a news conference Wednesday that interim Oslo
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians specifically rule
out such unilateral declarations, reserving statehood as an issue
to be settled between the two sides.
	   In his General Assembly speech, Netanyahu said failure by the
Israelis and Palestinians to meet deadlines in those accords do not
kill the accords themselves.
	   ``An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state in
disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo would constitute a
fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It would cause the
complete collapse of the process,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's prime minister returned to work
Thursday, after more than three weeks on sick leave to recover from
depression and build inner strength to face unprecedented
challenges.
	   ``I'm healthy. I have a (doctor's) certificate in my bag,''
Kjell Magne Bondevik at a news conference. ``I can handle the
pressure.''
	   There will be plenty of it. The 51-year-old Lutheran clergyman
can expect a tough battle in the coming weeks, when his minority
coalition needs to find support in parliament for its proposed 1999
national budget.
	   ``Back to a new political nightmare,'' wrote Norway's largest
newspaper, Verdens Gang.
	   Bondevik took a one-week sick leave on Aug. 30 to recover from
what his office called ``a depressive reaction to overwork.'' The
leave was extended to 3 1/2 weeks.
	   At his news conference Thursday afternoon, Bondevik described
the experience as ``hitting the wall.''
	   ``In a way, I felt I had an unlimited capacity. Naturally, I did
not,'' he said. ``My strength was gradually being tapped more than
I realized.''
	   The Norwegian news media, which generally respect the privacy of
public figures, allowed Bondevik to recover in peace.
	   Opposition politicians refused to use the sick leave against
Christian Democratic Bondevik, and the public was largely
sympathetic.
	   In a typical gesture, Bondevik's neighbors _ apparently
believing the prime minister needed a few more minutes of quiet _
tried to convince reporters gathered outside his home Thursday
morning that he had already left for work. Bondevik was still at
home.
	   During his leave, Bondevik _ who refused to go into details of
his treatment _ spent much of his time at a mountain cabin, taking
long walks, and playing Yahtzee with his family.
	   ``My family was the best medicine,'' he said.
	   While sympathetic during his sick leave, the political
opposition and news media said he cannot expect special treatment
now that he is back on the job.
	   ``Bondevik needs to convince us that he is strong enough to be
prime minister, and that he can stand the strain,'' an editorial in
Verdens Gang said Thursday.
	   The prime minister said his depression was a passing ailment,
unlikely to be repeated.
	   ``As a human begin, I have learned a lesson about what a refined
instrument the human body and soul is,'' said Bondevik. ``As prime
minister, I have learned a lesson about the need to set limits.''
	   When Bondevik's black BMW rolled up to the government quarter in
Oslo in the morning, taxi driver Omed Majed, an Iranian Kurd who
has lived in Norway for 10 years, was waiting. He gave an armful of
red roses to the prime minister.
	   ``He is a good man,'' Majed said afterwards.
	   Early in his term, Bondevik had strong support in opinion polls.
However, his government has been rattled by economic pressures.
Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, has been stung by
low crude prices.
	   When he took over last October, Norway's economy was at the peak
of a boom that analysts said could not last. Last month, the value
of Norway's currency, the krone, was hard hit by speculators and
interest rates soared, signaling market doubts that Bondevik's
coalition had the backbone needed to make tough budget cuts.
	   The moderate coalition of the Christian Democrats, the Center
and the Liberals needs support from other parties in Parliament for
what is likely to be a tight 1999 budget. Already split on where to
make cuts, newspapers said there is a good chance the coalition
could collapse over the budget.

Montgomerie and Singh among trio to lead German Masters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie, seeking to become Europe's
leading money earner for a sixth straight year, fired a 7-under-par
65 Thursday to share the first round lead at the German Masters.
	   The Scotsman scattered seven birdies and no bogies on a sunny
windless day at the dlrs 1.69 million event to join PGA champion
Vijah Singh and England's Lee Phillips at the top of the
leaderboard.
	   Montgomerie, shaking off a mid-season slump, has made a late
charge to climb to within dlrs 63,000 of leader Lee Westwood of
England in the Order-of-Merit.
	   ``I'm happy to have a first day like this in my pocket _ that
gives me confidence,'' said Montgomerie. ``The key to my game today
was the putting.''
	   But the 25-year-old Westwood was among five players one stroke
back at 6-under-66. There are three tournaments left in the yearly
earnings race.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, second in the Order-of-Merit,
was four back on the leaderboard after settling for a 69.
	   Both Singh and Westwood, playing partners, roared to torrid
starts before ending their rounds with a string of pars.
	   Singh, making his first appearance in Europe since capturing his
major at Seattle five weeks ago, sank three birdies on his first
four holes. He was 5-under after his first nine.
	   Westwood fired birdies on his first four holes before cooling
off with an eighth hole bogey.
	   Montgomerie, who missed several cuts during the worst of his
slump, spent extra time at the driving range before his opening
round.
	   ``I'm working hard to get my rhythm, but I'm thinking too much
during my round,'' he said. ``I putted well enough for a 9-under
round, but my game was only good enough for a 7-under.''
	   Joining Westwood at 66 was Germany's Sven Struever, Englishmen
Richard Boxall and Ian Garbutt and Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin.
	   Struever, 31, is the only German to win a tour title this year,
having captured Crans-sur-Sierre earlier this month.
	   ``You can make good strokes when the conditions are perfect,''
said Struever.
	   Bernhard Langer, the defending champion still seeking his
elusive 11th title in his native Germany, settled for a 69.

UNITED NATIONS: Robin Cook

<TEXT>
	   Cook, who met Kharrazi on the sidelines of the United Nations
General Assembly session, said he was delighted with Iran's
decision, and that Britain was ready to exchange ambassadors with
Tehran.
	   Kharrazi's comments stopped short of lifting Iran's death
sentence on Rushdie, but was an important step in improving ties
strained over the issue.
	   Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious edict
in 1989, saying Rushdie had committed blasphemy against Islam in
his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' He said Rushdie should be
killed.
	   The semi-official Khordad Foundation offered a dlrs 2.5 million
reward for killing Rushdie.
	   Cook said that Kharrazi's ``assurances should make possible a
much more constructive relationship between the United Kingdom, and

	   ``Dr. Kharrazi and I have, accordingly, agreed that we should
upgrade the level of our diplomatic relations to ambassadorial
level,'' Cook told reporters.

Fire breaks out during renovation of Van Gogh museum; No paintings

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Fire broke out in the Van Gogh
Museum Thursday during renovation work. A spokeswoman said she had
no immediate details of the damage, but confirmed that there were
no paintings in the museum.
	   ``There is no art in there,'' said Rianne Norbart.
	   The museum is usually home to a priceless collection of more
than 200 Van Gogh paintings, but it closed its doors to the public
earlier this month and shipped all its exhibits to other museums or
into storage while the building undergoes a nine-month facelift.
	   Amsterdam police spokesman Fons van der Berg said fire swept
through the museum's basement. Police cleared surrounding streets
because of fears that gas bottles in the basement might explode.
	   Eyewitnesses said thick black smoke billowed out of the building
shortly after 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). Fire fighters rushed to the scene
and quickly had the blaze under control. The cause of the fire was
not immediately known.
	   During renovation work, most of the museum's Van Goghs are being
displayed at the nearby Rijksmuseum. But 70 were shipped to the
United States to go on show first at the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, D.C., from Oct. 4 and later at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art.

Minister considering tents to house asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government is
considering pitching tents to house asylum seekers as a growing
stream of refugees threatens to overwhelm the 42,000 beds provided
for them.
	   If the current flood of applicants continues, beds will be
needed for 50,000 people by year's end, Werner van Bastelaar of the
Asylum Seeker Accommodation Center said Thursday.
	   The government-funded organization runs a nationwide network of
centers housing refugees in everything from caravans to disused
army barracks, but demand for beds continues to outpace supply.
	   ``If we can't house these people in the traditional way, we will
have to look for less conventional alternatives and tents are a
possibility,'' Dutch Justice Secretary Job Cohen told Dutch
television Wednesday night.
	   Last year, 35,000 people applied for asylum in the Netherlands,
which has welcomed oppressed since the British Pilgrims headed who
sheltered here before boarding the Mayflower on their journey to
America.
	   Cohen was speaking from Brussels where he was attending a
meeting of European Union ministers called to discuss the issue of
asylum seekers. He was expected to raise the Dutch problem with
other E.U. member states who are less welcoming to refugees.
	   In August, more than 3,700 people applied for asylum in this
overcrowded nation of 16 million. In January, only 2,900 applied.
	   A year ago, a small group of asylum seekers caused a national
uproar when they set up a tent village in a northern forest,
claiming they had nowhere else to go because their applications had
been rejected and their countries of origin would not take them
back.
	   But this time, the government seems resigned to tent-pitching as
perhaps the only way to put a roof over the heads of new arrivals
before winter.
	   The majority of asylum seekers entering the Netherlands come
from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Bosnia, Justice Ministry
spokeswoman Maud Brederp said. The influx may further swell as
refugees flee fighting in the Serb province of Kosovo.
	   Many asylum seekers arrive in the Netherlands because of its
reputation for taking care of refugees while they await the outcome
of their asylum applications _ a process which can take months.
	   Brederp said the Dutch want to see asylum procedures harmonized
throughout the European Union, which would diminish the
Netherlands' appeal.
	   At the moment, refugees tour Europe until they reach the
Netherlands ``and they think, `Hey, this is the place to be,'''
Brederp said.

Iran disassociates itself from reward for killing Rushdie

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday his
government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for
killing British novelist Salman Rushdie, clearing the way for
upgrading strained ties with Britain.
	   The Iranian ``government disassociates itself from any reward
which has been offered in this regard and does not support it,''
Kamal Kharrazi said after a meeting with his British counterpart,
Robin Cook.
	   Cook, who met Kharrazi on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly session, said he was delighted with Iran's decision, and
that Britain was ready to exchange ambassadors with Tehran.
	   ``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive
relationship between the United Kingdom, and I believe the European
Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our
relations,'' Cook said after the meeting.
	   ``Dr. Kharrazi and I have, accordingly, agreed that we should
upgrade the level of our diplomatic relations to ambassadorial
level,'' Cook told reporters.
	   Kharrazi's comments stopped short of lifting Iran's death
sentence on Rushdie, but was an important step in improving ties
strained over the issue.
	   Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious edict
in 1989, saying Rushdie had committed blasphemy against Islam in
his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' He said Rushdie should be
killed.
	   The semi-official Khordad Foundation offered a dlrs 2.5 million
reward for killing Rushdie.

Indonesia considering independent investigators into Suharto's
</HEADLINE>
wealth &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's government is considering
hiring independent investigators to probe the wealth of former
President Suharto, an official said Thursday.
	   A spokesman of the Attorney General's office, Soehandoyo, said a
discussion over the proposal focused on the potential authority of
such commission to interrogate, investigate and if necessary,
prosecute Suharto if it finds evidence of massive corruption. The
U.S. magazine Forbes estimates his wealth at dlrs 4 billion.
	   Suharto denies allegations of massive corruption during his 32
years in power. the 77-year-old Suharto stepped down in May after a
wave of riots and protests against his autocratic rule.
	   Noted lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution proposed establishing an
independent commission, saying Indonesians would only accept the
findings of such an investigation.
	   ``The matter is still being studied,'' Soehandoyo said.
	   The government, staffed by former Suharto supporters including
President B.J. Habibie, has promised a full and thorough inquiry.
But critics have cast doubt on the investigation saying the
government has neither the will nor expertise to search for
ill-gotten wealth.
	   Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib currently heads the
government investigation team.
	   Ghalib and senior Cabinet minister Hartarto Sastrosoenarto
visited Suharto on Monday night, when he again denied stashing
money in overseas accounts. The former leader also has offered to
supply a full list of his assets and to sign a letter authorizing
foreign banks to open up their records to investigators.
	   His denial, however, was greeted with disbelief by many
Indonesians struggling during the worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   The proposed commission includes Muslim leaders Abdurrahman
Wahid and Amin Rais, who is known for criticizing the government's
handling of the case.
	   Ghalib, has also proposed an ``expert council'' headed by the
Nasution himself, to help the government team.

Heras wing 19th stage, Olano still top with three stages to go
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rise up overall standings for Heras; CORRECTS
absolute and relative finishing times &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEGOVIA, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Roberto Heras of the Kelme-Costa
Blanca team won the 19th leg of the Tour of Spain cycling marathon
on Thursday, peddling past the finishing line 30 seconds ahead of
his nearest rivals.
	   Tour leader Abraham Olano of Spain and the Banesto team arrived
along with the other favorites one second later, leaving the
overall standings little changed with just three stages to go.
	   Heras covered the 170.4-kilometer (105.6-mile) run between the
cities of Avila and Segovia in the mountains north of Madrid in 4
hours, 13 minutes and 26 seconds. The win allowed Heras to leapfrog
up the leadership table to No. 5, although he remained over two
minutes behind Olano.
	   Teammate, fellow Spaniard and current overall No. 4 Fernando
Escartin came in next, alongside Alvaro Gonzalez de Galdeano of
Euskaltel-Euskadi. Escartin consequently cut one second off his lag
behind Olano to 37 seconds.
	   Numerous breakaway attempts were neutralized throughout the
stage until Heras opened up the gap during the approach to Segovia.
	   At the end of the day Banesto teamwork ensured Olano kept hold
of the leader's yellow jersey, 22 seconds clear of Frenchman
Laurent Jalabert of the ONCE-Deutsche Bank team.
	   Jalabert suffered during the grueling climb up the Navacerrada
mountain pass, but caught up with Olano and his other main rivals
on the way down.
	   Friday's 20th stage is considered the last chance for the
specialist climbers to attack Olano's dominance of the race
established in the 9th-leg time trial on Sept. 13.
	   The 206-kilometer (127.7-mile) run begins and ends with the
ascent up the Navacerrada pass and includes four other passes
in-between - a tough task for the leader who performs best on the
flat.
	   But on Saturday Olano is due to get another chance to display
his time-trial peddle power in the penultimate leg of the 22-stage
cycling race due to end Sunday in Madrid.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   The Independent, London, on U.S. politics:
	   As the watching world faces economic crisis, the last superpower
has turned inwards, choosing to torture its own leader rather than
face real policy decisions. This obsessive interest does not only
betray the outside world; it subverts the very ideals of the United
States.
	   There are convicted criminals serving long sentences in American
jails who have not had their testimony before such proceedings
published. Yesterday's video has reached the public in defiance of
this, under Congressional privilege. It has been released because
Republicans wish to hurt a Democrat President, not because they
wish to uphold the law.
	   If it is not too late for the president to bow to censure, and
clearly admit that he lied, then he should do so. Congress should
halt the stream of gossip that seems to pass for evidence, and deal
impartially and quickly with the case. If the president has to
leave office, then so be it; but at least the affair should be
conducted with dignity, true to the ideals of the founding fathers
of the United States of America.
	    &UR; ___
	   Daily Mail, London, on President Clinton:
	   If Clinton has blustered and squirmed about his squalid affair
with an infatuated intern young enough to be his daughter, then his
Republican pursuers in Congress have displayed contemptible
cynicism. They have been anxious to wound, but afraid to strike.
	   Even as we watched Clinton on one TV monitor playing his
pathetic sex games with the truth, there, on another monitor, we
could see Clinton wearing his statesmanlike expression and
addressing the United Nations about the threat of international
terrorism. No film director could have invented a double-take at
once so surreal and so profoundly sad. What we were witnessing
yesterday was the failure of Clinton the great communicator to
rescue Clinton the cornered perjurer from the pit of humiliation.
	   Now, whether or not he's impeached ... whether or not he quits
one step ahead of the Congressional posse ... he's finished.
	   He can still go through the motions on the world stage. But as
long as he remains, he will be a dirty joke.
	   As the ever-darkening shadow of global recession looms over all
our livelihoods, can we really afford to have the engine economy of
America presided over by a dead duck who won't lie down?
	    &UR; ___
	   Frankfurter Allgemeine, Frankfurt, Germany, on President
Clinton:
	   Does President Clinton deserve this public humiliation? Does his
statement satisfy the desires of the grand jury ... about his
relationship with his previous aide Lewinsky ... to the repulsion
of the Europeans? Or does it fulfill a higher purpose? The result
is: The publishing of the video interview and a thick volume of
back-up evidence poses a disaster, an embarrassment, never to be
outdone, to the history of the presidency. ...
	   The Republican majority in the House of Representatives have
Americans and the statement of Clinton in their hands. ... It has
the signs of arrogant political execution purposes. ...
	   What happened on Monday was an example of personal degradation.
But the true instigator of these degrading antics was none other
than the person in the middle, Clinton. He acted undignified in his
office. ... Just as the president can not prevent himself from
further destruction, his personal authority and credibility will
never come back. It is tragic, not strange: A president confuses
himself under oath on the details of anatomy, and the world looks
on.
	    &UR; ___
	   Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on Malaysia's
crackdown:
	   The summary arrests of Anwar Ibrahim on Sunday night and four
leading members of the Malaysian Muslim Youth Movement on Monday
are a sign of desperation on the part of the Malaysian Prime
Minister, Dr. Mahathir. Far from securing his position, this clumsy
act of raw power under the Internal Security Act _ which allows
indefinite detention without trial _ has increased the likelihood
of his own downfall, sooner rather than later. It has also
underlined the fundamental weakness of an authoritarian system of
government which has not developed sufficiently to provide, in
times of stress, an orderly transfer of power if and when that is
needed. ...
	   When the time comes for supposedly serious charges to be laid
against someone in Anwar's position, the first reaction is to
disbelieve them, and suspect a politically motivated smear
campaign, thuggishly enforced by outdated security laws. Dr.
Mahathir might have the upper hand for the moment. But this is a
power struggle with a long way to run yet. The forces for change
might not be wholly with Anwar. But they are definitely against Dr.
Mahathir.

	   The Indian Express, New Delhi, India, on American democracy:
	   While America plays out its domestic soap opera, key pillars of
the Pax Americana are being shaken severely in the world outside.
Clinton continued former president Bush's crusade for a world order
based on democracy, nonproliferation and the free market. But
people and events have been overturning many of those certainties.
	   From East Asia and Japan to Russia and Brazil, free market ideas
are under assault. The gurus of the free movement of capital across
national frontiers are yielding place to revisionists and advocates
of capital controls. Washington's carefully constructed
nonproliferation regime has been coming apart.
	   Americans may like to blame the shortcomings of foreigners for
these setbacks to the good life. But they can only blame their own
leaders' lack of restraint and common sense for the sad image
American-style democracy is acquiring abroad just now.

	   Corriere della Sera, Milan, Italy, on President Clinton:
	   Americans would like to punish Bill Clinton for his lies, but
don't want to give up his leadership, which has brought them six
years of peace and prosperity. ...
	   Whatever Clinton's next moves will be, and whatever strategy the
Republicans will use, all the future scenarios might be changed by
the Nov. 3 election.
	   Clinton has transformed the election into a sort of personal
referendum. If the Democrats lose ground, they will blame Clinton
and eventually ask for his resignation. But if that doesn't happen,
the Republicans won't be able to impeach the President.
	   Either way, Clinton's destiny will be decided by that election,
and therefore by American people, even if not directly. ...
	   This scandal has not only hit Clinton, or Kenneth Starr, or the
Republicans. It has hit the United States. And the United States
cannot wait too long for this to be over. Neither can the
international community and the global finance.
	    &UR; ___
	   Der Bund, Bern, Switzerland, on American democracy:
	   If the French president cultivated an unusual extramarital
relationship, it would be fully exploited by the media. A majority
of the fellow citizens perhaps would shrug their shoulders, as in
the case of Francois Mitterrand, if the existence of an
illegitimate daughter became public. But it would never turn into a
witch hunt, no judicial investigation would be initiated. Because
the French are less bigoted than the Americans?
	   The deeper reason lies elsewhere: according to Article 9 of the
French constitution, the private life of the president of the
republic is protected. The basic law of the Americans, an example
for so many other constitutions, doesn't have this protection of
privacy. ... The bird still hasn't been caught, but the damage to
the democratic system of the United States since Monday has been
irreparable.
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on U.S.-Japan plan for missile defense
system:
	   Japan and the United States are about to begin a joint project
to develop sea-based missile technology to shoot down tiny enemy
missiles as they descend at high speed from outer space.
	   The technical feasibility of the system is far from known. As a
matter of fact, the United States has so far conducted `theater
high altitude area defense' tests with land-to-air missiles five
times and has failed every time. There is no plan as yet for a
sixth test.
	   There are too many wild cards. How much money do we have to chip
in before the TMD system is complete? Is the plan compatible with
the Diet resolution on the peaceful use of space technology? ...
	   Moreover, the system will mean that Japan's security will be
dependent on the United States' telecommunication system. The
possibility exists that the new system will leave Japan in a
position where it is even harder for it to have an independent say
in security matters. This would not be desirable for promoting
healthy relations with the United States.
	   The government should disclose more information about the TMD
plan and promote deeper discussions about the wisdom of taking part
in it. It is essential, in particular, to debate the merits of the
TMD in the Diet.

	   Clarin, Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Bosnian elections:
	   Three years after the end of the war of extermination that tore
apart the republic of Bosnia Herzegovina, in the heart of the
Balkans, the survivors have returned to elect ... a future
government, in elections carried out under strict international
supervision. The results, however, have signaled frustration for
the hopes of the international community, which was bidding to
integrate the different political and ethnic forces in a formula of
coexistence between the three groups of confrontation: Serb
Bosnians, Croats and Muslims. Those parties seeking the
reconstruction of the country did not prosper. ... The Serb, Croat
and Muslim parties that won the elections represent the same forces
that unleashed the civil war at the outset of this decade. The
viability of a multinational state in Bosnia (thus) remains in
doubt, and with it, efforts to pacify and rebuild that devastated
corner of Europe.

	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on President Clinton:
	   Americans ought also to be disturbed by the decision to release
the videotape which challenges long-standing secrecy rules for
witnesses at grand jury proceedings.
	   Mr Clinton can choose to harness public sympathy and fight back.
But the big question for him should be not what he can to his
opponents, but what he can accomplish for the United States _ and
by extension the world _ if he clings to office. The sad conclusion
is that Mr. Clinton is likely to be increasingly distracted by his
personal battle, and matters of state will fall by the wayside.
	   For a man who values his place in history, the best way out
should be a quick, dignified exit.
	    &UR; ___
	   Gwinnett Daily Post, Lawrenceville, Georgia, on President
Clinton:
	   Bill Clinton should resign as president of the United States.
	   Not because his failure to do so will result in his impeachment,
though it is almost certain impeachment proceedings will be begun
so that the evidence to support such an action can be measured
against the standards set by the U.S. Constitution.
	   Not because the conduct of his personal life has shown him to be
a man lacking in moral integrity and strength of character, though
there certainly is ample evidence to show such is the case.
	   Not because of the disdain he has shown for the people of the
nation and the once-proud office which they have entrusted to him,
though it is clear he has little respect for the presidency or
those whose votes gave him the opportunity to serve in such a
position a power.
	   Not because he has shown a wanton disregard for the law and the
judicial process, though certainly his duplicity has proven that to
be true.
	   Not because he has diminished the standing of the United Stages
on the stage of world politics, though there is little doubt that
is the case.
	   Not because his scandal-ridden administration has proven to be
an embarrassment and a disgrace, though it has been and continues
to be.
	   But for all those reasons, and one more important still.
	   He can no longer lead the nation. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on President Clinton:
	   One of the most disturbing aspects of the controversy swirling
around President Bill Clinton is what appears to be a widespread
misunderstanding among Americans of why lying under oath is a
serious crime. ...
	   If parties to a legal action cannot be forced to tell the truth,
the entire justice system collapses.
	   This compelling need of the government to get the truth has the
potential to conflict with an individual citizen's right to protect
himself. The Founders recognized this, and provided for it in the
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. A citizen cannot lie under
oath with impunity, but he can refuse to answer questions, and his
refusal cannot be considered as evidence of guilt. ...
	   Although some of his supporters may not know this, Bill Clinton
certainly does. As chief executive, he is the chief law enforcement
officer of the nation. He is a lawyer. He taught in law school. If,
as now appears likely, he swore to tell the truth and then violated
that oath, not once but numerous times in at least two venues, he
committed a serious crime that the nation can ignore only at its
peril.

Montgomerie and Singh among trio to lead German Masters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS datelin, Lee Phillips to Van Phillips in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie, seeking to become
Europe's leading money earner for a sixth straight year, fired a
7-under-par 65 Thursday to share the first round lead at the German
Masters.
	   The Scotsman scattered seven birdies and no bogies on a sunny
windless day at the dlrs 1.69 million event to join PGA champion
Vijah Singh and England's Van Phillips at the top of the
leaderboard.
	   Montgomerie, shaking off a mid-season slump, has made a late
charge to climb to within dlrs 63,000 of leader Lee Westwood of
England in the Order-of-Merit.
	   ``I'm happy to have a first day like this in my pocket _ that
gives me confidence,'' said Montgomerie. ``The key to my game today
was the putting.''
	   But the 25-year-old Westwood was among five players one stroke
back at 6-under-66. There are three tournaments left in the yearly
earnings race.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, second in the Order-of-Merit,
was four back on the leaderboard after settling for a 69.
	   Both Singh and Westwood, playing partners, roared to torrid
starts before ending their rounds with a string of pars.
	   Singh, making his first appearance in Europe since capturing his
major at Seattle five weeks ago, sank three birdies on his first
four holes. He was 5-under after his first nine.
	   Westwood fired birdies on his first four holes before cooling
off with an eighth hole bogey.
	   Montgomerie, who missed several cuts during the worst of his
slump, spent extra time at the driving range before his opening
round.
	   ``I'm working hard to get my rhythm, but I'm thinking too much
during my round,'' he said. ``I putted well enough for a 9-under
round, but my game was only good enough for a 7-under.''
	   Joining Westwood at 66 was Germany's Sven Struever, Englishmen
Richard Boxall and Ian Garbutt and Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin.
	   Struever, 31, is the only German to win a tour title this year,
having captured Crans-sur-Sierre earlier this month.
	   ``You can make good strokes when the conditions are perfect,''
said Struever.
	   Bernhard Langer, the defending champion still seeking his
elusive 11th title in his native Germany, settled for a 69.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new prime minister finally mapped out a
strategy Thursday for climbing out of Russia's deep economic chasm,
including payments to the poor to compensate for inflation that
could exceed 500 percent this year.
	   Two weeks after he was appointed, Yevgeny Primakov offered at
least portions of his long-awaited economic plan to his
still-incomplete Cabinet. There were no real surprises.
	   As he has hinted in the past, Primakov proposed greater
government intervention in the economy and a more tightly knit
social safety net. But he made it clear that there would be no
return to Soviet-style state socialism.
	   He said the government would impose tighter control over the
liquor industry, always a potent source of revenue, but would not
nationalize it. He promised better tax collection _ a pledge that
no Russian government yet has been able to meet _ and said Russia
would appeal to international lenders to make good on promised
loans.
	   At the same time, two of his top economic aides issued sharp
warnings to Western investors and lenders.
	   Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko said Russia wanted to
work out a settlement with foreign banks that hold billions of
dollars worth of Russian government bonds that are currently
frozen.
	   But he warned: ``Those who are stubborn in their greediness may
end up getting nothing.''
	   First Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin said a deadline for the
banks to apply for a new deal on repayment of the bonds had been
pushed back from Sept. 26 to Oct. 2. Russian officials have been
meeting with representatives of international banks since Wednesday
and so far no agreement on mutually acceptable terms has been
reached.
	   Shokhin also warned that Russia could default on its
international debt if the International Monetary Fund does not
continue to extend financial help to Russia in the coming months.

Government suspends plans to expand biological center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government on Thursday suspended
plans to expand a scientific institute, after a Supreme Court
appeal by a small town that believes the institute is manufacturing
biological weapons.
	   Nes Tsiona, a bedroom community south of Tel Aviv, filed suit in
Israel's Supreme Court to stop the expansion plan. It said the
expansion would endanger the city's residents, some of whom live
only a few hundred meters (yards) from the center.
	   Just before the court was to decide on the appeal Thursday,
government attorneys agreed to suspend the expansion project until
a comprehensive environmental impact study is completed.
	   Nes Tsiona spokesman Tsahi Braverman hailed the move and said it
was likely to delay the expansion project for years.
	   The town filed the suit after Israeli newspapers reported that
the institute may be manufacturing biological weapons. They cited a
report by the British weekly magazine Foreign Report.
	   Braverman said ``bacteria from the center, as reported in
foreign media, could endanger Israelis from Tel Aviv to Ashdod.''
That area includes half of Israel's population.
	   Braverman said the impact study will be conducted by Israel's
environment ministry and not the defense ministry, which is
sponsoring the expansion project. Also, government lawyers agreed
to let Nes Tsiona officials appear before a closed-door committee
that meets on defense facilities.
	   The city had asked the court to halt the project altogether, but
Braverman said the compromise was just as good.
	   ``As far as we're concerned, the survey can take 100 years,'' he
said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Solana, Cohen quotes. TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; NATO: Bosnian election results not all that bad
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ The NATO allies pledged on Thursday
not to abandon Bosnia despite disappointing election results there
but some countries expressed concern at the high cost of Bosnian
peacekeeping.
	   The international peacekeeping force ``will continue to play a
pro-active role'' in maintaining peace and security in Bosnia, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana told reporters outside a NATO
defense ministers meeting.
	   ``We will not abandon Bosnia.''
	   Even so, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the allies
``hope that the military forces and missions can shrink as civilian
authorities play a larger role.''
	   The allies will complete a review of the peacekeeping operation
in December.
	   International officials had hoped the Sept. 12-13 elections _
the third in three post-war years _ would further sideline radical
nationalists opposed to ethnic tolerance and other provisions of
the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war.
	   The ballot's results won't be known until Friday. However,
initial indications are that extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen
has defeated Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic _ the favorite
of the international community _ in the presidential race.
	   Even so, Plavsic's showing was slightly up on the country's last
ballot, while the hardliners were slightly down.
	   ``The results are not all that we'd hoped for ... but they're
not an unmitigated disaster either,'' said a NATO official, who
spoke to reporters here on condition of anonymity.
	   Solana insisted that ``this is not a time for the international
community to hesitate.'' He cautioned, ``Bosnia has no future if it
returns to the extremism and suspicions of the past.''
	   Officials said the allies welcomed the fact the elections were
``free and fair'' and also the agreement of moderate Bosnian Serb
leaders agreed to work together towards implementing democratic
processes.
	   The West has deployed a 35,000-strong NATO-led multinational
peacekeeping force, known as the Stabilization Force or SFOR, and
invested billions of dollars a year to help rebuild Bosnia.
	   But efforts to bring Serbs, Croats and Muslims together again
have shown little result, and civilian projects are proceeding
slowly.
	   ``We can't allow a situation where peace entirely depends on the
presence of SFOR. We don't want to create a dependence culture,''

Governments kick off preparations for new trade talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ As Brussels called for a comprehensive new round
of trade talks, the United States joined India and other developing
nations at the World Trade Organization Thursday in urging caution.
	   Peter Carl of the 15-nation European Union told a special WTO
meeting that a new round should tackle new areas, such as the
creation of new international rules for competition and investment,
as well as traditional topics of services and agriculture. The
meeting is the first of a series held to prepare for new trade
negotiations due to begin next year.
	   However, United States trade representative Rita Hayes told
governments that new issues need to be ``carefully considered''
before they are put on the agenda.
	   She argued for a gradual approach, saying negotiators should be
able to tear down barriers in individual areas without waiting for
agreement on all issues.
	   Some developing countries have been wary of talk of a
comprehensive round, arguing they should be given breathing space
first to sort out problems and enforce existing trade accords.
	   Indian trade officials told the meeting that implementation of
existing agreements must take top priority and special treatment
for developing countries must be given importance.
	   Officials told the meeting a comprehensive new trade round would
be ``premature.''
	   Egyptian trade officials, speaking on behalf of African nations,
told the meeting that, despite being home to 700 million people,
they were becoming increasingly marginalized in the multilateral
trading system. Africa's share in value terms of global trade had
dropped from 5.9 percent in 1980 to 2.3 percent in 1996, they said.
	   Brazilian trade officials said implementation of existing
commitments should take top priority.
	   Japanese trade officials favored a comprehensive series of talks
covering new areas as well as traditional issues.
	   Many countries favored completing the talks within three years
and spoke out against protectionism in favor of free trade, trade
officials said.

Libyan gunboat reportedly fires on Italian fishing boat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Italian Foreign Ministry
statement, details of attack. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Libyan gunboat rammed and fired on an Italian
fishing boat 30 miles off the Libyan coast on Thursday, killing one
of 10 fishermen aboard.
	   The reason for the confrontation was not immediately known.
Italy's Foreign Ministry said it appeared the Libyan navy had not
received authorization for the use of force and said the Libyan
government had expressed regret.
	   The attack occurred around 2 a.m., when the gunboat rammed and
opened fire on the Sicilian fishing boat Orchidea, carrying a crew
of six Italians and four Tunisians, according to Italian news
reports.
	   Six of the crew members ended up in the water; four remained on
board to fight a fire sparked by the attack, news reports said. The
man who died _ engineer Rosario Margiotta, 52 _ was among those who
stayed, the reports said.
	   By afternoon, the Orchidea was under tow, according to reports
reaching its base.
	   Italy immediately protested to Libyan authorities and demanded
an explanation, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   Libya stressed its intent to avoid any repeat of the attack, the
Foreign Ministry said.
	   Italy noted the attack came at a time of ``positive
developments'' in relations between the two countries. Premier
Romano Prodi's government has been pushing the West to improve
relations with Libya, which is under U.N. sanctions for allegedly
sheltering terrorists.
	   In July, Italy and Libya signed an accord on terrorism, human
rights and weapons proliferation.

Ugandan Coffee Export Prices Dn; Tracking Weak Intl Mkt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Export prices for Ugandan robusta coffee
remained weak Thursday, even though the amount of coffee available
has declined, due to the low level of prices on the international
market, dealers told Dow Jones Thursday.
	   ``Export prices for our coffee are low, in spite of the low
volumes in the country, due to weak offers at the world market,''
said a Kampala based exporter.
	   Uganda's exports are declining as the 1998-99 season draws to an
end.
	   Some fresh coffee is coming in from northern Tanzania but demand
still remains higher than the supply.
	   Tight supply has pushed local procurement prices in Kampala to
between 1,650 and 1,700 Ugandan Shillings (UGX), up from about
UGX1,400 a month ago. (UGX1270 &QC; US1)
	   Dealers said premium screen 18 coffee was exported at 71.52
cents a pound (22.046 pounds &QC;  1 ton), 6 cents higher than the
indicative price of 65.52 cents/lb issued by the state-run Uganda
Coffee Development Authority (UCDA).	   Other robusta grades sold 5 cents/lb above the UCDA's indicative
prices.
	   Dealers said screen 18 traded at a 98.3 cent discount to the
benchmark Liffe September coffee futures contract. The Liffe
September contract closed at dlrs 1,671 a metric ton Wednesday.
	   Exporters said screen 15 sold at 70.52 cents/lb, screen 15 at
62.52 cents, BHP 1199 at 56.52 cents, BHP 10.13 at 31.52 cents and
Black Beans at 26.52 cents/lb. All prices are basis of FOR/T (free
on rail/ truck) Kampala.
	   However, exporters said the depreciating shilling is working in
their favor, as they receive a higher exchange rate when they
convert their dollar-based coffee earnings into local currency.
	   The Ugandan shilling has depreciated to UGX1,270 against the
dollar, from UGX1,235 early September.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMS; UPDATES with Milosevic declares stamping out
terrorism ``top national priority;'' no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VASILEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Yugoslav jets streaked overhead,
frightened Kosovo civilians streamed southward Thursday, trying to
escape a Serb police and Yugoslav army offensive which has trapped
hundreds of ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav government reacted with defiance
Thursday to a U.N. Security Council demand that President Slobodan
Milosevic halt the seven-month crackdown on ethnic Albanian
secessionists and enter talks on Kosovo's future.
	   The ruling Socialist Party, in a meeting chaired by Milosevic,
blamed ``Albanian separatism and terrorism'' for the crisis and
declared that ``rooting out terrorism'' was the top national
priority.
	   In Kosovo, artillery and tank fire thundered across the central
Drenica region Thursday, although it appeared the level had
fighting was lower than in previous days.
	   Nevertheless, thousands of terrified and exhausted refugees _
men, women and children _ were streaming south to escape the
fighting. Several of them approached foreign reporters, asking them
whether NATO would soon intervene.
	   ``All of our houses were burned,'' said one refugee, Kaytaz
Hysni, 59. ``Even our bread was inside.'
	   About every 20 minutes, Yugoslav jets streaked overhead,
apparently on reconnaissance missions. Refugee children would pick
up sticks and pretend to fire guns at the planes.
	   The Serbian Media Center said police had ``closed the ring
around strong groups of Albanian extremists,'' destroying their
bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown Feb. 28 to destroy the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia. Albanians form 90 percent of the
province's 2 million people.
	   As the refugees streamed past, small groups of uniformed KLA
fighters were hiding in the bushes. They appeared exhausted _ even
beaten _ after the sustained Serbian assault.
	   A 23-year-old KLA fighter, who said he left a factory job in
Germany four months ago to join the rebels, said Serb forces had
them cornered and there was no escape.
	   ``They are there, there and there,'' he said, pointing to three
hilltops. ``We can't leave. We'll only live if we win or if NATO
threatens Milosevic to stop.''
	   A rebel commander, who gave his name only as Milushi, said Serb
police had arrested about 200 Albanian men of military age and were
holding them at a factory. He insisted they were all civilians.
	   ``They steal their things, burn their houses and then take them
hostage,'' Milushi said.
	   In Vilamoura, Portugal, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said the Alliance was moving ``to an increased level of military
preparedness'' without actually approving the use of force.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   But an aide to the chief Albanian political leader in Kosovo,
Ibrahim Rugova, said U.N. and NATO moves may have already come too
late.
	   ``The resolution is a good step, but it came too late because
half of Kosovo is already destroyed and burned,'' the aide, Enver
Maljoku, said. ``I don't think Milosevic will take this message
from the U.N. seriously, and I'm afraid that he'll have enough time
to destroy the other half of Kosovo too.''

Ukraine's government tries to prevent public fear of financial
</HEADLINE>
collapse &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's regional government leaders
agreed Thursday to start a nationwide information campaign to
restore confidence in the falling national currency and arrest the
continual increase in prices.
	   The participants in the meeting of the Council of Regions, which
was chaired by President Leonid Kuchma, also decided to analyze the
``groundless'' increase in prices of many goods throughout Ukraine
and take measures to curb inflation.
	   Ukraine is suffering heavily from the financial crisis in
neighboring Russia, which has immediately caused widespread public
expectations of a looming financial collapse.
	   Public fears were further fanned by the continuing fall of the
national hryvna currency, which continued its plunge this week,
falling from 2.1 to the U.S. dollar in mid-August to 3.25 on
Wednesday.
	   Prices of many goods have increased throughout the country in
response to the hryvna's slide, and officials already estimate
September inflation at about 7.5 percent, up from 0.2 percent in
August.
	   Government measures to prevent the spread of panic, including
the creation of a state fund to compensate people for their lost
bank savings, have so far yielded little result.
	   Ukrainians, wary of a possible repeat of hyperinflation that
completely devalued their money in 1993, are increasingly buying up
goods and trying to convert whatever savings they have into U.S.
dollars.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko acknowledged that
authorities have managed so far to collect only a quarter of
planned budget revenues for September, this year's record low.
	   However, Tyhypko and other top officials continued to reassure
the public that Ukraine is capable of avoiding Russia's fate.
Tyhypko told regional officials that what he termed psychological
factors have played a ``most significant role'' in Ukraine's
present economic downfall.
	   Central Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko also said panic among the
population remained the only obstacle on the way to stabilizing the
hryvna and curbing inflation.

Bangladesh court renews arrest warrant against Taslima Nasrin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A Bangladeshi court on Thursday revived
an arrest warrant for author Taslima Nasrin, who faces death
threats from Islamic extremists for allegedly offending the
religious sentiments of Muslims.
	   The arrest warrant, issued in 1994, was revived more than a week
after Nasrin returned home and went into hiding. Before her secret
return Sept. 14, Nasrin spent four years in self-imposed exile in
Europe.
	   On Thursday, Judge Lokman Hossain also ordered Nasrin's property
confiscated as punishment for failing to appear in court.
	   Police at Dhaka's Motijheel district, where the 36-year-old
author's apartment is located, said they had yet to receive the
court's latest order.
	   A member of Nasrin's family, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, would not comment on the case.
	   Nasrin angered conservative Muslims after a newspaper quoted her
as saying that the Koran, Islam's holy book, should be rewritten.
She has denied making the comments, but said she favored changes in
Islamic laws to give more rights to women in Bangladesh.
	   Nasrin said she risked her life to return home to stay with her
mother ``in her last days.'' Her 60-year-old mother, Eid-ul-Ara
Begum, underwent treatment in New York for colon cancer.
	   Nasrin's return provoked street protests by Islamic activists
who have renewed a reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) for anyone
who kills her. Several Islamic parties have planned fresh street
protests for Friday, the Muslim Sabbath.
	   Her novel ``Lajja'' (``Shame'') has criticized Muslims for
attacking minority Hindus after Hindu zealots in neighboring India
destroyed a mosque in 1992. Bangladesh banned the novel accusing it
of inciting communal discord.
	   Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government filed a criminal case in
1994 accusing Nasrin of blaspheming Islam. She was later freed on
bail.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who replaced Mrs. Zia in 1996, has
shown little interest in pursuing Nasrin's trial. But her liberal
government is now under pressure from the Islamic groups.

UBS bearing after tax loss in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ United Bank of Switzerland, the big
Swiss banking group, said Thursday market turmoil will lead to an
after-tax loss of 500 million Swiss francs (dlrs 360 million) to 1
billion francs (dlrs 720 million) in the third quarter of 1998.
	   This will leave the bank only a ``modest'' net profit for the
second half, UBS said.
	   The company blamed turmoil in emerging markets for a shortage of
liquidity, which in turn harmed UBS's fixed-income business in
those markets.
	   UBS also cited wide volatility in stock indexes in the U.S. and
Europe, which hurt the value of UBS' equity trading book.
	   Since turmoil in the markets intensified in late August, UBS
``has suffered substantial declines in earnings,'' the bank said.
	   UBS' businesses in the emerging markets of Russia, Southeast
Asia and Latin America ``produced a drop in income of 630 million
francs (dlrs 453 million).
	   However, the bank said it didn't expect these developments to
recur and is hoping the world economy would escape prolonged,
serious weakening.
	   If those factors play out as hoped, the bank said it would
suffer ``no major deterioration in the group's structural power.''

Report: Microsoft may bid for Anglo-Dutch publisher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. and the
Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier are in talks on a deal that
could include a takeover bid by the software giant, Dow Jones
Newswires reported Thursday.
	   Dow Jones cited an unnamed source at Reed Elsevier. The report
came after rumors of a possible bid triggered a rise in Reed
Elsevier's stock early this week. Market watchers believe Elsevier
may be looking for a partner or takeover candidate after its merger
plans with Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer fell through earlier this
year.
	   A spokesman at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington,
said the company did not comment on rumors. The company's European
offices also declined comment.
	   ``We are aware of the rumors which have moved the shares in
recent days and we don't have any comment whatsoever,'' Fokko
Covers, head of Elsevier's European financial affairs, told Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   In May, Reed Elsevier signed a dlrs 30 million, five-year deal
to use Microsoft's commercial Internet services and its software to
support the publisher's products.

Iran disassociates itself from reward for killing Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with background, analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday that
his government would distance itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward
for killing British novelist Salman Rushdie, and was ready to
exchange ambassadors with Britain.
	   The Iranian ``government disassociates itself from any reward
which has been offered in this regard and does not support it,''
Kamal Kharrazi said after a meeting with his British counterpart,
Robin Cook.
	   Cook, who met Kharrazi on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly session, said he was delighted with Iran's decision.
	   ``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive
relationship between the United Kingdom, and I believe the European
Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our
relations,'' Cook said following his meeting with Kharrazi.
	   ``Dr. Kharrazi and I have, accordingly, agreed that we should
upgrade the level of our diplomatic relations to ambassadorial
level,'' Cook told reporters.
	   Kharrazi's comments stopped short of lifting the death sentence
on Rushdie, but was an important step in improving ties strained
over the issue.
	   Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious edict
in 1989, saying Rushdie had committed blasphemy against Islam in
his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' and should be killed.
	   The semi-official Khordad Foundation has offered a dlrs 2.5
million reward for killing Rushdie.
	   Iranian officials say they are powerless to lift Khomeini's
fatwa, or religious edict. They say the fatwa could have been
lifted only by the late revolutionary leader himself.
	   Iran has been trying to change its foreign policy ever since
Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric, took over as president in
August 1997.
	   The death sentence against Rushdie, which had forced the
Indian-born British writer to live in hiding, has been the main
hurdle in better ties between Iran and the EU.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hurricane Georges
charged across the Caribbean on its calamitous path toward the
Florida Keys on Thursday, leaving rescuers to pull bodies from
rivers, collapsed houses and mudslides.
	   At least 110 people have died and hundreds were missing since
the sprawling storm began its rampage Monday across the Caribbean.
	   A hurricane warning was issued early Thursday for several
counties in southern Florida.
	   All 80,000 residents of the Florida Keys were ordered to
evacuate Wednesday, and cars and trucks with boats in tow squeezed
onto the lone two-lane highway to the mainland.
	   Gov. Lawton Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and
southern Florida, allowing the state to use the National Guard,
lift tolls along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   Because of the storm's wobbly course, officials said 540,000
more people could be asked to leave Miami Beach and other low-lying
areas farther up the coast.
	   At 11 a.m. (1500 GMT), Georges was centered just east-northeast
of Camaguey, Cuba. It was moving west-northwest near 12 mph (19
kph) and its winds had increased to near 80 mph (130 kph).
	   As Georges battered the northern coast of Cuba on Wednesday,
Dominican President Leonel Fernandez announced that 70 people were
dead and hundreds were missing in his nation alone. The missing
included 45 people who disappeared when a school shelter washed
away Wednesday.
	   Officials have not begun to reach the Dominican Republic's
hardest-hit areas, where many more victims are expected to be
found. Fernandez asked for unity and urged people to attend church
Thursday, the holy day for the nation's patron saint, Mercedes.
	   ``Pray and ask the Almighty to help the destiny of our people,''
he said.
	   The Dominican government asked for international aid after the
disaster left at least 100,000 homeless. The U.S. Coast Guard sent
a C-130 airplane and helicopter to help search for victims.
	   In Puerto Rico, private economists estimated damages on the
island at least dlrs 2 billion. Electricity was out throughout the
island, and the state-owned power company said it could be months
before service is fully restored.
	   In Haiti, the U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 for
disaster response, while the U.S. government donated water, food,
blankets, sheets and clothing. France sent a 60-member security
team to help with water purification and treat the injured.

Ukrainian president meets Azeri official to discuss oil exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma met
Thursday with Azerbaijan's first deputy premier, Abbas Abbasov, to
discuss Ukrainian plans to transport Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oil,
Kuchma's press service said.
	   Ukrainian officials said the sides focused on a planned visit of
a group of experts from Azerbaijan, who are scheduled to arrive on
Oct. 8 to look at Ukraine's Odessa oil terminal and the
Odessa-Brody pipeline, both now under construction.
	   Ukraine, along with Russia, Turkey, Georgia and Iran, is eager
to take part in the lucrative transportation of oil from
Azerbaijan's huge Caspian Sea deposits.
	   The country has suggested that Caspian oil be taken by tankers
from the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa to Odessa on the Black
Sea, and from there via a pipeline to the western Ukrainian town of
Brody for export.
	   In talks with Azerbaijan, Ukrainian officials repeatedly have
argued that although this route could not be exclusive, it offered
the shortest way to northern Europe, providing for lower
transportation costs than other planned routes.
	   According to Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy
Holubchenko, the country would be ready to start transporting
Caspian oil in two years. Holubchenko says Ukraine would need about
dlrs 400 million to complete the half-finished Odessa-Brody
pipeline.

Norway's prime minister back on job after depression leave

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's prime minister returned to work
Thursday, after more than three weeks on sick leave to recover from
depression and build inner strength to face unprecedented
challenges.
	   ``I'm healthy. I have a (doctor's) certificate in my bag,''
Kjell Magne Bondevik at a news conference. ``I can handle the
pressure.''
	   There will be plenty of it. The 51-year-old Lutheran clergyman
can expect a tough battle in the coming weeks, when his minority
coalition needs to find support in parliament for its proposed 1999
national budget.
	   ``Back to a new political nightmare,'' wrote Norway's largest
newspaper, Verdens Gang.
	   Bondevik took a one-week sick leave on Aug. 30 to recover from
what his office called ``a depressive reaction to overwork.'' The
leave was extended to 3 1/2 weeks.
	   At his news conference Thursday afternoon, Bondevik described
the experience as ``hitting the wall.''
	   ``In a way, I felt I had an unlimited capacity. Naturally, I did
not,'' he said. ``My strength was gradually being tapped more than
I realized.''
	   The Norwegian news media, which generally respect the privacy of
public figures, allowed Bondevik to recover in peace.
	   Opposition politicians refused to use the sick leave against
Christian Democratic Bondevik, and the public was largely
sympathetic.
	   In a typical gesture, Bondevik's neighbors _ apparently
believing the prime minister needed a few more minutes of quiet _
tried to convince reporters gathered outside his home Thursday
morning that he had already left for work. Bondevik was still at
home.
	   During his leave, Bondevik _ who refused to go into details of
his treatment _ spent much of his time at a mountain cabin, taking
long walks, and playing Yahtzee with his family.
	   ``My family was the best medicine,'' he said.
	   While sympathetic during his sick leave, the political
opposition and news media said he cannot expect special treatment
now that he is back on the job.
	   ``Bondevik needs to convince us that he is strong enough to be
prime minister, and that he can stand the strain,'' an editorial in
Verdens Gang said Thursday.
	   The prime minister said his depression was a passing ailment,
unlikely to be repeated.
	   ``As a human begin, I have learned a lesson about what a refined
instrument the human body and soul is,'' said Bondevik. ``As prime
minister, I have learned a lesson about the need to set limits.''
	   When Bondevik's black BMW rolled up to the government quarter in
Oslo in the morning, taxi driver Omed Majed, an Iranian Kurd who
has lived in Norway for 10 years, was waiting. He gave an armful of
red roses to the prime minister.
	   ``He is a good man,'' Majed said afterwards.
	   Early in his term, Bondevik had strong support in opinion polls.
However, his government has been rattled by economic pressures.
Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, has been stung by
low crude prices.
	   When he took over last October, Norway's economy was at the peak
of a boom that analysts said could not last. Last month, the value
of Norway's currency, the krone, was hard hit by speculators and
interest rates soared, signaling market doubts that Bondevik's
coalition had the backbone needed to make tough budget cuts.
	   The moderate coalition of the Christian Democrats, the Center
and the Liberals needs support from other parties in Parliament for
what is likely to be a tight 1999 budget. Already split on where to
make cuts, newspapers said there is a good chance the coalition
could collapse over the budget.

Ukrainian government creates state broadcasting company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet on Thursday decided to
create a state shareholding company, Ukrainian Television and Radio
Broadcasting, to unite state-run broadcast media.
	   The decision was made in accordance with a recent presidential
decree and was meant ``to improve the effectiveness of management
in the electronic media sphere,'' the government's press service
said.
	   The Cabinet also appointed Mykola Kniazhytsky, head of the
private STB television network, to serve as the company's board
chairman.
	   Information Minister Zynoviy Kulyk said the newly created
company would unite several existing national television channels
and radio stations and 27 regional state-run television and radio
companies that are not subject to privatization.
	   The government also has moved to create a national publishing
and printing company that would unite 56 publishing houses and
other related companies, he said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``The goal is to save the national property of TV and radio
companies and publishing houses from privatization and pillage,''
Kulyk said.
	   But Kulyk had only bad news for broadcasters, saying the
cash-strapped government would be commissioning broadcasts only on
the basis of funds that are actually available, about 18.4 percent
and 21.7 percent of the radio and television's respective ``minimum
needs.''
	   ``It is entirely possible that we shall cut the national radio
broadcasts, for instance, from 22 hours a day to 7 to 8 hours,''
Kulyk said.
	   Kniazhytsky, meanwhile, said his main goal would be improving
the quality of broadcasts and representing the authorities's stance
at the time of a deep financial crisis in Ukraine. He said both
government officials and lawmakers, who are often at odds with the
government, should be on the board of the new company.
	   ``A state television should not divide the branches of power but
unite them in order to explain the joint position of the
authorities to our citizens, especially at a time of economic
crisis,'' Kniazhytsky said.

Supporters of Dagestani opposition leader announce sit-in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ About 500 supporters of an opposition
leader in the troubled Russian republic of Dagestan set up camp
Thursday on the outskirts of the regional capital Makhachkala and
announced they would not leave until their demands were fulfilled.
	   The protesters marched about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the
Novolaksky district to the capital to demand the release of Magomed
Khachilayev, who was arrested earlier this month on charges of
organizing a May 21 raid on the government building in Makhachkala
with his brother, Nadir Khachilayev.
	   Nadir Khachilayev heads Russia's Muslim Union, a leading
organization of Muslims. Magomed Khachilayev is the leader of a
movement representing the Lak ethnic group in Dagestan. Both
brothers have been leading opponents of the regional government.
	   The demonstrators said their protest would be peaceful. They
said that because city authorities would not allow them to enter
Makhachkala, they would camp on the outskirts until Magomed
Khachilayev was released. They want him to be free pending trial.
	   Dagestan, which borders on the breakaway region of Chechnya, has
suffered frequent bombings, kidnappings, ethnic and religious
strife and other violence.

New Brazilian soccer team shows same old flaws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ New players, new coach, same old
problems.
	   Brazil began its vaunted rebuilding campaign on Wednesday with a
1-1 tie against Yugoslavia that showed just how much works lies
ahead for coach Wanderley Luxemburgo.
	   In the first game since being thrashed by France in the World
Cup final, the new Brazil looked a lot like the old one _ the same
fragile defense, dazzling ballhandling and rare glimmers of talent
that offered a tantalizing promise of what could be.
	   Ronaldo wasn't there, although he probably will be next time.
Only Cafu, Rivaldo and Denilson were back from the team that lost
the World Cup final 3-0 in July.
	   Luxemburgo deliberately picked a roster heavy with young players
who will meet the age restriction for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
Many had never played on the national team previously.
	   Still, as the jeers showered down from the grandstands of
Castelao stadium in the far northern city of Sao Luis, it was clear
that fans expect more from their team, even the novices.
	   Yugoslavia struck first. With the game just seven minutes old,
Savo Milosevic took a through ball, split the defense and chipped
the ball over the head of rookie goalkeeper Andre.
	   It was the first of many lapses by fullbacks Antonio Carlos and
Cleber, and fans expected more _ the two were starters on the
Palmeiras team that won consecutive national titles in 1993 and
1994. The coach? Wanderley Luxemburgo.
	   Brazil tied it 10 minutes later on a free kick by Marcelinho,
the most lucid on the Brazilian offense. Rivaldo put a free kick
off the post, but that was about it.
	   Felipe, a brilliant young defender of Vasco da Gama of whom
great things are expected, blamed his poor play on opening-game
nerves. Rivaldo and Denilson got lost in pointless dribbles.
Veteran Muller, who played in the World Cups of 1986 and 1990, was
a cypher.
	   Vampeta, Marcos Assuncao, Jackson, Alex and other youngsters
will get other chances to prove they deserve a spot on a team that
won four World Cups.
	   ``It was more positive than negative,'' Luxemburgo said. ``We
played well in the first half. Yugoslavia had players that played
in the World Cup, more experienced and mature.''
	   That wasn't how most Brazilians saw it, especially since the
home team was a man up for most of the second half, thanks to a
sympathetic referee who gave Brazil the benefit of many calls.
	   ``Yugoslavia was the moral winner,'' soccer analyst Jose Couto
wrote in the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo. ``They were more
cohesive, spirited and competent than Brazil.''
	   Brazil's next exhibition game is against Colombia on Oct. 14 in
New York.

Israel criticizes Lithuania for delay in trial of war criminal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel criticised Lithuania Thursday for
postponing the trial of an accused Nazi war criminal who had fled
prosecution in the United States.
	   Aleksandras Lileikis, 90, is facing charges of genocide in
Lithuania for allegedly sending thousands of Jews to their deaths
while he served as security police chief in Vilnius during World
War II.
	   Lileikis fled the United States to Lithuania in 1996 after he
was stripped of his U.S. citizenship. Justice Department
prosecutors presented evidence showing he had signed orders for
Jews to be killed by gunfire at execution pits near Vilnius.
	   During the U.S. proceedings, Lileikis admitted heading the
security police in Nazi-occupied Lithuania, but characterized
himself as ``a disembodied issuer of orders.''
	   His trial in Lithuania was slated to begin in September but was
delayed due to the deterioration in his health.
	   In Jerusalem, Israel's foreign ministry expressed ``dismay that
the trial of Alexander Lileikis ... has once again been
postponed,'' read a statement from the ministry.
	   ``Israel views the trial as symbolic and educational and hopes
that the legal and constitutional system in Lithuania will find the
appropriate, legal way to hold the trial,'' the statement said.
	   The United States has pressed Lithuania to try war criminals,
especially if the Baltic country wants to be considered for
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
	   Before World War II, Lithuania had a thriving Jewish community
which once numbered over 200,000, but it was almost entirely
whipped out after the war. Six million Jews were killed in the nazi
Holocaust.

Israel says no progress in talks if Arafat raises statehood issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Palestinian negotiator, Arafat meeting
with Israeli opposition legislator over &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel warned Yasser Arafat on Thursday that he
will sabotage prospects for a West Bank troop withdrawal if he
seeks support for a planned declaration of Palestinian statehood
when he addresses the U.N. General Assembly next week.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Arafat is determined to
use his rare appearance before the world body to win international
backing for independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip when the
five-year period of Palestinian autonomy expires in May.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
in New York this week on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   U.S. officials had considered arranging a meeting between Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they are both in
New York, where the United Nations is located. However, with both
sides sharpening their rhetoric over the statehood issue, it
appeared unlikely such a summit will take place.
	   ``An arbitrary unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state ...
would constitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords, it
would cause the complete collapse of the process. I strongly urge
the Palestinian Authority not to take this course,'' Netanyahu said
in his speech to the U.N. Thursday.
	   Arafat is to arrive in New York later in the week.
	   Israeli officials warned Thursday that the negotiations on a
West Bank withdrawal would suffer if Arafat raised the statehood
issue in his Monday speech to the United Nations.
	   ``If Arafat chooses the path of diplomatic struggle against
Israel in the United Nations and attempts to promote a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood, he will simply sabotage the
chance that exists to achieve agreement with Israel,'' said Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
	   Netanyahu said earlier that a statehood declaration would
violate the autonomy accords which say the final status of the
disputed territories must be negotiated.
	   If Arafat declares a state in May, this ``in effect cancels the
(peace) agreement,'' Netanyahu said in New York, adding that the
move would trigger countermeasures by Israel.
	   Netanyahu has not said specifically how he would respond, but it
is believed he would annex parts of the West Bank and seal off
autonomous Palestinian areas from one another.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh details, Cohen, Shelton, Clark quotes,
 &UR; NATO readies air strikes on Yugoslavia &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos VLM101-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) - NATO instructed its generals Thursday
to begin preparations for air strikes on Yugoslavia unless
President Slobodan Milosevic ends his attacks on ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo. The big question now is whether the tough Yugoslav
president will be impressed.
	   The difference between this action and previous harsh words
aimed at Milosevic is the tone and the timing, NATO officials said.
A tough U.N. resolution Wednesday combined with a NATO ``activation
warning'' Thursday for air operations takes the 16-nation alliance
to the brink of shooting.
	   ``Today, NATO sent a clear message to President Milosevic that
it is time to stop the killing and destruction in Kosovo,'' said
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen after a meeting of allied
defense ministers.
	   ``Our Patience is running out.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the activation warning
from the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body,
takes NATO ``to an increased level of military preparedness. But he
stressed that further decisions were required before the alliance
unleashes any strikes.
	   If the political decision is made to launch a military action
against Yugoslavia, it would start would be a phased campaign,
gradually increasing in intensity.
	   ``The targets would be military targets,'' said Walter B.
Slocombe, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy. ``Very, very
effective and very, very strong blows would be aimed at the very
instruments that Milosevic is using to carry out this repression.''
	   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
asked if he thought NATO could bomb Milosevic into submission,
said: ``I believe that we have a wide range of options available to
us, the end result of which will be that Milosevic will comply with
the demands made of him by NATO.
	   ``Certainly we will start with the lighter of the options to
give him a chance to respond. But it might not end with the light
option.''
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe, said
it would take ``just a very few days'' to line up the necessary
forces to begin a military operation. He has already surveyed the
assets he will need. Now, under the ``activation warning,'' he will
be asking for specific commitments.
	   Clark noted that Milosevic is moving fast to complete the
destruction of ethnic Albanian villages before winter sets in.
	   ``Should the decision be made to employ force, there are adquate
measures available to significantly impact on the Serb military and
police action in Kosovo with all of the consequences that would
mean,'' he said.
	   Milosevic's massive attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in
Kosovo have continued unabated despite previous NATO threats. His
seven-month crackdown on separatists fighting for the independence
of Kosovo has claimed hundreds of lives and forced as many as
275,000 people from their homes.
	   Previous threats of military action have failed to persuade
Milosevic to mend his ways, and the latest saber-rattling from the
alliance did not appear to have slowed his onslaught against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which is the principal
state in the Yugoslav federation.
	   ``Belgrade is clearly conducting a war against its own people,''
said German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. ``Pictures of people
camping out in the open ... are in themselves an ultimatum'' to
Milosevic.
	   The call for a cessation of hostilities goes out to both sides.
	   ``All of the blame for this war does not entirely rest with the
Serbian side,'' Slocombe said.
	   A number of countries indicated at Thursday's ministerial
meeting they would participate, according to Slocombe. None said
they would not.
	   NATO, which has no military assets of its own except for some
communications hardware and airborne warning and control aircraft,
does have access to a wide array of equipment from the national
armies of 15 members - Iceland has no military force. And the three
candidate members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, who will
be welcomed into the NATO fold next April, have said they are
prepared to participate in the Kosovo operation.
	   Four months ago, passions were high at NATO. Foreign ministers
meeting in Luxembourg issued a tough statement threatening action.
But those passions cooled as many questioned what could be
accomplished by direct military intervention. Now, however, as
winter approaches and the photos of cold, hungry displaced people
are on front pages around the world, the international community is
once again feeling pressure to do something.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
warned Palestinians Thursday not to declare statehood, saying such
a step would destroy the peace process and lead to Israeli
retaliation.
	   Concerned about Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's plan to press
his case for Palestinian statehood during his upcoming U.N. General
Assembly speech, Netanyahu used his speech before the world body to
spell out Israel's strong opposition.
	   ``I strongly urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this
course,'' the Israeli leader said. ``Such actions will inevitably
prompt unilateral responses on our part and this development will
not be good for the Palestinians, not good for Israel, not good for
peace.''
	   He said the only way for Israel and the Palestinians to live in
peace is to complete the current talks on a further Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank and then negotiate a final
settlement.
	   ``We must continue to negotiate earnestly, continuously,
tirelessly until the final peace agreement is reached. No other way
will do,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Palestinian officials have said Arafat plans to tell the body
next week of his determination to declare a Palestinian state by
May, with or without Israel's approval. The General Assembly
historically has looked with favor on Palestinian aspirations.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday that interim peace agreements between
Israel and the Palestinians specifically rule out such unilateral
declarations, reserving statehood to be settled between the two
sides.
	   In his General Assembly speech Thursday, Netanyahu said failure
by the Israelis and Palestinians to meet deadlines set by the
Israel-Palestinian accords negotiated in Oslo, Norway, did not
undermine the validity of the accords themselves.
	   ``An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state in
disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo would constitute a
fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It would cause the
complete collapse of the process,'' he said.
	   In Jerusalem Thursday, a senior Palestinian official said the
Palestinians have already begun plans to counter any Israeli
retaliatory steps once statehood is declared and had formed five
committees to deal with the political, legal and economic aspects
of statehood.
	   ``We expect that Israel will respond harshly to the declaration
and so we must prepare,'' said Imad Musa, a spokesman for the
Palestine National Council, a 545-seat legislative body with
members living in exile and the Palestinian areas.
	   Also in the General Assembly Thursday, Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee pledged that India was prepared to sign on to
the nuclear test ban treaty but had to complete negotiations before
it did so.
	   Vajpayee told world leaders India wanted the treaty to go into
force no later than September 1999. India is one of the 44
countries that must ratify the treaty for it to go into effect.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his
speech that his country was ready to adhere to the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, even as he warned that compliance would depend on
whether India resumed its tests and on the world lifting sanctions
imposed after the tests.
	   Also on the speakers' list was Nigerian President Abdulsalami
Abubakar, Turkey's prime minister and the foreign minister of
Greece, who were sure to raise the thorny issue of Cyprus.

Russia delays debt payments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasayanov
said Thursday his country had delayed dlrs 600 million in interest
payments on old debt inherited from the former Soviet Union to
Germany and other governments.
	   However, Kasayanov, who was meeting with members of the Paris
Club of creditor nations, said what is termed new Russian debt was
being paid on time.
	   Francis Mayer, the president of the Paris Club, said no debt
would be renegotiated at the meeting and that its purpose was to
determine the level of debt owed and discuss the payment outlook.
	   Kasayanov said Russia was on time with payments for all
so-called new Russian debt incurred since Jan. 1, 1992 when Russian
became a sovereign nation after the Soviet collapse.
	   Earlier this month, the Germany government said it had received
only part of an interest payment due on rescheduled Soviet debt.
	   Russia has been scrambling to make payments on all sorts of debt
since the Aug. 17 devaluation of the ruble unleashed financial
turmoil throughout the economy.
	   Russia joined the Paris Club in 1997, after it reached an
agreement in 1996 to reschedule Soviet debt owed to the Paris Club
members.
	   The Club said in a statement it had ``discussed the exact
situation of payments by Russia, taking into account the delays in
payment that have occurred in August 1998.''
	   The Paris Club later released a statement saying that
``Creditors have expressed that they expect these payments to be
made quickly,'' the Club statement said.
	   The Paris Club agreed to reschedule more that dlrs 40 billion in
Russian debt in 1996. That debt was inherited from the former
Soviet Union, which had received loans from western countries.
	   On Thursday, Russian First Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin said
Russia made a mistake in its decision to join the Paris Club group
of debtor nations, saying terms did not benefit the Russian
government. He said debts owed to the former Soviet Union should
have offset Soviet debts owed to Paris Club members.
	   Kasayanov said he was hopeful he new Russian government would
continue reforms and its new economic policy would be outlined next
week.

	   Facts about Slovakia's parliamentary elections on Friday and
Saturday:
	   WHAT'S AT STAKE: Four-year terms in the Slovak parliament, which
has 150 seats, and a chance to form the government. Opposition sees
good chance to unseat authoritarian Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar,
who has ruled Slovakia most of the time since it gained sovereignty
in 1993.
	   CANDIDATES: Seventeen parties running, representing total of
1,618 candidates. In order for a party to make it into parliament,
party has to gain more than 5 percent of votes.
	   VOTERS: 4 million registered in population of 5.5 million.
	   FAVORITES: Last polls allowed before election showed Meciar's
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) leading with about 28
percent. The largest opposition party, Slovak Democratic Coalition,
second with 23 percent. The polls, taken Sept. 11, showed six
parties likely to make it into parliament, of which four are
opposition parties. Meciar's chances of forming government depends
on showing of potential coalition partners.
	   ISSUES: Efforts to join the European Union and NATO, 14 percent
unemployment, rising crime, deterioration of health care and
education systems, shortage of available housing, privatization
progress, Meciar's crackdown on media and general authoritarian
policies.
	   SEPARATE VOTE: Referendum initiated by Meciar's party on whether
to halt privatization of strategic gas and electricity suppliers

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Unknown gunmen opened fire on officials
driving in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, killing two and
injuring one, an Abkhazian official said Thursday.
	   Following the incident, Abkhazia and Georgia signed an agreement
on stabilizing the region, including the initiation of joint
patrols to establish order.
	   The agreement obliges the two sides ``to stop the exchange of
gunfire between the two sides, and not to resort to military
activity in relation to one another,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The Abkhazians were in the region's restive Ghali district
Wednesday night when the gunmen attacked their car, Abkhazian
Internal Affairs Minister Amazbei Kchach said.
	   Kchach blamed militants loyal to the Georgian government for the
attack, but did not offer any evidence.
	   The attack occurred as a Georgian delegation was in Abkhazia for
negotiations on the long-standing political dispute. Recently,
unknown gunmen in Abkhazia opened fire at a bus with 10 United
Nations representatives, and in a separate attack, fired on a
Georgian government official.
	   ``It is sad that talks are conducted with such a sad event in
the background,'' said Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba.
``Nevertheless, the talks must be held to prevent such events in
the future.''
	   After the talks, Georgian State Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze
said the two sides had agreed that the terrorist acts were being
carried out by ``destructive forces'' that exist in both Georgia
and Abkhazia.
	   ``We have worked out an approach on how to combine forces, have
agreed that joint patrols will be organized in the villages of the
Ghali region. It is very important,'' he told reporters in Tbilisi
after his return.
	   Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian soldiers and ethnic
Georgians in a 1992-93 civil war. Despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers, there have been frequent, violent skirmishes.

UBS bearing after tax loss in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ United Bank of Switzerland, the big
Swiss banking group, said Thursday market turmoil will lead to an
after-tax loss of 500 million Swiss francs (dlrs 360 million) to 1
billion francs (dlrs 720 million) in the third quarter of 1998.
	   This will leave the bank only a ``modest'' net profit for the
second half, UBS said.
	   The company blamed turmoil in emerging markets for a shortage of
liquidity, which in turn harmed UBS's fixed-income business in
those markets.
	   UBS also cited wide volatility in stock indexes in the U.S. and
Europe, which hurt the value of UBS' equity trading book.
	   Since turmoil in the markets intensified in late August, UBS
``has suffered substantial declines in earnings,'' the bank said.
	   UBS' businesses in the emerging markets of Russia, Southeast
Asia and Latin America ``produced a drop in income of 630 million
francs (dlrs 453 million).
	   However, the bank said it didn't expect these developments to
recur and is hoping the world economy would escape prolonged,
serious weakening.
	   If those factors play out as hoped, the bank said it would
suffer ``no major deterioration in the group's structural power.''

Foreign press target of anger during Malaysia's political strife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 12 grafs to UPDATE with fresh Mahathir quote and to
CLARIFY that TV crews abandoned coverage of other stories to cover
rallies. &QL; 
 &UR; With Malaysia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo KL101 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The international press goes where
the action is. And that's one reason Malaysian authorities don't
want them here.
	   The government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad believes the
foreign reporters, photographers and television news crews that
have descended on Malaysia during the past week to cover an
unprecedented challenge to his 17-year rule are not neutral, but
are rooting for his overthrow.
	   ``Do you want a repeat of Jakarta here? Well, the foreign press
would have a field day,'' national police chief Abdul Rahim Noor
said Thursday during what he described as ``a different kind of
press conference.''
	   He told one British reporter to ``shut up'' and threatened to
evict him, accused foreign journalists of exaggerating the extent
of recent pro-reform rallies, and finally said he would take no
more questions from the foreign media.
	   When reporters mention that Mahathir is Asia's longest-governing
leader now that Indonesia's President Suharto has been overthrown,
the Malaysian establishment interprets that as meaning the
journalists would like to see it happen again, because it would be
a good story.
	   ``They come hoping to see the fall of Dr. Mahathir,'' said
Rohaizad A. Rahim, in a Thursday commentary printed in The Star, a
pro-Mahathir newspaper. ``Many of these foreign reporters continue
to see similarities between the situation in Malaysia and that in
Indonesia.''
	   Mahathir suggested earlier this year that Malaysians who speak
to foreign reporters are being disloyal to their country.
	   The theme that the foreign press is trying to make Malaysia look
bad has been echoed by others since Mahathir fired his former
deputy and finance minister on Sept. 2. The deputy, Anwar Ibrahim,
has since launched an unprecedented series of nationwide rallies.
	   ``Freedom of speech includes the freedom to tell lies. We accept
that,'' Mahathir said Thursday when CNBC Asia, a regional
television network, broadcast a home video Anwar had made before
his arrest. It accuses Mahathir of greed and cronyism.
	   ``You are free to air this every half an hour because you own
the media and you can tell lies to the whole world and influence
the whole world against us,'' Mahathir said Thursday at a news
briefing attended by CNBC.
	   As the crowds grew, and Anwar's attacks on Mahathir became
sharper, more international journalists arrived to cover the
phenomenon. The local press covered Anwar less and less.
	   The Anwar phenomenon peaked, embarrassingly for Mahathir, during
a visit of Queen Elizabeth II and the staging of the Commonwealth
Games Asia for the first time. The television crews left those
events at times to cover the rallies.

NATO: Bosnian election results not all that bad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Solana saying NATO won't abandon
Bosnia, Cohen comment. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; With Bosnia-Elections &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ The NATO allies pledged Thursday not
to abandon Bosnia despite disappointing election results there,
though some countries expressed concern at the high cost of Bosnian
peacekeeping.
	   The international peacekeeping force ``will continue to play a
pro-active role'' in maintaining peace and security in Bosnia, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana told reporters outside a NATO
defense ministers' meeting in the Portuguese resort town of
Vilamoura.
	   ``We will not abandon Bosnia.''
	   Even so, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the allies
``hope that the military forces and missions can shrink as civilian
authorities play a larger role.''
	   The allies will complete a review of the peacekeeping operation
in December, and present recommendations on the future size and
shape of the international force.
	   International officials had hoped the Sept. 12-13 elections _
the third since the 1995 Dayton peace agreement ending the 3
1/2-year war _ would further sideline hard-liners opposed to ethnic
tolerance and other provisions of the Dayton accord.
	   The ballot's results won't be known until Friday. However,
initial indications are that extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen
has defeated Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic _ the favorite
of the international community _ in the presidential race.
	   Plavsic's showing was still slightly up on the country's last
ballot, while the hard-liners were slightly down.
	   ``The results are not all that we'd hoped for ... but they're
not an unmitigated disaster either,'' said a NATO official, who
spoke to reporters here on condition of anonymity.
	   Solana insisted that ``this is not a time for the international
community to hesitate.
	   ``Bosnia has no future if it returns to the extremism and
suspicions of the past.''
	   Officials said the allies welcomed Thursday's agreement by
moderate Bosnian Serb leaders to work together towards implementing
democratic processes.
	   The West has deployed a 35,000-strong NATO-led multinational
peacekeeping force, known as the Stabilization Force or SFOR, and
invested billions of dollars a year to help rebuild Bosnia.
	   But efforts to bring Serbs, Croats and Muslims together again
have shown little result, and civilian projects are proceeding
slowly.
	   ``We can't allow a situation where peace entirely depends on the
presence of SFOR. We don't want to create a dependence culture,''
the official said.

Israel criticizes Lithuania for delay in trial of war criminal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel criticized Lithuania on Thursday for
postponing the trial of an accused Nazi war criminal who had fled
prosecution in the United States.
	   Aleksandras Lileikis, 90, is facing charges of genocide in
Lithuania for allegedly sending thousands of Jews to their deaths
while he served as security police chief in Vilnius during World
War II.
	   Lileikis fled the United States to Lithuania in 1996 after he
was stripped of his U.S. citizenship. U.S. Justice Department
prosecutors presented evidence showing he had signed orders for
Jews to be killed by gunfire at execution pits near Vilnius.
	   During the U.S. proceedings, Lileikis admitted heading the
security police in Nazi-occupied Lithuania, but characterized
himself as ``a disembodied issuer of orders.''
	   His trial in Lithuania was slated to begin in September but was
delayed due to the deterioration in his health.
	   In Jerusalem, Israel's foreign ministry expressed ``dismay that
the trial of Alexander Lileikis ... has once again been
postponed,'' read a statement from the ministry.
	   ``Israel views the trial as symbolic and educational and hopes
that the legal and constitutional system in Lithuania will find the
appropriate, legal way to hold the trial,'' the statement said.
	   The United States has pressed Lithuania to try war criminals,
especially if the Baltic country wants to be considered for
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
	   Before World War II, Lithuania had a thriving Jewish community
which once numbered over 200,000, but it was almost entirely
whipped out after the war. Six million Jews were killed in the Nazi
Holocaust.

Ruling party affirms support for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Prime Minister Fatos Nano received the
endorsement of his ruling Socialist Party on Thursday and promised
Cabinet changes in the wake of this month's opposition campaign to
depose him.
	   No formal vote was taken during the meeting, party sources said
on condition of anonymity. But they said the party rejected calls
by opposition leader Sali Berisha for Nano to step down.
	   Nano told the party members that he would announce Cabinet
changes after consultations with the four other parties in the
ruling coalition. He did not say which ministers would be replaced,
but the sources said changes were likely in ministries of public
order, justice and finance.
	   On Wednesday, the Socialist Party secretary, Petro Koci, said
some kind of government shakeup would occur in the next week in
response to two days of rioting last week by Berisha's supporters
that threatened to topple the government in this impoverished
Balkan nation.
	   Berisha, a former president, is under criminal investigation for
his role in the Sept. 13-14 rioting, which left at least three
people dead and scores injured.
	   The rioting erupted one day after popular politician and top
Berisha aide Azem Hajdari was shot to death. Rioters briefly held
the parliament building, studios of government television and other
state buildings until police regained control.
	   Berisha blamed Nano for the killing, but Western officials say
they believe Hajdari's death was due to a private feud.
	   Also Thursday, Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said
that police arrested two people _ including a former police chief _
for involvement in the rioting.
	   Sali Shehu was a former police chief in the cities of Shkodra,
Durres and Tirana during Berisha's term as president but was fired
by the Socialists.
	   Ekrem Spahia, head of the Party of Legality, was arrested for
appearing on state television during the rioting and declaring ``TV
is free now. It's ours.''

U.N. Refugee Commissioner arrives in Belgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ogata meeting Milosevic, president's statement

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees arrived Thursday to discuss the worsening humanitarian
situation in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   Upon arrival Sadako Ogata met Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. At the meeting, Milosevic denied reports of a looming
humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo, saying they were ``part of
campaign against our country.''
	   A statement from Milosevic's office carried by Tanjug called
international criticism of Yugoslavia ``absurd.''
	   ``Pressures on Yugoslavia, which are unfortunately supported by
fabricated reports about the situation in Kosovo, do not contribute
to solving the problems, but only feed the illusions of terrorist
and separatist forces in their efforts to break away Kosovo from
Serbia and Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic's statement said.
	   It added that UNHCR was welcome in Yugoslavia, but warned the
agency should have ``objective approach.''
	   During her three-day visit, Ogata will visit Kosovo and meet
other Yugoslav officials, foreign aid workers and diplomats.
	   An estimated 275,000 people have been displaced by seven months
of clashes in Kosovo where Serb-led government forces are fighting
ethnic Albanian separatists seeking to wrest the province from
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Some 50,000 people are believed to be camping out in Kosovo
forests and hills, leading to fears that many will die with the
approach of winter.
	   Fearing a humanitarian catastrophe unless Milosevic halts
government attacks and allows the return of the displaced to their
homes, the U.N. Security Council and NATO are moving toward using
force to stop the Kosovo bloodshed.

	   Speaking outside the Foreign Office where he was briefed on the

Iran.
	   ''An extraordinary thing has been achieved,'' he said.
	   Publication of Salman Rushdie's '' Satanic Verses'' in 1988
caused an uproar among Muslims around the world, who contended that
it insulted Islam. The novel brought an Iranian ``fatwa,'' or death
sentence from Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini in February 1989.
Islamic militants put a 1.2 million pound (dlrs 2 million) bounty

	   LYON, France (AP) _ A hand transplant by surgeons using advanced
medical technology is raising new hope for victims of accidents,
land mines and birth defects, doctors said Thursday.
	   A team led by French and Australian doctors grafted a donor's
hand on an Australian businessman's arm Wednesday in the first
known hand transplant in years. The coming weeks will determine if
his body will accept it.
	   In a painstaking 13-hour operation, the right hand and forearm
of the anonymous donor was attached to the arm of the 48-year-old
Australian man, whose own hand was amputated in 1989 after an
accident, Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon said in a statement.
	   ``It gives hope to all those who are victims of domestic or work
accidents, anti-personnel mines, or have congenital deformations,''
Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, a co-head of the transplant team, told
French TV.
	   In the operation, the team attached ``all the arteries, veins,
nerves, tendons, muscles and skin after setting the two bones of
the forearm,'' the hospital statement said.
	   The patient was identified as an Australian businessman, France
2 television reported, adding it would take 12 to 18 months of
therapy for him to regain full use of the hand.
	   The operation was the result of recent advances in microsurgery
and transplant techniques. Doctors now assess the chances of
long-term success at 50-50.
	   The French hospital beat a Louisville, Kentucky team that was
planning such a transplant before the end of the year.
	   While the Lyon hospital billed the transplant as a first, it had
been done before. Doctors in Ecuador tried in the 1960s, but the
patient's body rejected the hand after two weeks.
	   Dubernard said he had been dreaming of trying such an operation
since the early 1970s.
	   Such a transplant, however, faces serious risks. Patients must
take anti-rejection drugs that can be potentially fatal, as they
suppress the immune system to keep the body from trying to destroy
the foreign tissue. That could also raise the risk of infection,
cancer and even death.
	   Doctors hope this time, with new anti-rejection drugs, the
Australian patient's body would not reject the foreign hand.
	   Other key problems are nerve regeneration to allow sensation. A
transplant patient may never regain feeling of hot and cold in
their new hand.
	   The director of the UCLA Hand Center in Los Angeles, Neil Jones,
said last month he didn't think transplant research among animals
so far ``allows us to move into the realm of human application.''
	   Head of transplant surgery at the Lyon hospital, Dubernard
co-led the team with Earl Owen, director of the Center for
Microsurgery in Sydney, Australia.

India pledges to conclude discussions on nuclear treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with details from speech, U.S. welcoming `small
steps'; U.N. chief welcoming decision, RAISES background. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Taking the lead from rival Pakistan,
India's prime minister pledged Thursday that his country was
prepared to sign the nuclear test ban treaty but had to complete
negotiations first.
	   Atal Bihari Vajpayee told world leaders gathered for the U.N.
General Assembly debate that India wanted the treaty to go into
force no later than September 1999. India is one of the 44
countries that must ratify the treaty for it to go into effect.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his
General Assembly speech that his country was ready to adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, though he warned that compliance
would depend on whether India resumed its tests.
	   The two countries conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May,
sparking fears of a nuclear arms race in South Asia. The United
States and other countries imposed sanctions on both countries and
demanded they sign the CTBT unconditionally.
	   After the Indian announcement, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said she welcomed the ``small steps'' India and Pakistan
were making toward adhering to the treaty, but said more was
necessary.
	   India had been participating in discussions on the CTBT through
1996 but refused to continue, claiming the treaty is
discriminatory.
	   India wants the declared nuclear powers to agree to a deadline
to destroy their arsenals. The five declared powers _ the United
States, Britain, France China and Russia _ have refused.
	   Vajpayee said India conducted its nuclear tests in May because
of the ``deteriorating security environment which has obliged us to
stand apart from the CTBT in 1996.''
	   Now that India's security interests are settled, India wants to
continue to cooperate with the international community and is in
discussions with key countries on a range of issues, including the
test ban treaty, Vajpayee said.
	   ``We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful
conclusion, so that the entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed
beyond September 1999,'' Vajpayee said in his speech.
	   ``We expect that other countries ... will adhere to this treaty
without conditions,'' he said.
	   States that sign on to the CTBT must refrain from testing
nuclear devices and prevent any nuclear explosions on their
territory.
	   It must be signed and ratified by 44 countries with nuclear
powers before it can go into effect. Forty-one of those 44 states
have signed: India, Pakistan and North Korea have not. Of those 41
signatures, 10 have ratified the treaty: Australia, Austria,
Brazil, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Peru, Slovakia, and Britain.
	   Vajpayee noted that when that treaty goes into force, it won't
eliminate existing nuclear arsenals.
	   ``Yet we will participate in these negotiations in good faith in
order to ensure a treaty that is non-discriminatory and meets
India's security imperatives,'' he said.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed both announcements, saying
the pledges by both Vajpayee and Sharif ``increase the momentum for
implementing'' the treaty.
	   Annan said he was also gratified that both countries were
participating in the Conference on Disarmament to ban the
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices.
	   Sharif and Vajpayee met for nearly two hours Wednesday but
achieved no breakthroughs over Kashmir, a simmering territorial
dispute that took a perilous turn since both countries carried out
the nuclear tests.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over the
disputed state of Kashmir _ in the 51 years since the independent
states were carved out of the British empire.

Salman Rushdie says Islamic death sentence appears over
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: COMBINES prvs, CORRECTS quote in graf 2: ADDS background

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British author Salman Rushdie, speaking after Iran
distanced itself from an Islamic death sentence against him, said
Thursday that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended.
	   ``This looks like its over,'' Rushdie said. ``It means
everything.''
	   Speaking outside the Foreign Office where he was briefed on the
development that came out British talks with Iran in New York,
Rushdie said: ``It seems that this has been done in Iran with
consensus.''
	   Rushdie said that some organizations would be upset by the
decision, but said there didn't seem to be much mainstream
opposition within Iran.
	   ``An extraordinary thing has been achieved,'' Rushdie said.
	   Publication of Salman Rushdie's '' Satanic Verses'' in 1988
caused an uproar among Muslims around the world, who contended that
it insulted Islam. The novel brought an Iranian ``fatwa,'' or death
sentence from Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini in February 1989.
Islamic militants put a 1.2 million pound (dlrs 2 million) bounty
on the Indian-born British writer's head.
	   At the United Nations in New York, Iran's foreign minister said
his government was distancing itself from the reward for killing
Rushdie, and was ready to exchange ambassadors with Britain.
	   Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who met Kharrazi on the
sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session, said he was
delighted with Iran's decision.
	   ``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive
relationship between the United Kingdom, and I believe the European
Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our
relations,'' Cook said after the meeting.

Governments kick off preparations for new trade talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ As EU called for a comprehensive new round of
trade talks, the United States joined India and other developing
nations at the World Trade Organization Thursday in urging caution.
	   Peter Carl of the 15-nation European Union told a special WTO
meeting that a new round should tackle new areas, such as the
creation of new international rules for competition and investment,
as well as traditional topics of services and agriculture. The
meeting is the first of a series held to prepare for new trade
negotiations due to begin next year.
	   However, United States trade representative Rita Hayes told
governments that new issues need to be ``carefully considered''
before they are put on the agenda.
	   She argued for a gradual approach, saying negotiators should be
able to tear down barriers in individual areas without waiting for
agreement on all issues.
	   Some developing countries have been wary of talk of a
comprehensive round, arguing they should be given breathing space
first to sort out problems and enforce existing trade accords.
	   Indian trade officials told the meeting that implementation of
existing agreements must take top priority and special treatment
for developing countries must be given importance.
	   Officials told the meeting a comprehensive new trade round would
be ``premature.''
	   Egyptian trade officials, speaking on behalf of African nations,
told the meeting that, despite being home to 700 million people,
they were becoming increasingly marginalized in the multilateral
trading system. Africa's share in value terms of global trade had
dropped from 5.9 percent in 1980 to 2.3 percent in 1996, they said.
	   Brazilian trade officials said implementation of existing
commitments should take top priority.
	   Japanese trade officials favored a comprehensive series of talks
covering new areas as well as traditional issues.
	   Many countries favored completing the talks within three years
and spoke out against protectionism in favor of free trade, trade
officials said.

	   VASILEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Yugoslav jets streaked overhead,
frightened Kosovo civilians streamed southward Thursday, trying to
escape an offensive that has trapped hundreds of ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.
	   Yugoslav army and Serb police forces struck deeper into the last
stronghold of separatist Kosovo Albanians, ignoring a U.N. Security
Council demand to halt the crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
	   U.N. officials estimated about 15,000 refugees were fleeing the
fighting but said an accurate count was impossible because police
refused to grant them access to the area.
	   Albanian sources said Serb forces Thursday burned four villages
on the eastern side of Cicavica mountain and took control of eight
others on the southeastern slope near Obilic, about 20 kilometers
(12 miles) northwest of the provincial capital Pristina.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav government reacted with defiance
Thursday to the Security Council's demand for a cease-fire and for
President Slobodan Milosevic to enter talks on Kosovo's future.
	   The ruling Socialist Party, in a meeting chaired by Milosevic,
blamed ``Albanian separatism and terrorism'' for the crisis and
declared that ``rooting out terrorism'' was the top national
priority.
	   In Kosovo, artillery and tank fire thundered across the central
Drenica region Thursday, although it appeared the level of fighting
was lower than in previous days.
	   Nevertheless, thousands of terrified and exhausted refugees were
streaming south to escape the fighting. Several of them approached
foreign reporters, asking them whether NATO would soon intervene.
	   ``All of our houses were burned,'' said one refugee, Kaytaz
Hysni, 59. ``Even our bread was inside.''
	   About every 20 minutes, Yugoslav jets streaked overhead,
apparently on reconnaissance missions. Refugee children would pick
up sticks and pretend to fire guns at the planes.
	   The Serbian Media Center said police had ``closed the ring
around strong groups of Albanian extremists,'' destroying their
bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown Feb. 28 to destroy the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia. Albanians form 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million people.
	   As the refugees streamed past, small groups of uniformed KLA
fighters were hiding in the bushes. They appeared exhausted _ even
beaten _ after the sustained Serbian assault.
	   A 23-year-old KLA fighter, who said he left a factory job in
Germany four months ago to join the rebels, said Serb forces had
them cornered and there was no escape.
	   ``They are there, there and there,'' he said, pointing to three
hilltops. ``We can't leave. We'll only live if we win or if NATO
threatens Milosevic to stop.'' He refused to give his name.
	   A rebel commander, who gave his name only as Milushi, said Serb
police had arrested about 200 Albanian men of military age and were
holding them at a factory. He insisted they were all civilians.
	   ``They steal their things, burn their houses and then take them
hostage,'' Milushi said.
	   But in a meeting with the chief U.N. refugee official, Sadako
Ogata, Milosevic denied international claims of a looming
humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic, according to a statement distributed by the
government's Tanjug news agency, called international criticism of
Yugoslavia ``absurd.''
	   ``Pressures on Yugoslavia, which are unfortunately supported by
fabricated reports about the situation in Kosovo, do not contribute
to solving the problems, but only feed the illusions of terrorist
and separatist forces in their efforts to break away Kosovo from
Serbia and Yugoslavia,'' the statement quoted Milosevic as saying.
	   He assured Ogata that U.N. refugee workers were welcome in
Yugoslavia but warned they must demonstrate an ``objective
approach.''
	   In Vilamoura, Portugal, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said the alliance was moving ``to an increased level of military
preparedness'' without actually approving the use of force.
	   NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a number
of nations, including Germany and the Netherlands, already have
committed men and aircraft to any future military action against
Yugoslavia.
	   But an aide to the chief Albanian political leader in Kosovo,
Ibrahim Rugova, said U.N. and NATO moves may be too late.
	   ``Half of Kosovo is already destroyed and burned,'' the aide,
Enver Maljoku, said. ``I don't think Milosevic will take this
message from the U.N. seriously, and I'm afraid that he'll have
enough time to destroy the other half of Kosovo too.''

Israel criticizes Lithuania for delay in trial of war criminal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CLARIFIES in grafs 2-3 that Israelis say Lileikis responsible
for deaths of tens of thousands; CORRECTS age to 91 in graf 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel criticized Lithuania Thursday for
postponing the trial of an accused Nazi war criminal who had fled
prosecution in the United States.
	   Aleksandras Lileikis, 91, is facing charges of genocide in
Lithuania for allegedly sending 75 Jews to their deaths while he
served as security police chief in Vilnius during World War II.
	   The Israeli foreign ministry charged in a release Thursday that
Lileikis had sent ``tens of thousands of Jews to their deaths.''
	   Lileikis fled the United States to Lithuania in 1996 after he
was stripped of his U.S. citizenship. Justice Department
prosecutors presented evidence showing he had signed orders for
Jews to be killed by gunfire at execution pits near Vilnius.
	   During the U.S. proceedings, Lileikis admitted heading the
security police in Nazi-occupied Lithuania, but characterized
himself as ``a disembodied issuer of orders.''
	   His trial in Lithuania was slated to begin in September but was
delayed due to the deterioration in his health.
	   In Jerusalem, Israel's foreign ministry expressed ``dismay that
the trial of Alexander Lileikis ... has once again been
postponed,'' read a statement from the ministry.
	   ``Israel views the trial as symbolic and educational and hopes
that the legal and constitutional system in Lithuania will find the
appropriate, legal way to hold the trial,'' the statement said.
	   The United States has pressed Lithuania to try war criminals,
especially if the Baltic country wants to be considered for
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
	   Before World War II, Lithuania had a thriving Jewish community
which once numbered over 200,000, but it was almost entirely
whipped out after the war. Six million Jews were killed in the nazi
Holocaust.

Bomb explodes at Jerusalem bus stop; soldier injured

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A bomb ripped through a Jerusalem bus stop
Thursday near a large university campus and hospital as people
headed for work and classes. One soldier was wounded and the blast
caused extensive damage.
	   The bomb, which weighed about one kilogram (two pounds) and
possibly triggered by a timer, went off at about 8:00 a.m. (0600
gmt) across from the Hebrew University's School for Overseas
Students. Israel's army radio said the device was similar to
another bomb which went off in Tel Aviv in August.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, In New York to address the
United Nations General Assembly, said the bombing strengthened his
belief in the need for the Palestinians to take tough security
measures before the two sides can reach a deal to move ahead in
peace negotiations.
	   In Jerusalem, police cordoned off the area around the Mount
Scopus campus, which sits on the edge of the West Bank close to
several Palestinian villages. Soldiers, backed by air force
helicopters, searched for suspects.
	   Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said a white car with
Palestinian license plates was seen leaving the scene and was
stopped at a nearby Israeli army roadblock. But Jerusalem police
commander Yair Yitzhaki later said the driver of the car probably
had nothing to do with the bombing.
	   A soldier sitting at the bus stop when the bomb went off was in
moderate condition, after suffering injuries to the head from the
blast. Israel's Channel 2 TV said the bomb was placed in bushes
just behind the bus stop which was blown to pieces by the
explosion. The street and a campus lawn were littered with debris
from the blast.
	   ``I was sitting at the bus stop alone for a couple of minutes
and then I heard a loud boom which sent me to the ground,'' said
the soldier, Amir Davidan, who spoke to reporters from his hospital
bed.
	   There was no responsibility claim for the attack but Israel had
been bracing for an attack by the militant group Hamas which
threatened to carry out bombings in revenge for the killings of two
of its members by Israeli forces earlier this month.
	   Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel, has carried out deadly
bombings before, but its trademark has been suicide bombings in
crowded downtown areas or on buses. Thursday's bomb was relatively
small and the bus stop was located in an outlying neighborhood of
Jerusalem.
	   Israeli radios said police had been ordered to beef-up security
throughout the capital.
	   Meanwhile, near the West Bank town of Hebron, several shots were
fired at a van driven by Jewish settlers, but no one was injured.
Israel's Channel 2 TV said the bullets were fired from a car driven
by Palestinian residents of the tensely divided city, as the two
vehicles passed one another on a dirt road.

Ruling party affirms support for prime minister

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Promising Cabinet changes in the wake of
an opposition campaign to depose him, the Albanian prime minister
on Thursday received the endorsement of his ruling Socialist Party.
	   Fatos Nano told the party members that he would announce Cabinet
changes after consultations with the four other parties in the
ruling coalition. He did not say which ministers would be replaced,
but the sources said changes were likely in ministries of public
order, justice and finance.
	   No formal vote was taken during the meeting, party sources said
on condition of anonymity. But they said the party rejected calls
by opposition leader Sali Berisha for Nano to step down.
	   On Wednesday, the Socialist Party secretary, Petro Koci, said
some kind of government shakeup would occur in the next week in
response to two days of rioting last week by Berisha's supporters
that threatened to topple the government in this impoverished
Balkan nation.
	   Berisha, a former president, is under criminal investigation for
his role in the Sept. 13-14 rioting, which left at least three
people dead and scores injured.
	   The rioting erupted one day after popular politician and top
Berisha aide Azem Hajdari was shot to death. Rioters briefly held
the parliament building, studios of government television and other
state buildings until police regained control.
	   Berisha blamed Nano for the killing, but Western officials say
they believe Hajdari's death was due to a private feud.
	   Also Thursday, Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said
that police arrested two people _ including a former police chief _
for involvement in the rioting.
	   Sali Shehu was a former police chief in the cities of Shkodra,
Durres and Tirana during Berisha's term as president but was fired
by the Socialists.
	   Ekrem Spahia, head of the Party of Legality, was arrested for
appearing on state television during the rioting and declaring ``TV
is free now. It's ours.''

Analysts: NATO intervention unlikely to solve Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO is edging closer to air strikes
in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province _ a move that some say could have
the opposite effect of what NATO wants.
	   The strikes would be aimed at stopping President Slobodan
Milosevic's bloody crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists.
Instead, analysts in Belgrade say they could boost Milosevic's
popularity at home and strengthen his resolve to defeat the ethnic
Albanian resistance.
	   ``Milosevic is hoping that NATO will strike, at least a bit,''
said Stojan Cerovic, chief commentator of the independent Vreme
weekly. ``Then he can hope to become president for life.''
	   Throughout his 11-year-rule, Milosevic has counted on the long
history of Serbian defiance toward the West; he claims a world
conspiracy exists to subdue Serbia and turn it into a ``banana
republic.''
	   The Serbian public, largely nationalist and trained to listen to
what state-run propaganda is saying, likely would react defiantly
to any NATO intervention. Should that happen, Milosevic may choose
to continue his crackdown in Kosovo, considered by Serbs their holy
land.
	   Those who question the wisdom of NATO strikes also note that
bombing Serbian troops in Kosovo is almost certain to result in
damage to ethnic Albanians. There are no clear front lines, and
Serbian military and police installations are based close to urban
areas where ethnic Albanians are a majority.
	   ``One can think of air strikes, but who will you strike?''
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini asked during a briefing at
the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. ``How are you going to
distinguish one from another? Who do you want to punish?''
	   Most military hangars in Serbia proper are deep underground,
built at a time when Yugoslavia's maverick communists anticipated
Soviet strikes. Today, NATO air strikes likely could do them little
damage.
	   In Bosnia three years ago, NATO air strikes against Bosnian
Serbs eventually brought Milosevic to the negotiating table. The
Yugoslav military, however, is much better equipped and trained
than the ragtag units of the Bosnian Serbs.
	   Serbia's ultranationalist vice premier Vojislav Seselj recently
said that Serbs would retaliate against any NATO strike. ``We
cannot defeat NATO, but we can certainly cause them a lot of
damage,'' he said.
	   Yugoslav air defense is equipped with highly mobile,
radar-equipped SA-10 (Igla) short-range anti-aircraft rocket
systems that could strike at NATO jets. Also, the Yugoslav Air
Force has sophisticated Russian-made Mig 29s which can outclass
many Western fighters.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday his
government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for
killing British author Salman Rushdie, and was ready to exchange
ambassadors with Britain.
	   The Iranian ``government disassociates itself from any reward
which has been offered in this regard and does not support it,''

Robin Cook.

Sosa's homers provide bright spot amid Georges' devastation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIKO PRICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ It began as a rumor
that swept through the storm-ravaged streets of the capital. Anyone
with access to a working TV or radio tuned in to see if it was
true.
	   By Thursday, pretty much everyone had heard the news: U.S. Major
League Baseball star Sammy Sosa, the pride and joy of this
baseball-crazed Caribbean nation, had hit two home runs to tie Mark
McGwire. ``65,'' ran a front-page headline in Listin Diario
newspaper.
	   For a nation grieving its dozens of dead from Hurricane Georges,
Sosa's homers on Wednesday provided a needed bright spot.
	   ``This is tremendous,'' the Rev. Jose Arellano Guerrero said
after saying Mass to more than 1,000 people at Mercedes Church in
the colonial downtown. ``The nation has come to pray for the boy.
He helps us unite.''
	   Alfredo Liciano drove through town in a white Toyota, ``Sosa
64'' taped in large letters across the rear windshield.
	   ``I haven't had time to make it 65,'' he said. ``But I might
just go ahead and put 66, because he'll get there soon enough.''
	   With electricity out in almost all of the country and most TV
and radio stations off the air, it took time for people to learn of
Sosa's feat.
	   When the first reports came in by radio, listeners called in to
ask if it really was true. One said he didn't believe it, and
accused the government of inventing the story to cheer people up.
	   The defensive talk-show host explained that he couldn't really
confirm it either, although later in the show a colleague got on
the Internet and found that it was true.
	   On Tuesday night, the only TV station broadcasting ran a
half-hour homage to the Chicago Cubs star, showing him connecting
with pitch after pitch and receiving standing ovations.
	   Santo Domingo's Jaragua Hotel, still flooded and without
elevators or power to some rooms, slipped notes under every door
announcing the news. ``Sammy Sosa hit two more home runs
yesterday,'' it read. ``He is tied again for the record.''
	   Sosa's hometown, San Pedro de Macoris, was cut off from the
capital by phone and road, and there was no word on how it fared.
	   Sosa was quoted in local newspapers as dedicating his homers to
the Dominican people.
	   ``I am at the side of all Dominicans, of my people, of my nation
in these difficult moments,'' he told Listin Diario from Milwaukee.
``Hopefully these home runs ... will bring a little happiness.''

Catholic leader criticizes Protestant colleague
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Catholic deputy leader of
Northern Ireland's new government criticized his Protestant
colleague Thursday and vowed he wouldn't ``cover up'' their failure
to enact April's peace agreement in full.
	   Seamus Mallon dramatically broke his policy of public solidarity
with leader David Trimble, the embattled chief representative of
Northern Ireland's British Protestant majority.
	   Belfast's new legislative Assembly in July jointly elected
Trimble and Mallon to oversee a multi-party administration, called
the Executive and drawn from the legislature.
	   Trimble insists that the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party can't
receive Executive positions until the Irish Republican Army starts
disarming, which the IRA refuses to do.
	   Seeking to buy time, Trimble signaled two weeks ago that the
Executive wouldn't be fully formed until after he and Mallon
represent the new administration at a summit with the Irish
government. That summit _ which must be held by Oct. 31 according
to the agreement _ would mark a start to formal cooperation between
both parts of Ireland, another key aspect of the accord.
	   But as Trimble flew Thursday to New York City to promote U.S.
investment in Northern Ireland, Mallon announced that the full
Executive must be appointed first _ and he wouldn't be ``pushed
around'' on the matter.
	   April's agreement set a target of IRA disarmament by mid-2000,
but didn't explicitly link this goal to Sinn Fein's eligibility to
participate in government. Next year the Executive is supposed to
take over many responsibilities from the British government. Before
that, its members will operate in ``shadow'' mode _ without powers.
	   ``I have made it clear to the (British and Irish) governments,
and to Mr. Trimble, that there must be a shadow Executive,'' Mallon
said. ``I will not break the agreement by taking part in a
contrived situation to cover up the fact that the shadow Executive
has not been formed.''
	   Trimble faces profound Protestant opposition to inviting IRA
supporters into government so long as the IRA, despite holding to a
14-month truce, doesn't clearly renounce violence.
	   Key decisions in the 108-member Assembly must receive support
from majorities of both its British Protestant and Irish Catholic
blocs. But Trimble's hold over the 58-strong Protestant side of the
house is tenuous, with just 30 members supportive of the accord.
	   On Wednesday night, riot police protected Trimble from a furious
mob heckling him as he visited a hall of the Orange Order, Northern
Ireland's conservative Protestant fraternal group, in his home
district.

South Africa military intervention in Lesotho bogs down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Mandela defending intervention
 &UR; AP Photos MAS101-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ After a clumsy military intervention that
left Lesotho's capital burned and battered, South Africa on
Thursday faced the unwelcome prospect of a long and costly
occupation.
	   ``We're stuck with a vassal kingdom,'' said analyst Richard
Cornwell of the Institute for Security Studies. ``We wrecked the
bloody place'' and removing the troops now won't be easy.
	   Maseru, the capital of this impoverished kingdom, was tense
three days after the invasion. There were manned roadblocks on some
streets in the morning, though bullets stopped flying and residents
drifted back to their ruined homes and businesses in the afternoon.
	   Embattled Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili spoke via radio and
the general ditched by rebels returned to his headquarters. Many of
the mutineers are now prisoners of war guarded by South African
troops.
	   Damage estimates run into the millions of dollars, and it's
unclear where the money will come from to rebuild.
	   ``Nobody is going to open in this place anymore. It will be a
ghost town,'' Cheryl Robertson said as she stood outside a pillaged
Woolworths department store that she owns with her husband.
	   Criticism of the intervention is widespread. Opposition
political parties _ and their thousands of supporters _ still
insist the national elections last May were rigged. Troops of the
South African Defense Force are seen as an invading army.
	   South Africa President Nelson Mandela defended his government's
actions once again, telling reporters in Ottawa, Canada, ``It's not
a question of whether it was popular or not. It's a question of
whether it was right.''
	   Defenders claim Lesotho's armed forces were mutinous, the
country was sliding toward chaos, and they were invited in by legal
authorities. Mosisili claimed there was a plot to assassinate him.
	   His opponents dismissed that claim as ``trash.''
	   ``One day the (troops) will go home,'' predicted Molapo Qhobela,
leader of the Basotholand Congress Party, the main opposition
group. ``As soon as they go we are back to square one.''
	   The operation involving 800 South African soldiers _ belatedly
joined by 200 from Botswana _ arrived Tuesday morning without
warning and fought pitched battles against Lesotho's soldiers.
	   Who shot first remains unclear. But a well-placed source in the
Lesotho army said many Lesotho soldiers _ who were not mutineers _
battled the South Africans because they believed their country was
being invaded.
	   ``If the South African soldiers had come with a white flag and
broadcast a message that they wanted to talk and settle things, it
would have been totally different,'' the source said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Lesotho, a Belgium-sized country of 2 million people located
within South Africa's borders, has a history of upheaval _ only now
South Africa is directly involved.
	   A Joint Operations Center to handle emergencies was established
Thursday under the chairmanship of South African Ambassador Japhet
Ndlovu.
	   South African commander Col. Robbie Hartslief said his troops
will remain ``until law and order is restored.'' He did not say how
long that might be.
	   Sampie Terreblanche, a political analyst at Stellenbosch
University in South Africa, said, ``I foresee that at least 'til
the end of the year, quite a large contingent of South African
troops will have to remain in Lesotho'' to maintain public order
and guard installations such as important hydroelectric dams.

In German vote, challenger's wives mirror his ambitions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo FRA106 &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Some people say Gerhard Schroeder has a
wife for every turn of his political ambitions. Now, running for
chancellor, he's married to his fourth.
	   In some countries _ the United States, for example _ political
enemies could be expected to pounce on such a marital history. But
here, the Social Democratic challenger's private life has not been
an issue in the campaign for Sunday's national election _ at least
not publicly.
	   Yet, below the surface, the 54-year-old Schroeder's succession
of spouses reflects for some a political inconstancy that could
backfire with voters' asking themselves: Is this the kind of
chancellor Germans want leading them into the new millennium?
	   When Chancellor Helmut Kohl promotes himself as a trusted
statesman, he means to emphasize his stability in times of global
uncertainty brought on by the Russian financial crisis and
continuing conflict in the Balkans. But the image also contrasts
neatly with Schroeder's stormy personal history, and his changeable
politics.
	   Schroeder married his first wife as a student rebellion swept
through Europe in 1968. While others his age were protesting in the
streets Schroeder was working himself through night school, living
a world apart from young radicals trying to change the system. He
married his high-school sweetheart, Eva Schubach.
	   Three years later, they divorced as Schroeder plunged into
leftist politics in the Social Democratic Party. He married
language student Anne Taschenmacher, a fellow political activist.
	   By 1981, Schroeder had moved on politically. By then a lawyer
and representative in parliament, he met Hiltrud Hampel, an
unhappily married policeman's wife with two children. After a
long-running extramarital affair, they wed in 1984.
	   In a country where politicians' wives are seen but rarely heard,
Hiltrud and Gerhard Schroeder became a nationally known
power-couple, both with political ambitions. She courted support
from the liberal Greens, helping him win the the Lower Saxony state
governor's race in 1990.
	   Germans saw them as partners. He cozied up to business _
automaker Volkswagen is based in Lower Saxony _ and she worked for
environmental causes.
	   But as his ambitions grew, the marriage fell apart. After an
acrimonious divorce _ an uncomfortably public drama that included a
tell-all book by the spurned spouse that was not at all
well-received in Germany _ Schroeder married Doris Koepf, a
political reporter 20 years his junior. They celebrated their
wedding three weeks after the divorce, just as Schroeder was
working his party connections to win the nomination to challenge
Kohl.
	   Despite her husband's campaign as a force for change,
Schroeder-Koepf so far fits the traditional German mold of the
self-effacing politician's wife _ a much different role than that
of his third wife. She is intent on shielding herself and her
seven-year-old daughter from the limelight and claims no personal
political ambition.
	   ``I don't want to have the feeling that Gerd's success depends
on me,'' she once said, using her husband's nickname.
	   Schroeder's popularity ratings have fallen in recent weeks. In
his latest incarnation as chancellor candidate, Schroeder has
continued to fiddle with his political message. On the campaign
trail, he now defends the social welfare state he once pledged to
prune.
	   But because the ``character issue'' often central to U.S.
elections is a self-imposed taboo for German pollsters, it's hard
to gauge whether Schroeder's personal life will affect him on
election day.
	   Most pollsters think it won't. ``The divorce, that all happened
last year,'' said Dieter Roth of the Electoral Research Group
organization. ``It's dead and gone, and even at the time it had a
limited impact on his popularity.''
	   However, Schroeder's character, political and personal, isn't
absent from voters' thoughts.
	   ``After four wives one has to wonder whether there's something
wrong in his head,'' said Gerd Lynen, an engineer in Frankfurt.
``What is important to me is what he brings to the government. And
I have doubts about that.''

Turkish mafia figure sentenced to six months in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ A French court sentenced an alleged Turkish
mafia boss to six months in prison for using a false passport and a
fake identity card.
	   Alaatin Cakici, 45, who is believed to be one of Turkey's top
mafia bosses, was arrested in France in August on an international
arrest warrant.
	   The court hearing Thursday in a Nice court took place behind
closed doors and tight police surveillance due to death threats
that have been made against Cakici.
	   The prosecutor had demanded 10 months in prison and a residency
ban in France for Cakici. However, the court sentenced him to six
months in jail.
	   The court also sentenced Cakici's bodyguard, Muradi Guler, 37,
to six months in jail for illegally possessing arms.
	   Cakici has been on the run from Turkish justice for years. He
was caught Aug. 17 in Nice by French police using a diplomatic
passport.
	   An appeals court in nearby Aix-en-Provence is to rule in several
days on whether to extradite Caciki to Turkey as authorities there
have demanded.
	   Cakici is wanted for a series of murders since 1978.
	   Meanwhile, in Turkey, opposition leaders called for Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz to resign after televisions aired an alleged
taped conversation between Cakici and a state minister.
	   The alleged conversation between Cakici and Eyup Asik, state
minister in charge of state monopolies, is seen by many as the
latest proof of the links between the Turkish state and underworld.
	   Asik, a close aide of Yilmaz, said the tape was a fabrication,
although he admitted to several conversations with Cakici. Yilmaz,
currently in the U.S., was quoted by daily Sabah as saying that he
believed the allegations were false.

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to restore ``BC'' to slug. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Without their top player Petr
Korda, the Czechs will drop out of the elite World Group for the
first time if they lose their Davis Cup match to South Africa this
weekend.
	   On Friday, Slava Dosedel takes on Wayne Ferreira and Bohdan
Ulihrach plays Marcos Ondruska.
	   In Saturday's doubles, David Rikl and Jiri Novak will face
Ferreira and Piet Norval. The reverse singles are Sunday.
	   Davis Cup champions in 1980 when Czechoslovakia was still one
country, the Czechs now face the prospect of falling out of the
World Group.
	   ``I hope our team will lead 2-0 after Friday's singles,'' Czech
captain Tomas Smid said. ``But Slava will have to leave his soul on
the court to win.''
	   Ferreira was instrumental in taking South Africa to the
threshold of the World Group again after his country was excluded
from Davis Cup play between 1978 and 1992.
	   ``We have two pretty much equal teams facing each other,'' South
Africa's coach Danie Visser said.

Police detain Turkish far-left party leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Police took away the leader of Turkey's
far-left Workers Party for questioning Thursday following
allegations that he aided Kurdish rebels, the party said.
	   Dogu Perincek was detained along with six other senior party
officials, said his deputy, Hasan Yalcin.
	   No details were made public about the allegations, which the
party said were raised by an informant among the rebels.
	   Party members gathered in front of their headquarters in
downtown Ankara to protest Perincek's detention.
	   Perincek, who has served prison terms under military rule, has
led the Marxist movement since the 1970s. The party has a small
following but no seats in the 550-member Parliament.
	   Kurdish rebels began their war for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast in 1984; nearly 37,000 people have been killed since
then.

New talks scheduled on Western Sahara
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ New talks mediated by the United Nations
on the status of Western Sahara will be held in Lisbon in the next
two weeks, the Moroccan Interior Minister said Thursday.
	   The new round of talks will try to resolve problems that have
arisen over whether some 65,000 members of three desert tribes will
be able to participate in a referendum on the territory's status.
	   Last year, Morocco and the Western Sahara rebels, known as the
Polisario Front, agreed to conditions for a U.N.-sponsored
referendum on whether the territory should become independent or be
absorbed by Morocco.
	   The rebels believe that only 4,000 of the tribal members should
be able to vote, while Morocco says that all 65,000 of them are
eligible.
	   Each side has accused the other of obstructing or meddling in
U.N.-organized voter identification, a complex process of
interviewing up to 250,000 people by a panel of tribal sheiks from
both sides.
	   The referendum was originally scheduled for Dec. 7 but it has
now been pushed back and a new date has not yet been set.
	   The new talks are to be attended by representatives from
Morocco, the Western Sahara rebels and former U.S. Secretary of
State James Baker III, who has named U.N. envoy to Western Sahara
last year.

 &UR; Supreme commander says village destruction isn't the end &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) - Mention the name Slobodan Milosevic
to Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe,
and his nostrils flare, his jaw tightens, the words flow hard and
fast.
	   Milosevic, of course, is the Yugoslav president who is shelling
and burning villages in the southern Serbian province Kosovo,
systematically driving ethnic Albanians from their homes in an
effort to end all attempts to achieve independence, or even a wider
autonomy.
	   The result has been tragic. Hundreds of dead. Hundreds of
thousands of displaced.
	   ``What we are really talking about here is a humanitarian
disaster precipitated by the cold political calculus of an
autocratic leader who has pursued a political strategy by military
means against his own citizens,'' says the American four-star
general who commands all NATO forces in Europe.
	   ``This is not the same as Bosnia in that Bosnia was a different
country,'' said Clark in a conversation on the sidelines of a NATO
defense ministers meeting in this Portuguese seaside resort.
	   ``It's another variant of the problem of failing states in the
post-Cold War environment. Yugoslavia was a failing state when it
fractured and split. Now, unprecedented military force is being
applied against these unarmed militants throughout rural Kosovo as
part of some kind of military strategy apparently aimed at
punishing the population.''
	   He pauses only briefly for breath.
	   ``He is moving at a high rate of speed to complete the
destruction before winter sets in. But the destruction of those
villages is unlikely to mark the end of his efforts to repress the
spirit and institutions of Albanian nationalism which have emerged.
What we expect to see is a more intensive focus on the displaced
populace as well as those in urban concentrations in an effort to
identify and attack any residual elements of the Kosovar cause.
	   ``So the fact that the destruction of the villages is almost
wrapped up or could be wrapped up in another few weeks, and that
the sound of artillery might diminish, shouldn't lead us to believe
that the situation will return to normal in Kosovo.''
	   Balkan machinations hold few surprises for Clark, who was the
general heading the military negotiations for the 1995 Dayton peace
accords on Bosnia. Now, he is the man who will command any eventual
allied military operation against the Yugoslav president.
	   But turn the subject to eventual military measures, and the flow
of the conversation becomes monosyllabic.
	   How will bombing Yugoslavia change anything?
	   ``There will be a significant reduction in the ability of
Yugoslav police and military forces to continue military operations
in Kosovo.''
	   Can Milosevic really be bombed into submission?
	   ``There are adequate measures to significantly impact Serb
military and police actions in Kosovo, with all the consequences
that that would mean.''
	   But will it really work?
	   ``In doing this, those elements of the Serb population that
believe they can conduct a war against elements of their own
country are going to be surprised. They are going to find there is
a heavy price to pay.''

Former foreign minister says son suspected of spying for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Former Foreign Minister Olavi J.
Mattila said Thursday that his son, Olli Mattila, a government
official, was suspected of passing secret documents to Russia.
	   On Wednesday, government members and police said they suspected
a Foreign Ministry official of giving classified papers, including
European Union documents, to two diplomats from the Russian Embassy
in Helsinki.
	   No details of the documents were given or when the alleged
spying took place. However, newspapers on Thursday reported that
the suspect was Olli Mattila, 39, who worked in the ministry's
commercial division.
	   ``I have known about it since Monday. My son told me about it
(that he was suspected of espionage),'' the elder Mattila told YLE
television news.
	   ``I'm not overly concerned about it. It was a question of normal
diplomatic contacts, which I believe is completely normal, having
being a diplomat myself,'' he said. ``But the matter must be
thoroughly investigated.''
	   Olli Mattila was unavailable for comment. Police and officials
have declined to identify the suspect.
	   After interrogating a suspect, police said they had reason to
believe that a foreign power had received information which could
damage Finland's foreign relations.
	   ``This case is particularly problematic because an intelligence
agency has broken into the core area of foreign policy decision
making,'' Security Police director Seppo Nevala said Wednesday. He
gave no details.
	   After the incident was discovered the ministry official was
given new duties in the ministry. A process of suspension was being
considered, officials said.
	   One of the Russian diplomats involved in the alleged espionage
had left the country when the case came to light. The other was
expelled, officials said.
	   The Foreign Ministry had informed the EU about the case, but
officials in Brussels said it was a domestic Finnish affair.
	   Finland, which joined the EU in 1995, is preparing to take over
the union presidency in July next year.
	   ``As Finland has otherwise performed conscientiously in the EU,
this sort of case naturally gives us the wrong kind of publicity,''
said Ole Norrback, minister for European affairs.
	   Olavi J. Mattila, 79, was foreign minister from 1971 to 1972 and
in 1975. He also held portfolios in the trade and industry ministry
and foreign trade ministry in the early 1960s and 1970s.

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO instructed its generals Thursday
to begin preparing for air strikes on Yugoslavia unless President
Slobodan Milosevic ends his attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   The big question now: Will the tough Yugoslav president be
intimidated?
	   The difference between this action and previous NATO tough talk
is the tone and the timing, NATO officials asserted. A tough U.N.
resolution Wednesday, combined with NATO's ``activation warning''
Thursday of phased air strikes and cruise missile attacks takes the
16-nation alliance to the brink of shooting.
	   ``Today, NATO sent a clear message to President Milosevic that
it is time to stop the killing and destruction in Kosovo,'' said
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen after a meeting of allied
defense ministers. ``Our patience is running out.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the activation warning
from the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policy-making body,
takes NATO ``to an increased level of military preparedness.''
	   But he added, ``Let me stress that the use of force will require
further decisions'' by NATO governments.
	   Milosevic's massive attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in
Kosovo have continued unabated since February, despite previous
NATO threats. His seven-month crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists fighting for independence in Kosovo has claimed
hundreds of lives and forced as many as 275,000 people from their
homes.
	   Previous threats of military action have failed to persuade
Milosevic to mend his ways, and the latest saber-rattling from the
alliance did not appear to have slowed his onslaught on Kosovo, a
province of Serbia where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the
population.
	   If the political decision is made to launch a NATO military
action against Yugoslavia, it would be a phased campaign, gradually
increasing in intensity.
	   ``The targets would be military targets,'' said Walter B.
Slocombe, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy. ``Very, very
effective and very, very strong blows would be aimed at the very
instruments that Milosevic is using to carry out this repression.''
	   Asked if he thought NATO could bomb Milosevic into submission,
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said: ``I believe that we have a wide range of options available to
us, the end result of which will be that Milosevic will comply with
the demands made of him by NATO.''
	   ``Certainly we will start with the lighter of the options to
give him a chance to respond,'' he added. ``But it might not end
with the light option.''
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe, said
it would take ``just a very few days'' to line up the necessary
forces to begin a military operation. He has already surveyed what
he will need; now, under the ``activation warning,'' he will be
asking for specific commitments.
	   A number of countries indicated at Thursday's ministerial
meeting they would participate, according to Slocombe. None said
they would not.
	   Clark noted that Milosevic is moving fast to complete the
destruction of ethnic Albanian villages before winter sets in.
	   ``Belgrade is clearly conducting a war against its own people,''
said German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. ``Pictures of people
camping out in the open ... are in themselves an ultimatum'' to
Milosevic.
	   The NATO defense ministers made clear their call for a cessation
of hostilities goes out to both sides. ``All of the blame for this
war does not entirely rest with the Serbian side,'' Slocombe said.
	   NATO has no military assets of its own except for some
communications hardware and airborne warning and control aircraft.
But it has access to a wide array of equipment from the national
armies of all its members except Iceland, which has no military
force.
	   The three candidate members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, who will be welcomed into the NATO fold next April, have
also said they are prepared to participate in the Kosovo operation.

Confederations' Cup dominates FIFA meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH (AP) _ While the controversial Super League was expected
to monopolize attention at the FIFA executive committee meetings
Thursday, it was the Confederations' Cup that was on everyone's
lips.
	   The executive committee meetings, for the first time scheduled
over two days, had planned to cover a host of issues ranging from
the threat of a spin-off league to effects of the Bosman ruling to
doping in soccer.
	   But as closed-mouthed members filtered out of FIFA headquarters
on Thursday, it became apparent that the upcoming Confederations'
Cup had dominated much of the discussions.
	   Scheduled next January 8-20 _ when leagues in the southern
hemisphere is in full swing and those in Europe are off _ many
associations are unhappy with the time slot for the eight-nation
competition.
	   With clubs required to release players for international
service, many teams are left without its stars for league
competition.
	   FIFA will make a final decision on the dates during Friday's
meetings.
	   The meetings also covered contracts for marketing and television
for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, a symposium on women's football
and the affiliation of new member national associations.
	   Friday, FIFA will also decide on various matters including the
composition of various FIFA standing committees until 2002, FIFA
competitions including the World Cup, the Confederations' Cup, the
women's World Cup, the structure of the FIFA general secretariat,
and various disputes with national associations.
	   FIFA will also review South Korea's request that the 2002 World
Cup be advanced to May to avoid the rainy season.
	   FIFA had earlier opposed the change because June and July are
traditionally reserved for the World Cup, and ``any change of
timing would severely disrupt soccer operations around the world.''
	   The quadrennial, month-long competition traditionally has
started around June 10, after the professional soccer season in
Europe and South America ends in April.
	   However, officials asked both nations to investigate past
weather in the region between May and September to allow FIFA's
executive committee to make a final decision Friday.

	   VASILEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Yugoslav jets streaked overhead,
frightened Kosovo civilians streamed southward Thursday, trying to
escape an offensive that has trapped hundreds of ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.
	   Yugoslav army and Serb police forces struck deeper into the last
stronghold of separatist Kosovo Albanians, ignoring a U.N. Security
Council demand to halt the crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
	   U.N. officials estimated some 15,000 refugees were fleeing the
fighting but said an accurate count was impossible because police
refused to grant them access to the area.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav government reacted with defiance
Thursday to the Security Council's demand for a cease-fire and for
President Slobodan Milosevic to enter talks on Kosovo's future.
	   The ruling Socialist Party, in a meeting chaired by Milosevic,
blamed ``Albanian separatism and terrorism'' for the crisis and
declared that ``rooting out terrorism'' was the top national
priority.
	   Albanian sources said Serb forces Thursday burned four villages
and took control of eight others in the central Drenica region.
Artillery and tank fire thundered across the region, although it
appeared the level of fighting was lower than in previous days.
	   Nevertheless, thousands of terrified and exhausted refugees were
streaming south to escape the fighting. Several of them approached
foreign reporters, asking them whether NATO would soon intervene.
	   ``All of our houses were burned,'' said one refugee, Kaytaz
Hysni, 59. ``Even our bread was inside.''
	   Every 20 minutes, Yugoslav jets streaked overhead, apparently on
reconnaissance missions. Refugee children would pick up sticks and
pretend to fire guns at the planes.
	   The Serbian Media Center said police had ``closed the ring
around strong groups of Albanian extremists,'' destroying their
bases in 15 villages in the region.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown Feb. 28 to destroy the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia. Albanians form 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million people.
	   As the refugees streamed past, small groups of KLA fighters were
hiding in the bushes, appearing exhausted _ even beaten _ after the
sustained Serbian assault.
	   A 23-year-old KLA fighter who refused to give his name said Serb
forces had them cornered and there was no escape.
	   ``We can't leave,'' he said. ``We'll only live if we win or if
NATO threatens Milosevic to stop.''
	   A rebel commander, who gave his name only as Milushi, said Serb
police had arrested about 200 Albanian men of military age and were
holding them at a factory. He insisted they were all civilians.
	   ``They steal their things, burn their houses and then take them
hostage,'' Milushi said.
	   But in a meeting with the chief U.N. refugee official, Sadako
Ogata, Milosevic denied international claims of a looming
humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo.
	   He assured Ogata that U.N. refugee workers were welcome in
Yugoslavia but warned they must demonstrate an ``objective
approach.''
	   In Vilamoura, Portugal, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said the alliance was moving ``to an increased level of military
preparedness'' without actually approving the use of force.
	   NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a number
of nations, including Germany and the Netherlands, already have
committed men and aircraft to any future military action against
Yugoslavia.
	   But an aide to the chief Albanian political leader in Kosovo,
Ibrahim Rugova, said U.N. and NATO moves may be too late.
	   ``Half of Kosovo is already destroyed and burned,'' the aide,
Enver Maljoku, said. ``I don't think Milosevic will take this
message from the U.N. seriously, and I'm afraid that he'll have
enough time to destroy the other half of Kosovo too.''

Armenian nuclear plant to be shut down for repairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A nuclear plant that produces 40 percent
of Armenia's power supply is being shut down Friday for maintenance
and refueling, the plant director said Thursday.
	   The press service of the Armenian Energy Ministry said that the
Medzamor nuclear power plant, 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of the
capital Yerevan and 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the Turkish
border, would be closed for 55 days. The ministry is spending dlrs
10 million on nuclear fuel purchases from Russia, and dlrs 8
million on scheduled repairs.
	   The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development called on Armenia to close the plant by the end of 2004
as a condition for a dlrs 57.4 million credit extended in 1994 for
construction of a new power station, Energy Ministry official Areg
Galstyan said. That plant will use natural gas and fuel oil.
	   But Suren Azatyan, the director of the nuclear plant, said the
EBRD's demand was unjustified, the Interfax news agency reported
Thursday. He said that the Medzamor plant had operated during just
13 years of its reactors' 30-year service life.
	   The plant was built in 1979, then closed in 1989 as a precaution
after a devastating 1988 earthquake in northern Armenia that killed
25,000 people.
	   Armenia's decision to restart one of its two reactors in 1996
triggered protests from neighboring Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey,
which consider the plant unsafe because of its proximity to a
geological fault line.
	   But Armenian officials insist the plant is reliable and
absolutely necessary to the nation. Fuel and energy supplies were
critically low for a number of years, but the situation has eased
in part because the Medzamor plant resumed operation.

Tel Aviv, Gaza and Barcelona sign agreement to promote peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Gaza's mayor was once held in an Israeli
prison, his counterpart from Tel Aviv once served as Israel's
Minister of Police.
	   The two met Thursday in this Spanish city and signed a so-called
Friendship and Mutual Cooperation Agreement that they claimed was a
groundbreaking step toward peace in the Middle East.
	   ``Here you have an agreement, the first of its kind, between the
two largest cities in Israel and Palestine,'' said Mayor of Gaza
Aown Shawa.
	   The agreement followed 18 months of negotiations between Gaza,
Tel Aviv, Barcelona, and the European Union's representative to the
Middle East, Miguel Angel Moratinos. Barcelona's role is primarily
that of facilitator.
	   ``This is an important step toward the real peace that all of us
dream about,'' said Tel Aviv's mayor Roni Milo, promising that it
would open up dialogue between ordinary citizens.
	   ``Peace is made not only by governments, but also by people,''
added Milo who served in a number of cabinet positions with the
Likud government, including Minister of Police from 1990-92. He is
currently a vocal supporter of the Oslo peace agreements between
Israel and Palestine, and the concept of a Palestinian state.
	   The Friendship and Mutual Cooperation Agreement commits everyone
involved to work for the implementation of the Oslo peace
agreements.
	   Gaza's mayor said he hoped it could help compensate for the
``stagnation'' of dialogue between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``Ordinarily, peace is best achieved by negotiations between
national governments, but when one country is trying its best to
block the peace process, then the influence of the people can help
unblock it,'' Shawa said.
	   Among the things called for in the agreement are exchanges of
know-how and experiences in business, science and culture.
	   Milo foresees, for instance, people from the world of culture
preparing a show in Barcelona to take on the road to Gaza and Tel
Aviv.
	   Another project involves converting the former site of a
slaughterhouse in Gaza into a park to be called Peace Park, with
assistance from both Tel Aviv and Barcelona.
	   Shawa, 64, said the new agreement showed that Barcelona was
``the most active city in Europe in promoting peace in the
Mediterranean region.'' He said the northeastern Spanish city had
earned this title when it hosted the EuroMed conference of regional
leaders in 1995.
	   A emotional Joan Clos, Barcelona's mayor, said, ``We offer
Barcelona as a city where those who trust more in the face-to-face
than the written word can work together for peace.''

Ecuador's president faces protests over economic package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Six weeks in office, President Jamil
Mahuad faces a wave of protests and a looming national strike after
he announced tough economic reforms to rescue Ecuador's shaky
economy.
	   Ecuador's largest labor federation, the United Workers Front,
has called a national strike for Oct. 1 to protest the reforms,
which include a devaluation of the national currency and an end to
subsidies on cooking gas, electricity and diesel oil.
	   About 3,000 students, workers and housewives banging empty
cooking pots marched through Quito on Wednesday to demand that the
government not implement the reforms.
	   Three police officers were injured and three students were
arrested in clashes during the sometimes violent protest, police
said.
	   ``We will win the streets to with marches and force the
government to withdraw these measures, which are going to starve
the people,'' said Wilson Becerra, a United Workers Front leader.
	   The reforms, announced Sep. 14, increase the prices of cooking
gas by 400 percent and more than double the price of electricity in
this poor Andean nation.
	   The reforms were aimed at reducing annual inflation that exceeds
40 percent, one of the highest in Latin America, and eliminating
Ecuador's ballooning budget deficit, which has the nation on the
verge of bankruptcy, said Mahuad. He took office on Aug. 10.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A bomb exploded at a Jerusalem bus stop
Thursday near a large university campus and hospital as people
headed for work and classes. One soldier was injured and the blast
caused extensive damage.
	   The bomb, which weighed about one kilogram (two pounds), went
off at about 8:00 a.m. (0600 GMT) across from the Hebrew
University's School for Overseas Students, on the edge of the West
Bank. Israeli army radio said the device was similar to another
bomb which went off in Tel Aviv in August.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in New York to address the
U.N. General Assembly, said the bombing strengthened his belief in
the need for the Palestinians to take tough security measures
before the two sides can move ahead in peace negotiations.
	   In Jerusalem, police cordoned off the area around the Mount
Scopus campus, which sits close to several Palestinian villages.
Soldiers, backed by air force helicopters, searched for suspects.
	   A soldier sitting at the bus stop when the bomb went off was in
fair condition, after suffering injuries to the head from the
blast. Israel's Channel 2 TV said the bomb was placed in bushes
just behind the bus stop, which was blown to pieces by the
explosion. The street and a campus lawn were littered with debri.
	   ``I was sitting at the bus stop alone for a couple of minutes
and then I heard a loud boom which sent me to the ground,'' said
the soldier, Amir Davidan, from his hospital bed.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing. Israel has
been bracing for an attack by the militant group Hamas, which
threatened to carry out bombings in revenge for the killings of two
of its members by Israeli forces earlier this month.
	   Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel, has carried out deadly
bombings before, but its trademark has been suicide bombings in
crowded downtown areas or on buses. Thursday's bomb was relatively
small and the bus stop was in an outlying neighborhood of
Jerusalem.
	   Israeli radio said police had been ordered to beef up security
throughout the capital.
	   Meanwhile, near the West Bank town of Hebron, several shots were
fired at a van driven by Jewish settlers, but no one was injured.
Channel 2 TV said the bullets were fired from a car driven by
Palestinian residents of the tensely divided city.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Kongulu Mobutu, a son of the late Zairian dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, has died as the result of a long illness, the
Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco said Thursday. He was 28.
	   Kongulu Mobutu was one of nine children. He had been admitted to
the hospital under a false name. No other details were available.
	   Mobutu Sese Seko, who was toppled in May 1997 after 32 years of
despotic rule that ruined his country, died in exile in Morocco
four months late of prostate cancer.
	   Like his father, the younger Mobutu fled Zaire when rebels led
by Laurent Kabila overthrew the government. The country has now
been renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   The elder Mobutu had a lavish villa in southern France, but it
was not clear whether his son had been living there before he was
admitted to Princess Grace Hospital in nearby Monaco.
	   Kongulu Mobutu was army general known for his brutality at the
time of the rebel takeover.

Turkish Cabinet minister resigns following allegations of links to

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Cakici's sentencing in Nice;
Asik resigning also as member of Parliament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish Cabinet minister announced his
resignation Thursday after news shows aired what allegedly were his
taped telephone conversations with one of Turkey's top mafia
bosses.
	   The conversation was seen by many as only the latest evidence of
links between the Turkish state and underworld.
	   A key political party had threatened earlier in the day to
withdraw its support from Premier Mesut Yilmaz's minority
government unless Eyup Asik quit as minister in charge of state
monopolies.
	   Without the Republic People's Party's 55 deputies, Yilmaz would
lack the parliamentary majority he needs to govern.
	   Asik said he would hand his resignation to Yilmaz when the
premier returns from a visit to the United States. He said he would
ask prosecutors to launch an investigation that he said would prove
his innocence.
	   Asik said he also was resigning as a member of Parliament. That
means he would lose his parliamentary immunity from any prosecution
if his fellow lawmakers accept his resignation.
	   On Wednesday, news shows broadcast what they said was a taped
conversation between Asik and godfather Alaattin Cakici.
	   In transcripts published by newspapers, Cakici thanks Asik for
helping him avoid arrest by tipping him off with details of a
police operation.
	   Asik, a close aide of Yilmaz, admitted to several conversations
with Cakici but claims the barely audible tape was a fake, perhaps
made by splicing together segments of conversations.
	   Yilmaz was quoted by Sabah daily as saying that he believed the
allegations were false.
	   Cakici was arrested last month in France, where he had been
traveling with a diplomatic passport, raising suspicion that he had
been under the protection of Turkey's public officials. He is
wanted in a series of murders committed since 1978.
	   On Thursday, a court in Nice sentenced him to six months in
prison for using a fake passport and identity card.
	   An appeals court in nearby Aix-en-Provence is to rule in several
days on whether to extradite Caciki to Turkey as authorities there
have demanded.
	   Turkey has been rocked by allegations of state-mafia relations
since 1996, when a car crash injured a legislator and killed a
police official and a fugitive terrorist _ all riding together in
the same car.

 &UR; Spokesman: No agreement to bring Formula One to Indy &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Thursday statement. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The Indianapolis Motor Speedway said
Thursday it has not reached an agreement to bring a Formula One to
the famed track, contradicting media reports that the Grand Prix
circuit will return to the United States in two years.
	   ``There hasn't been anything new on our efforts to bring Formula
One here for weeks,'' said Fred Nation, a spokesman for the
speedway. ``The story that we've reached an agreement is simply not
true.''
	   The Indianapolis Star reported Thursday that Tony George, the
Speedway president, and Bernie Ecclestone, president of Formula One
Administration Ltd., had reached an agreement to have the track
host a new U.S. Grand Prix race in September 2000. The newspapers
cited a source familiar with the negotiations.
	   Indianapolis television station WTHR reported Wednesday that the
deal has been completed but not signed.

Cyprus could cause regional conflict, Yilmaz says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Greek Cypriot government's decision to
deploy new anti-aircraft missiles threatens to turn the standoff on
the divided island into a regional conflict, Turkey's prime
minister warned Thursday.
	   Actions ``by Greece and the Greek-Cypriots poses a serious
threat to the security of the Turkish republic on northern Cyprus
and on Turkey and to peace and stability in the eastern
Mediterranean,'' Mesut Yilmaz told the General Assembly.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974 in
the wake of a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkish Cypriots have set up a breakaway state _ recognized only
by Turkey _ which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   In his speech, Yilmaz renewed Turkey's call for the creation of
a confederation on the Mediterranean island.
	   ``I believe that the proposed confederation can finally open an
avenue for peace, reconciliation based on a common destiny for the
two peoples in Cyprus.'' Yilmaz said.
	   The internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government, with
the support of the five permanent members of the Security Council,
rejects any proposal that would entrench the island's division.
	   The Greek Cypriot government wants to deploy S-300 Russian
anti-aircraft missiles, prompting Turkish threats to respond by
force if necessary. Greece has warned that could lead to war
between the two NATO partners.
	   ``Forces of the Greek, Greek-Cypriot camp have heightened
tensions on the island. The clock is ticking for the deployment of
the S-300 missile system,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Greece's foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, was expected to
address the assembly later Thursday.
	   Yilmaz said European Union's decision to start negotiations with
the Greek Cypriot side on entering the EU also has made it more
difficult to reach a settlement.
	   Talks have been deadlocked since August, when Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash demanded recognition of his breakaway state
and cancellation of EU entry talks with Cyprus as preconditions for
returning to the negotiating table.
	   Denktash has been refusing to see EU officials unless his terms
are accepted.

Confederations' Cup dominates FIFA meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH (AP) _ While the controversial Super League was expected
to monopolize attention at the FIFA executive committee meetings
Thursday, it was the Confederations' Cup that was on everyone's
lips.
	   The executive committee meetings, for the first time scheduled
over two days, had planned to cover a host of issues ranging from
the threat of a spin-off league to effects of the Bosman ruling to
doping in soccer.
	   But as closed-mouthed members filtered out of FIFA headquarters
on Thursday, it became apparent that the upcoming Confederations'
Cup had dominated much of the discussions.
	   Scheduled next January 8-20 _ when leagues in the southern
hemisphere is in full swing and those in Europe are off _ many
associations are unhappy with the time slot for the eight-nation
competition.
	   With clubs required to release players for international
service, many teams are left without its stars for league
competition.
	   FIFA will make a final decision on the dates during Friday's
meetings.
	   The meetings also covered contracts for marketing and television
for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, a symposium on women's football
and the affiliation of new member national associations.
	   Friday, FIFA will also decide on various matters including the
composition of various FIFA standing committees until 2002, FIFA
competitions including the World Cup, the Confederations' Cup, the
women's World Cup, the structure of the FIFA general secretariat,
and various disputes with national associations.
	   FIFA will also review South Korea's request that the 2002 World
Cup be advanced to May to avoid the rainy season.
	   FIFA had earlier opposed the change because June and July are
traditionally reserved for the World Cup, and ``any change of
timing would severely disrupt soccer operations around the world.''
	   The quadrennial, month-long competition traditionally has
started around June 10, after the professional soccer season in
Europe and South America ends in April.
	   However, officials asked both nations to investigate past
weather in the region between May and September to allow FIFA's
executive committee to make a final decision Friday.

World Cup cricketers get fashion conscious
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Branded pyjama cricket when it emerged two decades
ago, the one-day version of cricket has certainly reached new
levels in the fashion stakes.
	   A handful of international cricketers took to the catwalk at
London's Fashion Cafe Thursday to model new uniforms for the 12
teams competing at the 1999 World Cup.
	   The new uniforms, designed by Asics, feature a national icon of
the competing nation, names and numbers.
	   Defending champion Sri Lanka has a symbolic lion across its
shirt, while the green and gold strip of Australia, runners-up at
the last World Cup, is complemented by a symbol of the Southern
Cross.
	   The World Cup starts in May next year and will be played in
England, Wales and the Netherlands.

Thousands grieve hurricane victims in Dominican Republic

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominicans crammed
churches on their patron saint's day Thursday to grieve for the
scores of dead and hundreds missing from Hurricane Georges' rampage
through their country.
	   Across the Caribbean, Georges' death toll climbed past 110, and
damages reached into billions of dollars. The hurricane struck
southern Cuba on Wednesday, crossed it and threatened the Florida
Keys, where 100,000 people were ordered to flee its path.
	   ``On this day of (the Virgin) Mercedes, all the victims of
Hurricane Georges are present and we pray for the injured,'' the
Rev. Jose Arellano Guerrero said at the musty, stone Mercedes
Church in Santo Domingo's colonial city. He proceeded to read the
names of the dead from tiny scraps of paper.
	   At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) Thursday, Georges was centered near
Cayo Coco on Cuba's north coast and was moving west-northwest at 12
mph (19 kph). Its winds were near 80 mph (130 kph).
	   Bad news kept coming throughout the Caribbean: 27 dead in Haiti,
dlrs 2 billion in damage and hundreds of homes lost in Puerto Rico,
three dead and two missing in St. Kitts. Everywhere, victims
struggled to find water, food, ice and other bare essentials to
cope with loss and the tropical heat.
	   Dominican President Leonel Fernandez stunned the nation when he
said at least 70 Dominicans had died and hundreds were missing when
Georges' 110-mph (175-kph) winds swept through this impoverished
Caribbean nation Tuesday.
	   Rescuers searched for more victims, including 45 people missing
when floods swept away a shelter in San Cristobal. Army helicopters
and a U.S. Coast Guard C-130 airplane and helicopter combed the
Dominican countryside to assess the magnitude of the disaster.
	   More than 100,000 people lost homes, President Fernandez said.
Telephone lines were down throughout the country, and hundreds of
people were isolated from help by flooding. Airports in La Romana
and Puerto Plata were severely damaged.
	   More than 1,000 people prayed beneath the vaulted ceilings of
the Mercedes Church, some kneeling on the floor, their lips moving
as they prayed to a life-size Virgin Mary in white and gold gown.
They included Carmela Hernandez, 80, who lost three fingers when
the storm blew a door shut onto her right hand.
	   Hernandez, wearing a bloodied bandage, said the Mass ``gives me
peace.'' Then suddenly, she doubled over in pain and had to leave.
	   Arellano said this year's traditional street procession honoring
the virgin was canceled because downed power lines and trees made
it too dangerous.
	   People wandered through Santo Domingo, a city of 3 million, with
empty plastic jugs searching for water to drink. Many filled them
with filthy brown river water.
	   ``I know it's bad, but there's nothing else,'' said Altagracia
Duran, 40, who had searched all morning for water.
	   The Red Cross mobilized to deliver aid, and army soldiers
patrolled the capital with rifles to deter looting that surged
during the storm. Tourists at one hotel went on a city tour by bus,
to sightsee and to catch a glimpse of the damage.
	   In Cuba, Georges caused some damage to agricultural crops,
knocked out electricity in eastern parts of the island and caused
some rivers to overflow, the government said. No injuries or deaths
were reported.
	   In Puerto Rico, where three deaths were blamed on Georges, a
near-total blackout persisted and 28,000 were in shelters.
	   Hundreds of workers labored to repair power lines, and the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers provided ice, water and tanker trucks.
Traffic stalled in many parts of San Juan, where no traffic lights
worked and debris removal continued. Cargo cranes were downed at
the city's port.
	   Long lines formed at ice plants and water tanker trucks, and
police broke up a fight at one San Juan ice plant.
	   The Puerto Rico government offered dlrs 400 to dlrs 600 to
families who lost property and homes.
	   In Haiti, the U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 for
disaster response, and the U.S. government donated water, food,
blankets, sheets and clothing. France sent a 60-member security
team to help with water purification and treat the injured.
	   Some places in Cite Soleil, a seaside slum in Port-au-Prince
that is home to 200,000, remained chin-deep in water. The number of
tin-and-cardboard shacks lost was unknown.
	   In St. Kitts, 85 percent of homes were damaged or destroyed,
schools and hospitals were damaged, and half the crucial sugar crop
was lost. Some 2,500 were homeless.

NBA cancels 24 exhibition games, delays start of camps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The good news on the National Basketball
Association lockout front is that the sides are back speaking to
one another. The bad news is that time is getting short.
	   Unfortunately for basketball fans, the bad news outweighed the
good Thursday as the league canceled 24 exhibition games and
postponed the start of training camps indefinitely.
	   The lockout went through its 86th day with only the faintest of
hopes for a timely resolution, and the likelihood grew that the
league will be forced to cancel regular season games because of a
work stoppage for the first time in its history.
	   ``Nobody wants to miss the whole season, but there are 29 owners
that are willing to do so if they have to,'' deputy commissioner
Russ Granik said.
	   The unprecedented cancellation of two dozen games came one day
after commissioner David Stern, Granik, union director Billy Hunter
and union president Patrick Ewing met for about an hour at the
union's offices _ the first sit-down between the sides since owners
stormed out of a bargaining session Aug. 6.
	   The sides discussed whether to resume formal talks, at which the
owners would be expected to present a new proposal. The regular
season remains scheduled to tip off Nov. 3.
	   ``I don't know if we got the ball rolling or not,'' Granik said.
``We tried to offer some suggestions, but I don't know if the
process will move forward. We're waiting to hear back from them on
whether there's any point to having another meeting.''
	   ``We're ready to meet tonight if we can to resume bargaining.''
	   But with owners looking for a definitive limit on salary costs,
including a phaseout of the so-called Larry Bird exception (which
allows teams to exceed the salary cap to sign their own free
agents) and the union holding to its position that it won't agree
to any kind of a ``hard'' salary cap, prospects for a speedy
resolution appeared grim.
	   Hunter was out of his office Thursday and could not be reached
for comment.
	   The league, which previously canceled an exhibition game set for
Oct. 12 in Israel between the Miami Heat and Maccabi Tel-Aviv,
canceled four more days worth of games _ including the three-time
defending champion Chicago Bulls' first exhibition game at the
United Center on Oct. 13 against the Atlanta Hawks.
	   Also canceled were neutral-site contests in Syracuse, New York,
Albany, New York, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Green Bay,
Wisconsin, Honolulu, Buffalo, New York, Huntsville, Alabama and
Baltimore.
	   ``Unfortunately, it is now clear there will not be enough time
for teams to fill their rosters and go through the necessary period
of conditioning and be ready to play preseason games by
mid-October,'' Granik said in a news release.
	   Training camps, which were due to open Oct. 6, have been
postponed indefinitely. Another batch of exhibition games could be
canceled next week if no progress is being made.
	   The league imposed the lockout July 1 after the sides failed to
come to terms on a new collective bargaining agreement. The owners
had the right to reopen the contract if the percentage of
basketball-related income devoted to player salaries exceeded 51.8
percent.

Mexican government says it will maintain its economic targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria
said Thursday the government maintains its forecast of a 12 percent
rise in consumer prices this year and is confident the peso's
volatility eventually will subside.
	   In an appearance before the Senate, Gurria said that although
the economy is expected to slow down in the second half of 1998, he
believes it is still on track to expand between 4.5 percent and 5
percent.
	   Mexico's gross domestic product rose 5.4 percent in the first
six months of the year.
	   Gurria said economic growth would slow due to the global
financial crisis and lower oil prices, which have led to a sharp
rise in domestic interest rates.
	   He didn't indicate at what level the peso should trade against
the U.S. dollar. The peso closed on 48-hour spot markets Thursday
at 10.12 to per dollar. It hit a record low of 10.605 on Sept. 11.

Nominees For Booker Prize Announced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Literary judges on Thursday announced the six
nominees for Britain's biggest literary prize for fiction,
including a London bus driver's first book.
	   The final selection for the 20,000 pound (dlrs 30,000) Booker
Prize will be awarded Oct. 27 at a dinner in London's Guildhall.
	   Bookmakers have made Ian McEwan novel ``Amsterdam,'' favorite to
win, just ahead of ``Master Georgie,'' by Beryl Bainbridge, who has
been nominated five times.
	   London bus driver Magnus Mills is nominated for his debut novel,
``The Restraint Of Beasts,'' which was written in his spare time
between shifts driving his bus routes around the city.
	   Also on the list are Julian Barnes' ``England, England,'' Martin
Booth's ``The Industry Of Souls,'' and Patrick McCabe's ``Breakfast
On Pluto.''
	   Publishers entered 125 titles for consideration for the prize,
which was established in 1968. It is awarded each year for the best
novel written in English in Britain or Commonwealth nations and
published for the first time in Britain by a British publisher.
	   Lord Hurd, the former foreign secretary who is chairman of the
five-member panel of judges, said there was no obvious front
runner.

Marseille jumps to second place with 2-0 win at Bastia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup winner Robert Pires scored one goal and
made another Thursday as Marseille won 2-0 at Bastia to move into
second place in the French championship.
	   Marseille has 15 points, one point behind leader Bordeaux, which
plays host to improving Rennes on Friday.
	   Pires scored mid-way through the first half, picking up a
diagonal pass from Patrick Blondeau before firing in a ten-meter
(yard) shot from a tight angle.
	   Bastia goalkeeper Eric Durand made fine point-blank saves from
Florian Maurice and Abanbacar Camera in the second half.
	   But in the 66th minute Pires broke again down the right and set
up Camera to tap in from close range.
	   In Thursday's other match, Toulouse drew 0-0 with Auxerre.

Netanyahu says Palestinian statehood will sabotage peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With the Palestinians determined to seek
international support for statehood, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu warned Thursday that a unilateral declaration of
independence will sabotage the peace process.
	   Addressing the U.N. General Assembly four days before Yasser
Arafat makes a rare appearance at the world body, Netanyahu said a
statehood announcement would lead to unspecified Israeli responses
and insisted the only path to peace is through negotiations.
	   ``I strongly urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this
course,'' Netanyahu said. ``Such actions will inevitably prompt
unilateral responses on our part. And this development will not be
good for the Palestinians, not good for Israel, not good for
peace.''
	   Palestinian negotiators said Arafat is determined to use his
U.N. appearance to win global backing for independence in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip when the five-year period of Palestinian
autonomy expires in May.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue could affect
efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal in New York
this week on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was more upbeat,
telling reporters that in upcoming meetings with Netanyahu and
Arafat she will try ``to lock in'' an agreement.
	   ``We have felt that there has been systematic progress,'' she
said. ``There is a good basis for the discussions that we are going
to have here.''
	   Netanyahu told the General Assembly the only way for Israel and
the Palestinians to live in peace is to complete the current talks
on a further Israeli withdrawal and then negotiate a final
settlement.
	   ``We must continue to negotiate earnestly, continuously,
tirelessly until the final peace agreement is reached. No other way
will do,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``Only agreements honored by both sides can be successful,'' he
warned.
	   But the Palestinians appear determined to move toward statehood,
and the General Assembly has traditionally been sympathetic to the
Palestinian cause.
	   On Wednesday, Netanyahu complained about a recent comment by
Arafat that unless he could gain statehood in negotiations with
Israel he would simply declare it himself.
	   The Israeli leader said the interim Oslo agreements between
Israel and the Palestinians specifically rule out such unilateral
declarations, reserving statehood as an issue to be settled between
the two sides.
	   Albright echoed this view Thursday, telling reporters: ``We do
not agree with unilateral acts as far as issues that are final
permanent status issues.''
	   In his General Assembly speech, Netanyahu said failure by the
Israelis and Palestinians to meet deadlines in the Oslo accords
does not kill the accords themselves.
	   ``An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state in
disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo would constitute a
fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It would cause the
complete collapse of the (peace) process,'' he said.
	   Under the autonomy agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides are to conclude talks on a permanent
peace agreement by May 4, 1999.
	   Netanyahu said a durable peace must strike a balance between
Palestinian self-rule and Israel's security _ which means an end to
terrorism and hostile propaganda.
	   ``I repeat: This balance can only be achieved, not by unilateral
declarations but by negotiations and negotiations alone,'' he said.
	   A permanent peace must be based on the principle that ``the
Palestinians should have all the powers to govern their lives and
none of the powers to threaten our lives,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``We have the right to ensure that the Palestinian entity does
not become the base for hostile forces,'' he said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Thursday on Wall Street as
traders sold shares to cash in on the powerful gains Wednesday that
followed Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's strong hint of
an interest-rate cut.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average _ up 257.21 points, or 3.3
percent, on Wednesday _ closed with a loss of 152.42, or 1.9
percent, at 8,001.99. Trading was heavy but below Wednesday's
frenzied pace.
	   With the drop, the Dow was 14.3 percent below its July 17 record
of 9,337.97, but 1.2 percent above where it began the year.
	   Wednesday's rally was the fifth-largest point gain ever for the
Dow and also sent broader indicators rising sharply. On Thursday,
broader indicators fell on profit-taking and worries about upcoming
corporate earnings reports.

Nigeria urges lifting of sanctions, cites human rights progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Citing progress on human rights and
democracy, Nigeria's leader urged the international community to
lift economic sanctions to support the ``silent but peaceful
revolution,'' that is taking place in his country.
	   ``I stand before this august body as the leader of a country
which is now fully engaged in a genuine and irreversible process of
transition to democracy,'' Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar told world
leaders at the General Assembly.
	   He repeated his pledge to return Nigeria to a democratically
elected government on May 29 and noted that a new electoral
commission was inaugurated last month.
	   Abubakar came to power in early June following the sudden death
of Gen. Sani Abacha, who annulled presidential elections in 1993.
Abacha's five years in power were marked by rampant human rights
abuses.
	   Abubakar has released political prisoners and has been working
to improve relations with the rest of the world.
	   Because Nigeria has honored a pledge to restore fundamental
human rights and freedoms, ``we now call on the western countries
to lift the sanctions which some of them have imposed on our
country,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said earlier this week that he
was confident that all the sanctions against Nigeria _ including
those imposed by the European Union _ would be lifted soon, with
the exception of the arms embargo.
	   Nigeria needs the world's support to improve the lives of its
people, Abubakar said.
	   ``A silent but peaceful revolution is taking place in Nigeria,''
Abubakar said. ``This is the time, therefore, for the international
community to give the necessary encouragement and support for our
endeavors.''
	   Nigeria has been ruled by military governments for all but 10
years since gaining independence from Britain in 1960.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Former heavyweight Tim Witherspoon has
arrived in Warsaw to complete preparations for his fight with
Andrew Golota on Oct. 2.
	   ``I didn't come to Poland for money or for entertainment. I came
to win,'' said Witherspoon.
	   He said he was not afraid of Golota and was not intimidated
because he will be fighting in his opponent's home country.
	   The Golota-Witherspoon bout, billed as the first professional
heavyweight fight in Poland, is to show that the country can stage
world-class boxing. But the tickets will also have world-class
prices, as high as dlrs 300, which is more than many Poles earn in
a month.

Trainer expects to fighter to end Croatia's near-misses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTVILLE, Connecticut (AP) _ Zeljko Mavrovic's trainer sees the
Croatian heavyweight's fight against Lennox Lewis as being as easy
as 3-2-1.
	   ``Croatia was third in World Cup football,'' said Darkie Smith
of Britain. ``(Goran) Ivanisevic was second at Wimbledon. I think
Zeljko Mavrovic will be first Saturday night.''
	   ``He's a man with an entire country behind him,'' said Lewis,
who will defend the WBC title in a 5,000-seat tent at the Mohegan
Sun Casino. ``He's coming in very determined, very focused.''
	   The unbeaten Mavrovic knows his country is behind him. He also
knows that ``in the ring I'm alone.'' No fighter from Eastern
Europe has ever been heavyweight champion.
	   Despite his 27-0 record, with 22 knockouts, the 29-year-old
Mavrovic is a decided underdog against the power-punching Lewis, of
Britain.
	   Mavrovic, the European champion and WBC No. 1 contender, is
relatively unknown in this country, where he has fought only three
times, the last time being in Las Vegas in 1995. Most of his
matches have been in Germany.
	   ``I know a lot of people don't respect European champions, but
I've had that title for three years and in the next 48 hours I'll
be world champion,'' Mavrovic said Thursday.
	   The 33-year-old Lewis has fought often in the United States,,
but the site of the fight says a lot about his popularity with
boxing fans and his recognition level with the general public in
this country. Most Americans consider Evander Holyfield to be the
heavyweight champion. Holyfield holds the WBA-IBF titles.
	   What Lewis really needs is an opponent of Holyfield's stature.
	   ``Everybody keeps asking me about Evander Holyfield,'' Lewis
said. ``I can't think about Evander Holyfield. I have to think
about Zeljko Mavrovic first. To get to Evander Holyfield, I have to
get through Zeljko Mavrovic first.''
	   Lewis, who has 27 knockouts on his 33-1 record, will try to get
past the challenger inside the scheduled 12 rounds. Despite an
impressive number of knockouts, Mavrovic is expected to try outbox
the champion and win a decision.
	   ``He's not a one-punch knockout artist, I am,'' Lewis said.
``His chin hasn't been tested. You can't expect to go a whole fight
with me without being hit on the chin.''
	   ``I wasn't on the floor ever in my life,'' Mavrovic countered,
``and I don't expect to be there in this fight.''

Thousands grieve hurricane victims in Dominican Republic

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominicans crammed
churches on their patron saint's day Thursday to grieve for the
scores of dead and hundreds missing from Hurricane Georges' rampage
through their country.
	   Across the Caribbean, Georges' death toll climbed past 110, and
damages reached into billions of dollars. The hurricane struck
southern Cuba on Wednesday, crossed it and threatened the Florida
Keys, where 100,000 people were ordered to flee its path.
	   ``On this day of (the Virgin) Mercedes, all the victims of
Hurricane Georges are present and we pray for the injured,'' the
Rev. Jose Arellano Guerrero said at the musty, stone Mercedes
Church in Santo Domingo's colonial city. He proceeded to read the
names of the dead from tiny scraps of paper.
	   At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) Thursday, Georges was centered near
Cayo Coco on Cuba's north coast and was moving west-northwest at 12
mph (19 kph). Its winds were near 80 mph (130 kph).
	   In Cuba, the government announced two storm-related deaths and
damage to coffee, cacao and banana crops, the Mexican news agency
Notimex said. Nearly 20,000 homes were flooded in Holguin province.
	   Bad news kept coming throughout the Caribbean: 27 dead in Haiti,
dlrs 2 billion in damage and hundreds of homes lost in Puerto Rico,
three dead and two missing in St. Kitts. Everywhere, victims
struggled to find water, food, ice and other bare essentials to
cope with loss and the tropical heat.
	   Dominican President Leonel Fernandez stunned the nation when he
said at least 70 Dominicans had died and hundreds were missing when
Georges' 110-mph (175-kph) winds swept through this impoverished
Caribbean nation Tuesday.
	   Rescuers searched for more victims, including 45 people missing
when floods swept away a shelter in San Cristobal. Army helicopters
and a U.S. Coast Guard C-130 airplane and helicopter combed the
Dominican countryside to assess the magnitude of the disaster.
	   More than 100,000 people lost homes, President Fernandez said.
Telephone lines were down throughout the country, and hundreds of
people were isolated from help by flooding. Airports in La Romana
and Puerto Plata were severely damaged.
	   More than 1,000 people prayed beneath the vaulted ceilings of
the Mercedes Church, some kneeling on the floor, their lips moving
as they prayed to a life-size Virgin Mary in white and gold gown.
They included Carmela Hernandez, 80, who lost three fingers when
the storm blew a door shut onto her right hand.
	   Hernandez, wearing a bloodied bandage, said the Mass ``gives me
peace.'' Then suddenly, she doubled over in pain and had to leave.
	   Arellano said this year's traditional street procession honoring
the virgin was canceled because downed power lines and trees made
it too dangerous.
	   People wandered through Santo Domingo, a city of 3 million, with
empty plastic jugs searching for water to drink. Many filled them
with filthy brown river water.
	   ``I know it's bad, but there's nothing else,'' said Altagracia
Duran, 40, who had searched all morning for water.
	   The Red Cross mobilized to deliver aid, and army soldiers
patrolled the capital with rifles to deter looting that surged
during the storm. Tourists at one hotel went on a city tour by bus,
to sightsee and to catch a glimpse of the damage.

Three countries demand resumption of Angolan peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The three countries overseeing Angola's
peace process demanded Thursday that the government and the former
rebel group UNITA resume peace efforts stipulated under a 1994
accord.
	   ``There can be no military solution to the conflict,'' and the
government of Angola and UNITA must seek a political settlement,''
according to a communique issued by the United States, Portugal and
Russia, after a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly.
	   The communique was sent to both parties in Angola.
	   Angola's peace process has crumbled with a recent resurgence in
fighting. Tensions mounted after the government severed contact
with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi for his failure to honor the
accord. Savimbi and UNITA representatives joined the government
under a special agreement in April 1997.
	   UNITA fought a civil war against the government for nearly two
decades after Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1994
accord ended the fighting, but the United Nations says UNITA has
resisted implementing it, particularly by refusing to hand over
four key territories and demobilize its troops.
	   In their statement, the three countries also demanded that UNITA
``comply immediately and without conditions with its obligations''
under the accord ``and cease all military activity.''
	   Earlier, this month, the Security Council decided to keep U.N.
military observers in Angola for another month and urged Angolan
authorities to reconsider suspending UNITA's participation in the
government.
	   The three countries said they appeal to the council ``to
continue its engagement in the peace process in Angola and to
maintain an appropriate presence of the U.N. observer mission in
Angola in support of the peace process.''

Nigeria urges lifting of sanctions, cites human rights progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albright, Annan reactions &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Citing progress on human rights and
democracy, Nigeria's leader on Thursday urged the international
community to lift economic sanctions to support the ``silent but
peaceful revolution,'' that is taking place in his country.
	   ``I stand before this august body as the leader of a country
which is now fully engaged in a genuine and irreversible process of
transition to democracy,'' Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar told world
leaders at the General Assembly.
	   He repeated his pledge to return Nigeria to a democratically
elected government on May 29 and noted that a new electoral
commission was inaugurated last month.
	   Abubakar came to power in early June following the sudden death
of Gen. Sani Abacha, who annulled presidential elections in 1993.
Abacha's five years in power were marked by rampant human rights
abuses.
	   Abubakar has released political prisoners and has been working
to improve relations with the rest of the world.
	   Because Nigeria has honored a pledge to restore fundamental
human rights and freedoms, ``we now call on the western countries
to lift the sanctions which some of them have imposed on our
country,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said earlier this week that he
was confident that all the sanctions against Nigeria _ including
those imposed by the European Union _ would be lifted soon, with
the exception of the arms embargo.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright met with Abubakar on
Thursday morning and praised Nigeria's ``remarkable progress'' in
restoring its international standing. However, when asked by
reporters whether it was time to lift sanctions, Albright said
Washington would ``see how the process moves forward.''
	   Nigeria needs the world's support to improve the lives of its
people, Abubakar said.
	   ``A silent but peaceful revolution is taking place in Nigeria,''
Abubakar said. ``This is the time, therefore, for the international
community to give the necessary encouragement and support for our
endeavors.''
	   Abubakar spoke to the world body after the Security Council held
a special ministerial-level meeting on Africa.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the meeting by praising
Nigeria and saying he hoped Abubakar will ``continue on the path to
good governance and the rule of law.''
	   Nigeria has been ruled by military governments for all but 10
years since gaining independence from Britain in 1960.

Delray Beach, Florida lands Davis Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DELRAY BEACH, Florida (AP) _ The Delray Beach Tennis Center has
outbid New Orleans and Fort Worth to host the Davis Cup finals, the
loudest and most emotional event in professional tennis.
	   The center was named as host of the three-day finals that begin
Dec. 4. But first, the United States must defeat Italy while Sweden
must get past Spain in this weekend's semifinals.
	   ``I think you can say this is the Super Bowl of tennis,'' said
Pam Gerig, executive director of the Palm Beach County Sports
Commission, which helped Delray Beach win the bidding war.
	   The United States Tennis Association predicts the final will
bring in dlrs 13 million to dlrs 15 million for the county, Gerig
said. Palm Beach County has agreed to pick up half the dlrs 200,000
cost of hosting the event. Officials are looking for sponsors to
pick up the rest.
	   Tickets will cost from dlrs 90 to dlrs 450 for three-day passes
and will not go on sale until about a week after the semifinals'
results are known.

Manchester United score 2-0 win over Liverpool
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Paul Scholes rocketed-in a late goal
for Manchester United on Thursday to seal a 2-0 win over Liverpool
and erase a humiliating loss to Arsenal three days earlier.
	   United took a 1-0 lead in the 19th minute through a Denis Irwin
penalty and maintained the slim advantage for an hour before
Scholes' left-footed drive scorched into the net in the 79th minute
for the clincher.
	   Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke combined in the lead-up, with Cole
crossing from the right after strong run and Yorke tapping the ball
on for Scholes to strike from 15 meters.
	   The Old Trafford win came after Monday's surprise 3-0 defeat to
defending titlist Arsenal at Highbury.
	   Liverpool surrendered the chance to go into No. 1 spot in the
Premier League standings after missing a series of goalscoring
opportunities and having a goal disallowed for off-side at a
crucial stage in the second half.
	   A litiny of errors by Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Friedel and a
handball by Jason McAteer handed Manchester United the first goal
of the match.
	   Irish international Denis Irwin had no trouble with the
resulting penalty from the spot to score his first league goal of
the season and give United a halftime lead.
	   Friedel's first mistake was conceding a corner-kick after
fumbling a regulation save on the right post after an ill-directed
strike from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
	   Manchester United's England midfielder David Beckham took the
corner kick, lobbing the ball into the penalty area where Friedel
made the fundamental error of trying to fist the ball away instead
of taking a clean catch.
	   The ball rebounded and McAteer hand-balled in the ensuing
scramble for possession in the goal mouth, giving Manchester United
a spot kick.
	   Irwin made the penalty look easy, feigning left to force Friedel
onto the wrong foot before driving the ball into the opposite
corner of the net.
	   The U.S. World Cup goalkeeper had two other close calls in the
first half , while at the other end, Manchester United's Danish
international Peter Schmeichel made light work of two critical
saves.
	   Manchester United finished strongly but missed two chances to
extend its lead.

Albright sees progress in Mideast peacemaking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Home again, and registering optimism, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared Thursday ``we keep
making progress'' in helping Israel and the Palestinians reach a
West Bank accord.
	   Speaking outside the U.N. Security Council chamber where she sat
for four years as the U.S. representative, Albright hailed steps
taken by India and Pakistan to put the nuclear genie back in the
bottle. And she cast developments in the Balkans in the same
favorable light.
	   ``There are small steps in all these areas that lead in the
right direction,'' Albright said. Applying traditional diplomatic
caution, though, she reminded reporters that there was a lot of
work to done across the board.
	   ``We are constantly working at them,'' Albright told reporters.
``And as I have been asked many times before, I am an eternal
optimist, which is what you need to be to keep pushing this process
forward.''
	   India's pledge Thursday to sign the nuclear test ban treaty if
negotiations are concluded successfully followed by a day a pledge
by Pakistan to sign next year.
	   Carefully, Albright described the twin steps as ``some
progress,'' as she hailed the two old antagonists' decision to try
to resolve their dispute over the contested territory of Kashmir as
well as promises to curb exports of dangerous technology.
	   ``Obviously, much remains to be done,'' Albright said. Still
undone, she said, are finding a formula for a ban on production of
nuclear weapons ingredients as well as evidence the two countries,
which have tested nuclear weapons, intend to avoid a nuclear arms
race.
	   But her mood was upbeat, overall, and that included the Balkans
and the Middle East.
	   On Wednesday, the United States and all other members of the
Security Council except China joined to approve a resolution
warning Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop Serbian
attacks on civilians in the province of Kosovo.
	   At the same time, Albright is seeking a breakthrough in the
Middle East.
	   This weekend, she plans to talk to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and, for a second time, to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu about stumbling blocks still in the path of a West Bank
accord.
	   ``There has been some dramatic progress,'' she said. But
avoiding a prediction of success, Albright said: ``I don't know
what that will lead to. Stay tuned.''
	   The twin U.S. aims are a further Israeli pullback from the
territory that is gradually coming under Arafat's control and
stiffer measures by the Palestinians against terrorists.
	   On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin,
virtually ruled out as ``a bridge too far'' an agreement by the end
of the week.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, drew Albright's support Thursday in his
uphill effort to deter Arafat from proclaiming his intention to
establish a Palestinian state whatever the outcome of negotiations
with Israel.
	   The General Assembly is usually receptive to Arafat and often
critical of Israel.
	   In July, for instance, the assembly approved a resolution, over
U.S. and Israeli opposition, designed to upgrade the rights and
privileges of the Palestinian observer mission to the United
Nations to include those conferred on states. The right to vote was
not included.
	   In a report this week, the American Jewish Committee said the
world body had been enlisted by the Arabs for decades ``to serve as
an agent for one-sided criticism of the policies of the government
of Israel.''
	   ``The relentless focus on Israel has been unparalleled in its
size, scope, persistence and intensity,'' the Jewish group said.
	   Albright said she did not know exactly what Arafat would say to
the assembly next week. But, she said, ``we do not agree with
unilateral acts as far as issues that are final status issues.''
	   Albright referred to agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians that statehood, the future of Jerusalem, refugees,
borders and other tough topics would be reserved for discussion on
a final settlement.

Jacobs tries to complete `frustrating' season with victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a season in which she ran four of the best
races of her career, it would seem difficult for Regina Jacobs to
call this a ``frustrating'' year.
	   But that's exactly the way she feels.
	   That's because Jacobs missed an important part of the lucrative
European season with a respiratory ailment. The illness affected
Jacobs for eight weeks, and kept her out of big invitational meets
at Berlin and Brussels, plus the Grand Prix Final at Moscow.
	   She did return for the World Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa,
and helped the U.S. team win the team title for the first time,
placing second in the 5,000 meters and third in the 3,000.
	   ``The team needed my points,'' Jacobs said.
	   They were important because the Americans won by only two
points.
	   On Saturday, the 35-year-old Jacobs, who has been improving with
age, will try to complete her season with a victory in the Fifth
Avenue Mile, a race she won in 1994.
	   ``Finishing the season well is very important,'' Jacobs said.
``I'm in good shape now.''
	   That was not the case earlier in the summer, when Jacobs took
ill on the flight from the United States to Europe. Although
ailing, Jacobs remained in Europe, because she had rented an
apartment in Rotterdam for two months.
	   ``Being in Europe for eight weeks with no races is boring,'' she
said Thursday. ``It was frustrating.''
	   Before being sidelined, Jacobs ran three brilliant races in
July.
	   On July 4, she smashed the American record for 5,000 meters,
clocking 14 minutes, 52.49 seconds, at Brunswick, Maine. Then, she
won the silver medal at the Goodwill Games at Uniondale, N.Y.,
running a career-best 4:20.93, making her the second-fastest U.S.
women's miler behind Mary Slaney. And a few days later, at the U.S.
Open in Edwardsville, Ill., Jacobs won the 3,000 in 8:39.56,
another career-best.
	   In addition, she matched her career-best in the 800 with a
1:59.36 at Palo Alto, Calif., in May, making her four best
performances of the year in the United States. She first ran that
800 time in 1987.
	   Jacobs' accomplishments _ not only this season but also in
recent years _ have made her the best U.S. middle distance runner
of the 1990s.
	   She is the only American, male or female, to win a World
Championship medal at a distance more than 800 meters in this
decade, taking the 1,500 silver medal at the 1997 World
Championships in a race she might have won if one competitor didn't
shove her and another grab her singlet from behind and pull her
back on the final lap.
	   ``For me, it was personal,'' Jacobs said, ``but I felt it cost
Americans a gold. When I'm at the Olympics, the World Championships
or the World Cup, I'm competing for my country.
	   ``We were once dominating in the middle distances. Not any more.
We're trying to rebuild our programs, so winning a gold was
important.''
	   Jacobs' other outstanding performances over the years include
winning the 1,500 at the World Indoor Championships in 1995, after
being plagued for years by a mineral deficiency that sapped her
strength; competing on three Olympic teams, including a 10th-place
finish in the 1,500 at Atlanta; winning eight national titles,
including the 5,000 this year by a whopping seven seconds, and
being ranked second in the world in the 1,500 last year, the
highest ranking by a U.S. athlete this decade at 1,500 or above.
	   Her major opposition Saturday is expected from 1995 Fifth Avenue
Mile champion Sinead Delahunty of Ireland and Kelly Holmes of
Britain, the 1,500 runner-up at this year's Commonwealth Games.
	   Spain's Isaac Viciosa, the three-time defending champions, tops
the men's field. Others entered include Morocco's Khalid Boulami,
Kenya's David Lelei, Italy's Gennaro DiNapoli and Americans Jason
Pyrah and Jamey Harris.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges left hundreds of
Puerto Ricans homeless, their possessions swept away by raging
waters or wind. For the vast majority, the hurricane's legacy is a
long muggy period of inconvenience and indignity.
	   With the exception of a few buildings with generators, almost
all 3.8 million people in this U.S. territory remained without
electricity Thursday _ meaning, among many other things, no cash
from teller machines, or air conditioning to fight the
post-hurricane heat.
	   The state electric company said power outages could last months.
Other officials said much of the power will be back by the weekend
_ setting off a national guessing game about which areas would be
the privileged first.
	   About three quarters of Puerto Rico remained without water, too.
People made do without showers, toilets backed up. Officials set up
70 water centers, and long, sometimes unruly lines formed. By
Wednesday, taps were even running dry in hotels with cisterns.
	   ``I feel miserable,'' said Ivelisse Marques, a 48-year-old
mother of three in the San Juan suburb of Bayamon.
	   ``You get used to air conditioning. Without air conditioning or
fans, it's intolerable. You have the kids saying, `I'm bored, when
are you going to cook, there's no TV, buy a generator!'''
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello was meeting Thursday with U.S. Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Small Business Administration chief Aida
Alvarez to review damage, estimated at at least dlrs 2 billion.
	   At least 55 percent of the coffee crop and 90 percent of banana
crop was lost when Georges struck Monday, said agriculture chief
Miguel Munoz.
	   Highways sustained dlrs 20 million in damage. Access to the
northern city of Arecibo as temporarily cut off because of
flooding. In San Juan, roads were jammed as drivers negotiated
fallen trees and power poles and blue-uniformed police directed
traffic.
	   On Thursday some postal service resumed.
	   Helping everyone keep a sense of proportion was the knowledge
that at least three people had died and 28,500 people were living
in 361 shelters _ many of them in public schools.
	   In the nearby U.S. Virgin Islands, there was relief that Georges
had caused relatively minor damage _ especially compared to
Hurricanes Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995.
	   Most of the damage on St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John was to
landscape: downed trees, power lines, telephone lines and
stoplights.
	   At least 55 boats were damaged, compared to 100 during Hurricane
Marilyn. Local ports remain closed as workers assessed damages.
Most of the 800 people who reported to shelters before the storm
had returned home by Thursday.

Courier out with arm ailment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Jim Courier's flimsy biceps muscle has further
weakened the U.S. Davis Cup tennis team.
	   An already lean American group became younger and even less
experienced Thursday when coach Tom Gullikson withheld his ailing
star from the draw for this weekend's semifinal with the Italians.
	   ``Obviously, Jim is a great Davis Cup player and a great
supporter of the Davis Cup and I am just pleased that he is on the
team,'' Gullikson said. ``Clearly, he hasn't had much match
competition in quite a while. So, it was just basically that issue
of match toughness.''
	   Courier has been a part of 13 winning Davis Cup teams and no
losing ones. He could still substitute in either singles or
doubles.
	   ``I'm ready if they need me, but hopefully they'll make it
through,'' he said.
	   Courier will be replaced by Jan-Michael Gambill, who will make
his Davis Cup debut Friday against Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi.
	   Gambill, who has risen from No. 227 to 50th in the world
rankings, reached the third round of the U.S. Open this month,
losing to French Open champion Carlos Moya in a fifth-set
tiebreaker.
	   Although Gambill will be making his debut against Italy's top
singles player, Gullikson said going with him over Courier was a
no-brainer.
	   ``Certainly, Jan-Michael has had a great year, moving up into
the top 50 with some very big wins over Andre Agassi and other top
players,'' Gullikson said. ``And he played very well at the U.S.
Open, and current form is always a consideration. And certainly
hard courts is Jan-Michael's best surface. So, we certainly all
feel good about Jan-Michael playing.''
	   Todd Martin, who becomes the veteran leader, plays Davide
Sanguinetti in the other singles match Friday. They swap opponents
Sunday after Martin and Davis Cup rookie Justin Gimelstob play
against Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso in Saturday's doubles match at
the Milwaukee Center Arena.
	   Courier had hoped to be in the draw but admitted he was rusty.
	   He last played in Cincinnati in August, losing to Tommy Haas in
straight sets in the first round. He skipped the next tournament in
New Haven and withdrew from the U.S. Open, with an injury
officially listed as a ``dead arm.''
	   ``That's the best description I can give you, because I've done
all the medical tests and they don't see anything wrong with my
arm,'' Courier said. ``And it's in the biceps. It's not
nerve-related, it's not vessels, it's not the bones. It's just
muscle fatigue. It just basically shuts down, basically the whole
arm when it gets really bad.''
	   Just because Courier won't be on the court doesn't mean he won't
be doing his duties, Gullikson said.
	   ``Well, Jim is a great leader. He sets a good tone with his
worth ethic and his commitment and his commitment and he is a great
team guy,'' Gullikson said.
	   Courier, who estimated the American's chances of winning at
55-45, said he'll essentially serve as a second coach.
	   ``If these guys have any doubts or questions, they can come to
me. I've got a little bit of experience stored up,'' he said. ``If
they need a word of advice, I'll be there to give it to them.''
	   The winner plays the Sweden-Spain winner for the championship in
December.
	   Agassi is shunning the Davis Cup because he has a charity event
in Las Vegas on Saturday. He criticized the selection of Milwaukee
as host.

Brazil puts the brakes on dash to economic chaos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's pledge to adopt fiscal
austerity measures in an effort to break its headlong dash to
economic chaos has received high marks overseas, but is greeted
with skepticism at home.
	   On Wednesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said his
government planned to tackle the economy's main Achilles' heel _ a
budget deficit equal to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product _ and
hinted that taxes would be increased.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin praised Cardoso's speech,
saying it ``highlighted fiscal adjustment and reform as Brazil's
national economic priority.''
	   Enrique Iglesias, president of the Interamerican Development
Bank, said the speech was ``an excellent message to the
international financial community''.
	   But many businessmen fear that any increase in taxes would only
make matters worse.
	   ``The country already has the highest tax burden in the world,
responding for 32 percent of GDP,'' said Antonio Ermirio de Moraes,
owner of the Votorantim Group, Brazil's largest business
conglomerate. ``A tax increase would only help the underground
economy grow.''
	   Synesio Batista da Costa, president of the Brazilian Toy
Manufacturers' Association, is convinced taxes will be increased,
leading to a sharp drop in consumer sales, ``especially during the
Christmas season.''
	   The president's remarks, widely seen not only as an effort to
reassure international investors, but also to prepare Brazilians
for belt-tightening economic measures, also heightened fears of
recession and unemployment.
	   ``In the first quarter of 1999, there will either be recession
or economic stagnation,'' said economist Paulo Nogueira Batista of
the Getulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil's leading business
administration school. ``And as a result, unemployment will grow.''
	   Brazil's unemployment rate is around 8 percent, its highest
level since Cardoso took office in 1994.
	   And next year, ``the joblessness rate could hit double digit
figures _ the worst in all of Brazil's history,'' said Sergio
Mendonca of DIEESE, a labor union-funded socio-economic research
center.
	   Like other emerging markets, Brazil has been buffeted by the
turmoil in world financial markets with a loss of investor
confidence and a strong outflow of capital. The country's foreign
reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from the dlrs 70 billion
posted at the end of July.
	   To prevent a collapse of Brazil's currency, the real, and stem
capital flight, the government on Sept. 10 raised interest rates
from 29.75 percent to 49.75 percent.
	   Although slowed down, the outflow continues.
	   On Wednesday dlrs 531 million left the country, bringing the
total for the month to dlrs 16.79 billion.
	   Protecting the real with high interest rates is a double-edged
sword, economists point out.
	   On one hand they curtail capital flight, but on the other they
aggravate the deficit. According to press reports, government
securities account for nearly 85 percent of Brazil's public debt of
350 billion reals (dlrs 296 billion).

Fiat's Brazilian subsidiary to suspend production for two days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Citing a lack of demand, Fiat's
Brazilian subsidiary said Thursday it would suspend production for
two days next week.
	   Fiat, which produces an average of 1,800 units daily, will shut
down its manufacturing operations next Tuesday and Wednesday. The
company will begin closing certain production lines Friday.
	   ``We are trying to adjust our vehicle stock to the level of
demand,'' a company spokesman said. Fiat's sales were down by 22
percent so far this year and the company has around 30,000 units of
unsold inventory.
	   Volkswagen and Ford have also recently had to suspend production
due to dwindling demand.
	   Total Brazilian car sales fell 25 percent in the first eight
months of the year compared to the same period in 1997, due to
higher interest rates and a general economic slowdown.

Nigeria urges lifting of sanctions, cites human rights progress

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new graf 8 with details of sanctions; picks up 8th

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Citing progress on human rights and
democracy, Nigeria's leader on Thursday urged the international
community to lift economic sanctions to support the ``silent but
peaceful revolution,'' that is taking place in his country.
	   ``I stand before this august body as the leader of a country
which is now fully engaged in a genuine and irreversible process of
transition to democracy,'' Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar told world
leaders at the General Assembly.
	   He repeated his pledge to return Nigeria to a democratically
elected government on May 29 and noted that a new electoral
commission was inaugurated last month.
	   Abubakar came to power in early June following the sudden death
of Gen. Sani Abacha, who annulled presidential elections in 1993.
Abacha's five years in power were marked by rampant human rights
abuses.
	   Abubakar has released political prisoners and has been working
to improve relations with the rest of the world.
	   Because Nigeria has honored a pledge to restore fundamental
human rights and freedoms, ``we now call on the western countries
to lift the sanctions which some of them have imposed on our
country,'' he said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said earlier this week that he
was confident that all the sanctions against Nigeria _ including
those imposed by the European Union _ would be lifted soon, with
the exception of the arms embargo.
	   The 15-nation EU introduced some sanctions against Nigeria after
the military regime hanged nine dissidents in 1995. The measures
included a arms-sale ban, a sports boycott and blocking development
aid. No restrictions were placed on Nigeria's vital oil exports.

Court to question Zagallo on World Cup loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Losing the World Cup was bad
enough _ now Mario Zagallo will have to tell a court why.
	   A judge of Rio's 30th Civil Court has ordered Brazil's former
coach to explain what happened to star striker Ronaldo in the World
Cup final, when Brazil lost 3-0 to host France.
	   Ronaldo, the two-time player of the year, was mysteriously
scratched from the lineup shortly before the July 12 final, then
reinserted at the last minute. But he played poorly, and reports
later said he had gone into convulsions hours before the game.
	   In a post-game interview, Zagallo kept repeating, ``Ronaldo
shouldn't have played.'' But when reporters asked why, he got
furious and left without answering.
	   At the hearing, Zagallo will be asked ``the truth about Ronaldo,
before and during the final game,'' a court clerk said.
	   Also cited are Ricardo Teixeira, president of the Brazilian
Soccer Confederation; team doctor Lidio Toledo; team coordinator
Zico, and forward Bebeto.
	   No date has been set for the hearing. Zagallo and the others can
simply send their lawyers and don't have to show up, the clerk
said.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Despite warnings from Israel,
Palestinian officials said Thursday that Yasser Arafat reserves the
right to declare independence next May and will take his case
before the United Nations and in talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York
Thursday, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu said a
unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians would lead
to the ``complete collapse of the (peace) process,'' and warned
that Israel would counter such an act with unpleasant measures.
Netanyahu did not detail the measures, but has hinted in the past
that Israel could annex more West Bank land.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank in New York this week.
	   And there were signs that both sides were heeding the threats of
the other.
	   Palestinian officials acknowledged that they have begun
setting-up preparatory committees in advance of a statehood
announcement. And Israel's Channel 2 TV said the Israeli army had
sped-up training for several special units and was making
arrangements to secure some 21 Jewish settlements situated close to
Palestinian areas.
	   Months of mediating efforts have failed to bridge gaps between
the sides and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who met
with Netanyahu in New York Wednesday, said there was still much
work left to do.
	   Arafat will meet with Albright when he arrives in New York
Sunday. Thursday, his aides said Arafat had also accepted an
invitation for talks at the White House during a late night phone
conversation with Clinton.
	   Arafat and Clinton discussed on the phone ``in detail the peace
process and the U.S. efforts to revive this peace process,'' said
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Arafat asked Clinton to make every effort possible to ensure
that a U.S. initiative for the long overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from West Bank land would implemented. The Palestinians
accepted the plan but Israel wants tougher security guarantees.
	   Israel radio said Israel's top two negotiators, Danny Naveh and
Yitzhak Molcho, who are both traveling with Netanyahu, were to fly
to Washington later Thursday for meetings with U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross aimed at clinching a deal.
	   But with both sides sharpening their rhetoric over the statehood
issue, it appeared unlikely that a deal or a tri-lateral summit
could take place in the United States during the two-day overlap
when both Arafat and Netanyahu will be there.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, which met Thursday, released a
statement reiterating its desire to declare independence in the
West Bank and Gaza and make Jerusalem its capital. Palestinian
negotiators have said that Arafat is determined to use his rare
appearance before the world body to win international backing for
independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May when the
five-year period of Palestinian autonomy expires, according to a
peace deal signed in Oslo, Norway in 1993.
	   Netanyahu staunchly opposes Palestinian statehood, saying
another Arab nation on its borders would endanger Israel's
security. He told reporters that if Arafat declared statehood in
May of 1999, it would effectively cancel existing peace deals.
	   Erekat said that Netanyahu's comments would not impact Arafat's
speech which has already been written.
	   ``All of our efforts are in the hope that we can avoid any
unilateral steps ... but if the May deadline comes without
achieving an agreement this means we have no option other than to
declare Palestinian statehood.

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ A hand transplant by surgeons using advanced
medical technology is raising new hope for victims of accidents,
land mines and birth defects, doctors said Thursday.
	   A team led by French and Australian doctors grafted a donor's
hand on an Australian businessman's arm Wednesday in the first
known hand transplant in years. The coming weeks will determine if
his body will accept it.
	   In a painstaking 13-hour operation, the right hand and forearm
of the anonymous donor was attached to the arm of the 48-year-old
Australian man, whose own hand was amputated in 1989 after an
accident, Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon said in a statement.
	   ``It gives hope to all those who are victims of domestic or work
accidents, anti-personnel mines, or have congenital deformations,''
Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, a co-head of the transplant team, told
French TV.
	   In the operation, the team attached ``all the arteries, veins,
nerves, tendons, muscles and skin after setting the two bones of
the forearm,'' the hospital statement said.
	   The patient was identified as an Australian businessman, France
2 television reported, adding it would take 12 to 18 months of
therapy for him to regain full use of the hand.
	   The operation was the result of recent advances in microsurgery
and transplant techniques. Doctors now assess the chances of
long-term success at 50-50.
	   The French hospital beat a Louisville, Kentucky team that was
planning such a transplant before the end of the year.
	   In Louisville, the University of Louisville Medical Center
issued a statement Thursday expressing the best wishes of doctors
there for the success of the operation and the patient.
	   ``Throughout the process, we have stressed repeatedly the
imnportance of learning from each other. We hope Dr. Dubernard's
team will share with the medical community its findings so that all
may benefit from their experiences,'' the statement said.
	   While the Lyon hospital billed the transplant as a first, it had
been done before. Doctors in Ecuador tried in the 1960s, but the
patient's body rejected the hand after two weeks.
	   Dubernard said he had been dreaming of trying such an operation
since the early 1970s.
	   Such a transplant, however, faces serious risks. Patients must
take anti-rejection drugs that can be potentially fatal, as they
suppress the immune system to keep the body from trying to destroy
the foreign tissue. That could also raise the risk of infection,
cancer and even death.
	   Doctors hope this time, with new anti-rejection drugs, the
Australian patient's body would not reject the foreign hand.
	   Other key problems are nerve regeneration to allow sensation. A
transplant patient may never regain feeling of hot and cold in
their new hand.
	   The director of the UCLA Hand Center in Los Angeles, Neil Jones,
said last month he didn't think transplant research among animals
so far ``allows us to move into the realm of human application.''
	   Head of transplant surgery at the Lyon hospital, Dubernard
co-led the team with Earl Owen, director of the Center for
Microsurgery in Sydney, Australia.

Canada moves to end truck slowdown along U.S. border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The Canadian government said Thursday it will try
a two-pronged strategy to end harassment and tough inspections that
are deterring Canadian trucks from crossing into U.S. border states
in the Prairies.
	   Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said Canada has simultaneously
requested consultations under both the North American Free Trade
Agreement and the World Trade Organization to settle the dispute
over Canadian agricultural products.
	   ``We chose to go to the two forums because we want to underline
how important this unilateral, incorrect action is and to
demonstrate that we are prepared to avail ourselves of the
mechanism that we think is righting a wrong,'' he said.
	   Marchi's comments follow a meeting in Washington between Raymond
Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, and U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. Chretien indicated Canada would
take retaliatory action if the harassment isn't stopped.
	   Marchi said that under the provisions of NAFTA, both sides have
to meet within 15 days. It's 10 days under the WTO. If the
consultation process fails, the dispute could go to arbitration
under both NAFTA and the WTO.
	   American farmers, frustrated by low prices, have been blocking
Canadian truckers hauling wheat and hogs south for more than a
week. Cattle shipments have also been held up.
	   South Dakota is refusing to let Canadian hogs pass through the
state. North Dakota, Montana, Idaho and Minnesota have been forcing
Canadian truckers to fill out time-consuming forms about the safety
of their cargo.
	   The inspections, coupled with attempts to avoid blockades, are
forcing Canadian truckers to absorb thousands of dollars in
increased costs.
	   Marchi said he hopes the Canadian action will prompt the U.S.
government to pressure the governors of the states involved in the
dispute to back off.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Dieuseul Volma is waiting for a
miracle. A mother of six, she lost four of her children when a
flood unleashed by Hurricane Georges smashed up her home this week.
	   ``I don't even know where my children are,'' Volma, 38, said
matter-of-factly. She was among 300 people being sheltered in a
high school near the National Palace Thursday.
	   Rampaging waters unleashed by Hurricane Georges killed at least
27 people in Haiti this week. More are missing and feared dead, and
it's not known how many lost their lives in Volma's neighborhood of
Duvivier.
	   An hour before daybreak Wednesday, a flash flood from the nearby
Riviere Grise swept across a plain outside the capital. Usually a
trickle, the river crested at 30 feet (10 meters), shaking a
30-yard-long (30-meter-long) bridge by the foundations and closing
the main highway leading north from Port-au-Prince.
	   The flood swept away the collection of tiny, tin-roofed earth,
stone and wooden dwellings that the several thousand people who
lived in them called Duvivier. In the terrifying darkness, it
drowned chickens, goats and cows.
	   Fritzner Meme, 28, ran out of his splintering house wearing
nothing but his underwear, now his sole possession. Police pulled
Meme and other survivors out of the mud and drove them to Red Cross
headquarters in the capital. Then they were given shelter.
	   The survivors from Duvivier, whose ages range up to 70, are
grateful.
	   ``This is the first time we've gotten any help from our
government,'' said Luc Charles, 27. ``It's a great first step. But
will there be a second?''
	   Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, scraped
together a meager dlrs 130,000 to help hurricane victims. The U.N.
Development Fund contributed another dlrs 100,000, and the United
States donated and water, food, clothing, blankets and sheets.
France sent 60 officials with water purification material and a
mobile medical clinic.
	   ``We're doing our part to help. But we don't how long we can go
on doing it,'' said Jean-Claude Charles, a shelter supervisor.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback
resigned late Thursday, two days after a Nigerian woman facing
deportation died following a struggle with police.
	   Tobback, a Socialist, offered his resignation following crisis
talks within the center-left government. He said the police force
made errors in preparing the deportation of the woman.
	   Tobback had said he had been shocked by the events but had
warned he would not resign before an investigation into the death
was finished. He did not wait that long.
	   In Brussels, demonstrators demanded his resignation for the
third day in a row.

Iran disassociates itself from reward for killing Rushdie

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday his
government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for
killing British author Salman Rushdie, and was ready to exchange
ambassadors with Britain.
	   The Iranian ``government disassociates itself from any reward
which has been offered in this regard and does not support it,''
Kamal Kharrazi said after a meeting with his British counterpart,
Robin Cook.
	   A relieved Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' said from
Britain that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended.
	   ``This looks like it's over,'' Rushdie said. ``It means
everything.''
	   Cook, who met Kharrazi on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly session, said he was delighted with Iran's decision.
	   ``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive
relationship between the United Kingdom, and I believe the European
Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our
relations,'' Cook said following his meeting with Kharrazi.
	   ``Dr. Kharrazi and I have, accordingly, agreed that we should
upgrade the level of our diplomatic relations to ambassadorial
level,'' Cook told reporters.
	   Kharrazi's comments stopped short of lifting the death sentence
on Rushdie, but was an important step in improving ties strained
over the issue.
	   Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious edict
in 1989, saying Rushdie had committed blasphemy against Islam in
his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' and should be killed.
	   The semi-official Khordad Foundation has offered a dlrs 2.5
million reward for killing Rushdie.
	   Iranian officials say they are powerless to lift Khomeini's
fatwa, or religious edict. They say the fatwa could have been
lifted only by the late revolutionary leader himself.
	   Iran has been trying to change its foreign policy ever since
Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric, took over as president in
August 1997.
	   The death sentence against Rushdie, which had forced the
Indian-born British writer to live in hiding, has been the main
hurdle in better ties between Iran and the EU.
	   On Tuesday, Khatami told reporters that his government wanted to
put the Rushdie affair behind it.
	   But powerful hard-liners inside Iran's Islamic government have
always stood behind the death sentence. They are likely to continue
to do so. Because of Khomeini's cult-like following Iran, no
Iranian politician can be seen to condemn the fatwa.
	   Iran's chief prosecutor, Morteza Moqtadaie, marked the
anniversary of the fatwa last February by saying, ``The shedding of
this man's blood is obligatory.''

	   The government Thursday suspended the deportation of asylum
seekers from Brussels international airport until new measures were
approved.
	   Two policemen have been charged with assault in Tuesday's death
of Semira Adamu, a 20-year-old woman who resisted police efforts to
get her on a Togo-bound plane. Police subdued her by putting a
pillow on her face. She lapsed into a coma and died afterwards.
	   One of the two policemen who were charged with assault and
battery without the intent to kill, had been sanctioned by the
police force last year for kicking an asylum seeker during a
deportation operation, said police spokeswoman Els Cleemput.
	   Officials, who did not want to be named, said Tobback had been
angry upon learning that news, and it pushed him to offer his
resignation. The center-left government went into crisis talks late
Thursday before his resignation offer was announced.
	   The police officer in question had been put on non-active for
one month and was not allowed on deportation duty for seven months.
	   Since he was reintegrated in the service, he was always
supervised and videotaped during deportation operations, Cleemput
said. She pointed out he was not the man holding the pillow on
Adamu's face.
	   Cleemput said a pillow to subdue deportees was only used twice
last year. But this year resistance from deportees had increased
and the police had to use the practice a dozen times already. It
was the first serious incident involving a pillow.
	   On Thursday, the police union called on its members to refuse
cooperation in any forced expulsion of asylum seekers. Police at
Brussels international airport held a go-slow protest action,
delaying passport clearance.
	   Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her
family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has
three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her
refugee status.

Israel agrees to grant citizenship to Chicago family
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After months of haggling and red tape, the
Israeli government agreed Thursday to grant citizenship to an
African-American family that moved to Israel from Chicago after
converting to Judaism 10 years ago.
	   ``I came because of my belief in the Jewish way of life and my
hope was that it would give me and my family a certain
spirituality,'' said Sarah Yaisrael, who came with her husband,
Elazar, their four children and two grandchildren. ``I didn't
expect to have turmoil,'' she added.
	   Mr. Yaisrael was granted Israeli citizenship while on a visit to
Israel in 1996 but when the family immigrated in May, Mrs. Yaisrael
and the children were only granted 30-day tourist visas.
	   Under Israeli law, any Jew, or person with one Jewish
grandparents is entitled to citizenship, including those like the
Yaisraels who were converted through the Conservative stream of
Judaism.
	   But Israel's interior ministry, run by a powerful Orthodox
Jewish political party, held up the decision for months, meaning
the family was left without medical care, education benefits, or
work permits. Under the Shas party, the ministry has tried to halt
the growing number of non-Jews coming to Israel, either in search
of work, or those with Jewish parentage and has question the
legitimacy of those converted by Conservative or Reform rabbis.
	   Interior Ministry spokeswoman Tova Elinson said she was unable
to comment on the Yaisrael's case.
	   Ehud Bandel, the president of the Convervative movement in
Israel said he doubted the interior ministry decision demonstrated
a change of heart toward immigrants who converted to Judaism.
	   The movement has taken up the cases of dozens of converts like
the Yaisrael family who were not granted citizenship.
	   ``I would like to believe they have realized that this is not
the way to deal with this matter,'' Bandel said. ``But I cannot say
this.''
	   Mrs. Yaisrael said the ministry had sent a fax to the family
lawyer Thursday informing them of the decision, but she said she
wasn't going to celebrate until she had the documents in hand.
	   ``I can't say that it's like the land of milk and honey here,''
she said. But, ``I look for the best and hope that is what is
coming,'' she said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUTZTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Deborah Richard and Beth Daniel
shot 5-under-par 67s on Thursday to share the opening-round lead in
the LPGA First Union Betsy King Classic at Berkleigh Country Club.
	   Richard and Daniel each had six birdies and one bogey, including
2-under 33s on the front nine.
	   Thirty-nine players in the field of 140 golfers broke par.
	   Richard is seeking her first victory this season and sixth of
her career. She has missed 15 of the 31 tournaments this year
because of an injured left shoulder.
	   Daniel is seeking her first victory on the tour this season and
33rd of her career. She has missed six cuts, primarily due to an
ailing left shoulder.
	   Richard tied for fifth in the Safeco Classic at Kent, Washington
Sept. 10-13 and was fourth in the DuMaurier Classic, the last of
the season's four majors, in Canada in August.
	   Rookie sensation Se Ri Pak was a stroke back of the leaders,
joined at 4-under by Laura Davies, Cathy Johnston-Forbes and Nancy
Ramsbottom. Pak and two-time defending champion Annika Sorenstam
share the tour lead with four victories apiece. Davies had the best
front nine of the day, a 4-under 31.
	   Charlotta Sorenstam, Rachel Hetherington and Juli Inkster shot
69s.
	   Annika Sorenstam shot a 71. She entered the tournament as the
tour's leading money winner with dlrs 896,188, followed by Pak at
dlrs 805,700.
	   Mitzi Edge used a 9-iron for a hole-in-one on the 121-yard
(110-meter) 12th hole. She finished with a 72.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback
resigned late Thursday, two days after a Nigerian woman facing
deportation died following a struggle with police.
	   Tobback, a Socialist, offered his resignation following talks
within the center-left government. He said the police force made
errors in preparing the deportation of the woman.
	   Tobback had previously said he would not resign before an
investigation into the death was finished. He did not wait that
long.
	   In Brussels, demonstrators demanded his resignation for the
third day in a row.
	   The government Thursday suspended the deportation of asylum
seekers from Brussels international airport until new measures are
approved.
	   Two policemen have been charged with assault in Tuesday's death
of Semira Adamu, a 20-year-old woman who resisted police efforts to
get her on a Togo-bound plane. Police subdued her by putting a
pillow on her face. She lapsed into a coma and died afterwards.
	   One of the two policemen who were charged with assault and
battery without the intent to kill, had been sanctioned by the
police force last year for kicking an asylum seeker during a
deportation operation, said police spokeswoman Els Cleemput. The
police officer in question had been put on non-active for one month
and was not allowed on deportation duty for seven months.
	   Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tobback had

Tyson license may be in more jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The two top members of the Nevada Athletic
Commission said Thursday they will vote to reject Mike Tyson's
request to return to the ring unless he can explain his alleged
assault of two men following a traffic accident in Maryland last
month.
	   Claims by Tyson's lawyers that he is innocent of the charges
simply aren't good enough if Tyson wants his license back,
commission Chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem and Vice Chairman James Nave
said.
	   ``I would vote no if I have to vote today,'' Ghanem said.
	   Nave agreed, saying the position of Tyson's lawyers that he
couldn't discuss the matter because of pending charges gave him
little option in his vote.
	   ``It's not going to work for me,'' Nave said. ``How can we
license him without knowing about it?''
	   The Maryland issue had seemed to fade into the background at
Saturday's marathon hearing that ended when the commission ordered
Tyson to take a batter of psychological tests before returning Oct.
3 for a vote on whether to give him the license stripped when he
bit Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   Following the meeting, Ghanem said that if the psychological
reports came back OK ``then we have the responsibility to maybe,
probably, license him to fight again.''
	   Tyson agreed to the psychological tests and traveled to Boston
to undergo them Thursday at Massachusetts General Hospital. But
even as he was being examined by a team of three psychiatrists, his
licensing was again thrown into question.
	   Tyson's adviser, Shelly Finkel, said both he and Tyson's lawyers
had thought that the psychological testing was the only issue still
to be resolved.
	   ``It's pretty obvious to me that it's different than when we
left (the commission hearing),'' Finkel said. ``It's different than
what we were told.''
	   Nave, though, said the Maryland incident was still on the table,
and that commissioners thought that it went to the heart of Tyson's
problems with anger management.
	   During Saturday's hearing, Tyson's attorney, Dale Kinsella, told
commissioners that the former heavyweight champion would answer no
questions about the Maryland incident because charges were still
pending in the state.
	   Tyson is charged by two men with attacking them following a
minor traffic accident in the Washington, D.C., suburb of
Gaithersburg, Md. A preliminary hearing on the charges had been set
for Oct. 2, a day before the commission hearing, but that has been
scrapped and the case will head toward trial at a later date
instead.
	   ``I can't vote to move this thing forward without knowing more
about Maryland,'' Nave said. ``They can get a report from
Massachusetts saying he's OK, but we still have to know about
Maryland.''
	   Finkel said he would have to discuss the latest development with
Tyson's attorneys. He said Tyson should be judged innocent until
proven guilty.
	   ``I think what the commission is asking for is illegal,'' Finkel
said. ``It seems to me as if someone is playing a game.''
	   Nave said the commission can't license Tyson without knowing
whether he actually attacked the two men. Tyson's attorneys have
said he is innocent.
	   ``At some point they're going to have to realize that they have
to answer that situation,'' Nave said. ``This commission is not
going to be embarrassed and approve him to fight and find out a
month later he hit and kicked somebody.''
	   Nave said he felt Tyson's advisers did not adequately answer
many of the commission's concerns during Saturday's hearing and
that he would have voted against Tyson then if it had come to a
vote.
	   ``If the vote came to yes or no last Saturday, I would have
voted no,'' he said.

Arafat to meet Clinton, stick with statehood issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES graf 12 with Netanyahu to meet Clinton &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Despite warnings from Israel,
Palestinian officials said Thursday that Yasser Arafat reserves the
right to declare independence next May and will take his case
before the United Nations and in talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York
Thursday, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu said a
unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians would lead
to the ``complete collapse of the (peace) process,'' and warned
that Israel would counter such an act with unpleasant measures.
Netanyahu did not detail the measures, but has hinted in the past
that Israel could annex more West Bank land.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank in New York this week.
	   And there were signs that both sides were heeding the threats of
the other.
	   Palestinian officials acknowledged that they have begun
setting-up preparatory committees in advance of a statehood
announcement. And Israel's Channel 2 TV said the Israeli army had
sped-up training for several special units and was making
arrangements to secure some 21 Jewish settlements situated close to
Palestinian areas.
	   Months of mediating efforts have failed to bridge gaps between
the sides and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who met
with Netanyahu in New York Wednesday, said there was still much
work left to do.
	   Arafat will meet with Albright when he arrives in New York
Sunday. Thursday, his aides said Arafat had also accepted an
invitation for talks at the White House during a late night phone
conversation with Clinton.
	   Arafat and Clinton discussed on the phone ``in detail the peace
process and the U.S. efforts to revive this peace process,'' said
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Arafat asked Clinton to make every effort possible to ensure
that a U.S. initiative for the long overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from West Bank land would implemented. The Palestinians
accepted the plan but Israel wants tougher security guarantees.
	   Israel radio said Israel's top two negotiators, Danny Naveh and
Yitzhak Molcho, who are both traveling with Netanyahu, were to fly
to Washington later Thursday for meetings with U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross aimed at clinching a deal.
	   But with both sides sharpening their rhetoric over the statehood
issue, it appeared unlikely that a deal or a tri-lateral summit
could take place in the United States during the two-day overlap
when both Arafat and Netanyahu will be there.
	   In Washington, the White House announced that Netanyhau will
also meet with Clinton. The President will hold talks with
Netanyahu Monday and Arafat Tuesday.

Selectors make one change for Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand cricket selectors have
made one 1change to the team which won the bronze medal at the
Commonwealth Games when they named the side Friday for a
limited-overs tournament in Bangladesh.
	   Senior pace bowler Simon Doull, who missed the Games because of
injury, returns to replace Chris Drum, who sustained a minor injury
in Malaysia.
	   Doull has recovered from a groin strain but will nevertheless

Arafat to meet Clinton, stick with statehood issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES graf 12 with Netanyahu to meet Clinton &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Despite warnings from Israel,
Palestinian officials said Thursday that Yasser Arafat reserves the
right to declare independence next May and will take his case
before the United Nations and to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on
Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a
unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians would lead
to the ``complete collapse of the (peace) process,'' and warned
that Israel would move to counter such an act. Netanyahu did not
detail Israeli plans, but has hinted in the past that Israel could
annex more West Bank land.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue seems to be
scuttling efforts by the United States to wrap up an elusive deal
on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank this week.
	   There were signs that both sides were heeding the threats of the
other.
	   Palestinian officials acknowledged that they have begun setting
up preparatory committees in advance of a statehood announcement.
And Israel's Channel 2 TV said the Israeli army had accelerated
training for several special units and was making arrangements to
secure some 21 Jewish settlements situated close to Palestinian
areas.
	   Months of mediating efforts have failed to bridge gaps between
the sides and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who met
with Netanyahu in New York Wednesday, said there was still much
work left to do.
	   Arafat will meet with Albright when he arrives in New York on
Sunday. On Thursday, his aides said Arafat had also accepted an
invitation for talks at the White House during a late- night phone
conversation with Clinton.
	   Arafat and Clinton discussed ``in detail the peace process and
the U.S. efforts to revive this peace process,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Arafat asked Clinton to make every effort possible to ensure
that a U.S. initiative for the long-overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from West Bank land would be implemented. The
Palestinians accepted the plan but Israel wants tougher security
guarantees.
	   Israel radio said Israel's top two negotiators, Danny Naveh and
Yitzhak Molcho were to fly to Washington later Thursday for
meetings with U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross.
	   But with both sides sharpening their rhetoric, it appeared
unlikely that a deal or a trilateral summit could take place in the
United States during the two-day overlap when both Arafat and
Netanyahu will be there.
	   In Washington, the White House announced that Netanyhau will
also meet with Clinton. Clinton will hold talks with Netanyahu
Monday and Arafat Tuesday.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges left hundreds of
Puerto Ricans homeless, their possessions swept away by raging
waters or wind. For the vast majority, the hurricane's legacy is a
long muggy period of inconvenience and indignity.
	   With the exception of a few buildings with generators, almost
all 3.8 million people in this U.S. territory remained without
electricity Thursday _ meaning, among many other things, no cash
from teller machines, or air conditioning to fight the
post-hurricane heat.
	   The state electric company said power outages could last months.
Other officials said much of the power will be back by the weekend
_ setting off a national guessing game about which areas would be
the privileged first.
	   About three quarters of Puerto Rico remained without water, too.
People made do without showers, toilets backed up. Officials set up
70 water centers, and long, sometimes unruly lines formed. By
Wednesday, taps were even running dry in hotels with cisterns.
	   ``I feel miserable,'' said Ivelisse Marques, a 48-year-old
mother of three in the San Juan suburb of Bayamon.
	   ``You get used to air conditioning. Without air conditioning or
fans, it's intolerable. You have the kids saying, `I'm bored, when
are you going to cook, there's no TV, buy a generator!'''
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello was meeting Thursday with U.S. Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Small Business Administration chief Aida
Alvarez to review damage, estimated at at least dlrs 2 billion.
	   Cuomo announced up to dlrs 39 million in emergency grants to
repair damage to public housing. The U.S. administration also said
it was allowing Puerto Rico to use more than dlrs 300 million
previously awarded Puerto Rico for disaster relief and public
housing repairs, as well as other federal aid.

Sosa's homers provide bright spot amid Georges' devastation

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ It began as a rumor
that swept through the storm-ravaged streets of the capital. Anyone
with access to a working TV or radio tuned in to see if it was
true.
	   By Thursday, pretty much everyone had heard the news: U.S. Major
League Baseball star Sammy Sosa, the pride and joy of this
baseball-crazed Caribbean nation, had hit two home runs to tie Mark
McGwire. ``65,'' ran a front-page headline in Listin Diario
newspaper.
	   For a nation grieving its dozens of dead from Hurricane Georges,
Sosa's homers on Wednesday provided a needed bright spot.
	   ``This is tremendous,'' the Rev. Jose Arellano Guerrero said
after saying Mass to more than 1,000 people at Mercedes Church in
the colonial downtown. ``The nation has come to pray for the boy.
He helps us unite.''
	   Alfredo Liciano drove through town in a white Toyota, ``Sosa
64'' taped in large letters across the rear windshield.
	   ``I haven't had time to make it 65,'' he said. ``But I might
just go ahead and put 66, because he'll get there soon enough.''
	   With electricity out in almost all of the country and most TV
and radio stations off the air, it took time for people to learn of
Sosa's feat.
	   When the first reports came in by radio, listeners called in to
ask if it really was true. One said he didn't believe it, and
accused the government of inventing the story to cheer people up.
	   The defensive talk-show host explained that he couldn't really
confirm it either, although later in the show a colleague got on
the Internet and found that it was true.
	   On Tuesday night, the only TV station broadcasting ran a
half-hour homage to the Chicago Cubs star, showing him connecting
with pitch after pitch and receiving standing ovations.
	   Santo Domingo's Jaragua Hotel, still flooded and without
elevators or power to some rooms, slipped notes under every door
announcing the news. ``Sammy Sosa hit two more home runs
yesterday,'' it read. ``He is tied again for the record.''
	   Sosa's hometown, San Pedro de Macoris, was cut off from the
capital by phone and road, but a traveler who drove through on
Thursday said it suffered less damage than many surrounding areas.
Trees were toppled and some houses lost their roof, but the
traveler, Sandra Lopez, said the town's baseball fields _ including
those of Major League training camps _ were already drying out.
	   Sosa was quoted in local newspapers as dedicating his homers to
the Dominican people.
	   ``I am at the side of all Dominicans, of my people, of my nation
in these difficult moments,'' he told Listin Diario from Milwaukee.
``Hopefully these home runs ... will bring a little happiness.''

Cyprus could cause regional conflict, Yilmaz says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Greek minister's address, ADDS
background &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Greek Cypriot government's decision to
deploy new anti-aircraft missiles threatens to turn the standoff on
the divided island into a regional conflict, Turkey's prime
minister warned Thursday.
	   Actions ``by Greece and the Greek-Cypriots poses a serious
threat to the security of the Turkish republic on northern Cyprus
and on Turkey and to peace and stability in the eastern
Mediterranean,'' Mesut Yilmaz told the General Assembly.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974 in
the wake of a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkish Cypriots have set up a breakaway state _ recognized only
by Turkey _ which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   In his speech, Yilmaz renewed Turkey's call for the creation of
a confederation on the Mediterranean island.
	   ``I believe that the proposed confederation can finally open an
avenue for peace, reconciliation based on a common destiny for the
two peoples in Cyprus.'' Yilmaz said.
	   The internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government, with
the support of the five permanent members of the Security Council,
rejects any proposal that would entrench the island's division.
	   The Greek Cypriot government wants to deploy S-300 Russian
anti-aircraft missiles, prompting Turkish threats to respond by
force if necessary. Greece has warned that could lead to war
between the two NATO partners.
	   ``Forces of the Greek, Greek-Cypriot camp have heightened
tensions on the island. The clock is ticking for the deployment of
the S-300 missile system,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Greece's foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, in his address to
the assembly later Thursday, called this year's talks on Cyprus ``a
year of stagnation and frustration.''
	   Greece has said it will not soften its hard-line position unless
Turkey settles territorial disputes with Greece through the
International Court of Justice in The Hague.
	   ``The reaction from Ankara, obediently echoed by the
Turkish-Cypriot leader, has been one of harsh rejection,'' he said.
	   He said that rejection has been in the form of ``flat negation,
or by putting conditions, tantamount to canceling whatever has been
so far desired by the international community, prescribed by U.N.
resolutions and even accepted by the Turkish-Cypriot leadership
themselves.''
	   Yilmaz said European Union's decision to start negotiations with
the Greek Cypriot side on entering the EU also has made it more
difficult to reach a settlement.
	   Turkey was snubbed as an EU candidate at a summit last December
because of its poor human rights record, territorial disputes with
Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus. Instead, it was offered a
special relationship, including annual summits with EU leaders.
	   Talks have been deadlocked since August, when Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash demanded recognition of his breakaway state
and cancellation of EU entry talks with Cyprus as preconditions for
returning to the negotiating table.
	   Denktash has been refusing to see EU officials unless his terms
are accepted.

 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Declaring herself an ``eternal optimist,''
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday the U.S.
government was taking small steps toward resolving conflicts in the
Mideast, the Balkans and India and Pakistan.
	   Speaking outside the U.N. Security Council chamber where she sat
for four years as the U.S. representative, Albright hailed steps
taken by India and Pakistan to put the nuclear genie back in the
bottle. And she cast developments in the Balkans in the same
favorable light.
	   ``We keep making progress'' in helping Israel and the
Palestinians reach a West Bank accord, she added.
	   An administration official said Thursday that Clinton invited
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to separate meetings at the White House next week in
hopes of breaking the Mideast deadlock.
	   Albright met with Netanyahu on Wednesday, and was expected to
see Arafat over the weekend.
	   ``There are small steps in all these areas that lead in the
right direction,'' Albright said. Applying traditional diplomatic
caution, though, she reminded reporters that there was a lot of
work to done across the board.
	   ``We are constantly working at them,'' Albright told reporters.
``And as I have been asked many times before, I am an eternal
optimist, which is what you need to be to keep pushing this process
forward.''
	   India's pledge Thursday to sign the nuclear test ban treaty if
negotiations are concluded successfully followed by a day a pledge
by Pakistan to sign next year.
	   Carefully, Albright described the twin steps as ``some
progress,'' as she hailed the two old antagonists' decision to try
to resolve their dispute over the contested territory of Kashmir as
well as promises to curb exports of dangerous technology.
	   ``Obviously, much remains to be done,'' Albright said. Still
undone, she said, are finding a formula for a ban on production of
nuclear weapons ingredients as well as evidence the two countries,
which have tested nuclear weapons, intend to avoid a nuclear arms
race.
	   But her mood was upbeat, overall, and that included the Balkans
and the Middle East.
	   On Wednesday, the United States and all other members of the
Security Council except China joined to approve a resolution
warning Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop Serbian
attacks on civilians in the province of Kosovo.
	   At the same time, Albright is seeking a breakthrough in the
Middle East.
	   This weekend, she plans to talk to Arafat and, for a second
time, to Netanyahu about stumbling blocks still in the path of a
West Bank accord.

Belgian interior minister resigns over death of deportee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series. ADDS details, Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback
tendered his resignation late Thursday, two days after a Nigerian
woman facing deportation died following a long struggle with
police.
	   Tobback's move came after it became clear that one of the two
policemen charged in the incident had already been sanctioned by
the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an asylum seeker.
	   Tobback, a Socialist, offered to resign following crisis talks
within the center-left government. He said the police force made
errors in preparing the deportation of the woman.
	   In the streets, over 1,000 demonstrators were calling on him to
step down, shouting ``Tobback resign,'' during the third day of
protests against the government's asylum policy.
	   It is now up to King Albert II to accept or reject the
resignation offer, but it would be an exception if the monarch went
against the wishes of his minister. It was unclear early Friday who
would take over from Tobback.
	   It was the second time in five month the interior minister had
to resign. During the Spring, another Socialist, Johan Vande
Lanotte, stepped down after the key suspect in a pedophile case,
Marc Dutroux, briefly escaped.
	   Tobback had said he had been shocked by the death of Semira
Adamu but had warned he would not resign before an investigation
into the death was finished. But upon learning how police had
handled her deportation, he did not wait that long.
	   The resignation is not expected to endanger the survival of the
coalition of Christian Democrats and Socialists.
	   Tobback, 60, had been a cenrral figure in Belgian politics for
the past 20 years and had been interior minister from 1988 to 1994.
He was mayor of the university town of Leuven when Vande Lanotte's
resignation forced him back into national politics.
	   The government Thursday suspended the deportation of asylum
seekers from Brussels international airport until new measures were
approved.
	   Two policemen have been charged with assault and battery in the
death of Adamu, a 20-year-old woman who resisted police efforts to
get her on a Togo-bound plane. Police subdued her by putting a
pillow on her face. She lapsed into a coma and died afterwards.
	   It had been the sixth time police had tried to deport her, but
each time her struggles forced them to desist.
	   One of the two policemen had been sanctioned in January 1997 for
kicking an asylum seeker during a deportation operation, said
police spokeswoman Els Cleemput.
	   Officials, who did not want to be named, said Tobback had been
angry upon learning that news, and it pushed him to offer his
resignation. The center-left government went into crisis talks late
Thursday before his resignation offer was announced.
	   The police officer in question had been put on non-active for
one month and was not allowed on deportation duty for seven months.
	   Since he was reintegrated in the service, he was always
supervised and videotaped during deportation operations, Cleemput
said. She pointed out he was not the man holding the pillow on
Adamu's face.
	   Cleemput said a pillow to subdue deportees was only used twice
last year. But this year resistance from deportees had increased
and the police had to use the practice a dozen times already. It
was the first serious incident involving a pillow.
	   On Thursday, the police union called on its members to refuse
cooperation in any forced expulsion of asylum seekers. Police at
Brussels international airport held a go-slow protest action,
delaying passport clearance.
	   Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her
family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has
three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her
refugee status.

Three countries demand resumption of Angolan peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS UNITA officials allowed back into government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The three countries overseeing Angola's
peace process demanded Thursday that the government and the former
rebel group UNITA resume peace efforts stipulated under a 1994
accord.
	   ``There can be no military solution to the conflict,'' and the
government of Angola and UNITA must seek a political settlement,''
according to a communique issued by the United States, Portugal and
Russia, after a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly.
	   The communique was sent to both parties in Angola.
	   Angola's peace process has crumbled with a recent resurgence in
fighting. Tensions mounted after the government severed contact
with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi for his failure to honor the
accord. Savimbi and UNITA representatives joined the government
under a special agreement in April 1997.
	   UNITA fought a civil war against the government for nearly two
decades after Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1994
accord ended the fighting, but the United Nations says UNITA has
resisted implementing it, particularly by refusing to hand over
four key territories and demobilize its troops.
	   In their statement, the three countries also demanded that UNITA
``comply immediately and without conditions with its obligations''
under the accord ``and cease all military activity.''
	   The three countries said they appeal to the council ``to
continue its engagement in the peace process in Angola and to
maintain an appropriate presence of the U.N. observer mission in
Angola in support of the peace process.''
	   Earlier, this month, the Security Council decided to keep U.N.
military observers in Angola for another month and urged Angolan
authorities to reconsider suspending UNITA's participation in the
government.
	   Responding to that pressure, Angola's ruling party readmitted
some UNITA officials back into the government of national unity
Thursday.

Canada moves to end truck slowdown along U.S. border
</HEADLINE>

blocking truckers and in 7th graf that Idaho and Minnesota have not
been forcing truckers to fill out time-consuming forms. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The Canadian government said Thursday it will try
a two-pronged strategy to end harassment and tough inspections that
are deterring Canadian trucks from crossing into U.S. border states
in the Prairies.
	   Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said Canada has simultaneously
requested consultations under both the North American Free Trade
Agreement and the World Trade Organization to settle the dispute
over Canadian agricultural products.
	   ``We chose to go to the two forums because we want to underline
how important this unilateral, incorrect action is and to
demonstrate that we are prepared to avail ourselves of the
mechanism that we think is righting a wrong,'' he said.
	   Marchi's comments follow a meeting in Washington between Raymond
Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, and U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. Chretien indicated Canada would
take retaliatory action if the harassment isn't stopped.
	   Marchi said that under the provisions of NAFTA, both sides have
to meet within 15 days. It's 10 days under the WTO. If the
consultation process fails, the dispute could go to arbitration
under both NAFTA and the WTO.
	   Authorities have been blocking Canadian truckers hauling wheat
and hogs south for more than a week. Cattle shipments have also
been held up.
	   South Dakota is refusing to let Canadian hogs pass through the
state. North Dakota and Montana have been forcing Canadian truckers
to fill out time-consuming forms about the safety of their cargo.
	   The inspections, coupled with attempts to avoid blockades, are
forcing Canadian truckers to absorb thousands of dollars in
increased costs.
	   Marchi said he hopes the Canadian action will prompt the U.S.
government to pressure the governors of the states involved in the
dispute to back off.

Giants stop Pirates to move closer in wild-card race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's early games; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Barry Bonds and the San Francisco Giants
set up a really wild weekend in the wild-card race.
	   The Giants pulled within one game of idle New York and Chicago
for the NL's final playoff spot, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-2
Thursday to complete a four-game sweep.
	   San Francisco, the Mets and the Cubs all finish with three games
on the road. The Giants visit Colorado (76-83) while the Mets play
at East champion Atlanta (103-56) and the Cubs play at Central
champion Houston (100-59).
	   Bonds hit his 37th homer and Joe Carter, Rich Aurilia and
pitcher Russ Ortiz also connected for solo home runs.
	   The Giants won for the seventh time in eight games. They got
their first four-game sweep of the season and their first at home
against Pittsburgh since July 1985.
 &UR; Phillies-Marlins postponed
	   In Miami, Thursday night's Marlins' game against the
Philadelphia Phillies was postponed because of Hurricane Georges
and rescheduled as part of a doubleheader Saturday.
	   Florida and Philadelphia are to conclude the season with a
four-game series. If the Phillies sweep, the Marlins would finish
with 111 losses, the most in the major leagues since the 1965 New
York Mets.
	   Georges was forecast to hit the Florida Keys on Friday, with the
effects of the storm expected to felt in Miami and beyond. If
Friday night's game is also postponed, the teams will try to play
back-to-back doubleheaders Saturday and Sunday.
	   Philadelphia's Curt Schilling (15-14) is scheduled to pitch
against Livan Hernandez (10-12) Friday.

Cyprus could cause regional conflict, Yilmaz says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Greek minister's address, background.
No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Greek Cypriot government's decision to
deploy new anti-aircraft missiles threatens to turn the standoff on
the divided island into a regional conflict, Turkey's prime
minister warned Thursday.
	   Actions ``by Greece and the Greek-Cypriots poses a serious
threat to the security of the Turkish republic on northern Cyprus
and on Turkey and to peace and stability in the eastern
Mediterranean,'' Mesut Yilmaz told the General Assembly.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974 in
the wake of a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkish Cypriots have set up a breakaway state _ recognized only
by Turkey _ which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   In his speech, Yilmaz renewed Turkey's call for the creation of
a confederation on the Mediterranean island.
	   ``I believe that the proposed confederation can finally open an
avenue for peace, reconciliation based on a common destiny for the
two peoples in Cyprus.'' Yilmaz said.
	   The internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government, with
the support of the five permanent members of the Security Council,
rejects any proposal that would entrench the island's division.
	   The Greek Cypriot government wants to deploy S-300 Russian
anti-aircraft missiles, prompting Turkish threats to respond by
force if necessary. Greece has warned that could lead to war
between the two NATO partners.
	   ``Forces of the Greek, Greek-Cypriot camp have heightened
tensions on the island. The clock is ticking for the deployment of
the S-300 missile system,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Greece's foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, in his address to
the assembly later Thursday, called this year's talks on Cyprus ``a
year of stagnation and frustration.''
	   Greece has said it will not negotiate directly with Turkey over
Cyprus, insisting that the issue be settled in the International
Court of Justice in The Hague.
	   ``The reaction from Ankara, obediently echoed by the
Turkish-Cypriot leader, has been one of harsh rejection,'' Pangalos
said.
	   Yilmaz said European Union's decision to start negotiations with
the Greek Cypriot side on entering the EU also has made it more
difficult to reach a settlement.
	   Turkey was snubbed as an EU candidate at a summit last December
because of its poor human rights record, territorial disputes with
Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus. Instead, it was offered a
special relationship, including annual summits with EU leaders.
	   The U.N. mediated talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
leaders have been deadlocked since August, when Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash demanded recognition of his breakaway state
and cancellation of EU entry talks with Cyprus as preconditions for
returning to the negotiating table.

Belgian interior minister resigns in Nigerian deportee case

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback
resigned late Thursday, two days after a Nigerian woman facing
deportation died following a struggle with police.
	   Tobback's move came after it became clear that one of the two
policemen charged in the incident had already been sanctioned by
the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an asylum seeker.
	   Tobback, a Socialist, offered his resignation following talks
within the center-left government. He said the police force made
errors in preparing the deportation of the woman.
	   In the streets, over 1,000 demonstrators were calling on him to
step down, shouting ``Tobback resign,'' during the third day of
protests against the government's asylum policy.
	   It is now up to King Albert II to accept or reject the
resignation offer, but it would be an exception if the monarch went
against the wishes of his minister. It was unclear early Friday who
would take over from Tobback.
	   It was the second time in five month the interior minister had
to resign. During the Spring, another Socialist, Johan Vande
Lanotte, stepped down after the key suspect in a pedophile case,
Marc Dutroux, briefly escaped.
	   Tobback had previously said he would not resign before an
investigation into the death was finished. He did not wait that
long.

Organizers unveil dlrs 1.4 billion budget to stage 2002 Winter
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Olympic organizers on Thursday praised a
proposed dlrs 1.4 billion budget for the 2002 Winter Games as
tight, detailed and achievable.
	   They know the spending plan is based on the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee's best assumptions and estimates, and a lot of surprises
can happen in the next three years.
	   ``We approved (the proposal) with the caveat that we will
aggressively monitor it,'' said Alan Layton, chairman of the SLOC
board of trustees' budget committee. ``We will make no commitments
that we don't have the money to pay for.''
	   Layton said he expects to put his committee's recommendation
before the full board on Oct. 8 for a vote.
	   After 10 months of dissecting the 2002 Olympics into thousands
of tasks and scrubbing away unnecessary or redundant duties, the
SLOC staff unveiled an exhaustive spending plan they hope will
finance a successful yet frugal Winter Games.
	   Following Thursday's presentation, the proposed budget won
plaudits from members of the United States and International
Olympic committees who sit on SLOC's board.
	   ``I'm pleased with the level of detail,'' said Anita DeFrantz,
an IOC vice president. ``We are deeply concerned there is enough to
do the job and this looks like there will be.''
	   The proposed spending plan, which must also be approved by the
IOC, is more than dlrs 400 million larger than the amount Nagano,
Japan, spent to host this year's Winter Olympics. But the Nagano
budget didn't include nearly dlrs 500 million in construction costs
covered by the government.
	   The Salt Lake blueprint doesn't include dlrs 171 million in
transportation, security and Paralympics costs that organizers said
will be picked up by the federal government.
	   SLOC officials described their proposed spending plan as
disciplined and lean.
	   ``There isn't any room for reductions without drastically
cutting into the functions'' needed to stage an Olympics, said
Frank Joklik, SLOC president and CEO.
	   The Salt Lake spending plan covers 41 functions, such as medical
services or security; 200-plus projects, like the torch relay; 400
subprojects and 3,000 activities, such as tree plantings.
	   To the relief of state and local government leaders, the budget
balances without additional tax dollars. In fact, it returns dlrs
59 million taxpayers contributed to build a bobsled run and ski
jumps, along with a dlrs 40 million endowment to maintain the sites
after the Olympics.
	   Organizers have also set aside dlrs 55 million for unexpected
expenses once the Games begin.
	   To cover the expenses, organizers are banking on dlrs 1 billion
in cash from television rights, corporate sponsorships, ticket
sales and licensed products. Another dlrs 443 million is
anticipated in goods and services donated by sponsors.
	   Joklik said organizers have raised about half the cash and
service contributions from sponsors needed to balance the budget.
	   The current shortfall in revenue brought words of caution from
Layton and others. But John Krimsky Jr., deputy secretary general
of the USOC and head of that committee's efforts to raise money for
2002, said SLOC's estimates are reliable and realistic.
	   ``There is always a degree of escalation, but these are very
achievable numbers and will enable us to put on a successful and
financially solvent Winter Games,'' he said.
	   During the next two weeks, SLOC will hold budget briefings with
individual trustees and with representatives from Gov. Mike Leavitt
and Mayor Deedee Corradini.
	   During a news conference Thursday, Leavitt said he will be
looking at whether the proposed budget balances expenses with
putting on an acceptable Olympics.
	   SLOC spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said earlier this year that the
2002 Winter Games could go down as the ``cheap Olympics.'' And she
repeated Thursday that Salt Lake does not have the resources that
financed the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, which the
IOC declared the best ever.
	   Joklik said a successful Olympics is a matter of perception by
the athletes, media, IOC brass and the public. And the proposed
spending plan takes that into account.
	   ``Everything in this budget is essential,'' he said.

Millionaire to fund anti-European campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A millionaire businessman said Thursday he will
spend 20 million pounds (dlrs 30 million) to help form a group to
campaign against Britain's proposed membership of the single
European currency.
	   Paul Sykes said that the organization, to be called the
Democracy Movement, will spell out the dangers of Britain's
proposed membership of the euro and aimed to become the largest and
most effective anti-European federalist group in Britain.
	   Sykes said the movement would avoid party politics and appeal
directly to Britain's electorate with information about how the
euro would damage the country.
	   ``It is going to be a politician-free zone,'' Sykes said at the
London news conference. ``This is much, much too important for
political parties or individual politicians. It is a people's
movement.''
	   Tony Blair's Labor government, still popular with voters, has
said that it favors entry into the euro early in the next century,
although polls show most Britons are suspicious of the new
currency.
	   The euro is being launched in 11 European Union countries on
Jan. 1, 1999. Notes and coins won't go into circulation until 2002.
	   The opposition Conservative Party, which was in power 18 years
until a heavy defeat in May 1997 elections, says it will not sign
up to the euro for a decade, although the third Liberal Democrat
party is strongly in favor of the euro.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Fierce storms flooded more than 100 homes in
and around the capital killing one teenager whose car was swept up
in a current.
	   The 19-year-old driver died in the Juan Diaz community, on the
outskirts of the capital, where more than 60 homes were flooded,
civil protection officials said.
	   Flooding hit another 40 homes in Panama City.
	   A mudslide in the capital's Roberto Duran neighborhood damaged
several homes, but there were no reports of injuries.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The Guatemalan military has demobilized of
one-third of its force, completing a requirement of the peace
accords which ended the nation's 36-year civil war.
	   An agreement signed Wednesday night said the military had
formally released 15,477 soldiers and closed four military zones,
``which signifies a reduction of 33 percent of the army,'' Defense
Minister Hector Barrios Celada said.
	   The military will retain 31,500 soldiers, he said.
	   The government and a leftist rebel coalition signed peace
accords in December 1996 to end the war, in which an estimated
150,000 people died.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Former Contra rebel leader Eden
Pastora was treated Thursday for the effects of his 34-day-old
hunger strike.
	   The 61-year-old Pastora was admitted to a military hospital late
Wednesday after the former rebel fainted and complained of
persistent nausea and difficulty digesting liquids.
	   Pastora who is demanding the right to run for Nicaragua's
presidency in 2001, returned to his protest campsite in front of
the Supreme Electoral Council after being treated.
	   Known as ``Comandante Zero'' during his rebel days, Pastora
first fought with the leftist Sandinistas to topple the Somoza
regime in 1979 then turned on them, accusing them of being
Marxists. In the 1980s, he led the U.S.-backed Contra fight against
the Sandinista administration.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Leftist rebels occupied the main plaza of a
town in Peru's central jungle, dynamited its city hall and urged
residents not to vote in upcoming municipal elections, authorities
said Thursday.
	   A group of 50 Shining Path guerrillas occupied Aucayacu in the
department of Huanuco, 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Lima, for an hour Wednesday night, a military spokesman said.
Aucayacu has 10,000 inhabitants.
	   The rebels raised a red flag with a hammer and sickle in the
plaza, opened fire on the local police station and painted ``Don't
Vote'' on walls, in reference to Peru's Oct. 11 municipal
elections.
	   No one was reported killed or injured in the attack.
	   In the past, Maoist Shining Path rebels have tried to disrupt
municipal elections, executing mayors and candidates who wouldn't
withdraw.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A jump in the number of dengue
cases this year has led the El Salvadoran Health Ministry to
declare a national health alert.
	   Since January, 1,058 dengue cases have been recorded in the tiny
country of 5.6 million people. The total is five times greater than
for the same period last year.
	   Health officials said heavy rainfall caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon had created conditions favorable for the spread
of mosquitoes which carry the virus, characterized by fever, joint
pain, chills and, in serious cases, hemorrhaging.
	   El Salvadoran officials declare an alert after 1,000 cases have
been reported because the virus can spread quickly.
	   In a 1995 epidemic, the country recorded 9,500 dengue cases and
another 125 of hemorraghic dengue, which led to five deaths.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ An American who spent four years at a
Bolivian maximum security prison for drug trafficking was
extradited Friday to the United States where he faces similar
charges, authorities reported.
	   Andrew Martin Kline, 48, was handed to American DEA officials in
the city of Santa Cruz, 900 kilometers (569 miles) south west of La
Paz, Jose Orias, director of the National Corrections Department
told the AP by telephone.
	   Orias said Kline _ whose hometown in the U.S. was not available
_ served his four-year sentence at the Chonchocoro prison, located
near La Paz and at 4,000 meters (11,900 ft.) above sea level.
	   Orias said Kline faces charges for cocaine and marijuana
smuggling in California.

	   In Manomatuey, where a shelter was washed away Wednesday, three
more bodies were pulled from the muck to bring the toll there to at
least eight. And along the capital's seaside boulevard, a woman's
bloated and blanched body washed up to the shore; police said she
had been dead for about 36 hours.
	   Meanwhile, the hurricane continued its march in a diminished but
still dangerous state. It struck southern Cuba on Wednesday,
crossed it and was threatening the Florida Keys, where 100,000
people were ordered to flee its path.
	   At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) Thursday, Georges was centered near
Cayo Coco on Cuba's north coast and was moving west-northwest at 12
mph (19 kph). Its winds were near 80 mph (130 kph).
	   In Cuba, the government announced two storm-related deaths and
damage to coffee, cacao and banana crops, the Mexican news agency
Notimex said. Nearly 20,000 homes were flooded in Holguin province.

Long time coming: Kwan took a vacation

<TEXT>
	   NORTH CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ Olympic silver medalist
Michelle Kwan did something this year she'd never allowed herself
since first lacing on skates when she was 5 years old. She took a
vacation.
	   ``I went to Hawaii for two weeks,'' Kwan said as she prepared to
compete in this weekend's First Union Grand Slam of Skating. ``I
took the whole month of August off.''
	   Before that, except for an injury that kept her off the ice for
three weeks last year, the longest break the 18-year-old Kwan ever
took from skating was three days.
	   Kwan, who won her second world championship this year after
finishing second to Tara Lipinski at the Nagano Olympics, always
worried she might lose her touch if she took more time off.
	   ``What happens if I lose everything?'' she said she asked
herself. But after coming back strong from a toe stress fracture,
she knows that's not the case.
	   ``It's all in your head,'' said Kwan, who said this season she
might take a week or so of down time.
	   The Grand Slam, sanctioned by the International Skating Union,
allows Olympic-eligble and professional skaters to compete for the
dlrs 40,000 first-place prize. The eligible skaters remain
qualified for the Olympics and the world championships.
	   Sixteen skaters were invited, including men's Olympic gold
medalist Ilia Kulik of Russia, 1992 Olympic champion Viktor
Petrenko of Ukraine and former world champions Todd Eldredge of the
United States and Kurt Browning of Canada. It's the first judged
head-to-head competition between eligible and non-eligible skaters.
	   ``I think it's great,'' Kwan said. ``It's great having an
opportunity to be able to compete with ineligible people.
Competition is competition.''
	   Kwan, who graduated from high school this year, is still
undecided about where to attend college and what she wants to
study, though she is considering journalism and public relations.
	   ``There are so many things out there I want to do. I personally
want to commentate on skating,'' she said. ``I don't want to
postpone school for four years while I do the skating.''
	   Kwan still has her eyes on Olympic gold in 2002 at Salt Lake
City and said she would not have turned pro even if she had won
this year.
	   ``What I love about this sport is competing and doing your very
best and going out there and going to the Olympics and the world
championships,'' she said. ``If that disappears, what else do I
have to look forward to?''
	   The women's competition also includes world silver medalist
Irina Slutskaya of Russia and former world champions Lu Chen of
China _ a two-time Olympic bronze medalist _ and Yuka Sato of
Japan. Russian Maria Butyrskaya, Canadian Josee Chouinard and
Americans Nicole Bobek and Caryn Kadavy round out the field.
	   Other men in the Grand Slam include two-time U.S. champion Scott
Davis, Takeshi Honda of Japan, Evgeny Plushenko of Russia and Eric
Millot of France.
	   The unique format features a free program Friday night at the
North Charleston Coliseum, with the top four men and top four women
advancing to Saturday's semifinals. The top two skaters in each
semifinal advance to the championship round that evening.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Rescue workers
recovered at least 80 bodies Thursday as they explored parts of the
country cut off by Hurricane Georges, as the death toll of
Hurricane Georges neared 200 across the Caribbean.
	   In San Juan de la Maguana, in a low-lying valley 120 miles (200
km) west of the capital, workers recovered 76 bodies from a river,
said Angel Almanzar, director of the Dominican Red Cross.

	   KUTZTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Deborah Richard and Beth Daniel
shot 5-under-par 67s on Thursday to share the opening-round lead in
the LPGA First Union Betsy King Classic at Berkleigh Country Club.
	   Richard and Daniel each had six birdies and one bogey, including
2-under 33s on the front nine.
	   Thirty-nine players in the field of 140 golfers broke par.
	   Richard is seeking her first victory this season and sixth of
her career. She has missed 15 of the 31 tournaments this year
because of an injured left shoulder.
	   Daniel is seeking her first victory on the tour this season and
33rd of her career. She has missed six cuts, primarily due to an
ailing left shoulder.
	   Richard tied for fifth in the Safeco Classic at Kent, Wash.,
Sept. 10-13 and was fourth in the DuMaurier Classic, the last of
the season's four majors, in Canada in August.
	   Rookie sensation Se Ri Pak was a stroke back of the leaders,
joined at 4-under by Laura Davies, Cathy Johnston-Forbes and Nancy
Ramsbottom. Pak and two-time defending champion Annika Sorenstam
share the tour lead with four victories apiece. Davies had the best
front nine of the day, a 4-under 31.
	   Charlotta Sorenstam, Leslie Spalding, Kate Golden, Rachel
Hetherington and Juli Inkster shot 69s.
	   Annika Sorenstam shot a 71. She entered the tournament as the
tour's leading money winner with dlrs 896,188, followed by Pak at
dlrs 805,700.
	   Mitzi Edge used a 9-iron for a hole-in-one on the 121-yard
(110-meter) 12th hole. She finished with a 72.

Fairly strong earthquake shakes northern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.2 rocked northern Japan on Friday morning, but there
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake was centered about 80 kilometers (50 miles) under the
Pacific ocean floor at a point about 30 kilometers (19 miles) off
the coast of Fukushima prefecture, or state, the Meteorological
Agency said. It struck at 6:59 a.m. (2159 GMT Thursday)
	   The quake's location was about 280 kilometers (173 miles)
northeast of Tokyo. A magnitude 5.3 quake struck the same area last
month.
	   The agency said there was no fear of tsunami, seismic waves
caused by undersea disturbances such as earthquakes, as a result of
the temblor.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
it sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Rescue workers
recovered at least 80 bodies Thursday as they explored parts of the
country cut off by Hurricane Georges, as the death toll of
Hurricane Georges neared 200 across the Caribbean.
	   In San Juan de la Maguana, in a low-lying valley 120 miles (200
km) west of the capital, workers recovered 76 bodies from a river,
said Angel Almanzar, director of the Dominican Red Cross.
	   In Manomatuey, where a shelter was washed away Wednesday, three
more bodies were pulled from the muck to bring the toll there to at
least eight. And along the capital's seaside boulevard, a woman's
bloated and blanched body washed up to the shore; police said she
had been dead for about 36 hours.
	   Meanwhile, the hurricane continued its march in a diminished but
still dangerous state. It struck southern Cuba on Wednesday,
crossed it and was threatening the Florida Keys, where 100,000
people were ordered to flee its path.
	   At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) Thursday, Georges was centered near
Cayo Coco on Cuba's north coast and was moving west-northwest at 12
mph (19 kph). Its winds were near 80 mph (130 kph).
	   In Cuba, the government announced two storm-related deaths and
damage to coffee, cacao and banana crops, the Mexican news agency
Notimex said. Nearly 20,000 homes were flooded in Holguin province.
	   Bad news kept coming from throughout the Caribbean: 42 dead in
Haiti, dlrs 2 billion in damage and hundreds of homes lost in
Puerto Rico, three dead and two missing in St. Kitts. Everywhere,
victims struggled to find water, food, ice and other bare
essentials to cope with loss and the tropical heat.
	   Earlier Thursday, Dominicans crammed churches on their patron
saint's day to grieve for the scores of dead and hundreds missing
from Hurricane Georges' rampage through their country.
	   ``On this day of (the Virgin) Mercedes, all the victims of
Hurricane Georges are present and we pray for the injured,'' the
Rev. Jose Arellano Guerrero said at the musty, stone Mercedes
Church in Santo Domingo's colonial city. He proceeded to read the
names of the dead from tiny scraps of paper.
	   Rescuers searched for more victims, including 45 people missing
when floods swept away a shelter in San Cristobal. Army helicopters
and a U.S. Coast Guard C-130 airplane and helicopter combed the
Dominican countryside to assess the magnitude of the disaster.
	   More than 100,000 people lost homes, President Leonel Fernandez
said. Telephone lines were down throughout the country, and
hundreds of people were isolated from help by flooding. Airports in
La Romana and Puerto Plata were severely damaged.
	   More than 1,000 people prayed beneath the vaulted ceilings of
the Mercedes Church, some kneeling on the floor, their lips moving
as they prayed to a life-size Virgin Mary in white and gold gown.
	   People wandered through Santo Domingo, a city of 3 million, with
empty plastic jugs searching for water to drink. Many filled them
with filthy brown river water.
	   The Red Cross mobilized to deliver aid, and army soldiers
patrolled the capital with rifles to deter looting that surged
during the storm. Tourists at one hotel went on a city tour by bus,
to sightsee and to catch a glimpse of the damage.
	   In Puerto Rico, where three deaths were blamed on Georges, a
near-total blackout persisted and 28,000 were in shelters.
	   Hundreds of workers labored to repair power lines, and the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers provided ice, water and tanker trucks.
Traffic stalled in many parts of San Juan, where no traffic lights
worked and debris removal continued. Cargo cranes were downed at
the city's port.
	   Long lines formed at ice plants and water tanker trucks, and
police broke up a fight at one San Juan ice plant.
	   The Puerto Rico government offered dlrs 400 to dlrs 600 to
families who lost property and homes.
	   In Haiti, the U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 for
disaster response, and the U.S. government donated water, food,
blankets, sheets and clothing. France sent a 60-member security
team to help with water purification and treat the injured.
	   Some places in Cite Soleil, a seaside slum in Port-au-Prince
that is home to 200,000, remained chin-deep in water. The number of
tin-and-cardboard shacks lost was unknown.
	   In St. Kitts, 85 percent of homes were damaged or destroyed,
schools and hospitals were damaged, and half the crucial sugar crop
was lost. Some 2,500 were homeless.

Asian crisis spreads as New Zealand falls into recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's economy slumped
into recession as a result of drought and the prolonged Asian
crisis, according to growth data released Friday by Statistics New
Zealand.
	   It said those industries with a strong export orientation to
Asian markets had been particularly hard hit over the last two
quarters.
	   Gross domestic product decreased by 0.8 percent in the June
quarter, following a revised contraction of 1.0 percent in the
March quarter, originally reported as minus 0.9 percent.
	   A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative
growth and Friday's data had been widely expected to confirm that
drought and a weaker international economy had tipped the New
Zealand economy into recession.
	   The economy grew by 1.2 percent in the year to June 1998
compared with the year June 1997. This compared with a revised 2.3
percent growth in the year to March 1998, originally reported at
2.2 percent and expectations of 1.4 percent annual growth.
	   Government statistician Len Cook said the economy was now
growing at its slowest annual rate in five years.
	   ``The fallout from the severe east coast drought and the slump
in Asian export markets has been a downturn in business
investment,'' he said.
	   He said businesses had cut back on investment in new plant and
equipment and at the same time had run down stock levels.
	   ``As a result internal demand contracted 0.4 percent in spite of
lifts in household and government spending. With the downturn in
key export markets, export volumes fell for a second consecutive
quarter, further adding to the contraction in GDP,'' he said.
	   In the financial markets the data forced a further weakening in
overall monetary conditions, mostly through a decline in interest
rates.
	   Ninety-day bank bills, off which floating home mortgages are
priced, fell to 5.48 percent immediately after the data from 5.59
percent before it was released.
	   The data came after news Thursday that international credit
rating agency Moody's had downgraded New Zealand's rating by one
notch to Aa2 after disappointing current account data.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Rescue workers
recovered at least 80 bodies Thursday in parts of the country cut
off by Hurricane Georges, raising the death toll to nearly 200
across the Caribbean. In San Juan de la Maguana, in a low-lying
valley 120 miles (200 km) west of the capital, workers recovered 76
bodies from a river, said Angel Almanzar, director of the Dominican
Red Cross. In Manomatuey, where a shelter was washed away
Wednesday, three more bodies were pulled from the muck to bring the
toll there to at least eight. And along the capital's seaside
boulevard, a woman's bloated and blanched body washed up to the
shore; police said she had been dead for about 36 hours. Meanwhile,
the hurricane continued its march in a diminished but still
dangerous state. It struck southern Cuba on Wednesday, crossed it
and was threatening the Florida Keys, where 100,000 people were
ordered to flee its path. (CARIBBEAN-HURRICANE)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Taking the lead from rival Pakistan,
India's prime minister pledged Thursday that his country was
prepared to sign the nuclear test ban treaty but had to complete
negotiations first. Atal Bihari Vajpayee told world leaders
gathered for the U.N. General Assembly debate that India wanted the
treaty to go into force no later than September 1999. On Wednesday,
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his General Assembly
speech that his country was ready to adhere to the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, though he warned that compliance would depend on
whether India resumed its tests. The two countries conducted
tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May, sparking fears of a nuclear arms
race in South Asia. The United States and other countries imposed
sanctions on both countries and demanded they sign the treaty
unconditionally. (UN-PAKISTAN-INDIA)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday his
government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for
killing British author Salman Rushdie, and was ready to exchange
ambassadors with Britain. The Iranian ``government disassociates
itself from any reward which has been offered in this regard and
does not support it,'' Kamal Kharrazi said after a meeting with his
British counterpart, Robin Cook. A relieved Rushdie, author of
``The Satanic Verses,'' said from Britain that it appeared his
nearly 10-year ordeal had ended. ``This looks like it's over,''
Rushdie said. ``It means everything.'' Cook, who met Kharrazi on
the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session, said he was
delighted with Iran's decision. He said the countries have agreed
to upgrade their diplomatic relations to ambassadorial level.
(UN-IRAN-RUSHDIE)
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ NATO instructed its generals Thursday
to begin preparing for air strikes on Yugoslavia unless President
Slobodan Milosevic ends his attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
The difference between this action and previous NATO tough talk is
the tone and the timing, NATO officials asserted. A tough U.N.
resolution Wednesday, combined with NATO's ``activation warning''
Thursday of phased air strikes and cruise missile attacks takes the
16-nation alliance to the brink of shooting. Milosevic's massive
attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo have continued
unabated since February, despite previous NATO threats. His
seven-month crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists fighting for
independence in Kosovo has claimed hundreds of lives and forced as
many as 275,000 people from their homes. (NATO-KOSOVO)
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan authorities are holding 20 people
in connection with a plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy in the
capital, and the FBI was invited into the East African nation to
help with the investigation, a government minister said Thursday.
Regional cooperation minister Amama Mbabazi told a parliamentary
question-and-answer session that the FBI agents were invited to
Uganda following the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. diplomatic
missions in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania in which 259 people
died. He said Ugandan intelligence officials had learned that the
group that carried out the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
also planned to attack the U.S. Embassy in Uganda's capital,
Kampala. Over the weekend, security officials said 18 people had
been arrested in connection with plans to hit American and Ugandan
targets in the country. It was not clear when the other two people
were detained. (UGANDA-EMBASSY BOMBINGS)

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Former U.S. National Security Adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski was awarded the title of honorary Lviv citizen
on Thursday.
	   The city council said that Brzezinski was given the title for
his political achievements, including masterminding ``the collapse
of the USSR,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Polish-born Brzezinski, who served under President Jimmy
Carter, was visiting Lviv, some 500 kilometers (375 miles) west of
the capital, Kiev, and said he was grateful for the honor.
	   Brzezinski also said he would work for the reconciliation of
Ukrainians and Poles. Such reconciliation is important for
Ukraine's integration into Europe, he said, according to the
Interfax news agency.

	   DALLAS (AP) _ He didn't get away with Elvis' blue suede shoes,
but he allegedly took the King's black leather jacket. Now he's
dancing to the jailhouse rock.
	   Robert Louis Rodgers, 40, was booked Wednesday on a felony
charge that he stole Elvis Presley's jacket and tried to sell it
for dlrs 100,000.
	   Rodgers, who's being held on dlrs 35,000 bail at the county
jail, is accused of taking the piece from a display case in the
Elvis Auto Museum across from Graceland seven months ago. The case
apparently had a faulty lock. The black jacket, once part of
Presley's personal wardrobe, is valued at dlrs 40,000.
	   ``It's a great-looking, really cool jacket,'' said Todd Morgan,
a spokesman for the Memphis, Tennessee, museum. ``We're glad it's
coming home.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BREMERHAVEN, Germany (AP) _ An Elvis Presley sighting 40 years
ago in the North Sea port of Bremerhaven is good enough reason for
city officials to throw a four-day festival honoring the King of
Rock.
	   ``The Day that Elvis Came'' festival on Oct. 1-4 commemorates
the young U.S. Army private's arrival in Germany on Oct. 1, 1958,
to begin his military service.
	   Already famous from such hits as ``Love Me Tender'' and
``Jailhouse Rock,'' the 23-year-old GI was greeted by crowds of
fans as he walked off his troop transport ship.
	   The city plans to mark the anniversary of his arrival with
music, exhibits and a bronze plaque on the spot where Elvis first
touched German soil.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A four-year royal romance between
Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and an orthodontist's daughter
is over, the nation's best-selling newspaper reported Thursday,
ending speculation that their engagement was imminent.
	   ``It is over!'' screamed a giant headline emblazoned across the
front page of the daily De Telegraaf.
	   The cause of the split between the 31-year-old prince and
commoner Emily Bremers was not disclosed, but citing unnamed royal
insiders, De Telegraaf reported the relationship hit the rocks a
few months ago.
	   Bremers met Willem-Alexander when they were both students at
Leiden University, where the prince studied history while Bremers
took a law degree.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Locked in a tight election race,
Slovakia's ruling party is calling on Europe's rich and famous to
help it retain power in the parliamentary vote Friday and Saturday.
	   Model Claudia Schiffer, actors Gerard Depardieu and Claudia
Cardinale, race car driver Paul Belmondo _ now Ornella Muti has
joined the parade of celebrities to come stump for the Movement for
a Democratic Slovakia.
	   The populist-nationalist governing party, headed by Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar, has come in for criticism across the
political spectrum for the costly promotions, the fees for which it
insists didn't come out of state coffers.

Defiant Milosevic says threats won't solve Kosovo problem

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A defiant Slobodan Milosevic says
NATO threats ``only feed the illusions'' of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian rebels, who appear powerless to stop a Serb onslaught
which has sent thousands more desperate civilians fleeing their
homes.
	   Backed by a tough U.N. resolution, NATO instructed its generals
Thursday to prepare for air strikes unless Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, halts its attacks against remnants of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   But there was little sign that the warnings will deter
Milosevic's government from its campaign to destroy the KLA, which
is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia. Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown Feb. 28.
	   During a meeting Thursday with chief U.N. refugee official
Sadako Ogata, Milosevic said that ``pressures on Yugoslavia ... do
not contribute to solving the problems.''
	   The government's Tanjug news agency quoted Milosevic as saying
international threats ``only feed the illusions of terrorist and
separatist forces in their efforts to break away Kosovo from Serbia
and Yugoslavia.''
	   To reinforce that message, the ruling Socialist Party, in a
meeting chaired by Milosevic, blamed ``Albanian separatism and
terrorism'' for the crisis and declared that ``rooting out
terrorism'' is Yugoslavia's top national priority.
	   The Albanian rebels, meanwhile, have their backs to the wall.
	   Serb security forces, backed by armed Serb civilian, have formed
a ring around the province's central region of Drenica. On the
roads and trails that wind out of the region, about 20 kilometers
(12 miles) west of here, Serbs with black ski masks and machine
guns wait in ambush for guerrillas flushed out by tank and
artillery fire.
	   ``We can't stop the Serbs,'' said a 23-year-old guerrilla, who
refused to give his real name for fear of reprisal against his
parents who live in a Serb-controlled area.
	   Four months ago, he left his factory job in Germany to fight for
Kosovo independence. ``Really, I want to go back to Germany,'' he
said, displaying a shrapnel wound in his back. ``We can't leave. We
can only live if we win or if NATO threatens Milosevic to stop.''
	   A U.N. spokesman, Fernando del Mundo, estimated about 15,000
refugees are fleeing the fighting in the Drenica area. But he said
an accurate count was impossible because police refused to grant
them access to the area.

Opposition bids to unseat hard-line Meciar in Slovak elections

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ An unlikely alliance ranging across
the political spectrum entered Slovakia's nationwide elections with
high hopes Friday, intent on unseating a hard-line government that
has alienated its central European neighbors.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and his nationalist Movement for
a Democratic Slovakia have ruled largely uninterrupted and
unchallenged since the country broke from Czechoslovakia and became
independent in 1993.
	   But opposition forces that share little in common except a
dislike of the authoritarian politics of ``Meciarism'' stand a good
chance of taking power if they stay united beyond the two-day
elections Friday and Saturday.
	   Meciar's HZDS, as it is widely known, has powerful backers in
the state media and in privatized industries and is favored to get
the most votes of any of 17 parties competing for all 150 seats in
Parliament. But analysts say its prospects for finding enough
allies to forge a majority coalition are bleak because of dwindling
support.
	   Standing ready to try to take over is a rejuvenated opposition,
led by a recently formed five-party alliance _ the Slovak
Democratic Coalition _ that includes Christian conservatives,
social free-marketeers and Greens.
	   Opposition leaders say they would steer the nation on a vastly
different course, embracing the free-market and democratic reforms
needed to gain Slovakia entry into Western institutions.
	   ``The next few weeks are the best chance yet for democracy in
Slovakia,'' says Martin Butora, president of the Institute for
Public Affairs, an independent Bratislava think tank.
	   Despite authorities' efforts to clamp down on dissent and
hamstring the opposition, Butora says there has been a surge in
civic involvement by pro-Western Slovaks who want change.
	   Meciar and his ruling party have responded by imposing controls
on the media and non-governmental organizations, calling them
``subversive.''
	   He also has drawn criticism for his treatment of the
560,000-strong Hungarian minority that comprises over 10 percent of
Slovakia's population. He evoked comparisons to the ``ethnic
cleansing'' practices of the Bosnian war by proposing to Hungary
their ``voluntary repatriation.''
	   Slovakia's chances of being admitted to NATO or the European
Union any time soon may hinge on a change in government. The EU
excluded the nation of 5.5 million from the first round of
membership expansion, primarily because of alleged failings in its
democratic system.
	   Other issues on voters' minds are Slovakia's 14 percent
unemployment, rising crime, the deterioration of the health care
and education systems and an economy that still lags well behind
its neighbors'.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Criticism of South Africa's military
intervention in Lesotho was widespread as the small kingdom tried
to cope with the wholesale destruction of its capital.
	   There were manned roadblocks on some streets of the capital,
Maseru, on Thursday, though bullets had stopped flying and South
African and Botswanan troops regained a semblance of control.
	   Embattled Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili spoke of
reconciliation on state radio and alleged the intervention that
began Tuesday came after he and other top officials were targeted
for assassination. Lesotho had requested South African help.
	   Mosisili did not name the alleged conspirators in the
assassination plot.
	   His opponents dismissed the claim as ``trash.''
	   Damage estimates from a looting and arson spree that began in
the first hours of the intervention run into the millions of
dollars, and it's unclear where the money will come from to
rebuild.
	   In addition, South Africa must figure out how to restore a
credible government to Lesotho, an impoverished, Belgium-sized
nation of 2 million people that is surrounded by South African
territory _ and dependent on its bigger neighbor for jobs and
income.
	   ``Nobody is going to open in this place anymore. It will be a
ghost town,'' Cheryl Robertson said as she stood outside a pillaged
Woolworths department store that she owns with her husband.
	   Criticism of the intervention is widespread. Opposition
political parties and their thousands of supporters still insist
the national elections last May were rigged. Troops of the South
African Defense Force are seen as an invading army.
	   South Africa President Nelson Mandela defended his government's
actions, telling reporters in Ottawa, Canada: ``It's not a question
of whether it was popular or not. It's a question of whether it was
right.''
	   Defenders of the action say Lesotho's armed forces were
mutinous, the country was sliding toward chaos, and that they were
invited in by legal authorities.
	   The operation involving 800 South African soldiers _ later
joined by 200 from Botswana _ arrived Tuesday morning without
warning and fought pitched battles against Lesotho's soldiers.
	   Who shot first remains unclear. But a well-placed source in the
Lesotho army said many Lesotho soldiers _ who were not mutineers,
and whose government had asked for the intervention _ battled the
South Africans because they believed their country was being
invaded.
	   ``If the South African soldiers had come with a white flag and
broadcast a message that they wanted to talk and settle things, it
would have been totally different,'' the source said on condition
of anonymity because of fears for his safety.
	   South African commander Col. Robbie Hartslief said his troops
will remain ``until law and order is restored.'' He did not say how
long that might be.

After months of fence-sitting, NATO ups ante in standoff with
</HEADLINE>
Milosevic &QL;

	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ The NATO allies are taking their
standoff with Slobodan Milosevic to the brink, promising air
strikes and cruise missile attacks unless the Yugoslav leader ends
his crackdown in Kosovo _ and ends it quickly.
	   ``It is time to stop the killing and destruction in Kosovo. Our
patience is running out,'' U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Thursday.
	   Cohen and his NATO counterparts agreed Thursday to begin
assembling their firepower to strike against targets in Yugoslavia,
though set no specific date for an attack.
	   In the days ahead, each of the 16 NATO allies will say if and
how they can contribute to an allied air campaign against Milosevic
that will seek to check his brutal onslaught against ethnic
Albanian rebels in Kosovo province.
	   If the political decision is made to launch a military action
against Yugoslavia, it would be a phased campaign, gradually
increasing in intensity.
	   ``The targets would be military targets,'' said Walter B.
Slocombe, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy. ``Very, very
effective and very, very strong blows would be aimed at the very
instruments that Milosevic is using to carry out this repression.''
	   If Milosevic does not back down, by agreeing to a cease-fire and
seeking a negotiated solution, the military campaign would be
stepped up _ though officials won't say how far they will go.
	   Flouting months of international warnings, Milosevic's forces
have killed hundreds of separatists and civilians and prompted a
humanitarian crisis that is bound to worsen as winter sets in.
	   Tackling rogue leaders like Milosevic _ to prevent them from
destabilizing their neighbors in fragile areas _ illustrates the
sort of action the NATO alliance is preparing for in its post-Cold
War strategy.
	   The alliance also is looking at what it can do specifically for
Kosovo's more than 250,000 displaced people and refugees.
	   Officials are aware that NATO now needs to make an example of
Milosevic. ``The credibility of NATO is on the line,'' Cohen said.
	   The standoff with Milosevic, and its outcome, are of particular
interest for NATO's three candidate members _ Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic _ who will be welcomed into the NATO fold next
April.
	   Fighting in the Balkan has threatened to trigger wider
instability in eastern Europe.
	   The three countries have said they are prepared to participate
in the Kosovo operation.

New polls show Labor ahead of conservatives for Oct. 3 election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard began
soft-pedaling his key campaign promise, tax reform, as new polls
showed voters turning against his new tax and boosting the Labor
Party's chance of election.
	   Howard stressed that Australia's economy is growing, in contrast
to most of Asia and New Zealand, under his administration's three
years of rule, rather than promoting his tax reforms.
	   ``The international climate is going to be tougher for
Australia,'' Howard told a radio station.
	   ``If countries with which we trade a lot don't perform as well,
then that makes it more necessary for us to become more competitive
with our exports.
	   He said the principal question in the election was who was could
manage the Australian economy best in international circumstances
that were going to be more difficult next year than they were last
year.
	   ``We, of course, argue very strongly with a record of getting
our budget into balance we are far far better to manage the
Australian economy than the Labor Party,'' Howard said.
	   According to the AC Nielson poll published in the Sydney Morning
Herald, Howard's governing conservatives fell 1 percent in
popularity to 41 percent while Labor's backing remained steady at
43 percent.
	   The outcome of the Oct. 3 national election is too close to
call, with the poll's margin of error being 2 percent.
	   But Labor's slim lead may not be enough for it to capture
government; it would have to win 27 seats from the conservatives, a
feat no Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   More worrying for Howard, his key campaign promise, a new 10
percent goods-and-services tax on every product and transaction in
exchange for income tax cuts, is continually losing support among
those polled.
	   The poll indicated voter trust in that promise is down another 2
percent over the last week, to 37 percent support. Those who oppose
it rose to 53 percent.
	   The conservative coalition lost an ``unloseable'' election in
1993 against Prime Minister Paul Keating when it tried to convince
the public to accept a 15 percent goods-and-services tax. Keating
ran a scare campaign that persuaded voters the tax was too
confusing and unfair to accept.
	   Opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley is now running a
similar campaign against Howard, and is also trying to change the
key issue of the campaign to government-subsidized jobs for the
long-term unemployed.
	   The new poll also found that most of those polled oppose another
key Howard promise, the sell-off of the government-owned telephone
company Telstra, by a 59-33 percent margin.
	   Meanwhile, the latest Morgan poll found Labor's support rising
to 55.5 while the coalition's support was at 44.5 on a two-party
basis.
	   The Morgan poll, taken last weekend, found that the preferences
of minority parties and independents overwhelmingly supported
Labor.
	   The new polls mean Labor is now ahead in three of the four major
polls, and closing in the fourth, the Bulletin Poll, which has
Labor well behind the government.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

Former UN official charged in dlrs 1.5 million fraud scheme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A former United Nations housing official has
been charged with defrauding the world body out of more than dlrs
1.5 million by inflating the cost of projects in Africa.
	   FBI agents arrested Krishna Gowandan, 57, on Thursday on federal
charges of conspiring with a Ugandan architect to commit wire
fraud. The architect, Peter Kamya, had not been arrested; he is
believed to be living in Uganda.
	   Gowandan, a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago who lives in
Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, is a former housing chief of the
United Nations Development Program.
	   A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
accuses Gowandan of fixing a 1989 bidding process so that Kamya won
a contract to build homes for U.N. employees in Africa.
	   Gowandan allegedly approved dlrs 1.98 million in U.N. payments
for dlrs 400,000 worth of work. Kamya funneled at least dlrs
500,000 back to Gowandan through a series of wire transfers
involving bank accounts in the Channel Islands, prosecutors said.
	   Suspicious U.N. officials confronted Gowandan in 1996, asking
him if he was receiving kickbacks from Kamya. He allegedly told
them, ``I resent the question since I treasure my integrity.''
	   Gowandan was released on dlrs 200,000 bond and ordered to return
to court on Oct. 8. If convicted, he faces up to five years in
prison and a dlrs 250,000 fine.

Cuba denounces U.S. embargo, rejects accusations of espionage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Washington's accusations of a Cuban
espionage ring are ridiculous, the Cuban foreign minister said
Thursday in a speech that also attacked the U.S. embargo on his
country.
	   Roberto Robaina used a speech to world leaders at the General
Assembly's annual debate to blast the embargo, calling it ``the
grossest, most serious and systematic violation of human rights as
a whole.''
	   He said that the uncovering of a Cuban spy ring that U.S.
prosecutors said was the largest ever exposed in the United States
since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, was ``laughable.''
	   ``I am sure that you understand that the most ridiculous and
laughable thing that has occurred these days in the nation of
scandals is that the world's biggest spy, the United States, accuse
of espionage the world's most spied country, Cuba.''
	   Four men, including three Americans, were killed when a Cuban
MiG fighter jet shot down two Brothers planes over international
waters in February 1996. Soon afterward, federal officials looked
into whether spies played any part in the shooting.
	   Ten people were later arrested and charged with spying for Cuba.
	   Gonzalez rejected U.S. criticism of human rights violations in
his country, and accused the United States of preparing a ``new
vendetta'' against Cuba.
	   ``The international community should never allow such a noble
and compelling cause as that of human rights to be held hostage to
mean political interests,'' Gonzalez said.
	   Upholding his nation's communist system, he said capitalism was
responsible for the financial problems in global markets.
	   ``The process of globalization and neo-liberal
internationalization of the world economy has today multiplied the
advantages for the developed countries, to the detriment of the
increasingly underdeveloped economies,'' Gonzalez said.
	   He said that the inequitable trade between the rich and the poor
was ``more theft and aberrant swindle than trade.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Thursday, giving back more
than half of Wednesday's big gain, as some traders chose not to
wait until Tuesday to see if the Federal Reserve comes through with
an expected cut in interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average
finished 152.42 points _ or by 1.9 percent _ lower at 8,001.99
after nearly surrendering all of Wednesday's 257-point surge with
an afternoon slide of 218. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Growth in the U.S. economy slowed sharply in
the spring, marking the end, analysts believe, of a two-year
stretch of vibrant growth and the start of a period of lackluster
gains. The gross domestic product _ the sum of all goods and
services produced within U.S. borders _ advanced at a 1.8 percent
annual rate in the April-June period, after shooting up at a 5.5
percent rate during the first three months of the year, the
Commerce Department said Thursday. That was a bit better than the
1.6 percent rate estimated a month ago and the initial 1.4 percent
estimate of two months ago. Economists are expecting modest growth,
around a 2 percent rate or a little higher, for the second half of
the year. (US-ECONOMY)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Crisis-hit economies in Southeast Asia will emerge
from their problems in two to three years' time, the president of
the International Chamber of Commerce predicted Thursday. ``I am
moderately optimistic that within a few years, we will see the end
of the tunnel again,'' said Helmut Maucher, who is also the
chairman of international food and drinks firm Nestle. Indonesia
and other Asian nations affected by the turmoil still have many
problems, but are now aware of the need to reform, Maucher told a
news conference in Geneva. Russia's troubled economy will likely
suffer ``ups and downs'' for another 20 years, Maucher said. (WORLD
TRADE)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia's crisis, balancing budgets and
a threat to royal heads will be just some of the issues on the
table for this weekend's gathering of European finance ministers in
Vienna. Meeting Friday and Saturday amid in the Hofburg Imperial
Palace, ministers from the 15 European Union nations know the
crowded agenda reflects a growing urgency to wrap up preparations
for the birth of Europe's common currency in less than 100 days.
Ministers from the 11 nations that adopt the euro on Jan. 1 are
under particular pressure to set a deadline for eradicating budget
deficits. Germany insists the drive for balanced budgets is
essential for a strong euro. (EU-FINANCE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal banking authorities helped arrange a
rescue package for a large private investment fund that nearly
collapsed from losses of more than dlrs 90 billion invested in
financial markets around the world. Senior officials from 16 of the
world's largest banks and brokerage firms spent six hours Wednesday
at the New York offices of the Federal Reserve to work out a
preliminary plan to provide more than dlrs 3.5 billion to shore up
the Long-Term Capital Management LP fund, according to two sources.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The central bank acted
as a neutral observer, one of the sources said Thursday. He
stressed that no public money was involved in the plan. (US-FUND
RESCUE)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. and the
Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier are in talks on a deal that
could include a takeover bid by the software giant, Dow Jones
Newswires reported Thursday. Dow Jones cited an unnamed source at
Reed Elsevier. The report came after rumors of a possible bid
triggered a rise in Reed Elsevier's stock early this week. Market
watchers believe Elsevier may be looking for a partner or takeover
candidate after its merger plans with Dutch publisher Wolters
Kluwer fell through earlier this year. A spokesman at Microsoft's
headquarters in Redmond, Washington, said the company did not
comment on rumors. The company's European offices also declined
comment. (NETHERLANDS-REED ELSEVIER-MICROSOFT)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ United Bank of Switzerland, the big
Swiss banking group, said Thursday market turmoil will lead to an
after-tax loss of 500 million Swiss francs (dlrs 360 million) to 1
billion francs (dlrs 720 million) in the third quarter of 1998.
This will leave the bank only a ``modest'' net profit for the
second half, UBS said. The company blamed turmoil in emerging
markets for a shortage of liquidity, which in turn harmed UBS's
fixed-income business in those markets. UBS also cited wide
volatility in stock indexes in the U.S. and Europe, which hurt the
value of UBS' equity trading book. (SWITZERLAND-UBS)

Africa faces more conflicts _ and U.N. blames African leaders
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A year after the U.N. Security Council
held its first high-level meeting on Africa and called for its
conflicts to be settled peacefully, the continent is embroiled in
old and new crises from Angola and Sudan to Ethiopia and the Congo.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan voiced his frustration during the
council's second ministerial meeting on Africa Thursday and blamed
the continent's leaders for choosing guns over negotiations.
	   In the past year, one in four countries in Africa experienced
conflict and half the worldwide deaths from conflict were in
Africa, according to a report to the council cited by British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   ``What will it take for Africa's leaders finally to reject
military solutions to political challenges?'' asked Annan, a
Ghanaian. ``When will the realization arrive that no one _ not a
single one _ of these conflicts can end in the absence of
compromise, tolerance and the peaceful resolution of disputes?''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked the same
question, citing the tremendous toll the conflicts are taking in
the erosion of trust among African nations, lost opportunities for
economic development, and most importantly in human lives.
	   ``The leaders of countries in crisis have a choice. They can
stop now, and prevent the slide back to full-scale war. They can be
statesmen, and guide their nations toward a future of cooperation.
Or they can continue full-tilt into the past _ a past of hatred,
violence, instability and isolation,'' Albright said.
	   ``No one else _ not their neighbors, and not the international
community _ can make that choice for them,'' she said.
	   But Albright said the international community has a role: It can
make it harder to solve disputes through violence and easier for
African nations to choose the road to peace.
	   And she cited some inspiring progress _ democracy putting down
strong roots in Botswana and Mozambique and new hope that Nigeria
will return to democratic rule.
	   A Security Council committee led by Japan has singled out the
flow of arms to Africa as a key area where the international
community could make a difference between war and peace.
	   Saying ``this dirty business fuels conflict, fortifies
extremism, and destabilizes entire regions,'' Albright called for
curbs on the transfer of arms to conflict zones in Africa, timely
disclosure of shipments to those areas, and enforcement of arms
embargoes.
	   ``And we should seek to build international support, over the
next six months, for a voluntary moratorium on arms sales that
could fuel these interconnected conflicts,'' she said.
	   Declaring that Britain has ``a hard-nosed self-interest in
seeing Africa wealthy and prosperous,'' Cook pledged to promote the
continent's trade and development and reduce it debt. But he said
this was impossible without peace.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, noting ``the contagious
effect of these crises,'' called for a greater role by regional
organizations to prevent and settle Africa's conflicts.
	   The Organization of African Unity said it believes in ``African
solutions to African problems.''
	   But it called for international support to solve the Congo
crisis which threatens the entire region, to prevent full-scale war
between Ethiopia and Eritrea and a resumption of fighting in
Angola, and to combat terrorism.
	   And for the second year, the Security Council issued a
presidential statement urging all African nations to ``settle their
disputes by peaceful rather than military means.''

Morocco reports difficulties in identifying voters in Western
</HEADLINE>
Sahara &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Morocco reported difficulties in
identifying voters for a referendum on the political status of
Western Sahara and blamed rebels who are seeking independence for
the region's indigenous people.
	   Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali told the U.N. General
Assembly on Thursday that the Polisario Front has refused to take
part in the identification of a large number of potential voters
``although it had no right to do so.''
	   The United Nations reported in early August that more than
140,000 voters have been identified so far for the referendum. The
vote was originally scheduled for December but isn't expected to
take place until early 1999.
	   Western Sahara is the disputed area of North Africa claimed by
Morocco and the Polisario Front.
	   A U.N. force has been trying to identify voters because of
bitter disagreements over who is eligible to take part. The two
sides disagree over the identification of voters among three
Saharan tribes.
	   Filali said the exclusion of a considerable number of people
``casts doubts on the will of the other party to bring about the
necessary conditions for the organization of a fair and equitable
referendum.''
	   On other issues, the Moroccan minister accused Israel of
plunging the Middle East ``into a spiral of despair and confusion''
by failing to turn over land to the Palestinians and
procrastinating on peace negotiations.
	   Filali also accused the Israelis of adopting ``a policy for the
`judaization' of Jerusalem'' by expanding the city's municipal
boundaries _ a move which he said ``the entire Islamic world
denounces.''
	   Israel and Morocco established low-level diplomatic relations in
1995 after the signing of the Israel-Palestinian peace accords.
	   Israel had hoped the ties would be raised to ambassadorial
level, but relations soured after Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government came to power and adopted a tougher line
towards the Palestinians.

Netanyahu says Palestinian statehood will sabotage peace process

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With the Palestinians seeking
international support for statehood, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu warned that a unilateral declaration of
independence will sabotage the peace process.
	   Netanyahu, addressing the U.N. General Assembly four days before
Yasser Arafat makes a rare appearance at the world body, insisted
the only path to peace is through negotiations. And he said a
statehood announcement by the Palestinian leader would provoke an
Israeli reaction.
	   ``I strongly urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this
course,'' Netanyahu said Thursday. ``Such actions will inevitably
prompt unilateral responses on our part. And this development will
not be good for the Palestinians, not good for Israel, not good for
peace.''
	   Palestinian negotiators said Arafat will use his U.N. appearance
to win global backing for independence in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Arafat has said he will declare statehood on May 4, 1999,
regardless of whether a final peace agreement with Israel had been
negotiated.
	   The diplomatic battle over the statehood issue could affect
efforts by the United States to wrap up a deal in New York this
week on an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was more upbeat,
telling reporters that she will try to ``lock in'' an agreement
during upcoming meetings with Netanyahu and Arafat. ``We have felt
that there has been systematic progress,'' she said.
	   Netanyahu told the General Assembly that the only way for Israel
and the Palestinians to live in peace is to complete the current
talks on a further Israeli withdrawal and then negotiate a final
settlement.
	   ``We must continue to negotiate earnestly, continuously,
tirelessly until the final peace agreement is reached. No other way
will do,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Failure by the Israelis and Palestinians to meet deadlines in
the Oslo peace accords does not kill the accords themselves, the
Israeli leader said. He suggested, however, that a statehood
declaration could.
	   ``An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state in
disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo would constitute a
fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It would cause the
complete collapse of the (peace) process,'' he said.
	   In response, the Palestinian's U.N. representative, Nasser
al-Kidwa, said any decision taken by the Palestinian leadership
after the Oslo agreements expire ``cannot be considered a
unilateral act.''
	   Netanyahu's government had to bear ``the primary
responsibility'' for the inability to reach a final settlement
within the deadline, he said in a response that marked the first
time the Palestinians exercised the so-called ``right to reply''
granted them in a General Assembly decision to enhance their U.N.
status this summer.
	   Netanyahu said a durable peace must strike a balance between
Palestinian self-rule and Israel's security, which means an end to
terrorism and hostile propaganda.
	   ``I repeat: This balance can only be achieved, not by unilateral
declarations but by negotiations and negotiations alone,'' he said.
	   A permanent peace, he said, must be based on the principle that
``the Palestinians should have all the powers to govern their lives
and none of the powers to threaten our lives.''
	   But Al-Kidwa said Netanyahu was ``completely wrong'' to say that
the land belonged to Israel.
	   ``The land is ours...,'' he said. ``The Palestinians are an old
proud people that have the right to sovereignty and statehood.''

Lebanon pledges peace with Israel, but hinges it on Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Lebanon pledged Thursday to sign a peace
treaty with Israel in three months, but hinged the promise on
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights _ something the Israeli
government has rejected.
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri made the offer in a speech
to world leaders attending the General Assembly's annual debate,
and said he was speaking for Syria as well.
	   Hariri demanded Israel comply with Security Council resolutions
calling for it to withdraw from southern Lebanon and called on
world leaders to take a more effective role in enforcing them.
	   ``The negotiations on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks have come
to a complete standstill as a result of the intransigent position
of the Israeli government,'' he said. ``The repercussions of such
intransigence could very well shatter our hopes for peace.''
	   Nevertheless, he said that both Lebanon and Syria were committed
to peace.
	   ``We are ready to sign a peace treaty with Israel within three
months, on the condition that it withdraws from the south, west
Bekaa and the Syrian Golan to the line of June 4, 1967,'' he said.
	   Israel has occupied an enclave in southern Lebanon since 1985 in
a bid to protect its northern settlements from guerrilla attacks.
	   The Syrian-backed Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 militiamen from the border zone.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he was willing to
withdraw troops from the south if the security of Israelis was
guaranteed.
	   ``We now find ourselves in the bizarre position of offering to
withdraw from an Arab country and meeting with Arab refusal to
negotiate such a withdrawal,'' Netanyahu told the General Assembly
in his speech earlier Thursday.
	   Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war
and later declared it annexed. Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off
more than two years ago.
	   Syria and the previous Israeli government reached an informal
agreement on a full withdrawal from Golan, but Netanyahu's
government has rejected that agreement, saying it was never
completed.

New polls show Labor ahead of conservatives for Oct. 3 election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Friday
began soft-pedaling his key campaign promise, tax reform, as new
polls showed voters turning against his proposed new levy and
boosting the Labor Party's chance of election.
	   Rather than promoting his tax reforms, Howard stressed that
Australia's economy is growing, in contrast to most of Asia and New
Zealand, under his administration's three years of rule.
	   ``The international climate is going to be tougher for
Australia,'' Howard told a radio station.
	   ``If countries with which we trade a lot don't perform as well,
then that makes it more necessary for us to become more competitive
with our exports.
	   He said the principal question in the election was who could
manage the Australian economy best in international circumstances
that were going to be more difficult next year than they were last
year.
	   ``We, of course, argue very strongly with a record of getting
our budget into balance we are far far better to manage the
Australian economy than the Labor Party,'' Howard said.
	   According to the AC Nielson poll published in the Sydney Morning
Herald, Howard's governing conservatives fell 1 percent in
popularity to 41 percent while Labor's backing remained steady at
43 percent.
	   The outcome of the Oct. 3 national election is too close to
call, with the poll's margin of error being 2 percent.
	   But Labor's slim lead may not be enough for it to capture
government; it would have to win 27 seats from the conservatives, a
feat no Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   More worrying for Howard, his key campaign promise, a new 10
percent goods-and-services tax on every product and transaction in
exchange for income tax cuts, is continually losing support among
those polled.
	   The poll indicated voter trust in that promise is down another 2
percent over the last week, to 37 percent support. Those who oppose
it rose to 53 percent.
	   The conservative coalition lost an ``unloseable'' election in
1993 against Prime Minister Paul Keating when it tried to convince
the public to accept a 15 percent goods-and-services tax. Keating
ran a scare campaign that persuaded voters the tax was too
confusing and unfair to accept.
	   Opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley is now running a
similar campaign against Howard, and is also trying to change the
key issue of the campaign to government-subsidized jobs for the
long-term unemployed.
	   The new poll also found that most of those polled oppose another
key Howard promise, the sell-off of the government-owned telephone
company Telstra, by a 59-33 percent margin.
	   Meanwhile, the latest Morgan poll found Labor's support rising
to 55.5 percent while the coalition's support was at 44.5 on a
two-party basis.
	   The new polls mean Labor is now ahead in three of the four major
polls, and closing in the fourth, the Bulletin Poll, which has
Labor well behind.

Prime Minister appeals for votes from Pauline Hanson's

 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Friday
made a direct appeal to Pauline Hanson's right-wing populist One
Nation voters to consider voting for him.
	   Howard said on radio he did not agree with the policies of One
Nation, such as a cutoff of Asian immigration or abolition of
Aboriginal welfare programs, but unashamedly wanted the preferences
of its voters.
	   On Australian ballots, voters may nominate a ``second
preference'' party in case their first choice does not come first
or second in the polling. It is these ``second preferences'' that
Howard was appealing for.
	   ``Now I would say to One Nation voters who may be listening to
this program, I don't agree with the policies of the party that you
are proposing to vote for, I don't think they have anything to
offer, but when you cast your vote think of your preference,''
Howard said.
	   Meanwhile, Labor party campaign director Gary Gray accused
Howard's Liberal party of doing pre-election ``deals'' with
Hanson's One Nation party.
	   ``John Howard's coalition and One Nation party are doing deals
in key seats all over the country,'' Gray told reporters in
Canberra. ``They are now out to do rotten deals.''
	   Howard has repeatedly said that he will not enter either into
negotiations or coalition arrangements with the One Nation party.
	   So far there has been no direct response either from Howard or
the Liberal party to Gray's charge.
	   Gray put his charge bluntly.
	   ``Faced with rising voter backlash to John Howard's goods and
services tax and jobs record, the coalition and One Nation are
doing exactly what they did in the recent Queensland elections,
preference deals,'' he said.
	   One Nation candidates won 23.5 percent of the vote and 11 of the
89 seats in the Queensland state elections in June.
	   That was regarded as a triumph for a minor party which did not
exist at the time of the last elections.
	   Gray gave four examples to back up his charge of government
``deals.''
	   --One Nation has produced how-to-vote cards in Queensland which
would favor the coalition in the Oct. 3 election.
	   --The West Australian director of the Liberal party had admitted
holding discussions with One Nation.
	   --Independent West Australian candidate Allan Rocher has said
that Howard's Liberal party had made arrangements with the One
Nation party in an attempt to defeat him.
	   --Several members of the rural-based National Party, the junior
partner in Howard's coalition, are openly doing deals with One
Nation to save their seats.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Fierce storms flooded more than 100 homes in
and around the capital killing one teenager whose car was swept up
in a current.
	   The 19-year-old driver died in the Juan Diaz community, on the
outskirts of the capital, where more than 60 homes were flooded,
civil protection officials said.
	   Flooding hit another 40 homes in Panama City.
	   A mudslide in the capital's Roberto Duran neighborhood damaged
several homes, but there were no reports of injuries.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The Guatemalan military has demobilized of
one-third of its force, completing a requirement of the peace
accords which ended the nation's 36-year civil war.
	   An agreement signed Wednesday night said the military had
formally released 15,477 soldiers and closed four military zones,
``which signifies a reduction of 33 percent of the army,'' Defense
Minister Hector Barrios Celada said.
	   The military will retain 31,500 soldiers, he said.
	   The government and a leftist rebel coalition signed peace
accords in December 1996 to end the war, in which an estimated
150,000 people died.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Former Contra rebel leader Eden
Pastora ended his 34-day hunger strike Thursday after receiving
what he said were assurances from congressional leaders that he
would regain his right to run for public office.
	   Weak and unable to easily digest liquids after the fast, Pastora
had earlier been treated at a hospital. Pastora, 61, staged the
fast to protest a court decision barring him from a presidential
bid because he had once accepted Costa Rican citizenship.
	   ``I ended the strike because the leaders of congress promised me
to re-interpret the constitutional articles that affect me,''
Pastora said in a telephone interview.
	   Legislators were not immediately available to confirm that
report.
	   Pastora, who is demanding the right to run for Nicaragua's
presidency in 2001, returned to his protest campsite in front of
the Supreme Electoral Council Thursday after leaving a military
hospital earlier in the day.
	   Known as ``Comandante Zero'' during his rebel days, Pastora
first fought with the leftist Sandinistas to topple the Somoza
regime in 1979 then turned on them, accusing them of being
Marxists. In the 1980s, he led the U.S.-backed Contra fight against
the Sandinista administration.
	   Because he accepted Costa Rican citizenship during his exile
there in the 1977, electoral officials have ruled he cannot seek
Nicaragua's presidency. Pastora argues that the constitution allows
Nicaraguans to retain their rights as long as their second
citizenship is in another Central American country.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Leftist rebels occupied the main plaza of a
town in Peru's central jungle, dynamited its city hall and urged
residents not to vote in upcoming municipal elections, authorities
said Thursday.
	   A group of 50 Shining Path guerrillas occupied Aucayacu in the
department of Huanuco, 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Lima, for an hour Wednesday night, a military spokesman said.
Aucayacu has 10,000 inhabitants.
	   The rebels raised a red flag with a hammer and sickle in the
plaza, opened fire on the local police station and painted ``Don't
Vote'' on walls, in reference to Peru's Oct. 11 municipal
elections.
	   No one was reported killed or injured in the attack.
	   In the past, Maoist Shining Path rebels have tried to disrupt
municipal elections, executing mayors and candidates who wouldn't
withdraw.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A jump in the number of dengue
cases this year has led the El Salvadoran Health Ministry to
declare a national health alert.
	   Since January, 1,058 dengue cases have been recorded in the tiny
country of 5.6 million people. The total is five times greater than
for the same period last year.
	   Health officials said heavy rainfall caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon had created conditions favorable for the spread
of mosquitoes which carry the virus, characterized by fever, joint
pain, chills and, in serious cases, hemorrhaging.
	   El Salvadoran officials declare an alert after 1,000 cases have
been reported because the virus can spread quickly.
	   In a 1995 epidemic, the country recorded 9,500 dengue cases and
another 125 of hemorraghic dengue, which led to five deaths.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ An American who spent four years at a
Bolivian maximum security prison for drug trafficking was
extradited Friday to the United States where he faces similar
charges, authorities reported.
	   Andrew Martin Kline, 48, was handed to American DEA officials in
the city of Santa Cruz, 900 kilometers (569 miles) south west of La
Paz, Jose Orias, director of the National Corrections Department
told the AP by telephone.
	   Orias said Kline _ whose hometown in the U.S. was not available
_ served his four-year sentence at the Chonchocoro prison, located
near La Paz and at 4,000 meters (11,900 ft.) above sea level.
	   Orias said Kline faces charges for cocaine and marijuana
smuggling in California.

Egypt, Jordan test first link in proposed Mideast power grid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY308 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN FALCHETTO &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ When someone switches on the TV in Jordan
these days, the image on the screen may be powered by electricity
generated in Egypt.
	   The two countries have linked their power systems as the first
step toward a proposed electricity grid extending east to the Gulf
and west to Morocco _ and even Europe.
	   The Egypt-Jordan link is being tested now and should begin
commercial operation in October. The power is carried by cables
that are lifted over the Suez Canal by 225-meter (740-foot) towers,
then run along the floor of the Gulf of Aqaba between the two
nations.
	   A link between Jordan and Syria is expected to be finished next
year, and one between Syria and Turkey is scheduled for completion
in 2000.
	   As almost always in the Middle East, the beginning step was a
long time coming. And the grander plan for the entire region is
still held up by war and politics. Iraq's system is too damaged to
join the system; Israel isn't welcome for now.
	   Jordanian and Egyptian officials say their link alone will mean
steadier electricity and cost savings since they will be able to
trade power during peak hours of consumption.
	   ``Down the line, this will make electricity cheaper for
consumers,'' said Waddah Naboulsi, general director of the Arab
Union of Producers, Transporters and Distributors of Electricity, a
regional group.
	   The Egypt-Jordan link should save Jordan alone dlrs 7 million
annually in its first year or two and much more in the future
because it will reduce the need for new power plants, said Waiel
Sabri, executive manager of Jordanian Electrical Power Co.
	   Maher Abaza, Egyptian minister of electricity, said more than
just cost is involved.
	   ``These new connections will reduce the need for a strategic
(generating) surplus and make our system safer'' from blackouts, he
said.
	   If power fails in one country, ``it will be very easy to
instantly send power to the state in difficulty,'' he said.
	   Jordanian and Egyptian officials both said an important aspect
of the project is that it should form the base for the far broader
power grid.
	   The ambitious project started in 1988 with plans to include five
nations _ Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Turkey and Iraq. It was estimated
making the links would cost dlrs 450 million but lead to savings of
dlrs 2 billion a year by using excess generating capacity in each
country at non-peak times.
	   Since then Israel has proposed links to the two countries it has
peace with, Egypt and Jordan. And links are being discussed to the
Arab states of the Gulf and across North Africa. Further extensions
are envisioned to Sicily from Tunisia and to Spain from Morocco.
	   In the initial five-state system, each country is upgrading its
own electrical infrastructure through loans from the Arab Fund for
Social and Economic Development. Each must meet a regional standard
before connecting to the network.
	   But 10 years after the idea was conceived, the Jordan-Egypt link
is the first in the originally planned five-nation grid. Egypt and
its North African neighbor, Libya, opened a line in June.
	   ``Egypt exchanges electricity with Libya almost daily,'' said
Mohammed Abdel Latif, chief engineer of the Egyptian Electricity
Agency.
	   The delay in creating the larger regional system stems mostly
from politics, including complications from the 1991 Gulf War and
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
	   Iraq is still under U.N. sanctions _ imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait _ that prohibit almost all trade with the
country. Its electrical system also is still too crippled from the
Gulf War to join the system.
	   Another potential partner in the system, Lebanon, is still
rebuilding its electrical network from the devastating 1975-90
civil war.
	   Another question is linkage with Israel. Egypt and Jordan are
both willing to eventually make that link but say it must wait for
peace between the Jewish state and other Arab neighbors.
	   ``Any link with Israel (now) would lead to Syria withdrawing
from the project,'' said Abaza, the Egyptian electricity minister.
``Without Syria the grid is incomplete, and there is no way of
connecting to Turkey without passing through Syria.''

Mexican senators question bank bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Congressional opposition to a dlrs 55 billion
bank bailout intensified Thursday when Mexico's finance secretary
skirted tough questions from lawmakers in his annual report to the
Senate.
	   Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria addressed the Senate one day
after opposition legislators said they won't negotiate approval of
the bank rescue program unless top finance officials resign.
	   ``The bank bailout has come under great criticism due to the
grave social implications it represents for the people of Mexico,''
Sen. Alberto Anaya told Gurria during the four-hour hearing.
	   The bailout plan _ which aims to use taxpayers' money to cover
losses and bad loans at private banks _ has led to a standoff
between President Ernesto Zedillo's administration and the
opposition.
	   ``Would it not seem more fair for bankers to pay for this great
fraud?'' Anaya asked.
	   Legislators from the right-center National Action Party have
demanded the resignation of several cabinet ministers, not
including Gurria, in return for continuing talks on the program.
	   The party said it was demanding the resignations of the
officials most closely associated with the bailout, including
Central Bank Gov. Guillermo Ortiz, Finance Undersecretary Martin
Werner, and Banking Commission President Eduardo Fernandez.
	   The opposition-led Congress has been demanding additional
information about the bailout process for months, claiming the
Zedillo administration failed to adequately supervise the banking
system after its privatization in 1992.
	   Zedillo's administration has accepted that many irregularities
took place in the bailout process, and has brought charges against
several wealthy former bankers and businessmen who allegedly
engaged in corrupt practices to benefit from the bailout.
	   Gurria recognized that the government's supervision ``was not up
to the challenge'' of regulating the privatized banking industry,
which prompted even more criticism from senators.
	   ``The National Banking Commission is responsible for the
irregularities that took place,'' Sen. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser said.
``The agency was supposed to supervise the banks' operations.''

Brisbane, Adelaide look to repeat as Australian champions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The Brisbane Broncos and Adelaide
Crows hope to overcome hot streaks by their opponents and mostly
partisan spectators on the weekend to repeat as champions of
Australia's most popular football leagues.
	   On Saturday, Adelaide, the 1997 Australian Football League
champions, takes on North Melbourne before an expected crowd of
100,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. North Melbourne won the
Australian Rules football championship in 1996.
	   Adelaide has the chance to become the first team since Hawthorn
in 1989 to win back-to-back premierships.
	   On Sunday, the Broncos play the Sydney-based Canterbury Bulldogs
in the National Rugby League grand final at Sydney Football
Stadium.
	   Brisbane won last year's Super League championship when that
group and the Australian Rugby League had a one-year split. The
Broncos have proven to be the dominant team in this year's reunited
competition, finishing in first place in the regular season.
	   Adelaide will be up against a North Melbourne side that not only
is searching for its second flag in three seasons, but has an
11-match winning streak. And Adelaide has not beaten North
Melbourne since the 1995 season, including home-and-away losses
this season.
	   ``We will have to be better than last year to win it again,''
said Adelaide coach Malcolm Blight, who is appearing in his 10th
grand final as a player or coach. The Crows will also have to stop
North Melbourne's Wayne Carey, acknowledged by most as the best
player in the league.
	   Former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali is the
AFL's special guest this year and he will be given a lap of honor
in an open car in front of the capacity crowd.
	   Canterbury has won two heart-stopping matches in the rugby
league playoffs. The Bulldogs, who finished ninth on the NRL table,
overcame a 16-point deficit with 11 minutes to play to beat
Parramatta in extra time in last weekend's semifinals.
	   A week earlier, they beat Newcastle, last year's ARL champions,
in extra time.
	   ``We'll have to make sure that if we get the early lead, we
don't go to sleep,'' said Brisbane coach Wayne Bennett. ``We know
what they're capable of doing.''
	   It will be Brisbane's fourth appearance in the championship
final this decade, and they've been perfect, winning in 1992, 1993
and last year. A victory would cement the Broncos' place as
Australia's rugby league team of the 1990s.
	   Canterbury dominated the 1980s with a ferocious defense and
expansive running game on the way to premierships in 1980, 1984,
1985 and 1988. (djp)

Iran distances itself from reward for killing Rushdie

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Iran's foreign minister said his country
would distance itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for killing
Salman Rushdie, a gesture likely to be welcomed internationally but
attacked by hard-liners at home.
	   The Iranian ``government disassociates itself from any reward
which has been offered in this regard and does not support it,''
Kamal Kharrazi said Thursday after a meeting with his British
counterpart, Robin Cook. Both said they were now ready to exchange
ambassadors.
	   In London, a relieved Rushdie welcomed the news.
	   ``This looks like it's over,'' Rushdie said. ``It means
everything.''
	   Speaking outside the Foreign Office where he was briefed on the
development that came out of British talks with Iran in New York,
Rushdie said, ``An extraordinary thing has been achieved.''
	   Cook, who met Kharrazi on the sidelines of the United Nations
General Assembly session, said he was delighted with Iran's
gesture.
	   ``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive
relationship between the United Kingdom, and I believe the European
Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our
relations,'' Cook said following his meeting with Kharrazi.
	   ``Dr. Kharrazi and I have, accordingly, agreed that we should
upgrade the level of our diplomatic relations to ambassadorial
level,'' Cook told reporters.
	   Publication of Rushdie's ``Satanic Verses'' in 1988 caused an
uproar among Muslims around the world, who contended that it
insulted Islam.
	   Months before he died of cancer, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini issued a ``fatwa,'' or Islamic edict,'' calling on Muslims
to kill the Indian-born British writer.
	   Shortly after, the semi-official Khordad Foundation offered a
large reward to anyone who killed Rushdie. A few years ago, it
increased the bounty to dlrs 2.5 million.
	   Kharrazi's comments stopped short of lifting Iran's death
sentence on Rushdie, but was an important step in improving ties
strained over the issue.
	   The Iranian gesture contains little that is new. The Iranian
government has never officially backed the reward, and in recent
years has even given assurances that it will not actively seek
Rushdie's death.
	   But Kharrazi and Cook sought to portray the gesture as something
new and significant as a way to improve ties that have remained
strained over the issue. The two countries briefly severed ties
over the fatwa, and had refused to exchange ambassadors.
	   The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to
improve ties with the European Union. Britain has been keen on
better ties in order to benefit on lucrative projects in Iran,
which it has seen go to France and other European countries that
have better ties with Tehran.
	   Iran has been trying to change its foreign policy ever since
Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric, took over as president in
August 1997. Khatami has underscored the need to replace
confrontation with dialogue in Iran's relations with the West,
including the United States.
	   On Tuesday, Khatami told reporters that his government wanted to
put the Rushdie affair behind it.
	   But powerful hard-liners inside Iran's Islamic government have
always stood by the death sentence. They are likely to continue to
do so. Because of Khomeini's cult-like following Iran, no Iranian
politician can be seen to condemn the fatwa.
	   Only seven months ago, on the ninth anniversary of the fatwa,
the head of the foundation that is offering the reward said he was
considering upping the bounty.
	   Ayatollah Hassan Sanei said the reward would be ``commensurate
with the time and place that the sentence is carried out.'' He said
that if Rushdie were killed in the United States, for instance, the
prize would almost certainly be raised because ``all Muslims hate
the United States.'' He did not say what the prize would be.
	   Iran's chief prosecutor, Morteza Moqtadaie, marked the last
anniversary of the fatwa last February by saying, ``The shedding of
this man's blood is obligatory.''
	   State-run Tehran radio said at the time that, ``The destruction
of this man's worthless life could breathe new life into Islam.''

Kohl firmly rejects possibility of grand coalition

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With the two main parties running neck and neck in
the polls, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has vehemently rejected the
notion of his party sharing power with the opposition Social
Democrats after the national election.
	   Kohl had said Wednesday that such a coalition was ``possible in
principle,'' a comment that had suggested the chancellor might be
softening his stance.
	   But in another television interview Thursday, he said the idea
was simply a way for Social Democrats to distract voters from their
real intention: forming a government with the environmentalist
Greens, a party viewed by many voters as a touch too radical.
	   Analysts for weeks have predicted a grand coalition as the
natural outcome of Sunday's vote, with public opinion almost
equally divided between the two parties.
	   Kohl's Christian Democrats have closed in on the Social
Democrats to within 2 percentage points, according a Campo-Data
survey published Thursday that reviewed recent polling.
	   The survey gave 40.5 percent of the vote to Gerhard Schroeder's
party, compared to 38.6 percent for the chancellor's.
	   Schroeder's diminishing lead _ he led by up to 12 percentage
points last spring _ comes at a time of increasing international
turmoil, with economic crises in Asia and Russia and political
crisis in the United States.
	   Kohl, who after 16 years in power is seeking an unprecedented
fifth term, has stressed his status as a respected statesman
compared to the relative inexperience of Schroeder, the governor of
Lower Saxony state.
	   While Schroeder has supported a grand coalition all along, he
now hints his party could accept being the junior member of a
coalition led by Kohl's party.
	   ``The statement that all democratic parties must remain open to
any kind of coalition certainly is valid without any
preconditions,'' Schroeder told national ZDF television on Tuesday.

Now it's cows on steroids for body-beautiful shows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ While controversy still rages over
breast implants to enhance women entering beauty contests, cow
experts fear bovine beauty pageants may soon have to test cattle
for drugs designed to enlarge udders.
	   Two Australian farmers are facing life bans from national shows
after their cows tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs
this week at the prestigious Royal Melbourne Show.
	   The news has surprised New Zealand farmers and sparked fears
that the same thing may happen here, where drug tests are not
conducted.
	   ``The prize money at the likes of the annual Dairy Expo show in
Hamilton is getting pretty good, which is already motivation for
some competitors to go to extremes,'' a national show judge, John
Davies, said Friday.
	   ``The last thing we need is cows on steroids.''
	   He said the size and shape of a cow's udder determined its
productivity and played a big part in point-scoring at shows.
	   It would be almost impossible for a judge to tell whether a cow
was on drugs without ``taking a sample,'' he said.
	   Davies said hormone drugs designed to enlarge cow udders were
banned in New Zealand and Australia.
	   Roddy West, a Northland farmer, said it was common for
competitors to give beer to cows before a show in order to keep
them calm.
	   ``But injecting drugs into your cow is unacceptable. It should
be good enough without it.''
	   Dr. Lindsay Burton, a Livestock Improvement Corporation vet,
said drugs could enlarge udders, but not the cow's productivity.
	   ``They could also be very harmful to the animal.''
	   Lawrie Bryant, the New Zealand Royal Agriculture Society's
executive director, said drug tests might have to be introduced if
competitors were suspected of doping their animals.

A look at Germany's national election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Key facts about Germany's national elections:
	   HISTORY: 14th national vote since German Federal Republic formed
in 1949, four years after Hitler's defeat.
	   WHAT'S AT STAKE: The 656-seat lower house of parliament, which
formally elects the new chancellor. This government will usher in
German capital's return to Berlin next year after decades of being
relegated to sleepy, provincial Bonn after World War II.
	   MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES: Conservative Christian Democrats and
center-left Social Democrats, biggest parties, only ones fielding
chancellor candidates. Also in parliament: Christian Social Union,
Bavarian sister party to Christian Democrats; Free Democrats, small
pro-business party also allied with Christian Democrats;
environmentalist Greens; Party of Democratic Socialism, successor
to East German communists.
	   CANDIDATES: Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, Christian Democrat,
running for unprecedented fifth term after 16 years in office.
Gerhard Schroeder, 54, Social Democrat, popular governor of Lower
Saxony state.
	   ISSUES: Jobs, with unemployment at postwar highs. Immigration,
with extreme-right parties screaming that foreigners are stealing
German jobs. Eastern Germany, economically depressed since Kohl
brought it into western fold in 1990, could swing national vote.
Both major parties agree on European Union and NATO expansion and
Jan. 1 introduction of single European currency. Election also is
personality contest between rotund, fatherly Kohl and slicker,
younger Schroeder.
	   POSSIBLE SURPRISE: Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's designated heir,
could take over Kohl's party if chancellor loses. Wheelchair-bound
since a 1990 assassination attempt, the leader of the Christian
Democrats' faction in parliament is Germany's most popular
politician. He also could become chancellor in event of a Grand
Coalition, in which the major parties would share power. Kohl says
he'd never lead in cooperation with Social Democrats.
	   VOTER MOOD: Schroeder has seized on widespread dissatisfaction
with Kohl to create momentum for change. Kohl could benefit from
sense of uncertainty about economy and Germans' love of stability.
	   NUMBER OF VOTERS: About 60.5 million.

Prime Minister appeals for votes from Hanson's right-wingers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Friday
made a direct appeal to Pauline Hanson's right-wing populist One
Nation followers to consider voting for him.
	   Speaking on a radio program, Howard said he did not agree with
the policies of One Nation, such as a cutoff of Asian immigration
or abolition of Aboriginal welfare programs, but still sought the
preferences of its voters.
	   On Australian ballots, voters may nominate a ``second
preference'' party in case their first choice does not come first
or second in the polling. It is these ``second preferences'' that
Howard was appealing for.
	   ``Now I would say to One Nation voters who may be listening to
this program, I don't agree with the policies of the party that you
are proposing to vote for, I don't think they have anything to
offer, but when you cast your vote think of your preference,''
Howard said.
	   Meanwhile, Labor party campaign director Gary Gray accused
Howard's Liberal party of doing pre-election ``deals'' with
Hanson's One Nation party.
	   ``John Howard's coalition and One Nation party are doing deals
in key seats all over the country,'' Gray told reporters in
Canberra. ``They are now out to do rotten deals.''
	   Howard has repeatedly said that he will not enter either into
negotiations or coalition arrangements with the One Nation party.
	   So far there has been no direct response either from Howard or
the Liberal party to Gray's charge.
	   ``Faced with rising voter backlash to John Howard's goods and
services tax and jobs record, the coalition and One Nation are
doing exactly what they did in the recent Queensland elections,
preference deals,'' Gray said.
	   One Nation candidates won 23.5 percent of the vote and 11 of the
89 seats in the Queensland state elections in June.
	   That was regarded as a triumph for a minor party which did not
exist at the time of the last elections.

Doctors perform battery of tests on boxer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to note commissioners' questions on alleged
assault and Tyson spokesman response &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE HOWLAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Behind the walls of Massachusetts General
Hospital, Mike Tyson is undergoing a battery of tests to determine
whether he is psychologically fit to return to the boxing ring.
	   His evaluation, which stretched into a second day Thursday,
requires him to answer hundreds of questions from psychiatrists and
neuropsychologists. He was to have electrodes strapped to his head,
an MRI scan his brain for abnormalities and explain to doctors what
he sees in odd-shaped ink blots.
	   All this in an attempt to return to the sport he was banned from
after biting a chunk from Evander Holyfield's ear.
	   Tyson, who smiled and signed autographs as he stepped out of the
hospital Thursday, said some might ``think I'm a psycho because I
bit that guy's ear off.''
	   ``I just want to let the Nevada commission know I'm extremely
sorry and I'm really a good guy,'' he said.
	   The tests are a far cry from what happened when Tyson tried to
return to boxing in New Jersey, said Dr. Edwin ``Flip'' Homansky,
who is overseeing Tyson's evaluation for the Nevada Athletic
Commission.
	   ``In New Jersey he was with a psychiatrist for 45 minutes who
commented he was like a teddy bear in his office,'' Homansky said.
	   Tyson withdrew his application to return to boxing in New
Jersey, saying he didn't think the commission would allow him to
box.
	   According to a document from the Nevada Athletic Commission
outlining the scope of Tyson's evaluation, the boxer will undergo
at least 10 examinations which, among other things, will measure
his level of stress, social conformity, suspiciousness, impulsive
behavior and excitability.
	   At the end of testing, which a commission spokesman predicted
could take three days, the team of doctors will have to answer
several questions about Tyson's state of mind: How will Tyson
handle unpredictable situations? What's his potential to commit
``another major foul'' in the boxing ring? Will he be able to avoid
a repeat of the Holyfield ear-biting incident ``wherein Mr. Tyson
said he `snapped?'''
	   Robert Schleser, a psychology professor at the Illinois
Institute of Technology and director of the Center of Sports and
Performance Psychology, said he doubts the medical team will be
able to predict Tyson's behavior any better than a coin toss.
	   ``This is a weird situation,'' he said. ``There's no test that
specifically is going to tell you whether a boxer is going to bite
someone's ear. That is why this is a huge task for these guys.''
	   In addition, the athletic commission wants the doctors who
evaluate Tyson to look at videotape of his fight against Holyfield,
as well as from post-fight interviews and license reinstatement
hearings in New Jersey and Nevada. They have also been asked to
develop a treatment program if needed.
	   If Tyson is cleared by the doctors, the Nevada commission may
vote to give the former heavyweight champion a new boxing license
on Oct. 3. But that could be complicated by charges brought against
Tyson this month following a traffic accident in which he is
accused of hitting two men.
	   Two commissioners said Thursday they wanted to know more about
the incident before making a decision. Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel
said Tyson should be judged innocent until proven guilty.
	   Paul Anderson, assistant director of the National Sports
Institute of at Marquette University in Milwaukee, said many
high-profile athletes have been ordered to undergo psychological
counseling and treatment programs.
	   But Tyson's situation is unique, he said, because it is geared
to deciding whether he is mentally fit to continue in his sport.
	   Anderson said he's unsure how the process could help curb the
boxer's violent behavior. Tyson's troubles include time served in
an Indiana prison for a rape sentence.
	   ``No one is making him responsible for his conduct,'' Anderson
said of the latest evaluation. ``It's just making him jump through
hoops.''

Boys movement leader says youth violence is avoidable
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPOKANE, Washington (AP) _ Sit still. Don't cry. Stop hitting
your sister. Turn off the TV.
	   It's not easy being a boy _ especially at a time when America's
adolescent males are in crisis, says author Michael Gurian, a
leader of the emerging boys movement.
	   The most dramatic and visible symptom is the recent series of
deadly school shootings, all committed by boys. But, Gurian says,
millions of young males are missing out on the nurturing they need.
	   Gurian, now 40 and a psychotherapist, knows about tough
boyhoods. When he was 10 he was sexually abused by a physician. And
his family moved so frequently that he had trouble bonding with
other children.
	   ``Every kid has sufferings,'' Gurian says, speaking from his
Spokane home. ``I wanted to do something in my adult life to make
sense of what happened to me as a kid.''
	   His best-selling 1996 book, ``The Wonder of Boys,'' clearly
struck a nerve with its insights into a boy's early years. Now, he
has followed with ``A Fine Young Man,'' which examines ages 9 to 21
and suggests the violence they commit is predictable and avoidable.
	   Statistics from recent federal studies of boys and girls make it
clear that boys are in trouble, Gurian says. A sampling:
	   _Boys are four times as likely to commit suicide as girls.
	   _Boys are 15 times more likely to be victims of crimes, and they
commit more crimes than men.
	   _Boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed with a learning
disability and and four times as likely to drop out of school.
	   Though the reasons are complicated, Gurian believes many parents
fail to provide boys with proper emotional support, role models and
supervision.
	   He cites a range of factors, including divorce, lack of extended
families and time pressures on dual-income households.
	   Boys, he says, need more male mentoring, especially after age 10
and especially if their parents have divorced. Divorce often
isolates boys from the only male mentor they have, Gurian says.
Divorced fathers, he says, must work to stay in their sons' lives.
	   He also sees problems with court battles to allow girls in
formerly all-male institutions. ``Boys need to bond with other
boys,'' Gurian says. ``We're wasting a lot of our cultural time
trying to integrate everything.''
	   The boys' movement arose after a flurry of attention to the
problems of girls prompted by Mary Pipher's 1994 book ``Reviving
Ophelia.'' That work detailed forces in society, including media
pressure to be beautiful and sophisticated, that can transform
lively pre-teen girls into unhappy, unhealthy adolescents.
	   Boys also are under pressure to conform to society's
expectations _ pressure, Gurian says, that can create confusion
and, in extreme cases, clinical depression.
	   Trouble can arise when boys are left to sort out those
expectations on their own, often relying on media or video games
for their ideas about manhood with little input from fathers or
other male mentors, the author says. Many hide that struggle behind
bluster, aggression or sullen silence.
	   And boys who are emotionally hurt tend to respond by lashing
out, he says. Several of the boys involved in the recent school
shootings were struggling with family problems or peer-group
humiliations.
	   ``One-third of adolescent male students nationwide carry a gun
or other weapons to school,'' Gurian notes. ``We'll have more guys
doing it.''
	   It's no surprise to him that boys are the primary consumers of
video games, most of which concern a quest or hunt. But playing
such games for long periods exacerbates boys' tendencies to isolate
themselves and tune out the rest of the world, he says.
	   ``Video games are dangerous,'' says Gurian, noting that graphic
violence can desensitize boys. ``We are training this generation to
be better killers than we've ever had before,'' he says.
	   But boys also can be damaged by efforts to curb natural
rough-and-tumble play, Gurian says. Millions of years of evolution
as hunters are behind their love of games involving balls and other
moving objects, but some boys are punished or medicated because
their high energy conflicts with parents' longing for order and
quiet.
	   Grim statistics aside, Gurian's books are upbeat, hailing the
joys of boyhood while offering practical advice.
	   He says that boys are driven by biology _ that roiling
testosterone _ to be more physical, more solitary and more
aggressive than girls.
	   Gurian's emphasis on biological factors puts him at odds with
several other authors of recent books on boys.
	   It's the old debate: nature vs. nurture.
	   Squarely on the side of nurture is William Pollack, author of
``Real Boys.''
	   It's too easy to blame testosterone, says Pollack, an assistant
professor of psychiatry at Harvard University. Hormone overload
``doesn't make them more dominant and want to kill. Society does
that. If we don't let boys cry tears and listen to their pain,
they're going to shoot bullets.''
	   He says society disconnects boys from their mothers too soon,
largely because of fears that sons will be labeled sissies. But
that, Pollack says, leaves many boys with no one to talk to about
their feelings.
	   Also disputing Gurian's emphasis on biology is Dan Kindlon, who
wrote the upcoming ``Raising Cain, Protecting the Emotional Life of
Boys'' with Michael Thompson.
	   ``Societies can raise men who aren't very violent at all,'' says
Kindlon, also a Harvard professor, who cites the Amish and some
Eskimo tribes as examples.
	   He considers sexual abuse and excessive discipline more likely
causes of young male violence than hormones.
	   Gurian has no problem with the disagreements. He's pleased the
topic is drawing attention. ``The Wonder of Boys,'' his fourth
book, was rejected by 24 publishers who were more interested in
books about girls. Tarcher-Putnam eventually published it.
	   Gurian has two more books due early next year, both aimed at
young people. ``From Boy to Man'' is for boys ages 10-14, and
``Understanding Guys'' for girls ages 14-18.
	   ``We are saying you can't do better for girls and women than
improve the life of boys,'' says Gurian, the father of two
daughters.
	   Indeed, he and Pipher conduct joint seminars and she wrote a
cover blurb praising Gurian's book as ``filled with stories and
practical advice.''

Former Mexican state prosecutor extradited from Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Spain extradited the former attorney general
of the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon on Thursday to face
charges of illegally freeing suspects while in office, Mexican
authorities said.
	   Former Nuevo Leon Attorney General David Cantu Diaz was detained
in Madrid Sept. 16 on a warrant charging him with illegally
releasing three people accused of financial crimes, according to
the office of Mexico's attorney general.
	   A Spanish court overruled an appeal by Cantu and ordered him
extradited to Mexico Thursday.
	   Cantu will face charges of abuse of authority, aiding in the
escape of prisoners and administrative offenses. He allegedly
arrested three business people in 1995, held them until they agreed
to drop civil suits, and then illegally ordered them released.
	   Cantu resigned his post in 1996 during a controversy over the
slaying of a lawyer in the northern industrial city of Monterrey,
the capital of Nuevo Leon.
	   The attorney, Leopoldo del Real Ibanez, was shot to death on
Jan. 17, 1996, while he dined with Fernando Garza Guzman, then-head
of the state judicial police.

Howard stands by criticism of Malaysia's prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday he would not retract anything he said about the arrest of
former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The prime minister was repeating statements he made this week
about his stand on the situation in which Anwar had been arrested
and accused of sexual misconduct and treason.
	   On Monday. Howard said: ``It is a matter of deep concern to me,
and I think to most Australians, that there does appear to have
been a drift towards a more authoritarian approach.
	   ``The image of somebody who is clearly a political opponent of
the current prime minister being arrested is very disturbing.''
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad then said Howard
was ``wrong, absolutely'' and should ``check the real facts''
before making accusations, and this was followed by a formal
protest to Australia's high commissioner.
	   ``My reply to him ... is to say to him that I don't retract what
I've said,'' Howard told a Melbourne radio station Friday.
	   ``I don't retreat in any way, nor do I retract one syllable of
what I've already said.''
	   Howard said he was aware of Australian interests in Malaysia.
	   ``I have made the very measured and moderate statement that I
want problems solved not through the use of the police or the
apparatus of the state but rather through the ballot box,'' he
said.

Chinese dissidents told not to run for city legislature
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in Beijing have told three dissidents who
had announced their candidacy for the city legislature that they
may not run for office, a human rights group said Friday.
	   Meanwhile, a dissident, Lu Xinhua, was detained Thursday in the
central city of Wuhan after police confiscated documents intended
to register an independent group, the China Democracy Party, that
authorities have declared an illegal organization, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. It
said Lu was released later in the day.
	   So far, at least a dozen dissidents have been rounded up in the
past week as part of a renewed effort by the Communist government
to crush public dissent. Most, but not all, were associated with
the would-be opposition party.
	   Dissidents He Depu, Gao Hongming and Wang Zhixin recently
announced their candidacies for the city congress.
	   On Thursday, police visited He and Gao at their homes, tore down
posters announcing their election bids, and attempted to persuade
them to give up their candidacies, the Hong Kong-based human rights
group said.
	   It said that He and Gao remained determined to try to run for
office, and that they had protested to the police that they were
violating the law by interfering.
	   China has begun allowing apparently open elections in rural
villages, but it has not permitted those reforms in cities, where
elections are open only to Communist Party insiders.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 49 dissidents has written an open appeal
to President Jiang Zemin demanding the release of four people
detained in connection with an attempt to publish an independent
literary journal, the group Human Rights in China said.
	   The dissidents also demanded that the government pay
compensation to the four detained in or near Guiyang, the capital
of southwestern Guizhou province, for damages caused by their
imprisonment.
	   The letter to President Jiang, signed by 49 dissidents from
throughout the country, charged that the detentions violated
China's human rights commitments under a key U.N. treaty Beijing
signed last year, the New York-based group said.
	   The four were associated with a group of four poets, known for
their liberal views, who met frequently and had planned to publish
a literary journal promoting liberal ideas.
	   Two of the four, Ma Zhe and Liu Xianli, were formally arrested
and may face trial for allegedly trying to subvert the government,
	   Two others, rock singer Wu Ruojie and a businessman, Li Yi, were
subsequently detained and sentenced to three years in a labor camp,
allegedly for having ``divulged state secrets'' by telling overseas
groups about the detentions of the poets.

Floods destroy livelihood of some southern Mexico towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PIJIJIAPAN, Mexico (AP) _ After surviving the worst flooding in
more than 50 years, residents of this cattle-raising town in
southern Chiapas state say their children may go without milk _
perhaps for years _ until local farms recover.
	   Flooding earlier this month on Chiapas' Pacific coast killed 185
people, left dozens more missing and left some towns cut off from
the outside world for nearly two weeks.
	   Now, cattle _ the prime source of cash income for many families
_ are dying off.
	   ``We are lost. Milk production is the basic food source for our
children,'' said Rosendo Marin, head of a union that represents
1,700 ranchers in this Pacific coast township.
	   About 700 head of cattle were swept away by flood waters here,
and most of the remaining herds are sick, ranchers say.
	   With more than 40,000 cows believed to be suffering from blood
infections spread by the floodwaters, and not enough vaccines for
the disease, the outlook appears gloomy for local ranchers.
	   Ranchers who have already lost hundreds of cows fear lost grass
areas will result in the deaths of even more of their cattle.
	   ``A lot more cows will die because we lost more than 8,000
hectares (19,700 acres) of grassland'' to the muck and erosion,
said Jaime Escobar.
	   Milk production in Pijijiapan, which reached 150,000 liters
(39,600 gallons) before the flood, is down to a fifth its normal
level, Marin said.
	   ``We will not recover from this disaster for many years,'' said
Roman Farfan.

Yankees tie league mark with win over Devil Rays
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Yankees matched the American League mark of
111 wins Thursday night as Shane Spencer hit a go-ahead grand slam
in the sixth inning against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   New York (111-48) equaled the 1954 Cleveland Indians (111-43)
and trails only the 1906 Chicago Cubs (116-36) in the win column.
However, these Yankees had a 162-game schedule while the Indians
set the American League record in a 154-game season.
	   Spencer, a 26-year-old rookie, is the hottest Yankee of late,
with 11 hits _ five of them homers _ and 15 RBIs in his last 17
at-bats. He hit his first career grand slam last Friday at
Baltimore.
	   New York, which has three games left, set a team record for
wins, topping the 1927 Yankees (110-44), the famed Murderer's Row
that generally is regarded as baseball's best team ever.
	   The Yankees moved 63 games over .500 for the first time since
the end of the 1927 season and beat the expansion Devil Rays for
the eighth time in nine games.
	   Mike Buddie (4-1) got the win with two shutout innings in relief
of David Wells, the Yankees' probable starter in their postseason
opener next week. Wilson Alvarez (6-14) took a no-hitter and wound
up with the loss.
 &UR; Red Sox 9, Orioles 6
	   In Boston, Pedro Martinez struggled in a game that would give
Boston its first playoff berth in three years. Nomar Garciaparra
made sure the Red Sox won it.
	   Martinez allowed three homers as his September struggles
continued, but Garciaparra homered twice and scored four runs as
the Red Sox clinched the AL wild-card berth with a 9-6 win over the
Baltimore Orioles on Thursday night.
	   The Red Sox probably will begin postseason play in Cleveland
next Tuesday with Martinez (19-7), winless in his previous four
starts, on the mound. They would face Texas if the Rangers finish
with a better record than the Indians, who began the day two games
ahead.
	   Tom Gordon pitched a perfect ninth for his 42nd consecutive
save, setting a major league record. Gordon, who had shared the
record of 41 straight with Rod Beck and Trevor Hoffman, has 45
saves for the season.
	   Dennis Eckersley tied Hoyt Wilhelm for most career appearances
by a pitcher, 1,070, when he relieved for Boston in the eighth.
Sidney Ponson (8-9) took the loss.
 &UR; Twins 2, Indians 0
	   In Minneapolis, Brad Radke pitched 7 1-3 shutout innings for his
first home victory since June 9 and David Ortiz had a two-run
double as Minnesota handed the American League Central Cleveland
Indians their fourth straight loss.
	   Radke (12-14) gave up four hits, struck out seven and walked two
for his first win at the Metrodome since pitching a four-hit
shutout against the Chicago Cubs. Since then, he had been 0-5 with
two no-decisions at home.
	   Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 38th save.
	   The Twins broke up a scoreless game in the sixth against Jaret
Wright (12-10).
 &UR; Royals 6, White Sox 4
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Dean Palmer tied George Brett for the
second-best RBI total in Kansas City history and the Royals snapped
Chicago's 11-game winning streak in Kauffman Stadium.
	   Palmer's two-run single capped a four-run fifth inning and gave
him 118 RBIs for the season, matching Brett's total when he was the
AL MVP in 1980. Hal McRae holds the team record of 133 in 1982.
	   Jose Rosado (8-11) stopped a five-start winless streak with his
first victory since since Aug. 22. Jeff Montgomery got his 36th
save.
	   Jaime Navarro (8-16) took the loss.

	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Musa Shannon, who came into the game as a
substitute midway through the second half, scored in the 87th
minute Thursday night to give the Tampa Bay Mutiny a 4-3 Major
League Soccer victory over the Columbus Crew.
	   Shannon's goal on assists by Dominic Kinnear and Steve Ralston
ended a six-game losing streak for the Mutiny (12-20) against
Columbus, which has lost four straight.
	   The Crew (15-16), playing its final game at Ohio Stadium before
moving to its own field next year, had tied the score 3-3 on goals
by Brian McBride in the 75th minute on a penalty kick and Brian
Maisonneuve in the 78th minute.
	   Paul Dougherty of the Mutiny opened the scoring in the 10th
minute. Stern John of Columbus scored his league-leading 24th goal
in the 28th minute and Mauricio Ramos put Tampa Bay ahead 2-1 two
minutes later.
	   Ramos increased the margin to 3-1 by scoring in the first minute
of the second half.
	   The Crew had a 9-6 advantage in shots on goal and led 26-12 in
total shots.

	   MANOMATEUY, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The last thing that
happened before a crowded hurricane shelter was washed away by a
wave of mud was that a man pushed his 17-year-old son out the door.
	   The boy lived to tell about it. At least eight people and as
many as 36 _ including the boy's father _ did not. They died under
eight feet (2.5 meters) of muck, the result of Hurricane Georges,
which struck the Dominican Republic on Tuesday.
	   Villagers stood atop the shelter Thursday, unable to dig deep
enough to find more than eight bloated and mud-caked bodies.
	   ``My dad got me out. I was the last one to get out when the mud
came, and I climbed away,'' said Cemegui Prosquet Narciso as he
stood atop the mud pile where six family members probably are
buried.
	   Cemegui, who came from Haiti with his family to search for work
in the coffee fields of this central Dominican mountain area, spoke
without emotion _ apparently in shock _ about the ordeal that wiped
out his family.
	   When the hurricane hit Tuesday, most of the residents of this
agricultural village fled to the only concrete building in town, a
schoolhouse in which 41 people waited out the storm.
	   The schoolhouse is by the side of Tablaza River, which soon
rose. The people inside couldn't see out, and had no way of knowing
that a wave of mud was surging down the torrent.
	   But they heard a rumbling, and four people fled the shelter.
Cemegui was the fifth _ and last _ to make it out.
	   All that can be seen of the school Thursday was the girders of
the roof and about two feet (about half a meter) of the walls and
the door, which remains ajar. Mud fills the rest of the building.
	   Villagers began to dig into the schoolhouse, but without
equipment they were unable to get more than a foot (30 centimeters)
deep.
	   They recovered only eight bodies, which were laid out in the
morgue of a nearby town, bloated, scratched and covered in mud.
	   Two were children, two were men and one was a woman. None had
been identified by Thursday.

Malaysian government warns against turning prayers into rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government has warned
Malaysians against using Muslim prayers Friday to demonstrate
solidarity for arrested pro-reform leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   In an apparent bid to head off potential trouble, the
government's Department of Islamic Advancement announced in a
statement that there would be no special prayers at Kuala Lumpur's
National Mosque.
	   The mosque was the site of a huge rally led by the ousted deputy
prime minister on Sunday. Demanding the resignation of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and shouting ``Reform, reform'' tens of
thousands of people marched to the Independence Square from the
mosque.
	   Anwar was arrested the same night under security provisions that
allow up to two years imprisonment without trial. Neither his
family nor his lawyers have seen Anwar since and despite government
assurances there would be a fair trial, he has not appeared in
court.
	   On Friday, Kuala Lumpur was rife with rumors that the weekly
mass prayer at the Masjid Negara, or National Mosque, would be used
by Anwar's supporters to make statements.
	   ``Those intending to hold activities at Masjid Negara must get
permission from the chief imam of the mosque'' or a government
department, said an official statement on Thursday.
	   Malaysia's national police chief threatened Thursday to ``come
down hard'' on anyone who tries to follow Anwar's lead and organize
anti-government rallies.
	   Anwar's last rally was part of a series he held across the
Southeast Asian nation after being dumped as deputy prime minister
and finance minister on Sept. 2 by Mahathir, who called him morally
unfit to lead.
	   Police have threatened Anwar's wife with arrest if she addresses
the public. Officers have blockaded two streets around her home to
keep journalists and supporters away.
	   Anwar has adamantly denied a string of police accusations
against him, including unlawful sex acts, disturbing public order,
interfering with police investigations, and leaking state secrets.
	   The trouble started when he began questioning Mahathir's
17-year-rule and financial policies and began portraying himself as
an alternative to the prime minister, Anwar said during two weeks
of nationwide rallies before he was arrested.
	   Meanwhile, the ruling United Malays National Organization party
threatened pro-Anwar members with expulsion. Six top UMNO leaders,
including the chief of the party's powerful youth wing, are among
the 16 people who have been jailed under the Internal Security Act
since the protests started this month.
	   However, of the 132 people arrested during the protests, only 23
were still in police custody, a police spokesman said.

Cows entered in New Zealand contests may face steroid testing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Cow experts said Friday they fear
bovine beauty pageants may soon have to test cattle for steroids or
other drugs designed to enlarge udders.
	   Two Australian farmers are facing life bans from national shows
after their cows tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs
this week at the prestigious Royal Melbourne Show.
	   The news has sparked concern among New Zealand farmers that the
same thing may happen here, where drug tests are not conducted.
	   ``The prize money at the likes of the annual Dairy Expo show in
Hamilton is getting pretty good, which is already motivation for
some competitors to go to extremes,'' a national show judge, John
Davies, said Friday.
	   ``The last thing we need is cows on steroids.''
	   He said the size and shape of a cow's udder determines its
productivity and played a big part in point-scoring at shows.
	   It would be almost impossible for a judge to tell whether a cow
was on drugs without ``taking a sample,'' he said.
	   Davies said hormone drugs designed to enlarge cow udders were
banned in New Zealand and Australia.
	   Roddy West, a Northland farmer, said it was common for
competitors to give beer to cows before a show in order to keep
them calm.
	   ``But injecting drugs into your cow is unacceptable. It should
be good enough without it.''

India pledges to conclude discussions on nuclear treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ India's prime minister has pledged to move
forward on the global nuclear test ban treaty, hoping for it be
ratified and in effect no later than September 1999.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's pledge before the U.N.
General Assembly on Thursday followed the lead of Pakistan four
months after the bitter South Asian rivals conducted tit-for-tat
nuclear tests.
	   India is one of the 44 countries that must ratify the treaty for
it to go into effect.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif told the
General Assembly that his country was also ready to adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), though he warned that
compliance depended on whether rival India resumed its tests.
	   The two nations' nuclear tests led to worldwide condemnation and
economic sanctions.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday she
welcomed the ``small steps'' India and Pakistan were making towards
adhering to the treaty, but said more progress is still necessary.
	   Long before conducting the tests in May, India pulled out of
negotiations on the treaty, claiming it discriminated against
countries with nuclear potential.
	   India wants the declared nuclear powers to agree on a deadline
to destroy their arsenals. The five declared powers _ the United
States, Britain, France China and Russia _ have refused.
	   ``We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful
conclusion, so that the entry into force of the CTBT is not
delayed,'' Vajpayee said in his speech.
	   States that sign on to the CTBT must refrain from testing
nuclear devices.
	   The treaty must be signed and ratified by 44 countries with
nuclear powers before it can go into effect. Forty-one of those 44
states have signed: India, Pakistan and North Korea have not. Of
those 41 signatures, 10 have ratified the treaty: Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Peru, Slovakia, and
Britain.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed India's announcement,
saying the pledges by both Vajpayee and Sharif ``increase the
momentum for implementing'' the treaty.
	   Annan said he was also gratified that both countries were
participating in the Conference on Disarmament to ban the
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices.
	   Vajpayee noted that when that treaty goes into force, it won't
eliminate existing nuclear arsenals.
	   Sharif and Vajpayee met for nearly two hours Wednesday but
achieved no breakthroughs over Kashmir, a simmering territorial
dispute that took a perilous turn since both countries carried out
the nuclear tests.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over Kashmir _
in the 51 years since the independent states were carved out of the
British empire.

Brazil's Meligeni draws Romania's Pavel in Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORIANOPOLIS, Brazil (AP) _ Fernando Meligeni will lead
Brazil's bid to stay alive in the elite World Group in the first
game of Davis Cup match against Romania on Friday.
	   Meligeni, 48th in the ATP rankings, drew Romanian player Adrian
Voinea (67) for the first game of the match.
	   Teammate Gustavo Kuerten (27) will play the second match against
Andrei Pavel (76), also on Friday.
	   ``I've almost always played the opening game (in Davis Cup
matches). This time I can sleep late and, who knows, score the
second point for Brazil,'' joked Kuerten, the first Brazilian
player to break the top ten and winner of the 1997 French Open.
	   Meligeni recently beat Voinea in a challenger at Kosice in
Slovenia and Kuerten beat Pavel twice before in Prague.
	   Despite the statistical edge, the Romanian team, whose place in
the elite World Group will also depends on winning the match,
remained optimistic.
	   ``It's normal that the Brazilians are confident because they
have good players and they're playing at home. But we also have
experienced players with good rankings and we will fight,'' said
Romanian team captain Adrian Marcu.
	   On Saturday, Kuerten and Jaime Oncins should face off against
Pavel and Gabriel Trifu, but the coaches are allowed to change the
make-up of the doubles teams up to 60 minutes before the game.
	   On Sunday, Kuerten will play Voinea and Meligeni faces Pavel.

	   PIJIJIAPAN, Mexico (AP) _ After surviving the worst flooding in
more than 50 years, residents of this cattle-raising town in
southern Chiapas state say their children may go without milk _
perhaps for years _ until local farms recover.
	   Flooding earlier this month on Chiapas' Pacific coast killed 185
people, left dozens more missing and left some towns cut off from
the outside world for nearly two weeks.
	   At least one temporary bridge erected to reach those towns was
washed away when rivers rose again Thursday, local media reported.
Local elections scheduled for Oct. 4 were canceled in the flooded
communities.

Explosion at refinery in Victoria state

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A series of explosions ripped
through parts of Esso's gas plant near the town of Sale in
southeast Victoria state on Friday afternoon.
	   Police said they believed there might be some casualties, but no
details were immediately available.
	   Esso said they could not comment yet.
	   A large fire was burning at the Garretts Road plant in Sale,
about 110 miles (180 km) east of Melbourne.
	   A police spokesman said the cause of the explosions, which went
off before 1 p.m., was not known.
	   The Country Fire Authority (CFA) described the fire as major.
	   In June, a plug of ice blocked the main supply line into the
plant, which is Victoria's major source of natural gas.
	   State-wide restriction were imposed at the time, forcing factory
closures in 100 industry sectors at an estimated cost of 50 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 29 million).
