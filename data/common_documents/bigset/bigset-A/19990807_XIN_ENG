<HEADLINE> Four EU Members Warned of Law Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Friday
announced a decision to pursue infringement procedures against
Italy, Germany, Portugal and Belgium because the four European
Union (EU) members have violated rules on freedom to provide
services or freedom of establishment.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of obstacles preventing temporary employment
agencies based in other member states from offering their services
in Italy," the EU executive branch said, it had decided to refer
Italy to the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest
jurisdictional body.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the EU executive decided to refer Germany to
the EU court for discriminatory rules "concerning workers on
secondment from another member state."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission also decided to send reasoned opinions
to Germany and Portugal "concerning provision of services by
patent agents." Meanwhile, the EU executive is to send reasoned
opinions to Belgium "concerning discriminatory rules for the
registration of companies."
</P>
<P>
Under the EU Treaty, all the barriers "violate rules on freedom
to provide services or freedom of establishment," the commission
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
As for the registration of companies in Belgium, the director
or manager of a company must produce his permit if he is a EU
national residing in Belgium. However, if the director or manager
is a Belgian citizen, he is not required to provide proof of
residence.
</P>
<P>
"While this differential is not connected with the requirement
of residency as such, it amounts to discrimination on the basis of
nationality and is therefore incompatible with the principle of
freedom of establishment," the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the decision to send a reasoned opinion to
the Belgian authorities because it has not received a satisfactory
response to its letter of formal notice about this violation.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive is mainly responsible for drafting and
enforcing the EU's legislation. It has the right to decide to
refer any country to the EU court if it does not receive a
satisfactory reply from the country within two months after
sending the reasoned opinion, a serious warning for a violator.

<HEADLINE> IMF Return Vital to Economic Recovery: Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, Aug 6 (Xinhua) -- Improved relations with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) was key to Kenya's economic
recovery, Oduor-Otieno, an official with the country's Finance
Ministry, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Oduor-Otieno, who was appointed as permanent secretary of the
ministry two weeks ago, told press that combating corruption and
ending inefficiency in government top his team's agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We have to improve our relations with donors, especially the
IMF. We have to improve our efficiency, project management, and
we have to deal with corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan package to
Kenya in 1997 due to its concerns over corruption and poor
governance in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
So far talks on a resumption of the IMF loan has not restarted
because the IMF argued that it needs to see tangible
anti-corruption measures.
</P>
<P>
Oduor-Otieno said budgetary discipline and infrastructure were
also crucial to invigorating the battered economy.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Oduor-Otieno and Richard Leakey two weeks
ago was part of what Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi described
as the first phase of Kenya's recovery strategy. Kenya's gross
domestic product growth is forecast at 1.6 percent in 1999 from
1.8 percent last year.

<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion
Jan-Ove Waldner edged out Chinese 1995 world titlist Kong Linghui in
the world table tennis championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Swede, world champion in 1989 and 1997, counted on
his experience and deceptive serves to win the match 22-20, 13-21,
21-18, 19-21, 21-15 in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who had only won once in his seven encounters with Waldner,
virtually broke down as the Swede took five points in a row to lead
10-5 in the deciding set.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the only player in the world to have won a "Grand Slam"
of Olympic, world championship and World Cup titles, will take on
Chinese giant-killer Ma Lin.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lin, who brought down world No. 1 Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus
in the fourth round, entered the last four with a 21-13, 21-18, 21-8
victory over South Korean Kim Taek Soo.
</P>
<P>
Olympic title holder Liu Guoliang didn't give a chance to Sweden's
1991 world champion Jorgen Persson, winning 21-7, 21-10, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
"I played to my standard," said Liu. "I have confidence to win
the gold medal."
</P>
<P>
Refering to Kong-Waldner match, Liu said Kong didn't return well to
the Swede's serves.
</P>
<P>
"But I was not surprised at all when either of them won," the
Chinese fast-attacker added. "They are the best players of the world
and both played to their best today."
</P>
<P>
Liu will meet Austrian Werner Schlager in the semifinals on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Schlager beat two-time World Cup Zoran Primorac of Croatia 21-18,

<HEADLINE> Iran Invites Warring Afghan Factions to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran has said it is inviting the
Taliban and its opposition forces in Afghanistan to implement
agreements reached at the "six plus two" meeting in Tashkent,
Uzbekistan in July.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan have no military solution,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said to the official
Islamic Republic News Agency here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's six neighbors - China, Iran, Pakistan,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan - and the United States
and Russia, well-known as the "six plus two" informal group, have
agreed to improve coordination and efforts for a common approach
toward the settlement of the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Experience of conflicts in the past few days in Afghanistan
has brought about nothing but bloodshed, homelessness, and
devastation," Kharrazi said, referring to the lastest Taliban
offensive in which it seized a key airbase of the opposition
forces.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that around 5,000 Taliban fighters, backed by
recruits from Pakistan and some Arabs, took part in the
offensive, the first in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports the opposition forces while Pakistan backs the
Taliban, the religious students' movement that has won control of
most of the country in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying to foster a peace
process in the war-stricken country but has not immediately
achieved results.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran is fully ready to help a peace process and
urges Pakistan to do its best in bringing the Taliban to peace
talks in a bid to end bloodshed in the country.

The Angolan government made this decision in a session of the
Permanent Committee of the Council of Ministers held in Luanda
Friday, presided by the President of Angola Jose Eduardo dos
Santos.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued Friday by the committee said the government
hopes the new relief program will help relieve the suffering of

</P>
<P>
It is reported that up to half of the allocation will be used
to buy food for the victims living in besieged cities, while other
three million dollars will be appropriated for the self-sufficient
production by the displaced people.
</P>
<P>
On July 15, the government decided to adopt an "emergency
strategy" of humanitarian aids, providing with potato seeds and
other agricultural materials for residents of the besieged cities
and encouraging them to do farm work.
</P>
<P>
The committee, consisting of nine important ministries of the
cabinet, is responsible in wartime for dealing with issues on

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Businesses Yet to Recover One Year after </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The affected businesses are still
 struggling to recover one year after the August 7 bombing of the
U.S. embassy in Kenya's capital Nairobi, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
For Kenya's tourism sector, the situation in the past year has
been a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is about perception, it thrives on information and
when you perceive a place as insecure, you simply stay away,"
said Fred Kaigua, chief of the Kenya Association of Tour
Operators.
</P>
<P>
Small businesses, already struggling to survive in a flagging
economy, were aggravated by the terrorist blast, which claimed
more than 200 lives and injured over 5000.
</P>
<P>
"It was a big setback and the impact on small businessmen was
colossal," said Victor Pratt, chairman of the Kenya Management
Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people lost their jobs, lost their income. The
government lost taxes and productivity of the economy dropped
considerably," said Pratt.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of the Investment Promotion Council Joseph
arap Ng' ok put the economic and social cost of the bombing at 10
percent of Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) in today's price.
</P>
<P>
Ng'ok held that small traders within the vicinity lost complete
 businesses, stocks, productive assets and customers.
</P>
<P>
"These mainly comprised bus operators, kiosk owners , newspaper
vendors and hawkers and their losses are unrecoverable," Ng'ok
added.
</P>
<P>
Economic loss suffered by big Kenyan companies located in the
destroyed buildings was also a huge blow to the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which was reported worldwide, made foreign
investors hesitant to visit Kenya, resulting in a drop in foreign
exchange earnings, said Ng'ok.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the United States Agency for International
Development released some three million U.S. dollars for small and
medium businesses affected by the blast.
</P>
<P>
Already two million dollars have reached 44 organizations. A
loss assessment has been undertaken by Kenya Management
Assistance Program and further disbursements start this month.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the people affected believe it may be mere
symbolism. Some 210 businesses are expected to benefit, which
means if the money were distributed equally, each firm would get
only 135 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Drought in Four U.S. States Worst Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that the current drought in four northeastern states
in the country is the worst ever recorded for agriculture and it
threatens to cripple businesses and communities.
</P>
<P>
The drought is the worst ever for farmers in Maryland,
Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island states, Clinton said before
leaving the White House for a weekend trip to Arkansas and
Missouri states.
</P>
<P>
Maryland and New Jersey have imposed state water restrictions.
</P>
<P>
"Such a natural calamity can have devastating consequences, not
only for farmers, but for small businesses and communities that
depend upon a thriving agricultural sector, and for the electric
power system so vital to our nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has worked hard to help drought-stricken
farmers, Clinton said. "We must do more. It is our duty as a
national community."
</P>
<P>
The White House will convene a task force of affected federal
agencies "to coordinate our efforts and focus our attack on this
problem," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Export More Electricity to Azerbaijan, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran will be able to export more
electric power to neighboring Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan when its
power line installations complete by this yearend.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Energy Miniter Habibollah Bitaraf said Friday that
power grid connections to the two countries through Ardabil
province in the west and Mazandaran province in the east are now
underway.
</P>
<P>
Iran's capacity for electricity export now stands at 250
megawatts, and Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Armenia are receiving
electricity by hooking up to power grids in Iran's provinces of
East and West Azarbaijan, Bitaraf was quoted by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is potentially capable of increasing its capacity
of power production by up to 2,000 megawatts each year if
sufficient investments are made available.
</P>
<P>
Iran needs 2 billion U.S. dollars in investments to boost its
electric power production.
</P>
<P>
The country generated 102 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity
in the past Iranian calendar year which ended March 20, and would
increase its output to 108 billion kilowatt-hours by this yearend.
</P>
<P>
The country's electric power generating capacity was reported
at 25,400 megawatts, ranking the 21st in the world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Remains World's Biggest Arms Provider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States remained the
world's biggest exporter of arms in 1998, accounting for about a
third of the total, despite worldwide demand has been slumping,
the U.S. Congressional Research Service said Friday in an annual
review of arms sales.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the United States led in new arms deals, with 7.1
billion U.S. dollars, up from 5.7 billion U.S. dollars in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Germany ranked second, with 5.5 billion U.S. dollars in new
sales, and France third, with 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The value of all new arms sales worldwide in 1998 was 23
billion U.S. dollars, up from 21.4 billion U.S. dollars the year
before.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that the trend in terms of arms sales
has generally been downward, particularly among developing
nations, which are the biggest buyers of weapons. Since 1995,
total arms sales declined by 23.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis and low oil prices have contributed
to the decline in demand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Even though the world total arms sales declined after the end
of the Cold War, the United States increased its sales to
developing countries to 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 2.6
billion U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The biggest buyers of arms last year was Saudi Arabia, with 7.9
billion U.S. dollars in new sales. The United Arab Emirates ranked
second at 2.5 billion U.S. dollars. Malaysia ranked third, with
2.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia has seen its exports steadily declining since
the end of the Cold War. In 1991, it sold 8.2 billion U.S. dollars
in arms. In 1998, the total declined to 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> FAO to Focus on Post Harvest Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced Friday that it has set up
a global post-harvest forum called PhAction, which is expected to
help make up post-harvest losses.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based FAO believes that post-harvest losses are
dramatic in developing countries where loss of cereals is between
10 and 20 percent and of fruits and vegetables as high as 20 to
100 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that decreasing these post-harvest losses
could mean more food for tens of millions of consumers," the U.N.
agency said in a press release distributed at the U.N.
headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that just a 10 percent savings of post-harvest
losses in Asian rice would mean a savings of 5 million tons of
food a year.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin is
expected to sign "a weighty package" during his official visit to
Japan later this year, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The package would include agreements on scientific and
technical cooperation, cultural ties and air traffic, the ministry
said in a statement released after the end of bilateral
consultations in Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin and his
Japanese counterpart, Minoru Tamba, conducted the consultations.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers emphasized that Yeltsin's visit will be "a
milestone in promoting bilateral partnership," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Karasin and Tamba also co-chaired sub-commissions concerned
with border demarcation and joint economic activity in the
southern Kuril Islands within the framework of the bilateral
commission for concluding a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
They "discussed prospects for broadening bilateral ties in the
context of building long-term partnership" and confirmed the
"shared intention to actively pursue all aspects of bilateral
dialogue," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the situation on the Korean
Peninsula. They warned against "exerting pressure" and called for
using "political methods only" to resolve the Korea issue.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Businesses Yet to Recover Year after Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The affected businesses are still
struggling to recover one year after the August 7 bombing of the
U.S. embassy in Kenya's capital Nairobi, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
For Kenya's tourism sector, the situation in the past year has
been a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is about perception, it thrives on information and
when you perceive a place as insecure, you simply stay away,"
said Fred Kaigua, chief of the Kenya Association of Tour
Operators.
</P>
<P>
Small businesses, already struggling to survive in a flagging
economy, were aggravated by the terrorist blast, which claimed
more than 200 lives and injured over 5000.
</P>
<P>
"It was a big setback and the impact on small businessmen was
colossal," said Victor Pratt, chairman of the Kenya Management
Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people lost their jobs, lost their income. The
government lost taxes and productivity of the economy dropped
considerably," said Pratt.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of the Investment Promotion Council Joseph
arap Ng' ok put the economic and social cost of the bombing at 10
percent of Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) in today's price.
</P>
<P>
Ng'ok held that small traders within the vicinity lost complete
businesses, stocks, productive assets and customers.
</P>
<P>
"These mainly comprised bus operators, kiosk owners , newspaper
vendors and hawkers and their losses are unrecoverable," Ng'ok
added.
</P>
<P>
Economic loss suffered by big Kenyan companies located in the
destroyed buildings was also a huge blow to the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which was reported worldwide, made foreign
investors hesitant to visit Kenya, resulting in a drop in foreign
exchange earnings, said Ng'ok.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the United States Agency for International
Development released some 300,000 U.S. dollars for small and
medium businesses affected by the blast.
</P>
<P>
Already 200,000 dollars have reached 44 organizations. A loss
assessment has been undertaken by Kenya Management Assistance
Program and further disbursements start this month.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the people affected believe it may be mere
symbolism. Some 210 businesses are expected to benefit, which
means if the money were distributed equally, each firm would get
only 135 dollars.

EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champions Liu
Guoliang and Kong Linghui fought a five-set thriller to beat Austrian
duo Werner Schlager and Karl Jinkdrak in the men's doubles
quarter-finals of the world table tennis championships here on Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Sudanese Ceasefire Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday voiced his welcome to a Thursday decision by the
Sudanese Government on a comprehensive ceasefire throughout the
African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that the ceasefire "is essential for the
provision of much needed humanitarian assistance to hundreds of
thousands of civilians" affected by the ongoing conflict in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman, Annan said, "I welcome
the announcement made yesterday by the Government of Sudan
declaring a comprehensive ceasefire throughout the Sudan for a
period of 70 days."
</P>
<P>
"A ceasefire is essential for the provision of much needed
humanitarian assistance to hundreds of thousands of civilians,
mostly women and children, affected by the ongoing conflict," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Foreign Ministry, in a statement issued in the
capital Khartoum, declared Thursday a unilateral ceasefire across
the country, which took effect at midnight Thursday and would
expire on October 15.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said the government made the
move to "facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all
areas in need," and "the government hopes the rebel movement would
reciprocate by a similar move."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan called upon the rebel Sudanese People's
Liberation Movement (SPLM) to consider extending the scope of this
ceasefire and thus contribute to the creation of an enabling
environment for humanitarian operations in the Sudan," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The SPLM and its troops agreed on the extension of a
humanitarian-oriented ceasefire for Bahr-El-Ghazal, western and
central Upper Nile in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
"I count on the continued support of the Government and the
SPLM for the unhindered and safe provision by U.N. humanitarian
agencies and NGOs (non-governmental organizations) of relief to
all those in need of humanitarian aid throughout the country,"
Annan said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire, first agreed with the government last year,
effectively broke down last month during peace talks in the
Kenyan capital of Nairobi, which is aimed at ending the 16-year
civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Rebels fighting for the predominantly Christian and animist
south want increased autonomy in their region. More than 1.5
million people are believed to have died since the insurrection
broke out in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Officer Killed by PKK Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- One Turkish officer was killed and
one soldier wounded in an armed attack Thursday night by rebels of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in eastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A group of PKK rebels attacked a Turkish military team in Catak
town of Van province, causing the casualties, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has called on his
followers to "end the struggle" and "withdraw from the Turkish
territory."
</P>
<P>
The PKK has reportedly responded that they would obey Ocalan's
call, but vowed to defend themselves when being attacked.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, however, brushed aside the
appeal for peace from Ocalan, who was sentenced to death on the
charge of treason.
</P>
<P>
"Orders such as 'end the struggle' or 'go on with the struggle'
will not have any affect on our resolution to end terrorism," he
said.
</P>
<P>
PKK has been waging a separatist campaign for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since 1984. Conflicts between
the Turkish security forces and the PKK rebels have claimed over
37,000 lives.

WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of U.S. firefighters
Friday stepped up fighting wildfires that blackened over 1,400

The fires were estimated to have burned 240,000 hectares by
early Friday, an area nearly the size of Rhode Island in the east
United States. No injuries were reported and only one structure --
a storage shed -- was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
About 1,700 more firefighters were shipped in from around the

<HEADLINE> Suspects of U.S. Embassy Bombing Still at Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- One year after the twin bombings
of the U. S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the
terrorists behind the blasts are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U. S. Department of State published in
Kenyan major newspapers photographs of eight suspects responsible
for the August 7 bombing, which indiscriminately killed 224
innocent civilians and injured more than 5000.
</P>
<P>
Public places have also been posted with the notice, in which
the U.S. government is offering a reward of five million U.S.
dollars for information leading to the capture or conviction of
Saudi millionaire Bin Laden and other suspects.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden is on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
's "Ten Most Wanted" list.
</P>
<P>
Living somewhere in Afghanistan under the acknowledged
protection of the ruling Taliban, the 41-year-old son of a Saudi
construction magnate was formally indicted in America late last
year as ringleader of the bombing conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden's Al Qaeda (the base in Arabic) "remains actively
engaged in planning terrorist activities", according to the U.S.
State Department.
</P>
<P>
Other fugitive suspects on the poster are Atef, Fadhil,
Mohamed, Ghailani, Ally, Swedan and Fazil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the intensive worldwide hunt for those suspects has
yielded tangible results. Some 17 suspects have been charged with
murder in the United States in connection with the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Five of the suspects are in custody in New York, while three
more are in custody in Britain pending extradition.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has handed over two suspects to the FBI. They are among
those charged in a New York court with murder.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the trial of another two suspects was stalled due
to lack of crucial evidence from accomplices who are still at
large.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. government has made efforts to improve
security at its facilities overseas and combat terrorism, alerts
at American overseas diplomatic missions were sounded repeatedly
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
About 70 consulates and embassies have been temporarily
shuttered, resulting in a record number of facility closures.
</P>
<P>
U.S. experts said that the two east African embassies were easy
targets for terrorists because they are among the least secure of
Washington's 265 diplomatic outposts.
</P>
<P>
By the standards of an embassy security report issued in 1980s,
so far only 40 to 45 make the grade, said Michael Sheehan, the
State Department's counter-terrorism coordinator.
</P>
<P>
An alarm was raised again only a week before the anniversary of
the terrorist attacks, when security guards had to fire two
shotgun shells into a battered box parcel left behind within the
perimeter of the temporary building of the U.S. embassy on the
outskirts of Nairobi by an unidentified messenger.
</P>
<P>
Fears that the suspicious package was an explosive device
caused the security alert for over an hour. All people in the
mission were evacuated to the basement.
</P>
<P>
The parcel was found to contain a swimming suit.

<HEADLINE> French Gov't Rejects Request to Open Gambling Center in Lyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The French government rejected
Friday a request by the gambling business group Partouche to open
a gambling center in the central city of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said that it rejected the request because
there would be too many slot machines as compared with the
traditional gambling tables in the envisaged center.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Partouche failed to present a detailed plan
to financially aid the cultural programs of the city, which was
obligatory for a gambling business.
</P>
<P>
France had banned gambling business until 1988, when the
parliament adopted a law allowing big tourist cities with more
than 100,000 inhabitants and big cities with 500,000 inhabitants
to open gambling centers.
</P>
<P>
If the request is approved, Lyon will become the first big
French city to have a gambling center.
</P>
<P>
Lyon's mayor, former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, supports the
project, which envisages to open the gambling center in an
underground part of a Hilton hotel by the side of the Rhone River,
amid a highly prosperous international business district.
</P>
<P>
Another French big city, Bordeaux, also plans to open a
gambling center with the Accor group.

<HEADLINE> Cuba's New World Record Holders Sets Sight on Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's Hidalberto
Quintero Aranda, who set a new weightlifting world record Thursday
at the Pan American Games, has set his sight firmly on the Sydney
2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to Sydney," Aranda said here Friday. "The
Pan Am gold is only a step towards the 2000 Games."
</P>
<P>
The Winnipeg Concert erupted into cheers yesterday as the
packed crowd witnessed the first world record broken in the 13th
Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
The standing ovation broke out when Aranda lifted 205.5kgs in
the clean and jerk, improving the world standard, set by the
international weightlifting federation on January 1,1998, by 0.5kg.
</P>
<P>
The judges unanimously declared Aranda's 205.5kgs clean-and-
jerk attempt good, making the Cuban athlete the world record
holder in the men's 77kgs class.
</P>
<P>
The world record came during the two-stage clean and jerk phase
of the contest for 24-year-old Aranda, who weighed in at 76.55kgs.
It came during the final minutes of the competition, when the
Cuban had run out of challengers other than himself and the
previous best mark.
</P>
<P>
He did it by upping his first clean-and-jerk attempt to 190kgs
from 185kgs, then moving up to 200kgs and finally to 205.5kgs in
the final attempt.
</P>
<P>
Aranda's combined total for the clean and jerk and snatch came
to 355kgs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter, the new champion told
reporters that he first tried to beat the world record at 1998
weightlifting meet in Mexico but couldn't do it.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Tax Cut Not To Become Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
declared Friday that the Republican bill of 792 billion dollars
will not become law.
</P>
<P>
"This tax cut will not become law," he said, repeating his
determination to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he is willing to consider limited tax cuts using
projected budget surpluses, but only after Social Security and
Medicare are safeguarded for the future, public debt is paid
down and sufficient levels of spending are ensured for education,
defense, enrironment protection and other programs.
</P>
<P>
"That is how we ought to determine the size of the tax cut," he
said. "The amount should not be decided by politics, but by
arithmetic."
</P>
<P>
Defying Clinton's repeated vow to veto it, Republican lawmakers
Thursday pushed through the bill, which would be the largest tax
cut since President Reagan's in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the bill 50-49 after it cleared the House
221-206. Both the House and Senate adjourned until September 8.
</P>
<P>
Republican lawmakers decided to take their case for the tax cut
to their constituencies during the August congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
With little chance of becoming law, the bill will serve mainly
as a defining issue between Republicans and Democrats in the 2000
struggle for control of Congress and the race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
"There is a dramatic difference between Democrats and
Republicans in this capital city, and this is the dividing line,"
said Republican Representative Bill Archer, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders will not send the bill to Clinton to avoid
immediate veto while they are away for the August recess.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Thursday night that no matter when the bill arrives
at the White House, "I will have no choice but to veto it
immediately."
</P>
<P>
The bill would trim the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14
percent in 2003 and reduce the other rates by 1 percentage point in
2005.
</P>
<P>
Relief from the "marriage penalty" that affects millions of
two-income couples would begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The estate tax would be repealed gradually starting in 2003, and
capital gains taxes would be cut from 20 percent to 18 percent for
most investors retroactive to Jan. 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Urges to Revoke Rebel Leader's Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Namibia's Foreign Affairs department said Muyongo's interviews
with the international media had left no doubt that he was behind
this week's rebel attack on Katima Mulilo, Caprivi's main town in
northern Namibia.
</P>
<P>
He was granted as refugee in Denmark earlier this year after he
led hundreds of Caprivians into neighboring Botswana as part of
the secessionist bid.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 people were killed in clashes between rebels and
security forces at Katima Mulilo Monday. A state of emergency was
imposed in the area following the clashes. The situation there was
reported to become normal again.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the Caprivi were exerting pressure on the
Namibian government to have the Ngoma border post with Botswana
reopened, the SABC report said.
</P>
<P>
They urgently needed goods imported from South Africa which had
been held back at the border post for the past few days, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Okays U.N. Presence in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday unanimously decided to authorize the deployment of up to 90
military liaison personnel to help bring an end to the 11-month
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council authorizes the deployment of up to 90
military liaison personnel, together with the necessary civilian,
political, humanitarian and administrative staff, to the capitals
of the States signatories" of a peace agreement, the resolution
said.
</P>
<P>
These military personnel will have a three-month mandate to
establish contacts and maintain liaison with the Joint Military
Commission (JMC) and all signatories to the July 10 cease-fire
agreement, to assist all parties concerned in developing
modalities for the implementation of the agreement, signed in
Lusaka, capital of Zambia, said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The military observers are also to provide technical assistance
as required to the JMC, said the resolution, adding that they are
asked to provided information to the U.N. Secretary-General
regarding the situation on the ground, and "to assist in refining
a concept of operations for a possible further role of the United
Nations" in the implementation of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said these military liaison officers are
required to secure from the parties guarantees of cooperation and
assurances of security for the possible deployment in-country of
military observers.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called upon all States and parties concerned to
ensure the freedom of movement, security and safety of United
Nations personnel in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirms the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of Congo (K), the former
Zaire, and all States in the region, said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said the Security Council "welcomes the signing
of the Cease-fire Agreement on the conflict" in Congo (K) on July
10 in Zambia, which "represents a viable basis for a resolution of
the conflict" in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council "also welcomes the signing of
the Cease-fire Agreement on August 1, 1999 by the Movement for
Liberation of the Congo," and "expresses deep concern that the
Congolese Rally for Democracy has not signed the Agreement and
calls upon the latter to sign the Agreement without delay in order
to bring about national reconciliation and lasting peace" in the
country, said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "calls upon all parties to the conflict,
in particular the rebel movements, to cease hostilities, to
implement fully with the OAU (Organization of African Unity) and
the United Nations in the implementation of the Agreement to
desist from any act that may further exacerbate the situation,"
the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted after the Security Council met
Friday morning to consider a July 16 report from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who raised the recommendations on
the deployment of these military liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations hopes for thousands of international
peacekeepers and 500 military observers to help maintain a
cease-fire in the vast African nation once all the warring
parties agree to lay down their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries involved in the conflict, which broke out
in August last year in eastern Congo (K), signed the agreement in
Lusaka with the peace efforts from some African countries, the OAU
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The signatories included the rebels' backers Rwanda and Uganda
as well as President Laurent Kabila of Congo (K), who was
supported by troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
But internal disagreements prevented some rebel leaders from
signing the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Opposition Proposes Tax Reduction for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South African New National
Party Friday urged the government to consider tax reductions for
South Africans incurring high expenses to protect themselves from
criminals.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that inadequate security measures were
one of the reasons for an increase in farm attacks reported by the
police Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Security measures can only be improved at high cost to the
individual," NNP safety and security spokesman Boy Geldenhuys
said.
</P>
<P>
"Tax reductions should therefore be granted to individuals when
certain functions of the state become their responsibility."
</P>
<P>
The police's anti-crime operation aimed at increasing
visibility in specific crime-ridden areas has resulted in the
arrest of nearly 34,000 criminals in one month.
</P>
<P>
But despite a nationwide campaign against crimes, South Africa
still reports a rising crime rate, said to be one of the highest
in the world.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Deplores Secessionist Attacks in Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim Friday
deplored secessionist attempts in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Namibian ambassador to Ethiopia Eddie Amkongo,
Salim pointed out that many African countries face genuine
economic and social problems. "These, however, cannot be resolved
by armed and violent means."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that secessionis attempts in Namibia are both
unfortunate and totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general conveyed, through the ambassador, his
condolences and those of the OAU to the government and people of
Namibia and especially to the families of all those who lost their
lives in rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his sincere hope for the speedy return of
normalcy in Namibia and affirmed the OAU's full support for the
Namibian government's efforts in promoting the welfare and
progress of all Namibians and the development of the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people were reportedly killed and wounded following a
rebel attack on August 2 on a military garrison and a radio
station in the Caprivi region of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma declared a state of emergency
soon after the attacks. After days of fierce of fighting, the
Namibian government troops have recaptured all the key points
seized by the secessionists.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation in the Caprivi region is returning to
normal, the latest sources reaching here said.

NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The UN Tribunal General
Prosecutor, Justice Louise Arbour, is currently on a six-day visit
to Rwanda, official sources from Supreme Court told Rwanda News
Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
During her visit in Rwanda, Arbour will hold talks with senior
Rwandan government officials, notably Chief Justice, Simon
Rwagasore, with whom she discussed issues relating to the trials
of suspects of the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
"It would be better if some trial sessions based in Arusha be
brought in Rwanda so that Rwandan audience witness the trials,
because genocide was committed in Rwanda and against Rwandans,"
Justice Arbour was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
"I will take an upper hand in proposing that policy to the ICTR
-- International Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda -- based in Arusha,"
she indicated.
</P>
<P>
Justice Rwagasore reiterated the government's initiative to
speed up the trials and explained how genocide cases are handled
by Rwandan courts.
</P>
<P>
Louise Arbour has also met Rwandan Foreign Minister Augustine
Iyamuremye , with whom she exchanged views relating to justice in
Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> IRA Denies Smuggling Plans, Murder Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
denied Friday its leadership sanctioned plans to smuggle guns into
Ireland from the U.S., following the indictment of four members of
an alleged smuggling ring by a Florida court.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by Irish national broadcaster RTE, the
guerrilla group said no breach of the IRA ceasefire was involved
in last week's killing of Charles Bennet in Belfast and that the
ceasefire remains intact.
</P>
<P>
The killing cast fresh doubt over IRA claims over the
ceasefire. Bennett was shot in the head on 30 July.
</P>
<P>
The IRA statement, which said Bennett's killing "was not a
breach of the cessation," fell short of an outright denial that it
shot him.
</P>
<P>
"I believe to some extent that they are accepting that there
was some responsibility there, that there was some involvement,"
said RTE correspondent Charlie Bird, who was given the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement came a day after two men from Northern Ireland
appeared in court in the U.S. and pleaded not guilty to illegally
posting guns and bullets from Florida to the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed here any ruling by the British and
Irish governments that the IRA had broken its ceasefire could lead
to the expulsion of its political ally Sinn Fein from Northern
Ireland's peace process and power-sharing institutions set up
under an agreement singed in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Enact Law to Regulate Oil Sector: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister of
Energy and Minerals Abdallah Kigoda announced Friday that the
government plans to enact a law and establish an authority to
regulate petroleum business before June next year.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said this in a motion tabled to the National Assembly
(parliament) in the central city of Dodoma following complaints
made by members of parliament over the increase of petroleum
prices, which would trigger hiking of commodity prices
countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the proposed legislation and authority, the
government is preparing temporary regulations to control the
liberalized sector, reports reaching here quoted Kigoda as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said there are fears that big operators of petroleum
products in the world are colluding to fix prices of essential
goods, frustrating fair trade practices.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Tanzanian government is unable to control
prices of petroleum because it does not produce crude oil while
prices of the refined oil is being fixed by importers, the energy
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said the increase of petrol in the world market by
around 50 percent and depreciation of the Tanzanian shilling
against the dollar has further complicated the situation.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government will continue to review its
petrol price structure in a bid to ensure effective competition in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
But he noted fixing of petrol prices is a complex exercise that
needs enough time before the government could make major
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an MP criticized the government for failing to
control prices of petroleum thus making the public shoulder extra
burdens.
</P>
<P>
MP Anthony Diallo of the ruling Tanzanian Revolutionary Party
told a press conference in Dodoma that the rise of petroleum
prices was in fact caused by the increase of many taxes and poor
irrational price structures.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is making excuses that the increase of
petroleum prices was simply caused by world prices and the
government actually has the capacity to control petroleum prices.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Nominate Ferguson as Fed Vice Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday he will nominate Roger Ferguson to be vice chairman
of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, 47, is currently serving as a member of the Fed
board. If confirmed by the Senate, he would replace Alice Rivlin,
who stepped down last month, and become the first black to serve
as vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
"He is superbly qualified. he has served well and I am very
excited about the prospect of his service," Clinton said of
Ferguson, a banking expert who holds a law degree and a doctorate
in economics from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
The Fed board is composed of seven members who form the nucleus
of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that sets
U.S. monetary policy. The FOMC comprises the seven board members,
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four
presidents of the other 11 Fed regional banks who serve on a
rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
Fed members have a key say in the direction of U.S. interest
rates, a particularly sensitive question at the moment as the
financial markets weigh whether the FOMC will raise rates to slow
the economy at its next meeting on August 24.
</P>
<P>
The board currently has two vacancies: the vice chairman's job
as well as an ordinary board member slot. On Thursday, Clinton
said he planned to nominate former New York banker Carol Parry to
fill the board member vacancy.
</P>
<P>
After finishing his studies, Ferguson worked at the prominent
New York law firm of Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell from 1981 to 1984 and
then moved to McKinsey &AMP; Co. where he became a partner and
specialized in banking as well as payments systems.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was confirmed as a Fed board member in October 1997,
becoming the third black to serve on the panel.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Swung By US Jobs Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- London and Frankfurt markets
closed narrowly ahead Friday after a volatile session in which
most early gains were wiped out by buoyant US jobs data.
</P>
<P>
London took its lead from Wall Street's sanguine reaction to
the increased likelihood of a U.S. interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
Shares finished firmer, with session at 6121, up 19.4 points on
the day but well off the 6179.3 high reached in early afternoon
dealing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. payrolls data was the day's dominant factor, and
stronger than expected figures are making most analysts think that
an interest rate rise will happen later this month.
</P>
<P>
German shares closed slightly higher after a nervous day when
attention was focused on the important U.S. payrolls data.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax closed up 32 points at 5010.47 after spending
much of the day below 5000, reaching a low of 4974. The 0.64
percent advance on the day left the index down 1.8 percent on the
week.
</P>
<P>
French stocks closed lower after shedding early gains in the
wake of that U.S. payrolls data. The Cac-40 index finished down
17.37 points at 4223.64, having reached an intra-day high of
4276.45.

<HEADLINE>   Feature: Hebron Under Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEBRON, WEST BANK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- On a main road leading
to Hebron, a dozen of cars and trucks were lining up in front of
roadblocks, with their drivers being questioned by Israeli
soldiers armed with automatic rifles. Almost all of the cars were
seen making U-turns to go back.
</P>
<P>
"The city is closed," the soldiers told the drivers, including
foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
The drivers were also informed that if they really wanted to go
into the city, they had to take a big detour.
</P>
<P>
Military siege of Hebron entered the third day in the wake of
a shooting incident Tuesday night, in which two Jewish settlers
were lightly wounded in an ambush by unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers sealed off the city, barring Palestinians
except Hebron residents from entering and preventing all
Palestinians from leaving.
</P>
<P>
One of the most ancient cities in the region, Hebron got
her name from a Hebrew word meaning "friendly." In Arabic, the
city is called Halilee, which means "the beloved." But the city
has turned out to be a flashpoint of conflicts since it was
divided into two parts controlled by Israel and the Palestinians
respectively, under an interim accord signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 450 Jewish settlers live among more than 150,000
Palestinians in the city, with tensions and conflicts constantly
flaring between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Whenever there is any conflict, Israeli soldiers seal off the
city and impose a curfew on the Israeli-controlled part, barring
the 30,000 Palestinian residents in this part from leaving their
houses.
</P>
<P>
Three days after the latest curfew was imposed, life remained
stagnate in the Israeli-controlled part, with all shops closed,
not a single pedestrian seen on the streets, except patrolling
soldiers and military jeeps. The only sign of Arab existence was
the children peeking from behind windows and Arabic music coming
from inside buildings.
</P>
<P>
In the Palestinian-controlled area, however, residents said
they have got used to this kind of situation and have found ways
to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
Abu Faris, a 33-year-old English teacher, said the siege is not
a problem at all. In the last three days, he managed to travel
freely between his home in Hebron and the village of Halhoul just
outside the city, where he keeps an art-craft shop.
</P>
<P>
"Every morning I parked my car near the checkpoint, then
I bypassed the roadblock on foot, and then I took a taxi
to my shop," he smiled.
</P>
<P>
In face of the bitter reality, he kept a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
"Life is really nice here. We will not be bored," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked what was the meaning of the closure if people
could still enter and leave the city by taking detours, Abu
Faris said: "they just want to make trouble for us."
</P>
<P>
For Abu Faris and other Palestinians in Hebron, the closure
of the city is a reminder that peace between Israel and the
Palestinians is still far away.
</P>
<P>
Hopes for a quick revival of the stalled peace process raised
by the election of Ehud Barak as Israeli prime minister in May
have faded since Barak ran into dispute with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat on the implementation of
the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Though he pledged to carry out the Wye accord signed and then
frozen by his hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu last year,
Barak has been seeking to make some changes to its
implementation by blending parts of it with the final-status talks
aimed at a permanent settlement, but he has been turned down by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident Tuesday night is the first of its
kind since Barak took office early last month.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, which condemned the attack, said that Barak could
prevent such terror attacks by implementing the Wye agreement,
which calls on Israel to cede lands, release Palestinian
prisoners and build safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Barak Promises to Start Implementation of Wye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak promised on Friday that Israel would start further
implementation of the Wye agreement within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Television Channel One, Barak said
the timetable has been worked out with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat last month.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the timetable was first set by him and Mubarak and then
Arafat concured with it.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA signed the Wye accord in the United States
last October. The interim pact requires Israel to hand over to the
Palestinians another 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu, hard-line predecessor of Barak, carried out
the first phase of the three-stage withdrawal, but then suspended
the accord, accusing the Palestinians of failing to fulfill their
security commitments.
</P>
<P>
After assuming office last month, Barak pledged to implement
the second stage of withdrawal, but proposed to combine the third
withdrawal with the final status talks, an idea flatly rejected by
the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Barak has also said that if the Palestinians did not want the
proposal, he would fulfill his peace commitment.

ANKARA -- Ignoring pressures from several European countries
and human rights groups, Vural Savas, the chief prosecutor of
Turkey's High Court of Appeals, asked the court to uphold the
death penalty for PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
was sentenced to death on June 29 on charges of treason and
separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been waging a separatist campaign in
southeastern Turkey since 1984. Conflicts between the Turkish

Yasser Arafat in an effort to establish a private channel of
contact between the two leaders, local daily Haaretz reported on

NICOSIA -- Cyprus is to receive six TOR-M1 short-range missile
systems from Greece as part of the exchange for the long-range
Russian S-300 missiles now deployed in Greece's Crete island,
local media reported on Friday.

<P>
Cyprus' National Guard will receive the first batch of the 21
missile systems once Greece gets them from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, Cypriot army's top officials are reportedly concerned
about the island's air defense because the short-range missiles
cannot reach Turkish airspace for preemptive strikes.

Several contacts were made with U.S. Special Envoy to the
Middle East Denis Ross and other officials and "we asked their

<HEADLINE> Zambia Tries to Resolve Wrangle in Congolese Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) --Zambian Minister of State House
Eric Silwamba had separate meetings Thursday with rival rebel
leaders of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) to resolve the
wrangle in the major rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba's meetings with the CRD political and military leaders
took place separately in Goma and Kisangani of the the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I have been in Goma, and Kisangani where I met political
leaders. The message is the same everywhere: Congolese people want
peace," Silwamba was quoted as saying in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
"I will report to President (Frederic) Chiluba what I have seen
during this trip," he said.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the Congolese Rally for Democracy split into
two factions. Emile Ilunga ousted Wamba and became the new
leader of CRD. After the wrangle broke out Wamba moved from
eastern Goma to northern Kisangani and has been insisting that he
is still the leader of the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba noted that Wamba was no where to be seen. "I will
also submit all the RCD texts relating to Wamba's removal, then my
president will draw due conclusions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Because the power struggle within CRD, the CRD and the Movement
for the Liberation for Congo (MLC) did not sign the cease-fire
agreement signed in Lusaka on July 10 by all the six warring
countries involved in the 11-month war in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
However, MLC leader Jean-Pierre Bemba signed the ceasefire
agreement here last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wamba and MLC are allegedly backed by Uganda while Rwanda backs
the one led by Illunga.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Requires Release of Hostages in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of the Economic
 Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) Lansana Kouyate Friday
called for the "unconditional release" of over 30 hostages still
being held by former putschists in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The hostages "should be released unconditionally," the ECOWAS
chief said in Nigerian capital Abuja, reminding the putschists of
the need to respect the July 7 agreement.
</P>
<P>
The hostage takers claimed that their leader is being held by
the Foday Sankoh-led Revolutionary United Front (RUF) which signed
a peace agreement with the government in Togolese capital Lome on
July 7.
</P>
<P>
Through two of the released hostages, the putschists in
Freetown demanded the release of Johnny Koromah, leader of the
military junta that ruled the country for nine months before they
were flushed out by the ECOWAS-sponsored west Africa peace-keeping
force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The rebels Thursday had released several hostages including two
U.N. officials, one Reuters reporter and one clergy man.
</P>
<P>
The development is believed to be related to the intensive
negotiations underway between the rebels and Sankoh's group and
the Sierra Leonean government.
</P>
<P>
Christo Johnson who was among the freed reportedly said in
Freetown Friday that all the hostages were well and that their
captors wanted food and medicine among other demands.
</P>
<P>
Johnson together with other hostages was seized Wednesday in
the Okra Hills region, about 65 km east of the country's capital
Freetown by soldiers loyal to a military junta that supplanted
elected President Tejan Kabbah in 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people including U.N. observers, ECOMOG officials,
 journalists, and other personnels were believed to be taken
hostages by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers said through the released hostages that they
would release the hostages if the Lome peace agreement was revised
to give them and their leader Koromah more say in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they were not satisfied with the peace deal
because the RUF, a dominant part of the rebels, seems to gain more
than their ally, the former military junta combatants, in the
peace process.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday urged Afghan parties to the fighting to end
hostilities, stressing that the conflict would end only through
peaceful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The conflict can never be resolved through force, Annan said in
a statement issued by his spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful dialogue would lead to national reconciliation and
the formation of a genuinely representative government acceptable
to all Afghans, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Afghan parties including neutral groups and
individuals as well as countries with influence to work together
and with the U.N. to put an end to the present fighting and to
resume serious negotiations to establish peace in the country and
security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Annan's appeal came one day after the Security Council made a
similar call on warring factions in the central-west Asian country
to stop their senseless self-destruction and resume serious
negotiations under U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), the Taliban's recent offensive against the Northern
Alliance has displaced between 100,000 and 140,000 over a six-day
period.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests against UNMIK Customs Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has lodged
strong protest against customs control in boder crossings by the
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),
according to a U.N. Security Council document distributed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Instructed by his government, Yugoslav envoy Vladislav
Jovanovic lodged the protest in a letter to the president of the
U.N. Security Council on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, Charge d'affaires of the Permanent Mission of
Yugoslavia to the U.N., said UNMIK has established customs control
over four border crossings on Yugoslavia's border with Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
He listed the border crossings as those at Djieneral Jankovic,
Globocica, Cafa Prusit and Vrbnica.
</P>
<P>
"The customs proceedings in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
are regulated by federal laws for the entire territory of the
country," said the letter, adding that "taking any of its parts
out of the unified jurisdiction constitutes a flagrant violation
of the provisions of Security Council resolution 1244(1999)".
</P>
<P>
UNMIK set up such customs control "without any agreement with
or the participation of competent Yugoslav authorities", the
letter said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Friday announced the formation
of a global post-harvest forum in a response to growing needs for
information in post-harvest research and development, U.N.
officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the expansion of international food trade, and increased
importing and exporting of food products, a new dimension has
been added to the need for improving efficiency and minimizing
losses as food goes from the farmers' field to the consumers'
tables.
</P>
<P>
"Post-harvest activities used to focus on individual small
farmers who needed to preserve their harvested crops for
themselves and their families," said Francois Mazaud, senior
officer of FAO's post-harvest management group.
</P>
<P>
"Now innovative post-harvest systems allow farmers to add value
to their harvests while increasing income and generating off-farm
employment for people involved in the processing, transportation
and marketing of food products," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 10 founding institutes of the forum, known as PhAction,
will share information and work together to develop and deliver
innovative post-harvest systems, in collaboration with a range of
public and private sector partners in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In the future, membership will be expanded to major regional
research bodies, key non-governmental organizations, agricultural
business centers and entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Move Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved lower
Friday as investors got much more worried about higher interest
rates after a strong report on U.S. employment.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 79.79 at
10,714.03, erasing more than half its 119-point gain Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged after the Labor Department reported that
employers added a stronger-than-expected 310,000 jobs to their
payrolls in July and average hourly earnings, a key gauge of
inflation pressures, increased by 3.8 percent in the same month
from a year ago. The report made investors believe that the
Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to preempt inflation
from the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said two weeks
ago that the Federal Reserve must be especially alert to
inflation risks. If new data suggest that the pace of labor cost
and price increases will be picking up, the Federal Reserve will
act "promptly and forcefully" to fight against inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
 Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 13.42 at 1,300.29 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 17.87 at 2,547.96.
</P>

<HEADLINE> King Kong Finds Solace in Men's Doubles Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese world No. 3
Kong Linghui, who fell a victim to defending champion Jan-Ove Waldner
of Sweden in the men's singles quarter-finals, found some solace as he
combined with Liu Guoliang to win the men's world doubles title here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kong, 1995 world champion and Olympic doubles gold medalist with
Liu, played extremely well in their 19-21, 21-16, 18-21, 21-10,
21-18 victory over fellow Chinese Wang Liqin and Yan Sen.
</P>
<P>
"I felt so disappointed after I lost to Waldner," Kong said. "I
told Liu that we must make it this time."
</P>
<P>
After splitting the first four sets, the deciding set went
virtually point by point until Liu and Kong attacked mercilessly to
clinch the match point.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic gold medalist Liu Guoliang reached the singles
semifinals with an expected victory over 1991 world champion Jorgen
Persson of Sweden on Friday. He will take on giant-killer Austrian
Werner Schlager, who upset Croatia's two-time World Cup champion Zoran
Primorac in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liqin and Yan Sen, doubles champions in the ITTF Pro-Tour
Finals early this year, will return home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Wang suffered an early exit in the men's singles as he went down
to Frenchman Damien Eloi in straight sets. Yan Sen lost to Persson
in five sets on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Loss doesn't mean the end of the world," Wang said. "I will start
all over again."
</P>
<P>
"Wang's weakness is mentality, not skill," said Chinese head coach
Cai Zhenhua. "Technically, he is the best in the Chinese team but he
has to toughen his mind."
</P>
<P>
In the doubles semifinals, Liu and Kong downed Primorac and
Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus in four sets while Wang and Yan thrashed
South Korean duo Kim Taek Soo and Park Sang Joon easily.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wang Nan beat 17-year-old Zhang Yining in an all Chinese
women's singles final.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lin paired up with Zhang Yingying to snatch the mixed doubles
title on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Network Built to Monitor Haihe River Water Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China's environmental
protection authority has set up a surveillance network to monitor
the water conditions in the Haihe River basin, where important
cities such as Beijing and Tianjin are located.
</P>
<P>
The network, headquartered in this capital of Hebei Province,
is composed of six provincial-level environmental surveillance
centers and 59 county-level monitoring stations.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) took
the action in a bid to obtain prompter information for the battle
against water pollution in the Haihe River basin, which has been
worsening along with rapid industrial and social development in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Haihe River, meandering through Tianjin City, gathers
tributaries from north China's Hebei, Henan, Shandong and Shanxi
provinces, and the country's capital, Beijing. After this populous
area's chronic flooding problem was brought under control through
massive water conservancy projects, water pollution has emerged as
a new environmental burden.
</P>
<P>
SEPA has organized four similar surveillance networks in the
water systems of the Yangtze and Huaihe River basins, and Taihu
Lake.

<HEADLINE> Wang Nan Lifts World Singles Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Little failure in form
and momentary slip in precision nearly threw off Wang Nan as she came
from the verge of defeat to beat fellow Chinese Zhang Yining in the
women's singles final of the world table tennis championships here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World Cup winner Wang Nan, 20, finally triumphed over the
17-year-old teammate 15-21, 14-21, 21-5, 21-12, 21-11.
</P>
<P>
Wang looked lackluster from the very beginning and should could
hardly concentrate on the game, losing first two sets without a
chance.
</P>
<P>
Wang unleashed strong forehand attacks from both wings, pressuring
her rival from the third set on.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a good start," said Wang. "But I came into game
gradually, and with a little luck, I won my first world singles
championship."
</P>
<P>
Wang Nan reached the final with a five-set win over South Korean
Ryu Ji Hye, while Zhang edged out fellow Chinese Li Nan, also in
five sets.
</P>
<P>
Wang finished runner-up to all-mighty Deng Yaping in last world
championships. Multi-world champion Deng opted out of the
championships to focus on her English language studies in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Zhang surprised many when her name was seen on the Chinese team
roster for this world championships in March. Geng Lijuan of Canada
and Ni Xia Lian of Luxembourg, former world champions for China, and
China's world No. 3 Li Ju and giant-killing Li Nan all fell victims to
Zhang.

NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Congress President Sonia
Gandhi Saturday launched her party's election campaign in
Jharsuguda, Orissa, promising to provide a stable government for
the full five-year term, Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
She said the BJP government had "compromised" India's security
and the nation's image had "plummeted" in the world.
</P>
<P>
She urged the people to bring to an end the series of weak
governments at the center.
</P>
<P>
She said she had entered politics not because of lust for power
but because of her concern for the poor, down-trodden and backward
people and the country's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
She said the performance of the BJP-led government during the
last 16 months showed that such parties grabbed power just to
"satiate" their own self interest.
</P>
<P>
Prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is scheduled to launch the
BJP's election campaign Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Ceasefire Threatened: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge said Saturday that the delays in the signing of the
ceasefire document by the Congolese Rally for Democracy and lack
of monitoring of the agreement was endangering the ceasefire in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a graduation ceremony at Morgenster Teachers
College in Masvingo of south Zimbabwe, Mudenge said the delays in
signing and lack of monitoring provided an opportunity to the
enemies of peace to restart the war, with all the terrible
consequences that would entail in the region, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The war in the DRC had reached a dangerous phase when we
achieved the peace agreement. It is still poised at that point,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are literally face to face with a potentially explosive
escalation in the war," he noted, adding he hoped that "everyone
will act responsibly and Africa and the world will assume their
full responsibility to ensure that the peace process continues to
hold."
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, the most immediate obstacle
to overcome in restoring peace in the Congo was to resolve the
leadership rivalry within the Congolese Rally for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The two factions which are led by Emile Ilunga and Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba had not agreed on who was entitled to sign on behalf of
the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
"The result of this development is that the ceasefire is
incomplete and has not been monitored since July 10, 1999," said
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
On July 10 of this year, leaders of the allied forces in the
Congo, Congolese President Laurent Kabila, the rebel groups and
leaders of Uganda and Rwanda met in Zambia to sign a ceasefire
document that would bring to an end of the one-year war in the
third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state signed the agreement without the rebels, who
cannot decide which person would endorse the deal on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
However, Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the Liberation of Congo,
another rebel group, recently signed the ceasefire document,
bringing closer the prospects of peace.

<HEADLINE> France Opposes U.S. TMD Plan in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- France has expressed its opposition
to the U.S.-sponsored Theater Missile Defense (TMD) plan in East
Asia, saying it will trigger a new round of strategic nuclear arms
race, reported a French newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac is opposed to the U.S. plan and
holds "a full convergence" of views with China, the daily Le
Figaro quoted French presidential officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Over this issue, we stand by the side of the Chinese. The
American anti-missile missiles will reduce to nil the Chinese
defense and will launch a permanent race between sword and shield,
" said a presidential advisor at the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine has written a letter to
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to explain the position
of France over what he called "a new specter of Cold War,"
according to Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that the U.S. TMD plan, which includes deployment
of anti-missile missiles in Taiwan and Japan, will have
destabilizing effect in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
France suspects that the U.S. Defense Ministry, tacitly
supported by the U.S. Congress, is trying to justify the
development of anti-missile systems for Taiwan and Japan, as well
as for the United States itself.
</P>
<P>
"The United States Defense Ministry can no longer find the
pretexts in the Third World countries or in Russia. China is
therefore presented as a threat," the report quoted an
unidentified French official as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the real motive for relaunching a strategic nuclear arms
race in East Asia is the interests of U.S. military industrial
complex, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Taliban Involvement in Kashmir Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for Kashmir
Affairs Majid Malik said Saturday that the Taliban are not
involved in the freedom struggle in the India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of visiting Arab journalists, he said there
is an indigenous uprising going on in Kashmir, and allegations of
foreign interference are "totally baseless."
</P>
<P>
Rejecting allegations of Pakistan's military support to the
Mujahideen (holy fighters), Malik said they are fighting for their
right of self-determination for the last many years, and the
history is a witness to it.
</P>
<P>
Peace in the region is impossible without resolving the Kashmir
issue, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions, Malik said that Pakistan has neither
provided arms and fighting material nor financial support to the
Mujahideen.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Pakistan will continue to fulfill its
responsibility to extend moral, political and diplomatic support.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is not in favor of war and wishes to resolve
the issue through dialogue. The Kashmir issue is a nuclear flash
point, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Success Makes up for Malar's Olympic Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Joanne Malar wears a
gold ring on the second toe of her left foot to remind her how far
she has come since the depressing days after the 1996 Olympics
when she failed to get to the medal podium.
</P>
<P>
The gold ring was there as the 23-year-old Canadian swimmer
bent to get her third gold medal of the 13th Pan American Games
draped around her neck last night.
</P>
<P>
Malar broke the Pan Am and Canadian records in winning the 200m
individual medley. Her time was two minutes 14.18 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"The ring represents a healing time for me, " Malar said. "I
was down after the 1996 Olympics and went to Mexico with my sister
and my sister's friend. It was two weeks where I could just be
Joanne and not to be overwhelmed by pressures and expectations.
</P>
<P>
"I look at it, and it reminds me of the things I went through."
she said.
</P>
<P>
Those things included failing to make the final in her
specialty race, the 400m individual medley. It set a tone that
later saw Malar drop off a relay squad and finish fourth in the
200m.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Games can never be retrieved, but Malar looks ahead.
She has changed her coach and club and altered her training. At
the national training center in Calgary, in the company of Olympic
medalists such as Curtis Myden, Shamek Pietucha, Morgan Knabe and
Penny Heyns of South Africa, she has trained with weights and
improved her balance and strength by working out standing on a
ball.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I should be in the circus, " Malar said.
</P>
<P>
"It's good to know I'm not doing it alone, " she said of the
training group. "There's times when one of us is hurting and
someone can pull you aside and help you through it."
</P>
<P>
Canada now has 25 medals in 26 races at Winnipeg, including 11
gold, four silver and 10 bronze. Canada's record haul from the Pan
Am pool is 28, achieved in 1967 in Winnipeg and matched in 1979 in
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
Malar had only four swims at the Pan Am Games, netting her
other golds in the 400 individual medley and 4X200m relay and
getting a bronze in the 400m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Her stunning collection of Pan Am hardware, dating back to 1991
in Havana, also includes seven silver and three bronze medals.

<HEADLINE> Trademark to Protect Scenic Cave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The company that manages
Huanglong Cave at the Zhangjiajie Scenic Spot in central China's
Hunan Province has decided to use its trademark to protect the
cave.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye Wenzhi, general manager of the Zhangjiajie
Huanglong Cavern Investment Co. Ltd., the company has applied to
the Trademark Bureau of the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce for registration of 37 literary items and 40 different
designs related to the cave.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese characters "Huanglong" or Yellow Dragon, bear the
connotations of "authority" and "luck" in Chinese culture, so they
might easily be used in names at other scenic areas, sites,
enterprises or buildings, the general manager explained.
</P>
<P>
"If the registration is approved by the bureau, it will be
illegal for operators of other scenic sites or enterprises to use
the words "Huanglong Cave" in either writing or graphic patterns
without permission," he went on.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his company would redouble its efforts to
protect this intangible asset after the designation Huanglong Cave
is accepted as a trademark.
</P>
<P>
Huanglong Cave boasts more than 3,000 stalagmites and
stalactites, of which a stalagmite, which has growing for 200,000
years, were insured for 100 million yuan (about 12 million US
dollars) in April last year.
</P>
<P>
The company raked in well over 20 million yuan from sales of
tickets to tour the cave last year, according to the general
manager.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South African Sports
Minister Ngconde Balfour gave the South African 2006 World Cup Bid
Document the thumbs up in Johannesburg on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa are in the race with four other countries --
Germany, Morocco, England and Brazil -- to host the 2006 World Cup
and will hand over the Bid Document to world governing body, FIFA,
in Zurich on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with the document. I am proud of our sportsmen.
They did a marvelous job putting together this document," Balfour
said, quoted by South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"We also drew up a document for the Cape Town Bid to stage the
Olympics, but the World Cup Bid Committee did very well."
</P>
<P>
He said there was nothing negative in the document and, in its
positively, reflected South Africa's readiness to host the world
event.
</P>
<P>
"I have still to take it to President Mbeki, but I have no
doubt in my mind it shows we have the capability to host such an
event and are prepared for the World Cup," Balfour said.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned a lot from hosting the Rugby World Cup in 1995,
the IAAF World Cup of Athletics last year and we also have the
upcoming All-Africa Games in September to learn more.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind it is Africa's call to stage the
World Cup."
</P>
<P>
The document chronicles the infrastructure of the country's
stadiums, telecommunication, accommodations and transport
capabilities, which show that South Africa will be able to stage
the event.
</P>
<P>
After the handing over of the Bid Document the next step in the
process is that FIFA will send inspectors to South Africa to check
the local infrastructure before the final decision is made in July
2000.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Sector Tianjin's Driving Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production has become
the leading driving force in the economy of north China's Tianjin
municipality, contributing seven percent to its economic growth
during the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin 's industrial output reached 30.2 billion yuan-worth
during the first half of the year, a rise of 13 percent over the
same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
The sector also reported an improvement in efficiency during
the period, with industrial profits rising year-on-year by 18
percent, to eight billion yuan, and losses incurred by deficit-
ridden enterprises declining by eight percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
This promising situation can be mainly attributed to the State'
s stimulatory policies aimed at increasing domestic demand.
Enterprises manufacturing products such as electric wire, metal
items, tires, steel, concrete and hydro-power generators have at
least doubled their output during the period.
</P>
<P>
The production of high-tech products also received a great
boost, with the output of integrated circuits, switchboards,
mobile phones and personal computers registering year-on-year
increases ranging from six to 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the emergence of some new projects has served as a
new growth point for local industrial production. Statistics show
that 12 such projects brought in about 3.3 billion yuan in output
value during the first six months.
</P>
<P>
The ten major enterprise groups in Tianjin have also become a
major underpinning for the rapid industrial growth, with
successful technological renovations and deepened reform. The
average output growth for these ten enterprises stood at 13
percent during the January-June period.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Says not to Be Mediator in India-Pakistan Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh would like to play
pro-active diplomacy with the firm belief that the irritants of
the region could be solved peacefully, State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's role would not be as a mediator or to solve
problems trilaterally but to bring India and Pakistan together for
removing their disputes, Chowdhury told a roundtable on "Security
Perception in South Asian Region and Beyond," organized by the
Bangladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Fisheries and Livestock Minister
A.S.M. Abdur Rob stressed the need for forging consensus on the
issue of security in South Asia and urged all countries concerned
to shun arms races in the region.
</P>
<P>
He suggested formation of a joint arms monitoring team to keep
the weaponry within limit, resolve quickly bilateral problems,
face the challenges of poverty through SAARC (the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) and use the water resources,
human resources and natural resources under joint management for
the benefits of the people of the region.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarian Dr. Moyeen Khan suggested that Bangladesh
should not get involved in the conflicts between India and
Pakistan, describing such a move as "dangerous." The existing
conflicts between these two countries including the Kashmir issue
should be resolved bilaterally, he said.
</P>
<P>
Advocating making South Asia a nuclear-weapon-free zone,
speakers at the roundtable discussion said the region was now
sitting on two dangerous bombs -- atomic bomb and "poverty bomb"
and suggested the replacement of these two enemies of human
civilization with "peace bombs of development and progress" to
make the region nuclear-free.
</P>
<P>
It would be unrealistic to think about the security perception
of South Asia by ignoring the strong "poverty bomb" and the
destructive nuclear bomb, they said.
</P>
<P>
The recent events in Kargil between Pakistan and India
dominated the roundtable discussion, with most of the speakers
advocating a peaceful settlement of the issue through dialogue
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable discussion was attended by government ministers,
members of parliament, academics, diplomats and others.

<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientists of the
Chinese Arctic Expedition have completed their first observation
of the atmosphere at the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
They measured the changes in air pressure, humidity, wind speed
and wind direction in the atmospheric boundary layer, convection
layer and stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
According to expedition member Qu Shaohou, last Thursday the
expedition set up a 12 sq-m tent to carry out the observations at
73.25 degrees north latitude and 164.59 degrees west longitude.
</P>
<P>
The height of the atmospheric observation reached 600 m, and
the scientists observed a process of strong temperature inversion,
with changes of temperature of one degree centigrade every ten
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also collected data on solar radiation,
effective radiation on ice and reflective radiation.
</P>
<P>
Qu said the data obtained is important for research into the
interaction among the sea, ice and atmosphere at the edge of the
Arctic Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Troop Movements, Weapon Supplies to Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The peace efforts by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Arab league seem to be
making some progress in the Ethiopia-Eritrea war which has spilled
over to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign troop movements and the infusion of mass weapon
supplies into Somalia are being minimized, if not stopped totally.
</P>
<P>
One concrete example is the failure of warlord Muse Sudi
Yalahow to smuggle weapons and ammunition into Somalia from
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Yalahow went to Hiran region for a
possible reception of weapons and ammunition from Ethiopia. Muse
Sudi's convoy together with other battle wagons from the Hawadleh
clan have gone all the way to Fer-fer village on the
Somali-Ethiopian border to meet Ethiopian military officers for
the hand-over of the weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
After undisclosed two-day discussions between representatives
of Yalahow, Hawadleh clan military officers and Ethiopian
officials, the convoy returned to Mogadishu Friday empty handed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Yalahow has denied the arrival of any weapons
or ammunition as reported by a local daily newspaper. The
spokesman said the convoy did not come from Ethiopia in the first
place, but that his battle wagons had merely escorted commercial
lorries to the central regions and escorted others back to
Mogadishu and therefore had nothing to do with weapon reception
from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
On the other front, despite the presence of Ethiopian troops in
Bay and Bakol regions, their movements seem to have stopped at
least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports, the Ethiopians have stopped
supplying weapons and ammunition to the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) and their affiliated new group of Digil Salvation Army
fighting against faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid in Lower
Shabelle region, southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the Ethiopians are probably honoring
the peace tentative of the OAU and that if fails they will
continue their operations inside Somalia and even more seriously.
</P>
<P>
Aidid has told his supporters that mediation efforts between
his faction and Ethiopia are underway. He said he is going to lead
a delegation to Tripoli of Libya for the mediation efforts.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Pollution Control Efforts Paying Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Intensified pollution control
efforts on the Yangtze River, China's longest, have started to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Gezhouba Hydropower Plant, located on the
middle reaches of the river, shows that the trash which piled up
before pollution controls were instituted has been decreasing by
one third since the flood season began this summer, falling by two
m.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower plant serves as a benchmark for trash pollution
on the Yangtze. Previously, whenever the summer flood season began
the large amount of flotage from the upper reaches of the river
collected at the infall of the power plant or got stuck against
the pollution fencing of the power plant. The height of the trash
heap amounted to four m on the most serious occasions.
</P>
<P>
The large trash heap affected the power generation of the plant,
which had to stop production 18 times in 1998 in order to clear
the trash.
</P>
<P>
Cities along the Yangtze have stepped up the management of
trash from human activities and banned random dumping on both
banks of the river since last year's record floods.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Municipality, for instance, has cleared away its
riverside trash heap which had piled up over many years. In the
meantime, the navigation and port supervision authorities have
intensified the management and disposal of garbage created by
river vessels.
</P>
<P>
Now, all in-bound vessels must obtain trash disposal
certificates issued by professional trash collection organizations,
otherwise they will not be allowed to leave the river ports.
</P>
<P>
Riverside cities like Yichang, where the Gezhouba hydropower
plant is located, have increased the number of boats allocated to
rubbish collection, and activities under such slogans as "Purify
the water of the Yangtze and protect the mother river" are being
held to improve people's awareness of environmental protection.

HANOI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's fisheries sector has been
enhancing the export of aquatic produce, Vietnam News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has earned export revenues of more than 502 million
U.S. dollars in the first seven months of this year, a 10 percent
increase over the same period last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's cultivation and breeding of aquatic produce has
developed steadily throughout the country and the sector produced
329,000 tons of seafood from aquaculture alone.
</P>
<P>
It has brought the country's total output so far this year to
more than 1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
And more seafood processing enterprises nationwide have
invested in shrimp farming projects.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam hopes to increase its shrimp exports to Japan this year
thanks to the reduction in Japanese levies.

ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A Kashmiri militant group
Saturday warned the United States against launching attacks on
alleged Saudi "terrorist" Osama bin Laden who is now reportedly
hiding in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should know that attack on Afghanistan will
prove (to be) very expensive for it," Naseer Ahmed, commander in
chief of Al-Bedr organization, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are not scared of Americans and we cannot be intimidated by
threats," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said all efforts would be made to stop U.S. commandos
which he claimed had arrived in Pakistan to mount attacks on
neighboring Afghanistan to hunt down the prime suspect in last
year's devastating bomb blasts in the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"These commandos will be buried in (Pakistan's) tribal areas,
which border with Afghanistan," said Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed also said that he had met the Saudi dissident in the
eastern Afghanistan's town of Jalalabad Friday amidst heightened
security.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Mujahideen (holy fighters) of Osama were ready for any
possible strike by the United States and had deployed
anti-aircraft guns and missiles to face any eventuality, according
to Ahmed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Forces in Congo Not Likely to Return by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean forces based in the
 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are not likely to return
home before the end of the year as expected, commander of the
Allied Forces Major general Anthony Chingombe has said.
</P>
<P>
The commander told the Zimbabwe News Agency in Kinshasa Friday
that this was mainly because of the continued violation of the
July 10 Lusaka ceasefire agreement by rebels and their backers.
</P>
<P>
"Although the ceasefire is in effect in some parts of the
country, some rebels and their allies are violating it," the
Zimbabwe News Agency Saturday quoted Chingombe as saying.
</P>
<P>
"With such a situation continuing the Zimbabwean troops as well
as those of Namibia and Angola cannot simply leave the situation
like that," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, said the commander, the situation was at a standstill
in the eastern front of the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
He said recent violations were carried out at Makanza and
Bangadeya more than 1,000 km from Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"Even if Jean-Perre Bemba of the Movement of the Liberation of
Congo signed the agreement on Monday, we cannot take him seriously
because it is his troops that are continuing with violations in
the northern front," he said.
</P>
<P>
The other rebel group, the Congolese Restoration of Democracy
(RCD), did not sign because of the leadership wrangle between
Emile Ilunga and Ernest Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
On the rebels who were surrendering, Chingombe said Congolese
President Laurent Kabila was prepared to approach non-governmental
organizations to help with their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
So far 900 rebels had surrendered and there were indications
that more would follow suit, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the joint military commission whose task would be to monitor
the ceasefire agreement, he said, it was still to be commissioned
by ministers of defense who had forces in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"The ceasefire is going to hold if the masters of the rebels,
Rwanda and Uganda, respect it," Chingombe said, adding that Rwanda
had three brigades involved in the Congolese war while Uganda had
two brigades.

LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea chairman Ken Bates has

in protest at plans to start the world soccer gala earlier, the
chief of the English premier league club told the Sun newspaper on
Saturday.

<P>
A FIFA proposal to start the finals on May 23 instead of late
June to avoid the June-July rainy season in the co-hosting

"What a shambles. Didn't FIFA know four years ago when they
made their choice that it rains like hell there at that time of
year?

<P>
"And what a good idea to start the World Cup earlier in May
just when we are still playing. What idiot thought of that?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
"What England and European countries should do now is withdraw
and see how FIFA like it. There would not be a World Cup without

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Lagos State's new Police
Commissioner Mike Okiro who assumed duty Friday in Nigeria's
economic hub has pledged to use " orthodox or unorthodox" ways to
beat the surging crimes in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Okiro, who was deployed from Benue State to take over from
former Commissioner of Police Sunday Agbedo, said: "Lagos is not
new to me, it is only the command that is new. I have only been
away from Lagos for about four or five years," the Guardian
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While calling for the cooperation of the people for the success
of his assignment, he said he would run an open door policy.

Superintendent of Police (ASP) on August 1, 1977, promised to turn
things around in the combat against crime in the state."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Quicken Steps of Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
committed to prompt completion of the on-going privatization so as
to enable it to concentrate efforts on other aspects of
governance, Vice-President Atiku Abubakar has said in capital
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The activities of government were usually slowed down when
distracted by issues meant for the private sector, Atiku said
Friday when addressing the House of Representative's Committee on
Privatization, The Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Once privatization was concluded, he said, the government would
devote its attention to governance, maintenance of law and order,
ensuring social equity and fairness in order to foster sense of
belonging among citizens.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president explained that privatization involved
fundamental changes in the roles of the state and the private
sector. While the private sector acts as the fulcrum for economic
growth, the government plays the role of a catalyst by providing
the enabling environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also informed the legislators that many of the government
agencies earmarked for privatization have suffered from misuse of
their monopoly powers, defective capital base, undue bureaucracy
and colossal mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The government would be the ultimate umpire in the
privatization effort, said Atiku, but he assured that the hallmark
of the exercise would be openness, transparency and
accountability.
</P>
<P>
A.E. Amadi, chairman of the committee, pledged that members of
the body would properly assess and evaluate public enterprises to
be privatized and commercialized and ensure that shares were not
sold to a few private hands to avoid monopoly.
</P>
<P>
He said the 30-man committee would make decisions on all
matters relating to privatization and commercialization of
government agencies, monitor the functions and operations of such
agencies as well as consider their yearly budgets.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the efficient handling of the responsibility, Amadi
said that sub-committees on petroleum, industry, transport,
communication, finance, insurance and banking, as well as power,
steel and mining, had been established by the House of
Representatives.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Passes Legislation on Free Legal Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Legal workers in the south
China province of Guangdong will have their work permits revoked
for periods ranging from three months to one year if they fail to
perform their duty of offering free legal aid as requested.
</P>
<P>
This is laid down in the document "Legal Aid Regulations of
Guangdong Province", which was adopted by the Standing Committee
of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress early this month.
The regulation, the first of its kind in China, will be effective
as of September 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, lawyers, notaries and grass-roots
legal workers are required to offer free legal aid as requested by
courts or other relevant organizations to destitute or handicapped
people, juveniles, defendants facing the death penalty and who are
not represented by lawyers, and social welfare organizations in
need of legal help.
</P>
<P>
Foreign suspects, stateless persons, and unrepresented
defendants may apply for free legal aid from the concerned courts
or other relevant organizations during the process of litigation
and investigation.
</P>
<P>
Persons who obtain free legal aid by unlawful means will be
deprived of such aid, and will be forced to pay legal service
charges, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, which is in the forefront of China's reform and
opening-up drive, led the nation by setting up the first legal aid
center in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since then, some 30 branches of the center have been
established across the province. In 1997 alone, these
organizations handled 24,000 cases involving free legal aid. In
the same period, the local legal organizations have received 4,300
letters and personal requests for legal aid from 20,000 people.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebel Leader Intervenes to Free Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August (Xinhua) -- S. Leone's former rebel leader Foday
Sankoh has said in Togo's capital Lome that he had ordered a group
of former junta soldiers to free the hostages held by rebel
faction loyal to Johnny Koromah.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried," he said. "The position of the high command
is that this has no effect on the peace accord," said the leader
of the Revolutionary United Front(RUF) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 U.N. employees, aid workers, west African intervention
force soldiers and journalists are currently held in the Okra
Hills, some 65 km outside Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The RUF leader said the kidnapping was an "isolated" incident
that did not signal a broader split in the rebels' alliance with
Sierra Leone's former military junta and noted that he had ordered
the soldiers to release their captives.
</P>
<P>
He also accused officials of United Nations and West African
Peacekeeping Force, ECOMOG, of carelessly provoking the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said they had failed to contact senior rebel officials
before sending the delegation into rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
The kidnap took place when an international delegation met with
junta soldiers, who had said they would free about 150 women and
children captured during the war.
</P>
<P>
The junta soldiers freed several captives Thursday, which
included two U. N. officials, a Reuters reporter and a clergy man,
requiring them to convey their demand for food, medicine among
others.
</P>
<P>
The hostages freed Thursday night said they had been held in
the village of Magbini, about 55 miles east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
They also demand the freedom for their leader Koroma believed
to be detained by the RUF. Koroma and his men fought the
country's head of state and allied itself with the RUF rebels in
1997, but was 10 months latter flushed out by the Nigeria-led
ECOMOG force backing the unseated President Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
However Sankoh denied Koroma was detained, insisting he was the
"number two man" in the rebel alliance.
</P>
<P>
Relations between rebel commanders and former junta soldiers
remain murky. The groups theoretically are allied. But many former
junta soldiers felt excluded when the rebels signed the peace
accord on July 7 in Lome.
</P>
<P>
Koroma led a May 1997 coup that ousted the government of
President Kabbah and then Koroma's junta.

<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The appeal made from his prison by the leader of Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, to his followers to stop "
military operations," which was relayed later by the leadership of
PKK and by its military branch, sounds like a real farewell to
arms. Condemned to death on June 29 for trying to "divide the
Turkish territory," the chief of the Kurdish rebellion had tried
to save his head by launching an appeal for reconciliation to put
an end to a war which has killed 30,000 in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
-- An investigation team of the International Monetary Fund has
confirmed that the Russian Central Bank has over the past few
years secretly transferred part of its aid fund to an obscure
offshore company in the British island of Jersey in the English
Channel, which was described as a "fiscal paradise." The leaders
of the Russian Central Bank realized tremendous personal benefits
through the embezzlement, in which the Russian government was kept
in total darkness.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The actions of merging and take-over by the world's big
companies are increasing, as three gigantic transactions were made
on Friday alone, with 24.7 billion U.S. dollars changing hand in
one single day. The German telecoms company, Deutsche Telekom
bought 100 percent of the capital of One-2-One, Britain's fourth
largest telephone operator with 13.4 billion U.S. dollars. The
two Swedish automakers, Volvo and Scania, merged with each, while
the U.S. General Motors set up a "strategic alliance" with South
Korea's Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
-- France has warned the United States against a possible
destabilization in the East Asia region with the envisaged U.S.-
sponsored DMT system in the region. French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine has written to his U.S. counterpart Madeleine
Albright, expressing France's concern over a possible
deterioration of the situation in East Asia.

tough training have helped to create countless sports stars and a
lot of them are set to shine at the Military World Games to open

<P>
The sports they are competing range from swimming, judo to less
known lifesaving but nonetheless these stars had triumphed in
events like world championships, world cup or Olympic Games.

When the accuracy of aiming is no longer the matter of life and
death, elite shooters from around the globe will vie for medals
here.
</P>
<P>
They include China's Atlanta Olympics women's sports pistol
champion Li Duihong, Slovenian rifle expert Rajmond Debevec,
Poland's Olympic titlist Renata Mauer and Russia's Marina
Logvinenko, who won the gold in air pistol at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
World powerhouse Russia will make a big splash in the pools as
it sends the country's top diving aces Dmitry Sautin and Irina
Lashko plus Olympic swimming champion Denis Pankratov.
</P>
<P>
The Russians also have great strength in their fencing team,
which is spearheaded by Pavel Kolobkov, Stanislav Pozdnyakov and
Dmitri Shevchenko, each of them winning world championship for
several times.
</P>
<P>
China will field its mighty military pentathlon squad, which
has won both the men's and the women's team titles at the 1998
world championships.

<HEADLINE> ORBIS Flying Eye Hospital Holds Public Relations in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The ORBIS aircraft, the world's
only flying eye hospital, arrived in Macao on Friday for public
relations following sight-saving programs in China's Urumqi and
Lanzhou cities.
</P>
<P>
ORBIS is a non-profit, humanitarian organization dedicated to
fighting avoidable blindness worldwide. In the mid-1970s, Dr.
David Paton, an ophthalmologist from Texas of the United States,
conceived the idea of an airborne ophthalmologic treating and
teaching hospital.
</P>
<P>
With a Douglas DC-8 plane presented by the United Airlines and
other donations from enthusiastic people, the ORBIS aircraft took
flight in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Expenses of ORBIS operations come from donations from
individuals, companies and organizations, and ophthalmologic
specialists and other medical persons work voluntarily to large
extent.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the ORBIS hospital has visited 79 countries and
conducted 393 medical programs, training more than 46,000 doctors
and nurses in sight-saving skills. It is estimated that millions
of people suffering from eye diseases have benefited directly or
indirectly from ORBIS.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, ORBIS has conducted 67 medical programs in
China's 21 provincial areas and trained 12,700 doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
The ORBIS aircraft will leave for Taiwan on Monday for similar
public relations and then head for the Philippines, Myanmar and
Bangladesh for medical programs.

<HEADLINE> Poll: BJP to Emerge as Single Largest Party in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The BJP could emerge as the
single largest party in the next Lok Sabha with more than 200
seats, says an opinion poll conducted by Outlook weekly and the
Center for Media Studies.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll, which will be released on Sunday, covered
10,650 voters between July 25 and 30 in 71 constituencies in 16
states. It predicts 279 to 289 seats for the Bharatiya Janata
Party and its allies.
</P>
<P>
The Congress and its allies come a distant second with 152 to
162 seats.
</P>
<P>
A loose "Third Front" comprising the four left parties, the
Samajwadi Party, the TMC, the BSP and the AGP is projected to bag
between 63 and 68 seats. Others, including the TDP, the
Nationalist Congress Party and four small parties, could win
between 34 and 39 seats.
</P>
<P>
If the survey's projections turn out right, for the first time
in India, the BJP could overtake the Congress as the single
largest party in terms of votes polled at 27.5 percent (up 2
percent from last time) compared to the Congress, which dropped to
23.85 percent (down 2 percent).
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll suggests that had Sharad Pawar remained in the
Congress, a hung Lok Sabha again could have been expected.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one percent of those polled felt that Prime minister
Vajpayee is the best bet to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
The BJP and allies are set to poll 39.15 percent of the votes
compared to 37.2 percent in 1998, a swing of 1.95 percent in their
favor.
</P>
<P>
The Congress and allies are projected by the opinion poll to
get 31.15 percent of the votes share, a rise of 1.49 percent since
1998 when the party polled 29.66 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The biggest blow in terms of votes share will be the Third
Front: 17.53 percent in 1999 compared to 21.93 percent in 1998,
showing a negative 4.4 swing against it.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks today
signed free agent forward John Wallace, a first-round pick of the
team in 1996 with their $2 million salary cap exception option.
</P>
<P>
The team considered offering its salary exception to Charles
Oakley, but instead decided to bring back Wallace from the Toronto
Raptors. Wallace, 25, is 10 years younger than Oakley.
</P>
<P>
Despite being traded by the Knicks to Toronto as part of a
three-team deal in October 1997, Wallace desperately wanted to
return to New York.
</P>
<P>
"Coming back to New York, there's no better place to play
basketball in the whole NBA," Wallace said. "I wanted to be in a
position to win. I wanted to be back involved with a first class
team."
</P>
<P>
Wallace averaged career highs of 14.0 points and 4.6 rebounds
in 1997-98 for the Raptors. But he regressed in last year's
lockout-shortened season, averaging 8.6 points, 3.6 rebounds and
43 percent shooting in 48 games.
</P>
<P>
In three NBA seasons, Wallace has averaged 9.5 points and 3.5
rebounds while shooting 47 percent in 198 career games.

ABU DHABI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of government
schools in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has risen to 687 this
year from just 39 in 1966, indicating that the Gulf country has
made great progress in education.
</P>
<P>
The schools are now offering a high standard of education to
some 400,000 students, the Khaleej Times daily Saturday quoted a
report from the Ministry of Education as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the education process of the country had
witnessed significant developments since 1966, when President
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nayhan, became ruler of Abu Dhabi, the
largest of the seven emirates which formed the federation in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Today, in the seven emirates comprising Abu Dhabi, Dubai,
Sharjah, Ajman, Fujairah, Umm Al Quwain and Ras Al Khaimah, there
is a teacher for every 18 students in kindergartens, one for
every 16 students at the primary level and one teacher for every
11 students at preparatory and secondary levels, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"This teacher-student ratio is very high, even when compared
to developed countries," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, plans are afoot now to introduce
fundamental changes in the education process to keep pace with
the development requirements of the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy will be based on a positive participation of all
sections of the community in creating a developed education
system and implementing education programs, because continuous
training programs are the main tool in promoting skills of the
manpower in today's world," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Loses Grip on Food Security as Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, as the bread basket of
southern Africa, is gradually losing its top spot of food
self-sufficiency with food imports almost doubling from 2.3
percent in 1990 to 4.5 percent of its total consumption last year.
</P>
<P>
The Herald daily Saturday quoted economic highlights of the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe as saying that accelerated implementation
of drought mitigation measures and the maintenance of viable
agricultural policies would go a long way in containing the food
imports, saving on the limited foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"If the economy does not generate sufficient foreign currency
to meet import requirements, there will be pressure on the
exchange rate," said the bank.
</P>
<P>
It said the trade liberation program introduced in 1991 had
contributed to a significant increase in imports.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Re-Sign Free Agent Guard Jaren Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- One day after adding some
guard help off the bench, the San Antonio Spurs re-signed shooting
guard Jaren Jackson to an undisclosed contract.
</P>
<P>
The move comes 24 hours after the Spurs signed free agent Terry
Porter to a reported three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
Known as a journeyman through his first seven years in the NBA,
Jackson flourished in San Antonio. With the Spurs' Twin Towers --
Tim Duncan and David Robinson -- drawing double teams inside,
Jackson was the beneficiary of numerous open shots from the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
Jackson excelled in Game One of the NBA Finals against the New
York Knicks. With Duncan being constantly double-teamed by the
Knicks, Jackson made four of his five 3-point tries and scored 14
of his 17 points over the final 24 minutes as San Antonio posted
an 89-77 victory.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Jackson led the team in 3-pointers made and
attempted during the regular season. During the regular season,
Jackson averaged 6.4 points and 2.1 rebounds in 47 games, shooting
38 percent from the field and 82 percent from the foul line. His
average rose to 8.2 points and 2.4 rebounds in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
He averaged 5.5 points and 1.8 rebounds in 325 regular season
games with New Jersey, Golden State, the Los Angeles Clippers,
Portland, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington and San Antonio.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Banks Make Brisk Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A surge in the total profits of
the half-time score of Singapore's four major banks has proved
that the country's banks have made a brisk recovery from the worst
downturn the city state has ever had.
</P>
<P>
With four of the five banking groups having reported their
interim 1999 results, their total profits of 1.36 billion
Singapore dollars (about 810 million U.S. dollars) have already
well exceeded the 1.2 billion Singapore dollars (about 714 million
U.S. dollars) the five largest banks made last year.
</P>
<P>
The Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), the largest in the
country and the first to report interim earnings among the five,
reaped 655 million Singapore dollars (about 390 million U.S.
dollars) in interim net profit, a 301-percent leap compared to
the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Keppel TatLee Bank (KTL) posted a 293-percent jump in net
interim profit to 113.8 million Singapore dollars (about 68
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The United Overseas Bank (UOB) registered a 24.5-percent hike
in net profit to 320 million Singapore dollars (about 190 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Bank of the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC)
recorded a 21.8-percent rise in net interim profit to 269.2
million Singapore dollars (about 160 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed their better-than expected performance to
their well-capitalized strength and their way in which they manage
business.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that local bankers pursued their earnings by
pulling back loans fiercely, making adequate provisions, squeezing
depositors and borrowers and cutting staff salaries and these
measures have paid off.
</P>
<P>
Provisions have sharply fell compared to 1998 when the banks
piled on aggressive provisioning to position themselves for
recovery.
</P>
<P>
In the half-year results of this year, the half-year provisions
made by the DBS actually fell 70 percent and the provisions by the
UOB and OCBC contracted by 32.4 and 35 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> 600 Somali Refugees to Be Relocated in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 600 Somali refugees who have
been living at St. Annes Camp with the Mombasa Central Business
District in Kenya's southeastern Coast Province have been
registered for relocation in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the
refugees started registering Friday after the Kenyan government
announced it would close down the camp by the weekend, the East
African Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the fate of some 1,800 refugees remains unknown. They
had refused to register with the UNHCR as directed by Mombasa
District Commissioner Wilfred Legei.
</P>
<P>
It is said the 600 registered refugees are scheduled to be
relocated to the Kakuma camp in Rift Valley Province and the
Dadaab camp in North Eastern Province this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Legei ordered the closure of the camp and
directed all refugees be relocated to North Eastern Province, and
also took the issue with a local businessman who has issued the
refugees with national identification cards illegally.
</P>
<P>
Legei said the government was investigating the matter and
will take action against the businessman who has housed the
refugees since they arrived in Kenya over eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers: Bottled Water May Contaminate Contact Lenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Rinsing contact lenses with
bottled water may contaminate them and put contact lens wearers at
risk for eye infections, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (
AAO) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A study appearing in the August issue of Ophthalmology, AAO's
clinical journal, showed that some brands of bottled water contain
considerable amounts of bacteria and other microorganism,
including an organism normally found in the human urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, the
United States, analyzed 23 different brands of locally available,
non-carbonated bottled water. Nearly half of them contained living
microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast, mold and algae.
</P>
<P>
AAO said that microorganisms known to cause contact lens-
related bacterial keratitis were found in some of the bottled
water samples tested in the Baylor study. Sterile contact lenses
became contaminated in as little as one minute after being exposed
to the water samples.
</P>
<P>
While microorganisms can come from natural sources, AAO said
that much of the contamination occurs during the manufacturing
process.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the risk of infection, AAO recommends that only
sterile solutions be used for rinsing contact lenses.

<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Flood waters continued rising as
of late Saturday morning in many towns in Central Luzon, the
Northern Philippines, despite improved weather condition in the
region since Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Disaster Coordinating Council (RDCC) in Central

<P>
The council said that flood waters also started rising since

release of excess rain water from the Binga Dam in Benguet
Province.

Floods in San Luis rose to an average of five to six feet
Friday night from three to four feet deep Friday morning due to
the overflowing of the Arnedo dike, it said.

private security firms in the country to join hands and work hard
in the fight against crime.

The police realized the vital role played by other private
security companies in combating crime, he said.

"Zambia police is creating a layer zone department for all
security firms. We want to work with all concerned parties in
combating this problem, " Mayonda was quoted by Saturday's Times

<P>
Mayonda said this at a pass-out parade of 24 dog handlers and
13 security officers from Coin Security International, Zambia in
Lusaka on Friday.

He assured the Coin Security management that officers from
private security firms would no longer be subjected to harassment
from the regular police officers.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that private security officers were harassed
by police officers when they apprehended suspects.
</P>
<P>
"I have sent a circular to all police posts in Lusaka to work

<HEADLINE> Philippines Allows Small Savers to Invest in T-Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it has raised more than 50 million pesos (1.3
million U.S. dollars) in Treasury bills sold to small investors to
generate funds for its pro-poor development programs.
</P>
<P>
These investments in risk-free government securities came in
the form of T-Bill placements in denominations of 5,000 pesos (130
dollars) to 25,000 pesos (650 dollars), said the presidential
office in a report issued here.
</P>
<P>
As of May 31, it said, the Bureau of Treasury has sold 50
million pesos (1.3 million dollars) worth of T-Bills to small
savers like teachers, ordinary office workers, housewives and
retirees.
</P>
<P>
T-Bills used to be available only in large denominations
ranging from 100,000 pesos (2,590 dollars) and 10 million pesos
(259,000 dollars), and therefore, accessible only to banks,
pension funds and other big investors.
</P>
<P>
The small denomination T-Bills under the Small Investors'
Program (SIP) are available through the state-owned Land Bank and
Development Bank of the Philippines, the office said.
</P>
<P>
First launched in Manila in January, the SIP started with a
minimum denomination of 25,000 pesos (650 dollars). This was
further reduced to 5,000 pesos (130 dollars) to allow more small
investors to participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
The program was gradually expanded to major cities, including
Cebu, Iloilo and Davao.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Intensifies Efforts on Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is intensifying its efforts
on hunger alleviation and poverty reduction by striving to help
some 300,000 poor households escape hunger this year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has planned to reduce the rate of poverty-stricken
households nationwide to 13.7 percent this year, Vietnam News
Agency Saturday quoted Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids
and Social Affairs as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 2.4 million households classified as poor,
accounting for 15.7 percent of the total population. There are
almost 1,500 poor communes nationwide each with more than 40
percent of their households classified as in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Hunger and poverty eradication has been set as a major policy
and an important undertaking by the Vietnamese government. The
hunger alleviation and poverty reduction program started in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government planned to allocate 900 billion
Vietnamese dong (VND) (64.3 million U.S. dollars) to the national
program on hunger elimination and poverty reduction this year with
70 percent being channeled to the 1,000 poorest communes
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The government also planned to invest most of the more than
4,000 billion VND (290 million U.S. dollars) raised from the
recent State bond sales in poverty eradication activities.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam's national program on hunger alleviation and
poverty reduction aims to bring down the rate of poor households
to below 10 percent next year.

<HEADLINE> Dead Sea Shrinking At Alarming Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Dead Sea, the saltiest body of
water on earth and world-renowned tourist resort, is shrinking at
an alarming rate and might disappear in 20-25 years, Jordan
Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Landlocked in the Jordan Valley between Israel and Jordan, the
Dead Sea has shrunk to around 50 kilometers in length from 80
kilometers three decades ago due to drought, pollution and over
exploitation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the Jordan river water, is now being
diverted into Jordan and Israel after the two countries signed a
peace treaty in 1994, and the river water's quality has
deteriorated due to agricultural run-offs and increased salinity.
</P>
<P>
Water fountains around the sea are also dammed to gather water
for agricultural purposes, while other fountains were polluted,
Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial activities around the Dead Sea's banks also
contributed to the problems, massive evaporation pools vaporize
the sea's water to extract minerals and for manufacturing beauty
products.
</P>
<P>
Environmental impacts on the Dead Sea also include air
pollution caused by dust and fuel burning, and disposal of
hazardous materials, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Due to these factors, the Dead Sea might disappear in 20-25
years, warned Dureid Mahasneh, former general secretary of the
Jordan Valley Authority of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He said the Dead Sea's water level drops by 10 to 15
centimeters every year in modern history.
</P>
<P>
Each year, millions of tourists from all over the world are
flocking to its shores to float on its water, which contains high
level of sulphur.
</P>
<P>
The thick black mud around the sea's shores are also found to
have healing effects believed to treat various skin diseases.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Press Cautioned Against Exposure of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The (Olusegun) Obasanjo Leadership
Forum, a none governmental organization in Nigeria, has urged the
media to exercise caution in the performance of its duties as it
relates to the exposure of corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
The forum noted in a statement the embarrassing revelations and
 allegations bordering on the integrity of public office holders
and pleaded that "the media should not send out wrong signals to
other forces contending for political power through means other
than the ballot box," the Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement acknowledged that "the media owes it a
duty to hold public office holders accountable, but the
dissipation of energy on allegations of misconduct against
members of the legislature has become costly distraction which the
nation can ill-afford."
</P>
<P>
The forum also called on "public officers who have skeletons in
their cupboards should follow the path of honor by resigning
their appointments or membership of any of the arms of government
instead of waiting to be disgraced publicly".
</P>
<P>
It appealed to those "who shun out these allegations to be sure
of their facts before publishing to ensure that precious time is
not wasted investigating nothing and the press and the
legislature must thread cautiously in their utterances and
statements to ensure that our fragile democracy is not
endangered."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian news media has successfully pulled down the country's
House Speaker Alhaji Buhari in a campaign spear-headed by the
Lagos- based weekly The News and is engaging a battle with the
Senator Speaker Evan Enwerem by accusing him of trying to cover
his past conviction.
</P>
<P>
While the role of the press in the anti-corruption battle is
generally praised, there are people who caution that the press
should not go to the extreme in the find-the-skeleton fever.

<HEADLINE> Masood Forces Close in on Taliban-Held Districts: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance forces are closing in on the Taliban-held districts of
Tagab and Nejrab, northeast of capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kabul quoted an opposition spokesman as saying
Saturday that the forces loyal to former defense minister Ahmad
Shah Masood were confident to reoccupy the two districts.
</P>
<P>
There was sporadic fighting in the area overnight, said the
report. The Taliban fighter jets had carried out four sorties on
Panjsher Valley, the opposition's last stronghold, it added.
</P>
<P>
"There were civilians killed in the bombing raids but we're
still assessing the damage," the spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched their long-awaited summer offensive on
July 28 on Tagab and took the nearby city of Nejrab quickly. Over
the next week the Taliban forces scored major victories and forced
the opposition forces to retreat.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition led by Masood launched a counter attack on
Thursday and pushed the front line back to within 30 kilometers
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that between 800 and 1,000 Taliban fighters
were killed in the counter offensive. However, casualty figures
from the opposition side were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Urges Normalizing Situation in Dagestan Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin on Saturday ordered the armed forces chief of staff and
the Interior Ministry forces chief to normalize the situation in
the Dagestan republic, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The order came amid reports that about 500 armed Chechen
militants infiltrated into Dagestan early Saturday and trenched
near the villages of Ansalta and Rakhata in the mountainous
Botlikhsky district.
</P>
<P>
The armed Chechen group is believed to include Arabs and
people from Central Asia, Tass quoted the Dagestani interior
ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is moving its forces to the Botlikhsky district
and ascertaining intents of the Chechen guerrillas, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Recent weeks have witnessed a number of skirmishes along the
borders between Dagestan and the neighboring republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed in shoot-outs between heavily
armed gangs and Russian security forces near the border on Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said earlier that the attackers were based
in Chechnya and get into Russia through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Since then, as many as 150 fighters have occupied a Dagestani
village near the border.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent additional troops and military equipment to the
region Wednesday, saying it wants to guard against potential
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappings and violence have plagued Chechnya and neighboring
regions in recent years. According to the Russian Interior
Ministry, 1,094 people have been abducted since January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of anarchy reigning the area, a band of
kidnappers has demanded 7 million U.S. dollars for the release of
Gennady Shpigun, the Russian Interior Ministry's envoy to Chechnya
who has been held hostage for several months.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti crown prince is
expected to pay a visit to Egypt in early September, Egypt's
Al-Akhbar daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah
will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Prime
Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri on regional issues, including the
situation in the Gulf and the Middle East peace process, the
pro-government newspaper quoted Egyptian Ambassador to Kuwait
Mahmoud Wagdy as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad, who is also the Kuwaiti prime minister, will
discuss with Egyptian leaders ways of seeking close cooperation in
economic and trade areas, Wagdy said.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes within the context of constant consultations
and coordination between the two countries, the Egyptian
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Kuwait maintain close and good relations after Cairo
sided with Kuwait in the 1990 Gulf crisis and joined the
multinational forces in the 1991 Gulf War to liberate Kuwait from
the occupation of Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have signed many agreements on cooperation in
the fields of economy, technology, tourism, science, information
and labor.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Kuwaiti trade volume stood at 118 million U.S.
dollars in 1998. Kuwait has invested in Egypt an estimated 840
million dollars by the end of 1997, making it the second largest
Arab investor in Egypt after Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwait's Arab Fund for Development provided Egypt
with loans totaling over 1 billion dollars in the past five
years.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Increase Calamity Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Social Security System (SSS)
in the Philippines announced Saturday that it will ease its
requirements for calamity loans to help members who have been
affected by the recent floods.
</P>
<P>
SSS President Carlos Arellano told reporters here that the
management has submitted a recommendation to the Social Security
Commission, the institution's policy-making body, to increase the
loan ceiling from 5,000 pesos (129 U.S. dollars) to 8,000 pesos
(207 dollars) and reduce the contribution requirement from 36 to
24 months.
</P>
<P>
"Our members, who have been affected by the floods, face an
emergency. They need all the help they can get," Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
The SSS, the country's major social security body for private
workers, opened this week its calamity loan portfolio after
floods, caused by monsoon rains, submerged large areas in Metro
Manila and the provinces of Rizal, Pampanga and Pangasinan.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 people were killed and thousands fled their homes
as flood waters surged through the low-lying areas. Millions of
pesos worth of crops and properties were destroyed in the disaster
areas.
</P>
<P>
Arellano said members who have existing calamity loans of not
more than 10,000 pesos (259 dollars) would qualify for the new
portfolio as soon as it will be approved by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, the SSS has granted 6.15 billion pesos (159 million
dollars) of calamity loans to its members.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. unemployment rate remained steady in

decade low, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>

The Department said that employers added 310,000 jobs to their
payrolls. The strength in hiring last month reflected big gains in
demand for workers at temporary help agencies, which posted their
strongest rise in 18 months. Hiring of workers also showed big
gains at restaurants, computer companies and engineering firms. (

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Shrimp Sector Fails to Reach Export Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's fledging shrimp
sector, which had kept the country's export turnover healthy over
the last couple of years, failed to attain the export target for
the last fiscal year ending on June 30, according to the latest
statistics of the Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters' Association
(BFFEA) released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned about 247.32 million U.S. dollars by
exporting some 58.33 million pounds of frozen food (mainly shrimp)
in the last fiscal year against the target of 350 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BFFEA attributed the shortfall to escalating production
costs due to up-gradation of processing plants and abrupt falls in
shrimp prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Prices of frozen food experienced a decline of about 25-40
percent in the international market in recent days as most of the
South Asian countries are dumping their products at throw-away
prices due to massive devaluation of their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi seafood is facing still competition in the
international market, especially from Latin America. The share of
Bangladesh in the international frozen food market is less than
two percent against the combined total of nearly 20 percent by
India, Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian country has the capacity to meet five percent
of the international demand if exporters are backed by proper
policy support from the government, shrimp exporters said.

<HEADLINE> Sun Protection Defenses Skin Cancer Best, Researchers Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 6 (Xinhua) -- An influential U.S. medical
association said Friday that sun protection is still the key to
skin cancer prevention, despite new research that shed light on
how the body protects itself from the disease.
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the August 6 issue of Science,
researchers at the Texas University detailed apoptosis, the body's
recently identified line of defense against skin cancer. During
apoptosis, damaging sunlight exposures may activate the body's
natural defense mechanism and act to kill the cells with the
irreparably damaged DNA that may otherwise become skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
"These are exciting developments, but it is crucial that
individuals do not rely solely on their natural defense mechanisms
to prevent skin cancer," said the American Academy of Dermatology
(AAD).
</P>
<P>
The human body's defenses have limits and cannot repair all of
the DNA damage, said AAD, arguing that otherwise no one would ever
die of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
AAD also quoted dermatologist Mark Naylor at University of
Oklahoma as saying that while some individuals have interpreted
this study to mean that a sunburn may actually stop the beginning
of skin cancer, in fact, sunburn is the primary cause of DNA
damage in the first place. "There is an overwhelming body of data
which demonstrates that a sunburn is the leading cause of melanoma,
the deadliest form of skin cancer," said the expert.
</P>
<P>
According to AAD, skin cancer is the most common form of cancer
in the United States, with about 1 million new cases diagnosed
each year. It is estimated that 44,200 will be diagnosed with
melanoma in 1999, a 6 percent increase from 1998. And
approximately 7,300 deaths will be attributed to melanoma in 1999.
</P>
<P>
To prevent skin cancer, AAD recommends that individuals adopt a
comprehensive sun protection program that includes wearing sun
protective clothing, avoiding the sun between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00
p.m., seeking shade whenever possible.

<HEADLINE> Blast Injures Dozens at U.S. Texas Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of people were injured
as a fireball exploded on Friday evening over the swimming pool of
a newly-opened hotel in Grapevine of Texas State in the United
States, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
No deaths were reported. There was no fire after the initial
blast and police said nobody had been trapped in the rubble.

equipment room of the Embassy Suites hotel, which opened Tuesday
but remained under construction.
</P>
<P>

gas line could have been responsible, but a utility spokeswoman at
the scene said she did not think gas was involved.
</P>

<P>
Grapevine is a suburban community of 38,000 people north of
Dallas, near the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor's Voter Registration Closes With Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The 22-day voter registration for
the direct ballot in most areas of East Timor closed Friday with
more violence, reports reaching here Saturday from Dili, capital
of East Timor, said.
</P>
<P>
Despite requests to extend the registration period,
registration centers closed on Friday with 439,580 people
registered, 427,190 of whom live in East Timor, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The registration period in 14 remote areas will conclude on
August 8, according to UN officials in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
However, sporadic violence colored the run-up to the ballot
planned for August 30, with the last incident revealed on Friday
by UN Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) spokesman Yasuhiro Ueki.
</P>
<P>
He said a UNAMET official was slightly wounded by a chunk of
concrete when some 20 pro-integration militias attacked a house in
Ainaro regency on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Emergency Meeting Opens in Uruguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and Economic Ministers
from the four countries of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur)
met here Friday to seek a solution to the trade disputes between
Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur Council emergency meeting, initiated by Uruguayan
President Julio Sanguinetti, is expected to arrive at some
decisions to address the intra-zone trade distortion in the bloc
comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, following the
devaluation of Brazil's currency.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has gained a price advantage in its exports since it
devalued its currency, the real, by 30 percent in January. The
Mercosur, the third largest trade bloc in the world which yearly
produces 1 trillion U.S. dollars in goods and service for 200
million consumers, is facing its worst ever impasse after Brazil
forced Argentina to scrap import quotas on textiles and shoes two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Didier Opertti stressed on
Friday before the start of the meeting the confidence over the
bloc's prospect, saying that "the moments are difficult, but not
awful, Mercosur will survive."
</P>
<P>
Technical negotiators from the four Mercosur countries met
Thursday to solve the growing internal trade dispute, but did not
reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay insisted on the creation of a
mechanism for the macroeconomics coordination and transitory and
temporary measures to change the trade imbalances in the region.
</P>
<P>
Argentina proposed that such a mechanism will permit the
countries to adopt corrective measures, such as additional tariffs
or temporary quotas among the Mercosur partners.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil opposed any kind of hindrance to the access of
its products to the markets, saying that no protectionist measures
can be applied in Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Trade within Mercosur countries reached 15 billion dollars in
1998. But Argentina's exports, almost all of which go to Brazil,
fell by 27 percent in the first five months this year.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Bolivia Urged to Attend Andean Meeting to Boost Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Andean
Nations Community (CAN) Sebastian Alegrett on Friday urged Bolivia
and Peru to attend a meeting scheduled for August 13 in Lima to
accelerate the regional integration process.
</P>
<P>
Alegrett said that it is necessary to first realize trade
integration for the adoption of a single currency between the CAN
and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, composed of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay,
and CAN agreed on April 16, 1998, to gradually eliminate tariffs
and complete the construction of the free trade zone in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Lima meeting will discuss the Common External Tariffs to
perfect the Andean Customs Union.
</P>
<P>
The tariff structures of Bolivia and Peru are different from
Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, the other members of the Andean
bloc.
</P>
<P>
The temporary suspension of Peru in the Program of Tariff
Liberation and of the Common External Tariff during 1992, and its
return later to the bloc caused the definition of a different
tariff structure.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia maintains margins of tariff preference because of its
geographical position and the economy asymmetry existing with the
rest of the CAN member countries.

<HEADLINE> Gene Discovery Promises Better Understanding of Sleep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have found a
gene that causes narcolepsy in dogs, which will help tell how and
why humans sleep, the U.S. National Sleep Foundation (NSF) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Stanford University recently identified in dogs
the gene that causes narcolepsy, a chronic, potentially disabling
neurological disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness,
involuntary "sleep attacks," and loss of muscle control for many
people, an estimated 200,000 in the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
The NSF said it is believed that narcolepsy is as prevalent in
the United States as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis,
but only one in four narcoleptics are diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
"Because this serious sleep disorder lies at the core of how
the brain signals us to sleep and to stay alert," NSF said of the
discovery, "this breakthrough will greatly advance scientists'
understanding of sleep in general, and will likely lead to
widespread applications for sleep problems other than narcolepsy."
</P>
<P>
The NSF is a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting public
understanding of sleep and sleep disorders.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts to Stress Law-enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua)-- China is to restructure its
higher people's courts, in a bid to provide people's courts with
greater law-enforcement capabilities, which have been reduced by
local protectionism.
</P>
<P>
Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court,
announced the reform plan here today at a forum attended by
presidents of the country's higher people's courts.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform plan, higher people's courts are entitled to
command law-enforcement departments, which "is a major step in the
restructuring of the people's courts," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese courts have long been plagued by law-enforcement
difficulties resulting from local and professional protectionism.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, more than 850,000 court rulings
were waiting to be executed, involving over 259 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, illegal interference and violent activities against
the enforcement of court rulings have been common phenomena across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that courts at all levels should firmly combat
local protectionism, deal with those responsible in strict
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that, while taking full advantage of the law-
enforcement powers enshrined in the law, people's courts
nationwide should attach the same importance to the protection of
national stability.
</P>
<P>
"Law-enforcement officers should never resort to
oversimplified and crude methods to enforce court rulings, but
improve their professional skills, so that the rights and interest
of the public can be better protected," he said.

he had recieved for eight times during his career.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Article Exposes Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A signed article released by
Xinhua News Agency today said Lee Teng-hui's recent "two-states"
remarks were a thorough exposure of his long-standing attempt to
undermine the integrity of China's sovereignty and territory.
</P>
<P>
The article, entitled "Crucial Point Is to Split China",
accused Lee of sticking with splittism for a long period of time,
and even publicly opposing the "one China" principle, resulting in
serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
The article cited a spate of historical documents and facts, as
well as the practice of international law, to prove that there is
only one China and that the sovereignty of China can never be
separated or shared.
</P>
<P>
According to international law, it said, a newly-founded
government following the toppling of the former government by a
revolution should inevitably exercise all the power, including the
sovereignty, of the state. "As a matter of course, the government
of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is entitled to exercise
all power and the sovereignty of the whole of China, including
Taiwan, after the Kuomintang-led regime was overthrown in 1949."
</P>
<P>
The PRC has established diplomatic relations with more than 160
countries, which all have recognized that there is only one China,
that the government of the PRC is the sole legal government
representing the whole of China, and that Taiwan is an inseparable
part of China.
</P>
<P>
By quoting international law and the widely-accepted definition
of sovereignty, the article stressed that a state can never be
separated from its sovereignty, and the state has the right to
eliminate all separatist forces in a bid to safeguard its
territorial and sovereignty integrity.
</P>
<P>
The article also denounced the "money diplomacy" which is
advocated by Lee Teng-hui, saying that the so-called "diplomatic
relationships" between Taiwan and some 20 countries are as
unstable as a house built on sand.
</P>
<P>
The PRC has greatly strengthened its comprehensive national
power in the past few decades, and has been occupying a pivotal
position internationally. No politician with strategic foresight
and a good understanding of international situations would
sacrifice normal diplomatic relations with the PRC for relations
with Taiwan for the sake of money, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Quick Return Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The hope for the immediate comeback
of Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was snapped as doctors
determined he needed more surgery on his broken leg.
</P>
<P>
The two-time world champion had wished to return to training as
soon as Saturday with an eye toward the Hungarian Grand Prix in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher received a check for hours by doctors at a Geneva
clinic and Ferrari said in a statement after the examination that
"it is too early for him to return in an F1 car racing in the
coming weeks".
</P>
<P>
Schumacher snapped his right leg in two places in a head-on
crash into a tire wall at the British Grand Prix on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons in England operated after the crash to put a steel pin
in his leg and the 30-year-old German spent nearly a week in a
clinic outside Geneva before returning home.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari said that Schumacher might make his comeback at Monza
on September 12 after he received his operation, whose date is
unspecified.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Oil Price Basket Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan crude price basket
registered a fall of 32 U.S. cents to 17.04 dollars per barrel
this week, the Ministry of Energy and Mines announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The price fall, the first of its kind in the last two months,
was due to the liquidation of the contracts in the future markets,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, oil prices have recovered 98.
5 percent. Following an output cut of 2 million barrels per day by
the oil producing countries, oil prices in the world market
started to rebound on March 12.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's average oil price in 1998 was 10.63 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
With oil as the pillar of its economy, the country is the
largest oil producer and exporter in the Western hemisphere.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blasts Oil Pipeline in Northeast Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded Friday
at a segment of Colombia's Central Oil Pipeline in Los Llanos,
northeastern Casanare department, which the authorities said was
the work of the rebel National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The blast wrecked the pipeline, paralyzed pumping and caused a
spill of some 3,000 barrels of crude, the Colombian State Oil
Company said.
</P>
<P>
The company has made a series of emergency measures to control
the serious environmental damages at the site, including rush-
repair of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The Central Pipeline carries crude from the Casanare oil fields
to refineries in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the ELN guerrillas have so far carried out
some 1,000 attacks against oil installations across the country.

<HEADLINE> Mediterranean Becomes Tropical Aquarium, Italian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The warming of the Mediterranean
Sea-partly blamed for the spread of a "killer seaweed" out from
the French coast - was confirmed in a study released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study, produced by the Italian government-sponsored
Institute for Sea Studies (ICRAM), showed that habitat changes had
helped the invasion of 55 species of fish from the Red Sea, up the
Suez Canal, since the start of century, and 60 from the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Some of the newcomers were fearsome: the barracuda, which "now
has some commercial importance", the scorpion fish with its
"dreadful" spines, and the puff fish which is poisonous if eaten
sushi-style.
</P>
<P>
"A fundamental role in the spread of these tropical fish is the
temperature of the water which has risen half a degree over the
last few decades," said Franco Andaloro of ICRAM.
</P>
<P>
While earlier observers were benevolent towards the new
arrivals, even the nasty ones, researchers are now alarmed that
the tougher new kids on the block will muscle out older and
distinguished denizens, weakened by pollution and over-fishing.
</P>
<P>
Italian Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said that "the tropical
fish could run riot in the Mediterranean and lead to the
extinction of the more vulnerable native species."

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Needs Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Games are too big,
too long and they might be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
When the athletes of the Americas meet in four years in Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic, the Pan American Games are going to
have to be shorter and require less volunteer manpower.
</P>
<P>
And that's exactly what the president of the 13th Pan Am Games
says he's going to recommend.
</P>
<P>
"When we meet in Mexico City on Sept.16 for our debriefing, I'm
going to recommend that the size of the Games be reducted from 42
sports to maybe 28 or 30," said Don MacKenzie, the man who brought
the 13th Games to Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
"There are way, way too many sports and way too many athletes.
We reduced the events from 435 in Mar del Plata to 330 here. But
the Games should still be smaller.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is look at the Olympic Program, eliminate
the sports that aren't inherent to this hemisphere and with every
one we remove, add a sport that people participate in here in the
West. That will make the Games shorter; more managable and more
affordable."
</P>
<P>
As the Winnipeg Games approach its finale this Sunday, the Pan
American Sports Organization (PASO) president Mairo Vazquez Rana
has called them "the best organized Games ever."
</P>
<P>
While wealthy nations like Canada and the United States are in
a position to use the Pan Ams for more than just a celebration of
sport, it's been painfully obvious for quite some time that
smaller nations aren't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government was reported to have pumped at least
101.5 Canadina dollars into the Games, and a total of 22,000
volunteers became the essential part for the Games' success.
</P>
<P>
If you've paid any attention to Latin American economies
recently, you know it's going to be tougher for 22,000 in Santo
Domingo to give up their lives for 16 days.
</P>
<P>
"I'll admit that a couple of days ago, I was dragging, "
MacKenzie said. "But that's my fault. Sure, these Games could have
been finished today or tomorrow, but I'm the one who wanted them
spread out over three weekends."
</P>
<P>
That's why a shorter, smaller 14th Pan Am Games is the way to
go.

<HEADLINE> Goldstein Celebrates Birthday with Pan Am Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Paul Goldstein gave
himself the perfect present for a tennis player, the Pan American
Games men's gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The day after his 23th birthday, Goldstein rolled over
tournament's top seed and his American compatriot Cecil Mamiit 6-4,
0-6, 3-6 to save the blushes for the United States who had been
predicted to sweep all four tennis titles.
</P>
<P>
But only Goldstein delivered the promise, with his teammates
suffered crushing defeats in the women's singles and two doubles
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a pretty good birthday so far," he said.
</P>
<P>
The worldly young man who grew up in the Washington D.C., is
ranked 92 in the ATP Tour. After a year on the pro circuit,
including a tough four-set loss to Pete Sampras at the U.S. Open,
he has learned to deal with life when he gets down. For instance,
the last time he was burnt out, he headed to the Holocaust Museum
in D.C.
</P>
<P>
"It's powerful," said Goldstein. "When you think your life's
going bad you look at what happened to them and it puts it in
perspective."
</P>
<P>
His thirst for exploring all cultures is unquenchable and that
makes being a tennis pro ideal.
</P>
<P>
"It's such a global sport. That's what I think is the coolest
thing about tennis."
</P>
<P>
That makes the Pan Am Games real cool. He's checked out
baseball, badminton and team handball. He's made friends from all
over the Americas.
</P>
<P>
"For my career, to me (the Games) actually does present a
practical purpose," said Goldstein." One of the things the (US
Tennis Association) has been trying to do is to promote more of a
team atmosphere among the US players.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see an experience like this translate in a similar
form onto the tour where guys are supporting each other and
working hard for each other."
